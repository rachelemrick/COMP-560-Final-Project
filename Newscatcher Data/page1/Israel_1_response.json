            "excerpt": "The strike on Iran on Friday was originally intended to be much broader in scope, but after intense pressure from allies, Israeli leaders agreed to ratchet it down.",
            "summary": "Israel abandoned plans for a much more extensive counterstrike on Iran after concerted diplomatic pressure from the United States and other foreign allies and because the brunt of an Iranian assault on Israel soil had been thwarted, according to three senior Israeli officials.\nIsraeli leaders originally discussed bombarding several military targets across Iran last week, including near Tehran, the Iranian capital, in retaliation for the Iranian strike on April 13, said the officials, who spoke on the discussion of anonymity to describe the sensitive discussions.\nSuch a broad and damaging attack would have been far harder for Iran to overlook, increasing the chances of a forceful Iranian counterattack that could have brought the Middle East to the brink of a major regional conflict.\nIn the end — after President Biden, along with the British and German foreign ministers, urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prevent a wider war — Israel opted for a more limited strike on Friday that avoided significant damage, diminishing the likelihood of an escalation, at least for now.\nStill, in the view of Israeli officials, the attack showed Iran the breadth and sophistication of Israel's military arsenal.\nInstead of sending fighter jets into Iranian airspace, Israel fired a small number of missiles from aircraft positioned several hundred miles west of it on Friday, according to the Israeli officials and two senior Western officials briefed on the attack. Israel also sent small attack drones, known as quadcopters, to confuse Iranian air defenses, according to the Israeli officials.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Israel has not provided evidence to support its allegations that many employees of the main U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees are members of terrorist organizations, according to an independent review commissioned by the United Nations that was released on Monday.\nThe review was announced in January, before Israel circulated claims that significant numbers of employees of the agency, known as UNRWA, were members of terrorist groups.\nBut by the time investigators started working on the review in early February, it had taken on additional significance: Israel had accused about a dozen employees of the agency, which employs about 13,000 Palestinians in Gaza, of involvement in the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks on Israel or their aftermath. Israel had also said that one in 10 UNRWA employees in Gaza was a member of Hamas or its ally, Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\nMore than a dozen countries, including the United States, suspended funding to UNRWA in light of the allegations. The United Nations fired 10 of the 12 employees accused in the attack while pleading with donor countries to restore funding at a time when the majority of Gazans depend on the group for food and shelter. It also announced an internal investigation along with the independent external review, which was made public on Monday.\nThe review said that UNRWA had long shared lists of its employees with Israel, but that the Israeli government had not flagged any concerns about agency employees since 2011.\n'Israel made public claims that a significant number of UNRWA employees are members of terrorist organizations,' the report said. 'However, Israel has yet to provide supporting evidence of this.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Thousands of its members have been killed, and at least one senior military leader has been eliminated.\nYet Israel has not achieved its primary goals of the war: freeing hostages and fully destroying Hamas.\nThe war and the tactics of the Israel Defense Forces have come at a great cost. Vast numbers of Palestinian civilians have been killed in the Israeli campaign; hunger is widespread in Gaza; and deaths around relief efforts have generated condemnation.\nSix months into the conflict, the question of what Israel has achieved — and when and how the fighting could come to an end — is creating ever more intense global strains around a war that has cost Israel support from even close allies.\nIsrael's own military casualties have begun to climb, with about 260 killed and more than 1,500 injured since its pulverizing ground assault began in the weeks after the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on Oct. 7.\nIsraeli officials say that about 133 of the hostages taken remain in Gaza. But talks to secure the return of at least some of them in exchange for a halt in the fighting and the release of Palestinian prisoners have hit a snag. Hamas has rebuffed the latest proposal and claims it does not have 40 hostages who meet the terms of the first part of the proposed deal, raising questions about how many are still alive and how many are held by other groups.\nhalt in the fighting and the release of Palestinian prisoners have hit a snag.

            "summary": "As a progressive insurgent in her last primary campaign, Summer Lee barely eked out a victory in a Pittsburgh-area congressional race, facing fierce opposition from local Democratic leadership and an onslaught of spending from outside groups.\nTwo years later, Ms. Lee — now a congresswoman aligned with the left-wing 'Squad' in Washington — heads into Tuesday's primary contest as the dominant front-runner, backed by much of the party establishment even as her criticism of Israel has deeply angered some Jewish constituents.\n'It was just the development of Congresswoman Summer Lee,' said Mayor Ed Gainey of Pittsburgh, asked about the biggest difference between the 2022 primary contest and this one. 'No one can doubt her influence.'\nThe Democratic primary in Pennsylvania's 12th District seemed primed to become a major test of party attitudes about the Middle East, following the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack that Israeli officials say killed about 1,200 people in Israel, and the Israeli military response that has devastated Gaza.\nMs. Lee has condemned the Oct. 7 attack. But she is also one of the most vocal critics of Israel in Congress, breaking with much of her party on an array of Israel-related legislation and calling for a cease-fire nine days after the Hamas attack, a position at odds with many Democratic officials at the time.\nYet interviews with more than a dozen voters, party leaders and activists in the Pittsburgh area suggest that the once-expected ideological battle has been significantly limited.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "To understand the current confrontation between Iran and Israel, it helps to think about three recent phases of Middle East geopolitics.\nPhase 1: Before Oct. 7 of last year, Iran was arguably the most isolated power in the region. The Biden administration was growing closer to Saudi Arabia, Iran's biggest rival for power. Israel, Iran's longtime enemy, had signed a diplomatic deal during the Trump administration with Bahrain, Morocco and the U.A.E.

Iran, for its part, was financing a network of extremist groups such as Hamas and the Houthis. Together, these developments pointed to the emergence of a broad alliance — among Arab countries, Israel, the U.S. and Western Europe — to check Iranian influence and aggression.\nPhase 2: Hamas's Oct. 7 attack on Israel scrambled the situation. Israel's massive military response focused global attention on the plight of Palestinians — a subject that tends to isolate Israel.

U.S. officials worked closely with Israel to intercept the missiles, as my colleague Peter Baker reported. British and French forces participated, too. Arab countries shared intelligence. Jordan went so far as to shoot down some drones itself.

            "summary": "Many Israelis were in a somber mood on Monday as they prepared to usher in Passover, the Jewish festival of freedom, saying they would mark the holiday rather than celebrate it, with more than 130 hostages remaining in Gaza.\nThe number of hostages believed to be alive is unclear, and with negotiations with Hamas captors at an impasse, there is little prospect of their imminent release.\nThe holiday is to start after sundown on Monday with the traditional Seder meal. By tradition, this is a joyful gathering of family and friends who follow a ritual order of blessings over symbolic foods as they retell the biblical story of the bondage and suffering of the ancient Israelites in Egypt and their exodus and liberation.\nIsraelis are still jittery after an exchange of fire with Iran this month, the first time Tehran had directly attacked Israel from Iranian territory. And the country continues to mourn the roughly 1,200 people killed in the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, which prompted six months of deadly fighting in Gaza so far. More than 250 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza since the start of Israel's ground invasion in late October, the military says. More than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, according to Gaza health officials.\nDaily tit-for-tat attacks over the northern border with Lebanon have turned a portion of Israel into a no-go zone. Tens of thousands of residents of northern and southern Israel remain in temporary accommodations, having been evacuated from their homes.\n'We will mark the Seder night for the children,' said Irit Feingold, 35, a pedagogic instructor for preschoolers who was attending a rally for the hostages in Jerusalem on Saturday night, and was planning to spend Monday night with about 25 members of her extended family.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "A high-energy crowd rallied on Sunday in Pittsburgh to support Representative Summer Lee, a left-leaning congresswoman whose primary on Tuesday is a high-profile test whether she can stave off a challenge aimed in part at her stance over the war in Gaza.\nSpeakers framed Ms. Lee's race, in Pennsylvania's 12th District, as crucial to building a movement for working people and to fighting what they cast as billionaire influence in the race.\nThe rally with several hundred supporters drew a small group of protesters who held signs outside the headquarters of the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers to criticize Ms. Lee and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's stances on the war in Israel and Gaza. Ms. Lee's primary is one of the first down-ballot electoral tests of the Israel-Gaza conflict this year.\n'To fight for common sense in the House is to often be alone. I have seen Summer walk alone,' Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. 'On Tuesday, what we must do is show her and show the world and show the people in that big white house that she is not alone.'\n'It's not about winning — it's about winning big,' she added.\nMs. Lee won a close primary in 2022 against a moderate challenger on her way to become the first Black woman to represent Pennsylvania in Congress. She has garnered broad support from Democrats this year. Even so, she has also faced pressure within her district after becoming one of the first members of Congress to call for an immediate cease-fire, just over a week after Hamas attacked Israel, and Israel responded with a military assault on Gaza.\nDuring her remarks, Ms. Lee reiterated her support for union jobs, affordable housing and a 'pro peace movement.' At one point, she told the audience that there was 'no room for people who would use our communities against each other for their own political ambitions.'\nShe framed her race as being about democracy and appeared to acknowledge the heightened focus on her Israel-Gaza stance, saying, 'You don't have a democracy if one issue determines whether or not my community has representation.'\nHer opponent, Bhavini Patel, a municipal councilwoman, has repeatedly criticized Ms. Lee's votes relating to the conflict. Ms. Patel said in an interview that on Sunday she attended a 'rally focused on the Jewish community' and decried her opponent's rally as 'bringing people here who are not from here.'\nMs. Lee and her supporters have sharply criticized the involvement of Jeff Yass, a Republican megadonor in Pennsylvania who gave significantly to Moderate PAC, a super PAC backing centrist Democrats and running ads supporting Ms. Patel. Ms. Lee and her supporters have seized on them: Her campaign distributed signs on Sunday that read 'Move, Yass! Get out of the way.' (Ms. Patel said she had denounced Mr. Yass and his support.)\nAllies of Ms. Lee also indirectly praised her Gaza stance. Mr. Jones told the crowd that Ms. Lee 'shows us that solidarity is about consistency in showing up for each other,' and that solidarity includes a spectrum of people, 'whether it's workers in Pittsburgh or the people of Palestine.'\n'Summer is somebody who knows that sometimes confrontation is confirmation that we are on the right path for victory,' he said.\nAnd when Ms. Ocasio-Cortez began to criticize AIPAC, the pro-Israel group that is backing challenges to progressive incumbents outside Pennsylvania, the audience promptly booed the group's mention.\nBackers of Ms. Lee have pointed to her diverse coalition as evidence that she can draw support from the groups that the national Democratic Party is looking to motivate, such as young people and voters of color.\nMeanwhile, a handful of critics outside the venue, several of whom said they were backing Ms. Patel, held signs that criticized Iran and cast Ms. Lee and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez as opposing Israel. The protesters said they were especially unhappy with Ms. Lee's vote last week against parts of a foreign aid package that allocated billions to Israel and imposed new sanctions on Iran.\n'We as a Jewish community are afraid, and we want her to understand that by not supporting things like Iran sanctions, it makes not just Israel but also America less safe,' said Julie Paris, a regional director for the pro-Israel group StandWithUs and Pittsburgh resident.\nBut Ms. Lee's backers vastly outnumbered Ms. Paris and her compatriots.\nWill Allison, who served as president of College Democrats at the University of Pittsburgh, said his group had endorsed Ms. Lee, the first primary endorsement he said the group had made.\n'We're very lucky to have her as a congresswoman who can bring the money back to the district and can make the system work for us as her constituents, but who can also authentically hold to her positions and take those tough votes,' he said.\nAnd when Mayor Ed Gainey of Pittsburgh took the stage and asked the crowd, 'Y'all know what time it is?' the audience emphatically shouted back: 'Summer time!'\nA correction was made on : Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated how Ms. Lee voted on some parts of the foreign aid package. She voted last week against parts of a foreign aid package that allocated billions to Israel and imposed new sanctions on Iran, but supported bills that provided aid to Ukraine and Taiwan.\nUkraine and Taiwan.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel appeared to rebuff those warnings on Wednesday, saying the country would 'do everything necessary to defend itself.'\nHere is a look at where Israel has been drawn into conflicts, some of which could escalate quickly:\nLast Saturday, Iran launched its first direct attack on Israel. The attack itself caused little damage, as almost all the missiles and drones were intercepted by Israeli air defenses, supported by the United States, France, Britain and Jordan. But it took a clandestine war between the two nations that has gone on for decades to a different level.\nImage Iranians on Monday expressing support for their government's missile and drone attack on Israel over the weekend. Credit... Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times Tehran was responding to a strike on April 1 in which seven officers overseeing Iran's operations in the Middle East died in an attack on the Iranian Embassy complex in Damascus, Syria. Iran said Israeli warplanes had conducted the strike and vowed to retaliate for what it considered an unusually brazen attack.\nIranian officials have signaled in recent months that they want to avoid a war with Israel. Officials in Israel and the United States have said that Israel miscalculated with its embassy strike, thinking that Iran would not react strongly. That strike, they said, effectively broke the unwritten rules of engagement in the long confrontation between the two sides. Israel has signaled that it will respond, and Iranian leaders have warned that if it does so, Iran will react forcefully, with deadlier weapons than in the last strike.\nInstead of attacking Israel directly, Iran typically goes after it through groups in the region that it supports, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, its most powerful proxy. On Wednesday, Hezbollah claimed responsibility for a cross-border drone and missile attack in northern Israel that the Israeli military said had injured 14 soldiers, six of them severely.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Rather than preparing the public for a showdown with its archrival, the government signaled a return to relative normalcy, lifting restrictions on large gatherings and allowing schools to reopen.\nSome right-wing Israeli politicians, dismayed by the lack of an immediate response, have argued that Israel needs to strike back forcefully — and soon — or risk losing its deterrence. Other more centrist officials have argued that Israel should instead bide its time before responding and capitalize on the support it has received from allies and regional actors, who are otherwise angry about Israel's war in Gaza.\nAny forceful Israeli response would risk angering President Biden, who has pressed Israel to de-escalate and whose military support Israel would need in the event of a major confrontation. Israel has already drawn the president's criticism for dragging out the war in Gaza, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel must weigh the perceived benefits of retaliation against the risk of further displeasing the president and the potential cost — both human and financial — of fighting two wars at the same time.\nAn Israeli official briefed on cabinet discussions who requested anonymity to discuss security matters said that as of Monday several options were being considered, ranging from diplomacy to an imminent strike, but gave no further details.\nIn short, the next steps in the conflict remain uncertain.\nThe nature of Israel's response, analysts said, could increase or decrease the possibility of a regional war. And it could improve or strain Israel's ties with Arab nations who share an antipathy for Iran but have been critical of the war in Gaza.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The attack — and the revelation on Saturday of its target — was in retaliation for Iran's strike in Israel last week after Israel bombed its embassy compound in Damascus. But it used a fraction of the firepower Tehran deployed in launching hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel.\nThe strike on Friday was the latest salvo in a series of tit-for-tat attacks between the two countries this month that have heightened fears of a broader regional conflict. But the relatively limited scope of Israel's strike and the muted response from Iranian officials seem to have eased tensions.\nIran and Israel have conducted a yearslong shadow war, but the conflict intensified on April 1, when Israeli warplanes killed seven Iranian officials, including three senior commanders, at an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria, which Israel asserts was used as a military site. Iran responded last week by firing a barrage of drones and cruise and ballistic missiles at Israel, almost all of which were shot down by Israel and its allies. But the strikes nevertheless rattled Israelis.\nThat attack was Iran's first-ever direct assault on Israeli soil, thrusting the countries' clandestine warfare — long fought by land, air, sea and cyberspace — into open view.

A cross-border raid in 2006 by Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese group, kicked off a devastating monthlong war, and rocket barrages fired by armed groups out of Gaza have escalated into days of heavy fighting and destruction.\nBut this time Israel is juggling a host of conflicting interests, as well as some new factors.\nIf it does respond to the unprecedented Iranian attack — itself carried out in retaliation for a strike on an Iranian Embassy building in Syria that killed top commanders in Iran's armed forces — Israel must weigh whether to do so in proportion to the actual results of the Iranian assault, which was largely blocked by air defenses and caused little damage, or to consider what could have happened if more than 300 drones and missiles had actually hit Israel.\nHard-right members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government are pushing for an immediate and forceful response, saying that the lack of one will further weaken Israel in its enemies' eyes. Some Israelis see an opportunity to use military strikes to fulfill the longstanding Israeli goal of degrading Iran's nuclear program.\nBut other Israelis are urging restraint or so-called 'strategic patience,' wary, among other things, of taking the nation's focus away from its war with Hamas in Gaza, the efforts to release its scores of hostages there and its skirmishes with Hezbollah along its northern border, as well as the risk of setting off a broader regional conflict without international support.\nAnalysts say the success of Israel and its allies, led by the United States, in blocking most of the Iranian attack has given Israel the leeway to choose how and when to respond, if at all.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Mr. Netanyahu faces a delicate calculation. Letting an unprecedented direct attack from Iran pass without a military response could open him up to criticism that he is endangering Israel. But overly aggressive retaliation, in a region that is already on high alert, could dramatically raise the chances of the conflict spiraling out of control. For now, life in Israel is returning to normal, and Iranian officials signaled on Sunday that they were seeking to prevent further escalation. Mr. Netanyahu's war cabinet met on Sunday evening without deciding how to respond to Iran's assault, and the military had yet to detail possible options by nightfall, an official who was briefed on the meeting said.

Witnesses said that Israeli troops fired at a crowd in northern Gaza on Sunday.\nNearly all of the drones and missiles that Iran fired at Israel on Saturday — in retaliation against what was believed to be an Israeli airstrike on an Iranian Embassy building in Syria two weeks earlier — were shot down by Israel's military with help from Britain, Jordan and the United States. The only serious casualty was a 7-year-old girl, Amina al-Hasoni, who was badly wounded.

Israeli military analysts are divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza. Credit...Within moments of Israel and its allies shooting down a fusillade of Iranian missiles and drones this weekend, many began wondering what the latest exchange between Israel and Iran would mean for the war in the Gaza Strip. The Iranian attack was retaliation for what was widely believed to be an Israeli strike this month on an embassy building in Damascus that killed seven Iranian officials, including three top commanders in Iran's armed forces. But it occurred against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel is battling Hamas, a militant group funded and armed by Iran. Israeli military analysts were divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza, now in its sixth month. The next fulcrum in that war could hinge on whether Israel decides to pursue Hamas in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have fled amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis. Some analysts argued that the implications for Gaza would depend on whether Israel responded with a major counterattack against Iran. Others contended that Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip would be unaffected. Shlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general and a former director of the Israeli military's strategic planning division, said that if Israel responds with substantial force to the Iranian attack, it could spark a multifront war that would compel the Israeli leadership to move its attention away from Gaza. In the case of a significant regional conflagration, General Brom said, Israel might choose to delay its plans to invade Rafah, which Israeli officials describe as the last Hamas stronghold. 'It's not comfortable for us to have simultaneous, high-intensity wars in multiple theaters,' General Brom added. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to send ground forces into Rafah, despite international pressure to back off the operation. On Sunday, an Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that the Iranian attack would have no effect on the military's plan to invade Rafah. A large-scale direct confrontation with Iran could potentially bring the war in Gaza to a close, General Brom said. But for the war to end in such a way, it would require a broader cease-fire that encompassed several parties, including Israel, Iran and the Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. 'There's an idea that in order to resolve a crisis, the situation first needs to become worse,' he said, explaining that an escalation followed by a comprehensive cease-fire with Iran might incline that country to push its regional proxies to stop fighting with Israel. While the members of Israel's war cabinet did not issue a formal statement after meeting on Sunday, a separate Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, indicated that the country would respond to the Iranian assault — although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how. Other military experts, however, dismissed the link between the Iranian attack and the war in Gaza. 'There's no connection at all,' said Amos Gilead, a retired major general who served in Israeli military intelligence. General Gilead said that Israel's army had enough resources to fight against Iran and continue to wage war against Hamas in Gaza. Others analysts made a similar point, arguing that the resources needed to fight Iran were different from those needed in Gaza. Israel needs fighter jets and air defense systems to counter Iran, they said. In contrast, they added, the army mainly requires ground troops, drones, and attack helicopters to fight Hamas in Gaza. 'There's no real tension between these two things,' said Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former head of Israel's National Security Council. Still, General Eiland said that the success of the coalition that repelled the Iranian attack, which included the United States, Britain and Jordan, could inspire Israel to take advantage of the momentum to overcome its declining status internationally by ending the war in Gaza. Though the United States, Israel's closest ally, has broadly supported Israel's decision to go to war in Gaza, it has increasingly signaled its displeasure over the mounting death toll and warned against a major ground assault in Rafah. The support the United States provided Israel on Sunday in shooting down Iranian drones and missiles could give it more leverage over its Israeli counterparts. While General Eiland said such an outcome could help Israel develop good will in the international community and contribute to reaching a solution to end the war in Gaza and skirmishes with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, he was doubtful that Mr. Netanyahu would purse such a path. 'He says he wants to achieve ‘total victory' in Gaza and conquer Rafah, a process that could last two or three months,' he said, referring to the prime minister. 'It's clear Netanyahu has a different mind-set and priorities.' Aaron Boxerman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

The brazen attack this weekend, when Iran launched a barrage of drones and missiles in retaliation for Israel's attacking its embassy compound in Syria earlier in the month, was the first time Iran had launched open attacks against Israel from its soil. The attack has unnerved a region already roiling in conflict, raising concerns among diplomats and U.N. officials that a new, potentially wide and destructive war could spark if both sides don't stand down. António Guterres, the Secretary General of the U.N., told the Council that it was 'time to step back from the brink,' and that its members, as well as the United Nations at large, had the collective responsibility 'to actively engage all parties concerned to prevent further escalation.' The meeting on Sunday was convened at the request of Israel. The Council has not collectively issued a statement condemning Iran's attack, and it has also not issued a statement condemning Israel's attack on Iran's embassy in Damascus that killed several senior commanders. All 15 members of the Council must reach a consensus for a statement to be issued and none was reached on both issues. The Security Council is one of the few venues where adversaries engaged in conflict come face to face and sit in the same chamber. On Sunday, both Israel and Iran's ambassadors were present and delivered fiery comments about the other's country, blaming each other for actions they both called terrorism. Gilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador, said Iran's attack had 'crossed every red line' and Israel reserved the right to retaliate. Mr. Erdan called for the Council to take severe action against Iran, including 'crippling' sanctions and statements of condemnation. 'The fact that Israel's air defense proved to be superior does not change the brutality of Iran's attack,' he said. Iran's ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, said his country had an 'inherent right to self-defense' after Israel's attack on its diplomatic compound. Mr. Iravani said that Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region,' but that if its interests, people or national security came under attack it would 'respond to any such threat or aggressions vigorously and in accordance with international law.' The United States and Iran both said that they do not seek war with one another, but that if one attacks the other's interests, there would be a defensive response. Robert A. Wood, a U.S. representative to the U.N., told the Security Council that the 'U.S. is not seeking escalation, our actions have been defensive in nature,' and said the U.S. goal was to 'de-escalate' and then get back to securing an end to the conflict in Gaza. Mr. Wood said the U.S. planned to bring further action on Iran at the Council and called on the Council to unequivocally condemn Iran's actions. Any resolution against Iran put forth by the U.S. at the Council would likely be vetoed by Russia and China, two of Iran's close allies, who sharply criticized Israel for what they said was reckless violation of international law when it attacked Iran's embassy compound. 'What happened in the night of the 14th of April did not happen in a vacuum,' said Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's ambassador to the U.N. China's ambassador, Dai Bing, called on the Council to 'exercise maximum calm and restraint' and said the implementation of an immediate cease-fire is the 'top priority.' Israel has said that the embassy compound was a legitimate military target because senior commanders from Iran's Quds Forces, the external branch of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, were holding a meeting inside the building.

Ramadan Abed/Reuters As thousands of displaced Palestinians tried to return to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday, Israeli troops fired at the crowd, forcing people to turn back in panic, according to an emergency worker and two people who tried to make the journey. Wafa, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency, reported that five people were killed and 23 wounded by Israeli gunfire and artillery in the incident on Al-Rashid Street south of Gaza City as a crowd of Gazans headed north to their homes. The circumstances of the deaths could not be confirmed independently, and the Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions about whether its forces opened fire on Palestinian civilians trying to cross to northern Gaza. For months, the Israeli military has barred Palestinians who have been displaced by the war in Gaza from returning to their homes in northern Gaza. It has become a sticking point in negotiations between Israel and Hamas. It was not clear why some Palestinians believed that Israel would not block them from returning on Sunday. But they were making the journey on a day when Iran had launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel. More than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its assault there in October, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health. The assault occurred in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people, according to the Israeli authorities. On Sunday morning Jamila Ibrahim, 39, said that she began hearing of some Palestinians who left early and managed to get back to the north. She later spoke with friends who were able to return north. But there were very few. Around 10:30 a.m. she and her three children — who are between 10 and 17 — set out, joining other people on the journey. She said there were no official notices from the Israel military, which has occupied large parts of Gaza after it launched a ground invasion, that residents would be allowed to return to their homes. It was just based on word of mouth, as well as people seeing others leaving and being encouraged to join the trek home, she said. 'Some people were scared, they didn't know what fate they were heading to, they didn't know what would happen,' she said. 'Some were happy that they were going to return.' Most people were on foot — carrying what little food they had or their few belongings in bags and luggage — and some paid large sums of money to go by car, trucks or donkey carts, she said. But they all took the same seaside road, heading north toward an Israeli checkpoint that has cut off southern Gaza from the north. 'There was lots of tension, lots of tension among the people,' she said. 'They were scared they could be shot.' Those who tried to cross north in the middle of the night — around 4 a.m. — managed to make it to the north, she said, based on her conversation with friends who crossed successfully. But later that morning, by the time she and other displaced Palestinians tried to follow, Israeli forces opened fire on them, she said. 'Around 12:30 the Israelis started shooting,' she said. Mazen Al-Harazeen, a first responder in Gaza, said Israeli forces fired weapons and he did not know how many had been killed, but he said, 'There was shooting and martyrs.' Early Sunday morning, Avichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, or I.D.F., wrote on social media that the rumors that the army was allowing residents to return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip were false. 'The I.D.F. will not allow the return of residents,' he added. 'For your safety, do not approach the forces operating there.' Nearly two million Gazans have been displaced by the war between Hamas and Israel, now in its sixth month. One of their biggest concerns is when and if they will be allowed to return to their homes, or whether they will be permanently displaced, as previous generations were. Around 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes in 1947 and 1948 during the wars surrounding Israel's establishment as a state. Bilal Shbair contributed reporting.

The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, said Israel's military still needed to detail possible options. At Amina al-Hasoni's house in the village of al-Fur'ah, Israel, the Iranian attack wounded her and ripped holes in the roof and floor. Credit... Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times The hospital waiting room was quiet on Sunday: There was no crowd of relatives, no flood of patients. Israel's air defenses had just fended off a large-scale Iranian attack, with only one serious casualty recorded. But there was no sense that a crisis had been averted outside the pediatric intensive care unit at Soroka Medical Center in southern Israel's city of Beersheba. Instead, tension filled the air until the doors to the ward swung open and a gasping mother stumbled out, her face contorted. Then raw emotion quickly took its place as she crumbled into a chair, crying. While Israel suffered little in the way of significant damage overnight, this one family was dealt a devastating blow. Amina al-Hasoni, 7, was clinging to life — the sole serious casualty of the Iranian barrage. And were it not for systemic inequities in Israel, her relatives said, maybe she too could have been spared. There are roughly 300,000 Arab Bedouins in the Negev desert. About a quarter of them live in villages that are not recognized by Israeli officials. Without state recognition, those communities have long suffered from a lack of planning and basic services like running water, sewers and electricity. And few have access to bomb shelters, despite repeated requests to the state. The Hasoni family lives in one such community, sharing a hilltop in the Negev village of al-Fur'ah with a plot of disconnected houses. When rocket warning sirens went off on Saturday night, Amina's uncle Ismail said he felt stuck — there was nowhere to go. Booms overhead signaled air defenses intercepting missiles before there was a big explosion. Then he heard a woman screaming — his sister — and 'I started running,' he said. Ismail, 38, found his sister outside her house holding Amina, who was bleeding from the head. Her family had decided to flee the rockets, running out the front door. But Amina, who slept in a back room with pink walls covered in painted butterflies, didn't make it. A missile fragment ripped through the home's thin metal roof, shearing a hole with sharp metallic edges. It made impact just in front of the door — which is where Amina was knocked unconscious. 'I think it hit her while she was running away,' Ismail said. He said he took the injured Amina from his sister and lifted the girl into his own arms. Ismail then tracked down a car that raced her toward the hospital, more than 40 minutes away on a rutted, winding road that fades out in some places, with camels crossing in others. Only then, with Amina on her way, did he go inside the house, where he said he saw a large, black piece of shrapnel about the size of a pretzel jar. And 'there was blood,' he said, a puddle that had turned into a stream across the tile floor, to the front door. By Sunday afternoon, the orange patterned tiles had been cleaned. None of the dozen or so relatives there could say who had done it, only that 'it was bad for the children to see' all the blood. But Ismail hasn't gone back inside. 'It's difficult,' he said, his jeans and boots still spattered with blood. Not far from where he sat, a pink Minnie Mouse blanket and a small black-and-white girl's dress hung on a family clothesline. 'We could have built shelters here,' Ismail added. He dismissed any suggestions that what happened to Amina was bad luck. 'It's part of a policy,' he said. 'We can't do anything.' The missile fragment that tore into Amina's home was one of more than 150 collected in the area on Sunday by police bomb disposal teams, and the family said officers had taken away the piece that hit their home. The teams combed the desert for hours, searching for debris and carting away huge hunks of twisted metal — efforts repeated across Israel. The Hasoni home is not far from a military base, Nevatim, that was reportedly a target of the Iranian assault and that Israeli officials said was lightly damaged. That is little consolation to Amina's father, Muhammad, who spent the morning at the hospital taking turns at her bedside. He didn't say much to her, he said, and just repeated her name. Amina — the youngest of his 14 children — 'likes to laugh and have fun all the time,' said Muhammad, 49. She's a good student with a 'strong personality,' he added, who doesn't always listen to instructions. And she loves to draw. He called Iran's actions 'inhumane.' 'May God demolish them,' he said, without hesitation. April 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET Iran's ambassador to the U.N., Amir Saeid Iravani, addressed the Council after his Israeli counterpart and defended his country's actions as the 'inherent right to self-defense' in response to the attack on its diplomatic compound in Syria two weeks ago. April 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET Iravani said Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region' and has 'no intention' of engaging in conflict with the United States, but warned that it would respond proportionately if Israel or the U.S. military were to attack Iran or its interests.

Tomer Neuberg/Associated Press After convening a virtual meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, Group of 7 leaders adopted a joint declaration that reaffirmed their 'full solidarity and support to Israel' and accused Iran of having risked 'provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation' that must be avoided. Iran's attack, which appeared to have been mostly intercepted by Israel and its allies, was carried out in retaliation for Israeli attacks on an Iranian Embassy building in Syria earlier this month. Iranian leaders have signaled that their retaliation is over unless they are attacked again. The joint declaration from the leaders of G7 nations — Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, as well as the European Union — demanded that 'Iran and its proxies cease their attacks.' The leaders said they were ready 'to take further measures now and in response to further destabilizing initiatives.' Hoping to head off Israel from further escalating the conflict, President Biden privately advised Israel against firing back on Iran, U.S. officials said on Sunday. It was not yet clear how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his government would respond. Leaders of the European Union have publicly urged restraint from both countries as they, too, condemned Iran's actions. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, called the attack 'blatant and unjustifiable,' adding that 'all actors must now refrain from further escalation.' Charles Michel, president of the European Council, said that the condemnation from G7 leaders was unanimous and that 'all parties must exercise restraint.' 'Ending the crisis in Gaza as soon as possible, notably through an immediate cease-fire, will make a difference,' Mr. Michel added. Demonstrators gather at Palestine Square in Tehran on Sunday. Credit... Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times Many Iranians stayed glued to their television screens and phones Saturday night, anxiously following updates as their country launched a military attack on Israel and fearing a wider war that would only add to the country's current economic upheaval. In Tehran and several other big cities, lines of cars stretched a mile or more outside gas stations in the middle of the night. Some parents kept their children home from school on Sunday. Tehran's airport closed down, and will remain that way until at least Monday morning. Iranians living inside the country said in interviews that they were worried the confrontation with Israel would spiral out of control and hoped both sides would avoid escalating the conflict. Soheil, a 37-year-old engineer in Isfahan who, like several other Iranians, asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution, said all he and his colleagues could talk about at work on Sunday was the prospect of a broader conflict. 'I'm afraid of war,' he said. 'It will have a great impact on our daily lives, especially on the economy and the price of dollar, and the anxiety will affect our mental health.' Since a strike two weeks ago on the Iranian Embassy complex in Syria that killed three top military commanders, Iran's currency, the rial, has fallen sharply against the U.S. dollar, shrinking purchasing power as Iran's leaders vowed to respond. Nafiseh, a 36-year-old high school teacher in Tehran, said that many of her students did not attend school on Sunday because parents were worried about counterattacks from Israel. 'It's all everyone is talking about, from teenagers to teachers and family members, it's all about the war and attacks,' she said. Supporters of the government hailed the attacks as Iran's showcasing its military might to defend itself on Saturday, with several hundred gathering in Tehran's Palestine Square to celebrate with fireworks and chants of 'Death to Israel.' A large mural on the square depicted Iranian missiles with a message written in Farsi and Hebrew that read, 'Next time the slap will be harder.' On Sunday night, a crowd formed again in the square, carrying signs and chanting anti-Israel slogans. Others took to social media to say they would fight for their country unconditionally if Iran were to go to war. 'When a foreign enemy is involved, honor means standing with our country even at the cost of our lives,' Reza Rashidpour, a civil engineer, wrote on social media. 'Long live Iran, long live soldiers of Iran.' But critics of the government denounced the attacks, seeing them as a misadventure that risks harming ordinary Iranians. Many Iranians oppose government policies that include funding, arming and training groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanese armed group that has increasingly traded fire with Israel since the Oct. 7 attacks that set off the current fighting in Gaza. In protests against the government over the past few years a recurring chant has been, 'No to Gaza, no to Lebanon, my life for Iran.' Ali, a 53-year-old veteran of the Iran-Iraq war who lives in Kerman, said the existence of the Islamic Republic depends on 'crisis.' 'Now they are exploiting the war and the crisis to survive,' he said. A woman carries a weapon in Tel Aviv on Sunday after Iran launched drones and missiles toward Israel. Credit... Hannah Mckay/Reuters After many Israelis spent a long night huddled in bomb shelters, life crept back toward calm on Sunday, even as the people of Israel waited tensely to see how their government would respond to the Iranian strikes that set off rarely heard sirens in Jerusalem. Jerusalem is targeted much less frequently than border communities or the coastal metropolis of Tel Aviv, but during the assault loud booms resounded in the skies, where missiles and interceptors wove around one another like fireflies. In areas of Jerusalem with a mostly Jewish population, many crowded into public bomb shelters, some wearing pajamas and lugging sleeping bags. 'There were more people there than usual,' said Zev Palatnik, 33, who spent some of the night in his building's bomb shelter alongside his neighbors. 'There's a sense that the rockets from Iran are more sophisticated than the ones from Gaza,' he said, adding that there was a higher level of anxiety as a result. But on Sunday, a relatively steady amount of foot traffic flowed in downtown Jerusalem as Israelis returned to work. Ron Cohen, a 37-year-old engineer, said he had hoped that the Israeli government would immediately strike back at Iran, but he did not expect a significant Israeli response. 'Not much, maybe a few small things,' he said. 'Our government knows how to defend, but not how to attack.' For the Israelis among the tens of thousands forced to flee communities along the borders with Gaza and Lebanon, the assault compounded six exhausting months of war. Many expressed uncertainty over the best way for the government to respond. Gidi Lapid, who left his home in Metula, near the border with Lebanon, with his family at the beginning of the war, said Israel might be able to show strength through restrained action. But at the same time, Iranians 'should be the ones in existential dread, in bomb shelters, stocking up on food and water,' Mr. Lapid said by phone from Eliav, a small town near Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem.

Letting an unprecedented direct attack from Iran pass without a military response could open him up to criticism that he is endangering Israel. But overly aggressive retaliation, in a region that is already on high alert, could dramatically raise the chances of the conflict spiraling out of control.\nFor now, life in Israel is returning to normal, and Iranian officials signaled on Sunday that they were seeking to prevent further escalation.\nMr. Netanyahu's war cabinet met on Sunday evening without deciding how to respond to Iran's assault, and the military had yet to detail possible options by nightfall, an official who was briefed on the meeting said. Israel has faced calls for restraint from the United States, the Group of 7 nations, the European Union and the secretary general of the United Nations.\nIsrael's next moves will have strategic implications for its war in Gaza against Hamas, a militant group funded and armed by Iran, and for civilians in the enclave who have been grappling for months with violence and severe hunger. Witnesses said that Israeli troops fired at a crowd in northern Gaza on Sunday.\nNearly all of the drones and missiles that Iran fired at Israel on Saturday — in retaliation against what was believed to be an Israeli airstrike on an Iranian Embassy building in Syria two weeks earlier — were shot down by Israel's military with help from Britain, Jordan and the United States. The only serious casualty was a 7-year-old girl, Amina al-Hasoni, who was badly wounded.\nResidents remove possessions and inspect their homes following Israeli airstrikes in Khan Yunis, Gaza, on Saturday. Israeli military analysts are divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza. Credit...Within moments of Israel and its allies shooting down a fusillade of Iranian missiles and drones this weekend, many began wondering what the latest exchange between Israel and Iran would mean for the war in the Gaza Strip.\nThe Iranian attack was retaliation for what was widely believed to be an Israeli strike this month on an embassy building in Damascus that killed seven Iranian officials, including three top commanders in Iran's armed forces. But it occurred against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel is battling Hamas, a militant group funded and armed by Iran.\nIsraeli military analysts were divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza, now in its sixth month. The next fulcrum in that war could hinge on whether Israel decides to pursue Hamas in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have fled amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis.\nSome analysts argued that the implications for Gaza would depend on whether Israel responded with a major counterattack against Iran. Others contended that Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip would be unaffected.\nShlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general and a former director of the Israeli military's strategic planning division, said that if Israel responds with substantial force to the Iranian attack, it could spark a multifront war that would compel the Israeli leadership to move its attention away from Gaza.\nIn the case of a significant regional conflagration, General Brom said, Israel might choose to delay its plans to invade Rafah, which Israeli officials describe as the last Hamas stronghold.\n'It's not comfortable for us to have simultaneous, high-intensity wars in multiple theaters,' General Brom added.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to send ground forces into Rafah, despite international pressure to back off the operation. On Sunday, an Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that the Iranian attack would have no effect on the military's plan to invade Rafah.\nA large-scale direct confrontation with Iran could potentially bring the war in Gaza to a close, General Brom said. But for the war to end in such a way, it would require a broader cease-fire that encompassed several parties, including Israel, Iran and the Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah.\n'There's an idea that in order to resolve a crisis, the situation first needs to become worse,' he said, explaining that an escalation followed by a comprehensive cease-fire with Iran might incline that country to push its regional proxies to stop fighting with Israel.\nWhile the members of Israel's war cabinet did not issue a formal statement after meeting on Sunday, a separate Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, indicated that the country would respond to the Iranian assault — although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how.\nOther military experts, however, dismissed the link between the Iranian attack and the war in Gaza.\n'There's no connection at all,' said Amos Gilead, a retired major general who served in Israeli military intelligence.\nGeneral Gilead said that Israel's army had enough resources to fight against Iran and continue to wage war against Hamas in Gaza.\nOthers analysts made a similar point, arguing that the resources needed to fight Iran were different from those needed in Gaza. Israel needs fighter jets and air defense systems to counter Iran, they said. In contrast, they added, the army mainly requires ground troops, drones, and attack helicopters to fight Hamas in Gaza.\n'There's no real tension between these two things,' said Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former head of Israel's National Security Council.\nStill, General Eiland said that the success of the coalition that repelled the Iranian attack, which included the United States, Britain and Jordan, could inspire Israel to take advantage of the momentum to overcome its declining status internationally by ending the war in Gaza.\nThough the United States, Israel's closest ally, has broadly supported Israel's decision to go to war in Gaza, it has increasingly signaled its displeasure over the mounting death toll and warned against a major ground assault in Rafah. The support the United States provided Israel on Sunday in shooting down Iranian drones and missiles could give it more leverage over its Israeli counterparts.\nWhile General Eiland said such an outcome could help Israel develop good will in the international community and contribute to reaching a solution to end the war in Gaza and skirmishes with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, he was doubtful that Mr. Netanyahu would purse such a path.\n'He says he wants to achieve ‘total victory' in Gaza and conquer Rafah, a process that could last two or three months,' he said, referring to the prime minister. 'It's clear Netanyahu has a different mind-set and priorities.'\nAaron Boxerman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addresses the United Nations Security Council during an emergency meeting at U.N. headquarters on Sunday.

'They were scared they could be shot.'\nThose who tried to cross north in the middle of the night — around 4 a.m. — managed to make it to the north, she said, based on her conversation with friends who crossed successfully.\nBut later that morning, by the time she and other displaced Palestinians tried to follow, Israeli forces opened fire on them, she said.\n'Around 12:30 the Israelis started shooting,' she said.\nMazen Al-Harazeen, a first responder in Gaza, said Israeli forces fired weapons and he did not know how many had been killed, but he said, 'There was shooting and martyrs.'\nEarly Sunday morning, Avichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, or I.D.F., wrote on social media that the rumors that the army was allowing residents to return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip were false.\n'The I.D.F. will not allow the return of residents,' he added. 'For your safety, do not approach the forces operating there.'\nNearly two million Gazans have been displaced by the war between Hamas and Israel, now in its sixth month. One of their biggest concerns is when and if they will be allowed to return to their homes, or whether they will be permanently displaced, as previous generations were.\nAround 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes in 1947 and 1948 during the wars surrounding Israel's establishment as a state.\nBilal Shbair contributed reporting.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:49 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:49 p.m. ET Aaron Boxerman\nAaron Boxerman Reporting from Jerusalem While Israel's war cabinet members didn't issue a formal statement after the meeting, an Israeli official familiar with the discussions indicated that Israel would undoubtedly respond — although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how.

Credit... Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times The hospital waiting room was quiet on Sunday: There was no crowd of relatives, no flood of patients. Israel's air defenses had just fended off a large-scale Iranian attack, with only one serious casualty recorded.\nBut there was no sense that a crisis had been averted outside the pediatric intensive care unit at Soroka Medical Center in southern Israel's city of Beersheba. Instead, tension filled the air until the doors to the ward swung open and a gasping mother stumbled out, her face contorted. Then raw emotion quickly took its place as she crumbled into a chair, crying.\nWhile Israel suffered little in the way of significant damage overnight, this one family was dealt a devastating blow. Amina al-Hasoni, 7, was clinging to life — the sole serious casualty of the Iranian barrage. And were it not for systemic inequities in Israel, her relatives said, maybe she too could have been spared.\nThere are roughly 300,000 Arab Bedouins in the Negev desert. About a quarter of them live in villages that are not recognized by Israeli officials. Without state recognition, those communities have long suffered from a lack of planning and basic services like running water, sewers and electricity. And few have access to bomb shelters, despite repeated requests to the state.\nThe Hasoni family lives in one such community, sharing a hilltop in the Negev village of al-Fur'ah with a plot of disconnected houses. When rocket warning sirens went off on Saturday night, Amina's uncle Ismail said he felt stuck — there was nowhere to go.\nBooms overhead signaled air defenses intercepting missiles before there was a big explosion. Then he heard a woman screaming — his sister — and 'I started running,' he said.\nIsmail, 38, found his sister outside her house holding Amina, who was bleeding from the head. Her family had decided to flee the rockets, running out the front door. But Amina, who slept in a back room with pink walls covered in painted butterflies, didn't make it.\nA missile fragment ripped through the home's thin metal roof, shearing a hole with sharp metallic edges. It made impact just in front of the door — which is where Amina was knocked unconscious.\n'I think it hit her while she was running away,' Ismail said.\nHe said he took the injured Amina from his sister and lifted the girl into his own arms. Ismail then tracked down a car that raced her toward the hospital, more than 40 minutes away on a rutted, winding road that fades out in some places, with camels crossing in others.\nOnly then, with Amina on her way, did he go inside the house, where he said he saw a large, black piece of shrapnel about the size of a pretzel jar. And 'there was blood,' he said, a puddle that had turned into a stream across the tile floor, to the front door.\nBy Sunday afternoon, the orange patterned tiles had been cleaned. None of the dozen or so relatives there could say who had done it, only that 'it was bad for the children to see' all the blood. But Ismail hasn't gone back inside.\n'It's difficult,' he said, his jeans and boots still spattered with blood. Not far from where he sat, a pink Minnie Mouse blanket and a small black-and-white girl's dress hung on a family clothesline.\n'We could have built shelters here,' Ismail added.\nHe dismissed any suggestions that what happened to Amina was bad luck.\n'It's part of a policy,' he said. 'We can't do anything.'\nThe missile fragment that tore into Amina's home was one of more than 150 collected in the area on Sunday by police bomb disposal teams, and the family said officers had taken away the piece that hit their home. The teams combed the desert for hours, searching for debris and carting away huge hunks of twisted metal — efforts repeated across Israel.\nThe Hasoni home is not far from a military base, Nevatim, that was reportedly a target of the Iranian assault and that Israeli officials said was lightly damaged.\nThat is little consolation to Amina's father, Muhammad, who spent the morning at the hospital taking turns at her bedside. He didn't say much to her, he said, and just repeated her name.\nAmina — the youngest of his 14 children — 'likes to laugh and have fun all the time,' said Muhammad, 49. She's a good student with a 'strong personality,' he added, who doesn't always listen to instructions. And she loves to draw.\nHe called Iran's actions 'inhumane.'\n'May God demolish them,' he said, without hesitation.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET Iran's ambassador to the U.N., Amir Saeid Iravani, addressed the Council after his Israeli counterpart and defended his country's actions as the 'inherent right to self-defense' in response to the attack on its diplomatic compound in Syria two weeks ago.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET Iravani said Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region' and has 'no intention' of engaging in conflict with the United States, but warned that it would respond proportionately if Israel or the U.S. military were to attack Iran or its interests.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:26 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:26 p.m. ET Israel's U.N. ambassador, Gilad Erdan, who had requested the emergency meeting of the Security Council, assailed Iran and its proxies, saying Iran had crossed every red line in its attack and that Israel reserved the right to retaliate. Erdan called for the Council to take severe action against Iran, including sanctions and statements of condemnation. 'The fact that Israel's air defense proved to be superior does not change the brutality of Iran's attack,' he said.\nIsraeli Iron Dome air defense system launches to intercept missiles fired from Iran on Sunday.

Tomer Neuberg/Associated Press After convening a virtual meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, Group of 7 leaders adopted a joint declaration that reaffirmed their 'full solidarity and support to Israel' and accused Iran of having risked 'provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation' that must be avoided.\nIran's attack, which appeared to have been mostly intercepted by Israel and its allies, was carried out in retaliation for Israeli attacks on an Iranian Embassy building in Syria earlier this month. Iranian leaders have signaled that their retaliation is over unless they are attacked again.\nThe joint declaration from the leaders of G7 nations — Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, as well as the European Union — demanded that 'Iran and its proxies cease their attacks.' The leaders said they were ready 'to take further measures now and in response to further destabilizing initiatives.'\nHoping to head off Israel from further escalating the conflict, President Biden privately advised Israel against firing back on Iran, U.S. officials said on Sunday. It was not yet clear how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his government would respond.\nLeaders of the European Union have publicly urged restraint from both countries as they, too, condemned Iran's actions. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, called the attack 'blatant and unjustifiable,' adding that 'all actors must now refrain from further escalation.'\nCharles Michel, president of the European Council, said that the condemnation from G7 leaders was unanimous and that 'all parties must exercise restraint.'\n'Ending the crisis in Gaza as soon as possible, notably through an immediate cease-fire, will make a difference,' Mr. Michel added.\nDemonstrators gather at Palestine Square in Tehran on Sunday. Credit... Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times Many Iranians stayed glued to their television screens and phones Saturday night, anxiously following updates as their country launched a military attack on Israel and fearing a wider war that would only add to the country's current economic upheaval.\nIn Tehran and several other big cities, lines of cars stretched a mile or more outside gas stations in the middle of the night. Some parents kept their children home from school on Sunday. Tehran's airport closed down, and will remain that way until at least Monday morning.\nIranians living inside the country said in interviews that they were worried the confrontation with Israel would spiral out of control and hoped both sides would avoid escalating the conflict.\nSoheil, a 37-year-old engineer in Isfahan who, like several other Iranians, asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution, said all he and his colleagues could talk about at work on Sunday was the prospect of a broader conflict.\n'I'm afraid of war,' he said. 'It will have a great impact on our daily lives, especially on the economy and the price of dollar, and the anxiety will affect our mental health.'\nSince a strike two weeks ago on the Iranian Embassy complex in Syria that killed three top military commanders, Iran's currency, the rial, has fallen sharply against the U.S. dollar, shrinking purchasing power as Iran's leaders vowed to respond.\nNafiseh, a 36-year-old high school teacher in Tehran, said that many of her students did not attend school on Sunday because parents were worried about counterattacks from Israel. 'It's all everyone is talking about, from teenagers to teachers and family members, it's all about the war and attacks,' she said.\nSupporters of the government hailed the attacks as Iran's showcasing its military might to defend itself on Saturday, with several hundred gathering in Tehran's Palestine Square to celebrate with fireworks and chants of 'Death to Israel.' A large mural on the square depicted Iranian missiles with a message written in Farsi and Hebrew that read, 'Next time the slap will be harder.' On Sunday night, a crowd formed again in the square, carrying signs and chanting anti-Israel slogans.\nOthers took to social media to say they would fight for their country unconditionally if Iran were to go to war.\n'When a foreign enemy is involved, honor means standing with our country even at the cost of our lives,' Reza Rashidpour, a civil engineer, wrote on social media. 'Long live Iran, long live soldiers of Iran.'\nBut critics of the government denounced the attacks, seeing them as a misadventure that risks harming ordinary Iranians.\nMany Iranians oppose government policies that include funding, arming and training groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanese armed group that has increasingly traded fire with Israel since the Oct. 7 attacks that set off the current fighting in Gaza. In protests against the government over the past few years a recurring chant has been, 'No to Gaza, no to Lebanon, my life for Iran.'\nAli, a 53-year-old veteran of the Iran-Iraq war who lives in Kerman, said the existence of the Islamic Republic depends on 'crisis.'\n'Now they are exploiting the war and the crisis to survive,' he said.\nA woman carries a weapon in Tel Aviv on Sunday after Iran launched drones and missiles toward Israel. Credit... Hannah Mckay/Reuters After many Israelis spent a long night huddled in bomb shelters, life crept back toward calm on Sunday, even as the people of Israel waited tensely to see how their government would respond to the Iranian strikes that set off rarely heard sirens in Jerusalem.\nJerusalem is targeted much less frequently than border communities or the coastal metropolis of Tel Aviv, but during the assault loud booms resounded in the skies, where missiles and interceptors wove around one another like fireflies.\nIn areas of Jerusalem with a mostly Jewish population, many crowded into public bomb shelters, some wearing pajamas and lugging sleeping bags.\n'There were more people there than usual,' said Zev Palatnik, 33, who spent some of the night in his building's bomb shelter alongside his neighbors. 'There's a sense that the rockets from Iran are more sophisticated than the ones from Gaza,' he said, adding that there was a higher level of anxiety as a result.\nBut on Sunday, a relatively steady amount of foot traffic flowed in downtown Jerusalem as Israelis returned to work. Ron Cohen, a 37-year-old engineer, said he had hoped that the Israeli government would immediately strike back at Iran, but he did not expect a significant Israeli response.\n'Not much, maybe a few small things,' he said. 'Our government knows how to defend, but not how to attack.'\nFor the Israelis among the tens of thousands forced to flee communities along the borders with Gaza and Lebanon, the assault compounded six exhausting months of war. Many expressed uncertainty over the best way for the government to respond.\nGidi Lapid, who left his home in Metula, near the border with Lebanon, with his family at the beginning of the war, said Israel might be able to show strength through restrained action.\nBut at the same time, Iranians 'should be the ones in existential dread, in bomb shelters, stocking up on food and water,' Mr. Lapid said by phone from Eliav, a small town near Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem. 'Not our peace-seeking nation.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences",

Israel's military, with the help of the United States, Britain and Jordan, shot down nearly all of the drones and missiles that Iran fired on Saturday, in what was believed to be the first direct Iranian attack on Israel after years of a shadow war. Life largely returned to normal in Israel on Sunday, and there were indications that the military would not seek to immediately retaliate against Iran, even as tensions remained high in the region. Iranian officials also appeared to signal that its operation against Israel was over. Israel's war cabinet concluded a meeting on Sunday evening without deciding how to respond to Iran's assault, according to an official briefed on the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks more freely. By nightfall, the military had yet to detail possible options, the official said.\nIn public, Israeli ministers appeared divided over how to respond. Benny Gantz, a centrist minister and one of three voting members of the war cabinet, said that Israel should exact a price from Iran, but only 'in a way and at a time that suits us.' Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right minister, then criticized Mr. Gantz for his perceived moderation, arguing that Israel should deter Iran by going 'crazy.'\nThe Biden administration is advising Israel that it does not necessarily need to fire back at Iran, with U.S. officials saying that Israel had proved its ability to protect itself.\nIranian officials issued a series of statements that appeared designed to keep tensions from escalating further. Iran's foreign minister said that Tehran 'has no intention of continuing defensive operations, but if necessary it will not hesitate to protect its legitimate interests against any new aggression.'

Israeli military analysts are divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza. Credit...Within moments of Israel and its allies shooting down a fusillade of Iranian missiles and drones this weekend, many began wondering what the latest exchange between Israel and Iran would mean for the war in the Gaza Strip. The Iranian attack was retaliation for what was widely believed to be an Israeli strike this month on an embassy building in Damascus that killed seven Iranian officials, including three top commanders in Iran's armed forces. But it occurred against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel is battling Hamas, a militant group funded and armed by Iran. Israeli military analysts were divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza, now in its sixth month. The next fulcrum in that war could hinge on whether Israel decides to pursue Hamas in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have fled amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis. Some analysts argued that the implications for Gaza would depend on whether Israel responded with a major counterattack against Iran. Others contended that Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip would be unaffected. Shlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general and a former director of the Israeli military's strategic planning division, said that if Israel responds with substantial force to the Iranian attack, it could spark a multifront war that would compel the Israeli leadership to move its attention away from Gaza. In the case of a significant regional conflagration, General Brom said, Israel might choose to delay its plans to invade Rafah, which Israeli officials describe as the last Hamas stronghold. 'It's not comfortable for us to have simultaneous, high-intensity wars in multiple theaters,' General Brom added. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to send ground forces into Rafah, despite international pressure to back off the operation. On Sunday, an Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that the Iranian attack would have no effect on the military's plan to invade Rafah. A large-scale direct confrontation with Iran could potentially bring the war in Gaza to a close, General Brom said. But for the war to end in such a way, it would require a broader cease-fire that encompassed several parties, including Israel, Iran and the Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. 'There's an idea that in order to resolve a crisis, the situation first needs to become worse,' he said, explaining that an escalation followed by a comprehensive cease-fire with Iran might incline that country to push its regional proxies to stop fighting with Israel. While the members of Israel's war cabinet did not issue a formal statement after meeting on Sunday, a separate Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, indicated that the country would respond to the Iranian assault — although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how. Other military experts, however, dismissed the link between the Iranian attack and the war in Gaza. 'There's no connection at all,' said Amos Gilead, a retired major general who served in Israeli military intelligence. General Gilead said that Israel's army had enough resources to fight against Iran and continue to wage war against Hamas in Gaza. Others analysts made a similar point, arguing that the resources needed to fight Iran were different from those needed in Gaza. Israel needs fighter jets and air defense systems to counter Iran, they said. In contrast, they added, the army mainly requires ground troops, drones, and attack helicopters to fight Hamas in Gaza. 'There's no real tension between these two things,' said Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former head of Israel's National Security Council. Still, General Eiland said that the success of the coalition that repelled the Iranian attack, which included the United States, Britain and Jordan, could inspire Israel to take advantage of the momentum to overcome its declining status internationally by ending the war in Gaza. Though the United States, Israel's closest ally, has broadly supported Israel's decision to go to war in Gaza, it has increasingly signaled its displeasure over the mounting death toll and warned against a major ground assault in Rafah. The support the United States provided Israel on Sunday in shooting down Iranian drones and missiles could give it more leverage over its Israeli counterparts. While General Eiland said such an outcome could help Israel develop good will in the international community and contribute to reaching a solution to end the war in Gaza and skirmishes with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, he was doubtful that Mr. Netanyahu would purse such a path. 'He says he wants to achieve ‘total victory' in Gaza and conquer Rafah, a process that could last two or three months,' he said, referring to the prime minister. 'It's clear Netanyahu has a different mind-set and priorities.' Aaron Boxerman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

Credit... Yuki Iwamura/Associated Press The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, with diplomats urging restraint by all parties to prevent conflict in the region from escalating. The brazen attack this weekend, when Iran launched a barrage of drones and missiles in retaliation for Israel's attacking its embassy compound in Syria earlier in the month, was the first time Iran had launched open attacks against Israel from its soil. The attack has unnerved a region already roiling in conflict, raising concerns among diplomats and U.N. officials that a new, potentially wide and destructive war could spark if both sides don't stand down. António Guterres, the Secretary General of the U.N., told the Council that it was 'time to step back from the brink,' and that its members, as well as the United Nations at large, had the collective responsibility 'to actively engage all parties concerned to prevent further escalation.' The meeting on Sunday was convened at the request of Israel. The Council has not collectively issued a statement condemning Iran's attack, and it has also not issued a statement condemning Israel's attack on Iran's embassy in Damascus that killed several senior commanders. All 15 members of the Council must reach a consensus for a statement to be issued and none was reached on both issues. The Security Council is one of the few venues where adversaries engaged in conflict come face to face and sit in the same chamber. On Sunday, both Israel and Iran's ambassadors were present and delivered fiery comments about the other's country, blaming each other for actions they both called terrorism. Gilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador, said Iran's attack had 'crossed every red line' and Israel reserved the right to retaliate. Mr. Erdan called for the Council to take severe action against Iran, including 'crippling' sanctions and statements of condemnation. 'The fact that Israel's air defense proved to be superior does not change the brutality of Iran's attack,' he said. Iran's ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, said his country had an 'inherent right to self-defense' after Israel's attack on its diplomatic compound. Mr. Iravani said that Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region,' but that if its interests, people or national security came under attack it would 'respond to any such threat or aggressions vigorously and in accordance with international law.' The United States and Iran both said that they do not seek war with one another, but that if one attacks the other's interests, there would be a defensive response. Robert A. Wood, a U.S. representative to the U.N., told the Security Council that the 'U.S. is not seeking escalation, our actions have been defensive in nature,' and said the U.S. goal was to 'de-escalate' and then get back to securing an end to the conflict in Gaza. Mr. Wood said the U.S. planned to bring further action on Iran at the Council and called on the Council to unequivocally condemn Iran's actions. Any resolution against Iran put forth by the U.S. at the Council would likely be vetoed by Russia and China, two of Iran's close allies, who sharply criticized Israel for what they said was reckless violation of international law when it attacked Iran's embassy compound. 'What happened in the night of the 14th of April did not happen in a vacuum,' said Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's ambassador to the U.N. China's ambassador, Dai Bing, called on the Council to 'exercise maximum calm and restraint' and said the implementation of an immediate cease-fire is the 'top priority.' Israel has said that the embassy compound was a legitimate military target because senior commanders from Iran's Quds Forces, the external branch of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, were holding a meeting inside the building.

Shear Reporting from Washington The White House said that President Biden and King Abdullah II of Jordan spoke on Sunday about the Iranian attacks and pledged to stay in contact in the days ahead. Officials said the two men also discussed the situation in Gaza, pledging to increase humanitarian aid and to work to end the conflict as soon as possible.

Ramadan Abed/Reuters As thousands of displaced Palestinians attempted to return to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday, Israeli troops fired at the crowd, forcing people to turn back in panic, according to an emergency worker and two people who tried to make the journey. Wafa, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency, reported that five people were killed and 23 wounded by Israeli gunfire and artillery in the incident on Al-Rashid Street south of Gaza City as a crowd of Gazans headed north to their homes. The circumstances of the deaths could not be confirmed independently, and the Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions about whether its forces opened fire on Palestinian civilians trying to cross to northern Gaza. For months, the Israeli military has barred Palestinians who have been displaced by the war in Gaza from returning to their homes in northern Gaza. It has become a sticking point in negotiations between Israel and Hamas. It was not clear why some Palestinians believed that Israel would not block them from returning on Sunday. But they were making the journey on a day when Iran had launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel. More than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its assault there in October, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health. The assault occurred in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people. On Sunday morning Jamila Ibrahim, 39, said that she began hearing of some Palestinians who left early and managed to get back to the north. She later spoke with friends who were able to return north. But there were very few. Around 10:30 a.m. she and her three children — who are between 10 and 17 — set out, joining other people on the journey. She said there were no official notices from the Israel military, which has occupied large parts of Gaza after it launched a ground invasion, that residents would be allowed to return to their homes. It was just based on word of mouth, as well as people seeing others leaving and being encouraged to join the trek home, she said. 'Some people were scared, they didn't know what fate they were heading to, they didn't know what would happen,' she said. 'Some were happy that they were going to return.' Most people were on foot — carrying what little food they had or their few belongings in bags and luggage — and some paid large sums of money to go by car, trucks or donkey carts, she said. But they all took the same seaside road, heading north toward an Israeli checkpoint that has cut off southern Gaza from the north. 'There was lots of tension, lots of tension among the people, they were scared they could be shot,' she said. Those who tried to cross north in the middle of the night — around 4 a.m. — managed to make it to the north, she said, based on her conversation with friends who crossed successfully. But later that morning, by the time she and other displaced Palestinians tried to follow, Israeli forces opened fire on them, she said. 'Around 12:30 the Israelis started shooting,' she said. Mazen Al-Harazeen, a first responder in Gaza, said Israeli forces fired weapons and he did not know how many had been killed, but he said, 'There was shooting and martyrs.' Early Sunday morning, Avichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces, or I.D.F., wrote on social media that the rumors that the army was allowing residents to return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip were false. 'The I.D.F. will not allow the return of residents,' he added. 'For your safety, do not approach the forces operating there.' Nearly 2 million Gazans have been displaced by the war between Hamas and Israel, now in its sixth month. One of their biggest concerns is when and if they will be allowed to return to their homes, or whether they will be permanently displaced, as previous generations were. Around 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes in 1947 and 1948 during the wars surrounding Israel's establishment as a state. Bilal Shbair contributed reporting.

Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times The hospital waiting room was quiet on Sunday: There was no crowd of relatives, no flood of patients. Israel's air defenses had just fended off a large-scale Iranian attack, with only one serious casualty recorded. But there was no sense that a crisis had been averted outside the pediatric intensive care unit at Soroka Medical Center in southern Israel's city of Beersheba. Instead, tension filled the air until the doors to the ward swung open and a gasping mother stumbled out, her face contorted. Then raw emotion quickly took its place as she crumbled into a chair, crying. While Israel suffered little in the way of significant damage overnight, this one family was dealt a devastating blow. Amina al-Hasoni, 7, was clinging to life — the sole serious casualty of the Iranian barrage. And were it not for systemic inequities in Israel, her relatives said, maybe she too could have been spared. There are roughly 300,000 Arab Bedouins in the Negev desert. About a quarter of them live in villages that are not recognized by Israeli officials. Without state recognition, those communities have long suffered from a lack of planning and basic services like running water, sewers and electricity. And few have access to bomb shelters, despite repeated requests to the state. The Hasoni family lives in one such community, sharing a hilltop in the Negev village of al-Fur'ah with a plot of disconnected houses. When rocket warning sirens went off on Saturday night, Amina's uncle Ismail said he felt stuck — there was nowhere to go. Booms overhead signaled air defenses intercepting missiles before there was a big explosion. Then he heard a woman screaming — his sister — and 'I started running,' he said. Ismail, 38, found his sister outside her house holding Amina, who was bleeding from the head. Her family had decided to flee the rockets, running out the front door. But Amina, who slept in a back room with pink walls covered in painted butterflies, didn't make it. A missile fragment ripped through the home's thin metal roof, shearing a hole with sharp metallic edges. It made impact just in front of the door — which is where Amina was knocked unconscious. 'I think it hit her while she was running away,' Ismail said. He said he took the injured Amina from his sister and lifted the girl into his own arms. Ismail then tracked down a car that raced her toward the hospital, more than 40 minutes away on a rutted, winding road that fades out in some places, with camels crossing in others. Only then, with Amina on her way, did he go inside the house, where he said he saw a large, black piece of shrapnel about the size of a pretzel jar. And 'there was blood,' he said, a puddle that had turned into a stream across the tile floor, to the front door. By Sunday afternoon, the orange patterned tiles had been cleaned. None of the dozen or so relatives there could say who had done it, only that 'it was bad for the children to see' all the blood. But Ismail hasn't gone back inside. 'It's difficult,' he said, his jeans and boots still spattered with blood. Not far from where he sat, a pink Minnie Mouse blanket and a small black-and-white girl's dress hung on a family clothesline. 'We could have built shelters here,' Ismail added. He dismissed any suggestions that what happened to Amina was bad luck. 'It's part of a policy,' he said. 'We can't do anything.' The missile fragment that tore into Amina's home was one of more than 150 collected in the area on Sunday by police bomb disposal teams, and the family said officers had taken away the piece that hit their home. The teams combed the desert for hours, searching for debris and carting away huge hunks of twisted metal — efforts repeated across Israel. The Hasoni home is not far from a military base, Nevatim, that was reportedly a target of the Iranian assault and that Israeli officials said was lightly damaged. That is little consolation to Amina's father, Muhammad, who spent the morning at the hospital taking turns at her bedside. He didn't say much to her, he said, and just repeated her name. Amina — the youngest of his 14 children — 'likes to laugh and have fun all the time,' said Muhammad, 49. She's a good student with a 'strong personality,' he added, who doesn't always listen to instructions. And she loves to draw. He called Iran's actions 'inhumane.' 'May God demolish them,' he said, without hesitation.

Tomer Neuberg/Associated Press After convening a virtual meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, Group of 7 leaders adopted a joint declaration that reaffirmed their 'full solidarity and support to Israel' and accused Iran of having risked 'provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation' that must be avoided. Iran's attack, which appeared to have been mostly intercepted by Israel and its allies, was carried out in retaliation for Israeli attacks on an Iranian Embassy building in Syria earlier this month. Iranian leaders have signaled that their retaliation is over unless they are attacked again. The joint declaration from the leaders of G7 nations — Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, as well as the European Union — demanded that 'Iran and its proxies cease their attacks.' The leaders said they were ready 'to take further measures now and in response to further destabilizing initiatives.' Hoping to head off Israel from further escalating the conflict, President Biden privately advised Israel against firing back on Iran, U.S. officials said on Sunday. It was not yet clear how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his government would respond. Leaders of the European Union have publicly urged restraint from both countries as they, too, condemned Iran's actions. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, called the attack 'blatant and unjustifiable,' adding that 'all actors must now refrain from further escalation.' Charles Michel, president of the European Council, said that the condemnation from G7 leaders was unanimous and that 'all parties must exercise restraint.' 'Ending the crisis in Gaza as soon as possible, notably through an immediate cease-fire, will make a difference,' Mr. Michel added.

It was not immediately clear what the group had decided about possibly responding to Iran's overnight strikes. Demonstrators gather at Palestine Square in Tehran on Sunday. Credit... Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times Many Iranians stayed glued to their television screens and phones Saturday night, anxiously following updates as their country launched a military attack on Israel and fearing a wider war that would only add to the country's current economic upheaval. In Tehran and several other big cities, lines of cars stretched a mile or more outside gas stations in the middle of the night. Some parents kept their children home from school on Sunday. Tehran's airport closed down, and will remain that way until at least Monday morning. Iranians living inside the country said in interviews that they were worried the confrontation with Israel would spiral out of control and hoped both sides would avoid escalating the conflict. Soheil, a 37-year-old engineer in Isfahan who, like several other Iranians, asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution, said all he and his colleagues could talk about at work on Sunday was the prospect of a broader conflict. 'I'm afraid of war,' he said. 'It will have a great impact on our daily lives, especially on the economy and the price of dollar, and the anxiety will affect our mental health.' Since a strike two weeks ago on the Iranian Embassy complex in Syria that killed three top military commanders, Iran's currency, the rial, has fallen sharply against the U.S. dollar, shrinking purchasing power as Iran's leaders vowed to respond. Nafiseh, a 36-year-old high school teacher in Tehran, said that many of her students did not attend school on Sunday because parents were worried about counterattacks from Israel. 'It's all everyone is talking about, from teenagers to teachers and family members, it's all about the war and attacks,' she said. Supporters of the government hailed the attacks as Iran's showcasing its military might to defend itself on Saturday, with several hundred gathering in Tehran's Palestine Square to celebrate with fireworks and chants of 'Death to Israel.' A large mural on the square depicted Iranian missiles with a message written in Farsi and Hebrew that read, 'Next time the slap will be harder.' On Sunday night, a crowd formed again in the square, carrying signs and chanting anti-Israel slogans. Others took to social media to say they would fight for their country unconditionally if Iran were to go to war. 'When a foreign enemy is involved, honor means standing with our country even at the cost of our lives,' Reza Rashidpour, a civil engineer, wrote on social media. 'Long live Iran, long live soldiers of Iran.' But critics of the government denounced the attacks, seeing them as a misadventure that risks harming ordinary Iranians. Many Iranians oppose government policies that include funding, arming and training groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanese armed group that has increasingly traded fire with Israel since the Oct. 7 attacks that set off the current fighting in Gaza. In protests against the government over the past few years a recurring chant has been, 'No to Gaza, no to Lebanon, my life for Iran.' Ali, a 53-year-old veteran of the Iran-Iraq war who lives in Kerman, said the existence of the Islamic Republic depends on 'crisis.' 'Now they are exploiting the war and the crisis to survive,' he said. April 14, 2024, 4:08 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 4:08 p.m. ET Gaya Gupta Reporting from New York The United Nations Security Council has begun its emergency meeting to address Iran's attacks on Israel. 'The people of the region are confronting a real danger of a devastating, full-scale conflict,' the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, said in opening remarks. 'Now is the time to defuse and deescalate. Now is the time for maximum restraint.' April 14, 2024, 4:36 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 4:36 p.m. ET For the Security Council to issue any statement condemning Iran's actions all of its 15 members would have to agree — a prospect that appears unlikely, given its recent lack of consensus over issuing condemnation statements on Hamas's Oct. 7 attacks and the attack on the Iranian Embassy compound in Syria, which prompted Iran's strikes.

Hannah Mckay/Reuters After many Israelis spent a long night huddled in bomb shelters, life crept back toward calm on Sunday, even as the people of Israel waited tensely to see how their government would respond to the Iranian strikes that set off rarely heard sirens in Jerusalem. Jerusalem is targeted much less frequently than border communities or the coastal metropolis of Tel Aviv, but during the assault loud booms resounded in the skies, where missiles and interceptors wove around one another like fireflies. In areas of Jerusalem with a mostly Jewish population, many crowded into public bomb shelters, some wearing pajamas and lugging sleeping bags. 'There were more people there than usual,' said Zev Palatnik, 33, who spent some of the night in his building's bomb shelter alongside his neighbors. 'There's a sense that the rockets from Iran are more sophisticated than the ones from Gaza,' he said, adding that there was a higher level of anxiety as a result. But on Sunday, a relatively steady amount of foot traffic flowed in downtown Jerusalem as Israelis returned to work. Ron Cohen, a 37-year-old engineer, said he had hoped that the Israeli government would immediately strike back at Iran, but he did not expect a significant Israeli response. 'Not much, maybe a few small things,' he said. 'Our government knows how to defend, but not how to attack.' For the Israelis among the tens of thousands forced to flee communities along the borders with Gaza and Lebanon, the assault compounded six exhausting months of war. Many expressed uncertainty over the best way for the government to respond. Gidi Lapid, who left his home in Metula, near the border with Lebanon, with his family at the beginning of the war, said Israel might be able to show strength through restrained action. But at the same time, Iranians 'should be the ones in existential dread, in bomb shelters, stocking up on food and water,' Mr. Lapid said by phone from Eliav, a small town near Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem. 'Not our peace-seeking nation.'

Although Hezbollah, Iran's most powerful regional proxy, launched rockets into the Golan Heights amid the overnight attack, it largely remained on the sidelines. April 14, 2024, 2:48 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 2:48 p.m. ET Adam Sella Reporting from Tel Aviv With much attention shifted to Iran, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an Israeli grass-roots citizens' group, reiterated its call for a deal to release the approximately 100 hostages held in Gaza. The group said in a statement that the fear and uncertainty felt by Israelis during Iran's overnight strike 'pale in comparison to the terror, dread, despair, loneliness, cold, physical and mental torment' experienced by the hostages. April 14, 2024, 2:32 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 2:32 p.m. ET Eric Schmitt Reporting from Washington American officials said U.S. fighter jets shot down more than 70 exploding drones in the attack Saturday, while two Navy warships in the eastern Mediterranean destroyed between four and six ballistic missiles and an Army Patriot battery in Iraq knocked down at least one missile that passed overhead. The more than 300 drones and missiles Iran launched was on the high end of what U.S. analysts had expected, one official said.

Kenny Holston/The New York Times Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday after Iran's overnight attack on Israel that the House would vote in the coming days on aid for Israel, and he suggested that aid for Ukraine could be included in the legislation. 'House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing with Israel,' Mr. Johnson said on Fox News, noting that he had previously advanced two aid bills to help the U.S. ally. 'We're going to try again this week, and the details of that package are being put together. Right now, we're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues.' U.S. funding for both Israel and Ukraine has languished in Congress; Mr. Johnson initially refused to take up a $95 billion aid package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan passed by the Senate, and the Senate refused to take up a House Republican proposal that conditioned aid to Israel on domestic spending cuts. In recent weeks, Mr. Johnson has repeatedly vowed to ensure that the House moves to assist Ukraine. He has been searching for a way to structure a foreign aid package that could secure a critical mass of support amid stiff Republican resistance to sending aid to Kyiv and mounting opposition among Democrats to unfettered military aid for Israel. But the attacks from Iran have ratcheted up the pressure on Mr. Johnson to bring some kind of package to the floor this week, potentially forcing him to make a decision he has been agonizing over for weeks. He left it unclear on Sunday whether the legislation he said the House would advance this week would also include aid for Ukraine. Mr. Johnson said he believed that some proposals around Ukraine aid enjoyed broad support among House Republicans. He noted that he met with former President Donald J. Trump on Friday at his estate in Florida and that Mr. Trump had been supportive of conditioning the aid as a loan. 'I think these are ideas that I think can get consensus, and that's what we've been working through,' Mr. Johnson said. 'We'll send our package. We'll put something together and send it to the Senate and get these obligations completed.' Before the attacks in Israel over the weekend, Mr. Johnson had privately floated bringing up the $95 billion spending package for Ukraine and Israel passed by the Senate in February — and moving it through the House in tandem with a second bill containing policies endorsed by the conservative wing of his party. That plan envisioned two consecutive votes — one on the Senate-passed bill and another on a package of sweeteners geared toward appeasing Republicans who otherwise would be infuriated by Mr. Johnson's decision to push through a bipartisan aid package for Ukraine. Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Sunday that the two conflicts were tied together, and that he hoped they would be addressed together. 'What happened in Israel last night happens in Ukraine every night,' he said on CBS's 'Face The Nation.' Mr. McCaul said that he had previously secured a 'commitment' from Mr. Johnson that a broad national security bill would be brought to the House floor for a vote, but that the timing was unclear. 'My preference,' he said, 'is this week.' Minho Kim contributed reporting.

Iranian officials also appeared to signal that its operation against Israel was over.\nIsrael's war cabinet concluded a meeting on Sunday evening without deciding how to respond to Iran's assault, according to an official briefed on the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks more freely. By nightfall, the military had yet to detail possible options, the official said.\nIn public, Israeli ministers appeared divided over how to respond. Benny Gantz, a centrist minister and one of three voting members of the war cabinet, said that Israel should exact a price from Iran, but only 'in a way and at a time that suits us.'

Israeli military analysts are divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza. Credit...Within moments of Israel and its allies shooting down a fusillade of Iranian missiles and drones this weekend, many began wondering what the latest exchange between Israel and Iran would mean for the war in the Gaza Strip.\nThe Iranian attack was retaliation for what was widely believed to be an Israeli strike this month on an embassy building in Damascus that killed seven Iranian officials, including three top commanders in Iran's armed forces. But it occurred against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel is battling Hamas, a militant group funded and armed by Iran.\nIsraeli military analysts were divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza, now in its sixth month. The next fulcrum in that war could hinge on whether Israel decides to pursue Hamas in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have fled amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis.\nSome analysts argued that the implications for Gaza would depend on whether Israel responded with a major counterattack against Iran. Others contended that Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip would be unaffected.\nShlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general and a former director of the Israeli military's strategic planning division, said that if Israel responds with substantial force to the Iranian attack, it could spark a multifront war that would compel the Israeli leadership to move its attention away from Gaza.\nIn the case of a significant regional conflagration, General Brom said, Israel might choose to delay its plans to invade Rafah, which Israeli officials describe as the last Hamas stronghold.\n'It's not comfortable for us to have simultaneous, high-intensity wars in multiple theaters,' General Brom added.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to send ground forces into Rafah, despite international pressure to back off the operation. On Sunday, an Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that the Iranian attack would have no effect on the military's plan to invade Rafah.\nA large-scale direct confrontation with Iran could potentially bring the war in Gaza to a close, General Brom said. But for the war to end in such a way, it would require a broader cease-fire that encompassed several parties, including Israel, Iran and the Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah.\n'There's an idea that in order to resolve a crisis, the situation first needs to become worse,' he said, explaining that an escalation followed by a comprehensive cease-fire with Iran might incline that country to push its regional proxies to stop fighting with Israel.\nWhile the members of Israel's war cabinet did not issue a formal statement after meeting on Sunday, a separate Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, indicated that the country would respond to the Iranian assault — although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how.\nOther military experts, however, dismissed the link between the Iranian attack and the war in Gaza.\n'There's no connection at all,' said Amos Gilead, a retired major general who served in Israeli military intelligence.\nGeneral Gilead said that Israel's army had enough resources to fight against Iran and continue to wage war against Hamas in Gaza.\nOthers analysts made a similar point, arguing that the resources needed to fight Iran were different from those needed in Gaza. Israel needs fighter jets and air defense systems to counter Iran, they said. In contrast, they added, the army mainly requires ground troops, drones, and attack helicopters to fight Hamas in Gaza.\n'There's no real tension between these two things,' said Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former head of Israel's National Security Council.\nStill, General Eiland said that the success of the coalition that repelled the Iranian attack, which included the United States, Britain and Jordan, could inspire Israel to take advantage of the momentum to overcome its declining status internationally by ending the war in Gaza.\nThough the United States, Israel's closest ally, has broadly supported Israel's decision to go to war in Gaza, it has increasingly signaled its displeasure over the mounting death toll and warned against a major ground assault in Rafah. The support the United States provided Israel on Sunday in shooting down Iranian drones and missiles could give it more leverage over its Israeli counterparts.\nWhile General Eiland said such an outcome could help Israel develop good will in the international community and contribute to reaching a solution to end the war in Gaza and skirmishes with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, he was doubtful that Mr. Netanyahu would purse such a path.\n'He says he wants to achieve ‘total victory' in Gaza and conquer Rafah, a process that could last two or three months,' he said, referring to the prime minister. 'It's clear Netanyahu has a different mind-set and priorities.'\nAaron Boxerman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.\nWhere air defense systems were seen intercepting missiles or drones Damage or other evidence of attack visible\nWhere air defense systems were seen intercepting missiles or drones Damage or other evidence of attack visible United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addresses the United Nations Security Council during an emergency meeting at U.N. headquarters on Sunday. Credit... Yuki Iwamura/Associated Press The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, with diplomats urging restraint by all parties to prevent conflict in the region from escalating.\nThe brazen attack this weekend, when Iran launched a barrage of drones and missiles in retaliation for Israel's attacking its embassy compound in Syria earlier in the month, was the first time Iran had launched open attacks against Israel from its soil. The attack has unnerved a region already roiling in conflict, raising concerns among diplomats and U.N. officials that a new, potentially wide and destructive war could spark if both sides don't stand down.\nAntónio Guterres, the Secretary General of the U.N., told the Council that it was 'time to step back from the brink,' and that its members, as well as the United Nations at large, had the collective responsibility 'to actively engage all parties concerned to prevent further escalation.'\nThe meeting on Sunday was convened at the request of Israel. The Council has not collectively issued a statement condemning Iran's attack, and it has also not issued a statement condemning Israel's attack on Iran's embassy in Damascus that killed several senior commanders. All 15 members of the Council must reach a consensus for a statement to be issued and none was reached on both issues.\nThe Security Council is one of the few venues where adversaries engaged in conflict come face to face and sit in the same chamber. On Sunday, both Israel and Iran's ambassadors were present and delivered fiery comments about the other's country, blaming each other for actions they both called terrorism.\nGilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador, said Iran's attack had 'crossed every red line' and Israel reserved the right to retaliate. Mr. Erdan called for the Council to take severe action against Iran, including 'crippling' sanctions and statements of condemnation.\n'The fact that Israel's air defense proved to be superior does not change the brutality of Iran's attack,' he said.\nIran's ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, said his country had an 'inherent right to self-defense' after Israel's attack on its diplomatic compound. Mr. Iravani said that Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region,' but that if its interests, people or national security came under attack it would 'respond to any such threat or aggressions vigorously and in accordance with international law.'\nThe United States and Iran both said that they do not seek war with one another, but that if one attacks the other's interests, there would be a defensive response.\nRobert A. Wood, a U.S. representative to the U.N., told the Security Council that the 'U.S. is not seeking escalation, our actions have been defensive in nature,' and said the U.S. goal was to 'de-escalate' and then get back to securing an end to the conflict in Gaza. Mr. Wood said the U.S. planned to bring further action on Iran at the Council and called on the Council to unequivocally condemn Iran's actions.\nAny resolution against Iran put forth by the U.S. at the Council would likely be vetoed by Russia and China, two of Iran's close allies, who sharply criticized Israel for what they said was reckless violation of international law when it attacked Iran's embassy compound.\n'What happened in the night of the 14th of April did not happen in a vacuum,' said Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's ambassador to the U.N.\nChina's ambassador, Dai Bing, called on the Council to 'exercise maximum calm and restraint' and said the implementation of an immediate cease-fire is the 'top priority.'\nIsrael has said that the embassy compound was a legitimate military target because senior commanders from Iran's Quds Forces, the external branch of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, were holding a meeting inside the building.\nApril 14, 2024, 7:11 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 7:11 p.m. ET Michael D.

Ramadan Abed/Reuters As thousands of displaced Palestinians attempted to return to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday, Israeli troops fired at the crowd, forcing people to turn back in panic, according to an emergency worker and two people who tried to make the journey.\nWafa, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency, reported that five people were killed and 23 wounded by Israeli gunfire and artillery in the incident on Al-Rashid Street south of Gaza City as a crowd of Gazans headed north to their homes.\nThe circumstances of the deaths could not be confirmed independently, and the Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions about whether its forces opened fire on Palestinian civilians trying to cross to northern Gaza.\nFor months, the Israeli military has barred Palestinians who have been displaced by the war in Gaza from returning to their homes in northern Gaza. It has become a sticking point in negotiations between Israel and Hamas.\nIt was not clear why some Palestinians believed that Israel would not block them from returning on Sunday. But they were making the journey on a day when Iran had launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel.\nMore than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its assault there in October, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health. The assault occurred in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people.\nOn Sunday morning Jamila Ibrahim, 39, said that she began hearing of some Palestinians who left early and managed to get back to the north. She later spoke with friends who were able to return north. But there were very few.\nAround 10:30 a.m. she and her three children — who are between 10 and 17 — set out, joining other people on the journey.\nShe said there were no official notices from the Israel military, which has occupied large parts of Gaza after it launched a ground invasion, that residents would be allowed to return to their homes. It was just based on word of mouth, as well as people seeing others leaving and being encouraged to join the trek home, she said.\n'Some people were scared, they didn't know what fate they were heading to, they didn't know what would happen,' she said. 'Some were happy that they were going to return.'\nMost people were on foot — carrying what little food they had or their few belongings in bags and luggage — and some paid large sums of money to go by car, trucks or donkey carts, she said. But they all took the same seaside road, heading north toward an Israeli checkpoint that has cut off southern Gaza from the north.\n'There was lots of tension, lots of tension among the people, they were scared they could be shot,' she said.\nThose who tried to cross north in the middle of the night — around 4 a.m. — managed to make it to the north, she said, based on her conversation with friends who crossed successfully.\nBut later that morning, by the time she and other displaced Palestinians tried to follow, Israeli forces opened fire on them, she said.\n'Around 12:30 the Israelis started shooting,' she said.\nMazen Al-Harazeen, a first responder in Gaza, said Israeli forces fired weapons and he did not know how many had been killed, but he said, 'There was shooting and martyrs.'\nEarly Sunday morning, Avichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces, or I.D.F., wrote on social media that the rumors that the army was allowing residents to return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip were false.\n'The I.D.F. will not allow the return of residents,' he added. 'For your safety, do not approach the forces operating there.'\nNearly 2 million Gazans have been displaced by the war between Hamas and Israel, now in its sixth month. One of their biggest concerns is when and if they will be allowed to return to their homes, or whether they will be permanently displaced, as previous generations were.\nAround 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes in 1947 and 1948 during the wars surrounding Israel's establishment as a state.\nBilal Shbair contributed reporting.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:49 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:49 p.m. ET Aaron Boxerman\nAaron Boxerman Reporting from Jerusalem While Israel's war cabinet members didn't issue a formal statement after the meeting, an Israeli official familiar with the discussions indicated that Israel would undoubtedly respond — although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how.

Credit... Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times The hospital waiting room was quiet on Sunday: There was no crowd of relatives, no flood of patients. Israel's air defenses had just fended off a large-scale Iranian attack, with only one serious casualty recorded.\nBut there was no sense that a crisis had been averted outside the pediatric intensive care unit at Soroka Medical Center in southern Israel's city of Beersheba. Instead, tension filled the air until the doors to the ward swung open and a gasping mother stumbled out, her face contorted. Then raw emotion quickly took its place as she crumbled into a chair, crying.\nWhile Israel suffered little in the way of significant damage overnight, this one family was dealt a devastating blow. Amina al-Hasoni, 7, was clinging to life — the sole serious casualty of the Iranian barrage. And were it not for systemic inequities in Israel, her relatives said, maybe she too could have been spared.\nThere are roughly 300,000 Arab Bedouins in the Negev desert. About a quarter of them live in villages that are not recognized by Israeli officials. Without state recognition, those communities have long suffered from a lack of planning and basic services like running water, sewers and electricity. And few have access to bomb shelters, despite repeated requests to the state.\nThe Hasoni family lives in one such community, sharing a hilltop in the Negev village of al-Fur'ah with a plot of disconnected houses. When rocket warning sirens went off on Saturday night, Amina's uncle Ismail said he felt stuck — there was nowhere to go.\nBooms overhead signaled air defenses intercepting missiles before there was a big explosion. Then he heard a woman screaming — his sister — and 'I started running,' he said.\nIsmail, 38, found his sister outside her house holding Amina, who was bleeding from the head. Her family had decided to flee the rockets, running out the front door. But Amina, who slept in a back room with pink walls covered in painted butterflies, didn't make it.\nA missile fragment ripped through the home's thin metal roof, shearing a hole with sharp metallic edges. It made impact just in front of the door — which is where Amina was knocked unconscious.\n'I think it hit her while she was running away,' Ismail said.\nHe said he took the injured Amina from his sister and lifted the girl into his own arms. Ismail then tracked down a car that raced her toward the hospital, more than 40 minutes away on a rutted, winding road that fades out in some places, with camels crossing in others.\nOnly then, with Amina on her way, did he go inside the house, where he said he saw a large, black piece of shrapnel about the size of a pretzel jar. And 'there was blood,' he said, a puddle that had turned into a stream across the tile floor, to the front door.\nBy Sunday afternoon, the orange patterned tiles had been cleaned. None of the dozen or so relatives there could say who had done it, only that 'it was bad for the children to see' all the blood. But Ismail hasn't gone back inside.\n'It's difficult,' he said, his jeans and boots still spattered with blood. Not far from where he sat, a pink Minnie Mouse blanket and a small black-and-white girl's dress hung on a family clothesline.\n'We could have built shelters here,' Ismail added.\nHe dismissed any suggestions that what happened to Amina was bad luck.\n'It's part of a policy,' he said. 'We can't do anything.'\nThe missile fragment that tore into Amina's home was one of more than 150 collected in the area on Sunday by police bomb disposal teams, and the family said officers had taken away the piece that hit their home. The teams combed the desert for hours, searching for debris and carting away huge hunks of twisted metal — efforts repeated across Israel.\nThe Hasoni home is not far from a military base, Nevatim, that was reportedly a target of the Iranian assault and that Israeli officials said was lightly damaged.\nThat is little consolation to Amina's father, Muhammad, who spent the morning at the hospital taking turns at her bedside. He didn't say much to her, he said, and just repeated her name.\nAmina — the youngest of his 14 children — 'likes to laugh and have fun all the time,' said Muhammad, 49. She's a good student with a 'strong personality,' he added, who doesn't always listen to instructions. And she loves to draw.\nHe called Iran's actions 'inhumane.'\n'May God demolish them,' he said, without hesitation.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET Iran's ambassador to the U.N., Amir Saeid Iravani, addressed the Council after his Israeli counterpart and defended his country's actions as the 'inherent right to self-defense' in response to the attack on its diplomatic compound in Syria two weeks ago.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET Iravani said Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region' and has 'no intention' of engaging in conflict with the United States, but warned that it would respond proportionately if Israel or the U.S. military were to attack Iran or its interests.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:26 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:26 p.m. ET Israel's U.N. ambassador, Gilad Erdan, who had requested the emergency meeting of the Security Council, assailed Iran and its proxies, saying Iran had crossed every red line in its attack and that Israel reserved the right to retaliate.

Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times Many Iranians stayed glued to their television screens and phones Saturday night, anxiously following updates as their country launched a military attack on Israel and fearing a wider war that would only add to the country's current economic upheaval.\nIn Tehran and several other big cities, lines of cars stretched a mile or more outside gas stations in the middle of the night. Some parents kept their children home from school on Sunday. Tehran's airport closed down, and will remain that way until at least Monday morning.\nIranians living inside the country said in interviews that they were worried the confrontation with Israel would spiral out of control and hoped both sides would avoid escalating the conflict.\nSoheil, a 37-year-old engineer in Isfahan who, like several other Iranians, asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution, said all he and his colleagues could talk about at work on Sunday was the prospect of a broader conflict.\n'I'm afraid of war,' he said. 'It will have a great impact on our daily lives, especially on the economy and the price of dollar, and the anxiety will affect our mental health.'\nSince a strike two weeks ago on the Iranian Embassy complex in Syria that killed three top military commanders, Iran's currency, the rial, has fallen sharply against the U.S. dollar, shrinking purchasing power as Iran's leaders vowed to respond.\nNafiseh, a 36-year-old high school teacher in Tehran, said that many of her students did not attend school on Sunday because parents were worried about counterattacks from Israel. 'It's all everyone is talking about, from teenagers to teachers and family members, it's all about the war and attacks,' she said.\nSupporters of the government hailed the attacks as Iran's showcasing its military might to defend itself on Saturday, with several hundred gathering in Tehran's Palestine Square to celebrate with fireworks and chants of 'Death to Israel.' A large mural on the square depicted Iranian missiles with a message written in Farsi and Hebrew that read, 'Next time the slap will be harder.' On Sunday night, a crowd formed again in the square, carrying signs and chanting anti-Israel slogans.\nOthers took to social media to say they would fight for their country unconditionally if Iran were to go to war.\n'When a foreign enemy is involved, honor means standing with our country even at the cost of our lives,' Reza Rashidpour, a civil engineer, wrote on social media. 'Long live Iran, long live soldiers of Iran.'\nBut critics of the government denounced the attacks, seeing them as a misadventure that risks harming ordinary Iranians.\nMany Iranians oppose government policies that include funding, arming and training groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanese armed group that has increasingly traded fire with Israel since the Oct. 7 attacks that set off the current fighting in Gaza. In protests against the government over the past few years a recurring chant has been, 'No to Gaza, no to Lebanon, my life for Iran.'\nAli, a 53-year-old veteran of the Iran-Iraq war who lives in Kerman, said the existence of the Islamic Republic depends on 'crisis.'\n'Now they are exploiting the war and the crisis to survive,' he said.\nApril 14, 2024, 4:08 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 4:08 p.m. ET Gaya Gupta\nGaya Gupta Reporting from New York The United Nations Security Council has begun its emergency meeting to address Iran's attacks on Israel.

Hannah Mckay/Reuters After many Israelis spent a long night huddled in bomb shelters, life crept back toward calm on Sunday, even as the people of Israel waited tensely to see how their government would respond to the Iranian strikes that set off rarely heard sirens in Jerusalem.\nJerusalem is targeted much less frequently than border communities or the coastal metropolis of Tel Aviv, but during the assault loud booms resounded in the skies, where missiles and interceptors wove around one another like fireflies.\nIn areas of Jerusalem with a mostly Jewish population, many crowded into public bomb shelters, some wearing pajamas and lugging sleeping bags.\n'There were more people there than usual,' said Zev Palatnik, 33, who spent some of the night in his building's bomb shelter alongside his neighbors. 'There's a sense that the rockets from Iran are more sophisticated than the ones from Gaza,' he said, adding that there was a higher level of anxiety as a result.\nBut on Sunday, a relatively steady amount of foot traffic flowed in downtown Jerusalem as Israelis returned to work. Ron Cohen, a 37-year-old engineer, said he had hoped that the Israeli government would immediately strike back at Iran, but he did not expect a significant Israeli response.\n'Not much, maybe a few small things,' he said. 'Our government knows how to defend, but not how to attack.'\nFor the Israelis among the tens of thousands forced to flee communities along the borders with Gaza and Lebanon, the assault compounded six exhausting months of war. Many expressed uncertainty over the best way for the government to respond.\nGidi Lapid, who left his home in Metula, near the border with Lebanon, with his family at the beginning of the war, said Israel might be able to show strength through restrained action.\nBut at the same time, Iranians 'should be the ones in existential dread, in bomb shelters, stocking up on food and water,' Mr. Lapid said by phone from Eliav, a small town near Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem.

Kenny Holston/The New York Times Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday after Iran's overnight attack on Israel that the House would vote in the coming days on aid for Israel, and he suggested that aid for Ukraine could be included in the legislation.\n'House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing with Israel,' Mr. Johnson said on Fox News, noting that he had previously advanced two aid bills to help the U.S. ally. 'We're going to try again this week, and the details of that package are being put together. Right now, we're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues.'\nU.S. funding for both Israel and Ukraine has languished in Congress; Mr. Johnson initially refused to take up a $95 billion aid package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan passed by the Senate, and the Senate refused to take up a House Republican proposal that conditioned aid to Israel on domestic spending cuts.\nIn recent weeks, Mr. Johnson has repeatedly vowed to ensure that the House moves to assist Ukraine. He has been searching for a way to structure a foreign aid package that could secure a critical mass of support amid stiff Republican resistance to sending aid to Kyiv and mounting opposition among Democrats to unfettered military aid for Israel.\nBut the attacks from Iran have ratcheted up the pressure on Mr. Johnson to bring some kind of package to the floor this week, potentially forcing him to make a decision he has been agonizing over for weeks.\nHe left it unclear on Sunday whether the legislation he said the House would advance this week would also include aid for Ukraine.\nMr. Johnson said he believed that some proposals around Ukraine aid enjoyed broad support among House Republicans. He noted that he met with former President Donald J. Trump on Friday at his estate in Florida and that Mr. Trump had been supportive of conditioning the aid as a loan.\n'I think these are ideas that I think can get consensus, and that's what we've been working through,' Mr. Johnson said. 'We'll send our package. We'll put something together and send it to the Senate and get these obligations completed.'\nBefore the attacks in Israel over the weekend, Mr. Johnson had privately floated bringing up the $95 billion spending package for Ukraine and Israel passed by the Senate in February — and moving it through the House in tandem with a second bill containing policies endorsed by the conservative wing of his party. That plan envisioned two consecutive votes — one on the Senate-passed bill and another on a package of sweeteners geared toward appeasing Republicans who otherwise would be infuriated by Mr. Johnson's decision to push through a bipartisan aid package for Ukraine.\nRepresentative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Sunday that the two conflicts were tied together, and that he hoped they would be addressed together. 'What happened in Israel last night happens in Ukraine every night,' he said on CBS's 'Face The Nation.'\nMr. McCaul said that he had previously secured a 'commitment' from Mr. Johnson that a broad national security bill would be brought to the House floor for a vote, but that the timing was unclear.\n'My preference,' he said, 'is this week.'\nMinho Kim contributed reporting.\nApril 14, 2024, 1:02 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 1:02 p.m. ET Adam Sella\nAdam Sella Reporting from Tel Aviv The Israeli military said in a statement that it is calling up 'approximately two reserve brigades for operational activities on the Gaza front.'

Credit... Jim Hollander/EPA, via Shutterstock In a deeply divided Israel, even the dramatic scene above the country's skies on Sunday is open to political interpretation.\nFor supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's display of defensive technology against an Iranian salvo that included hundreds of drones and missiles proves Mr. Netanyahu has long been right to warn about the threat posed by Iran.\nHis opponents are loath to give him any credit, reserving their praise for the air force.\n'Like everything in Israel in recent years, the story is split into two narratives,' said Mazal Mualem, an Israeli political commentator for Al-Monitor, a Middle East news site, and the author of a recent biography of the Israeli leader.\n'The division and polarization in Israeli society prevents people from seeing the full picture,' Ms. Mualem added.\nIran's barrage on Sunday, launched in response to an Israeli attack on an Iranian Embassy building this month in Damascus that killed several high-ranking commanders in Iran's armed forces, came at a perilous time for Mr. Netanyahu.\nAt home, he is an unpopular leader whom many hold responsible for his government's policy and intelligence failures that led to the deadly Hamas-led attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, which prompted Israel to go to war in Gaza. Abroad, he is the focus of international censure over Israel's prosecution of that war, which has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Gazans.\nHow he ultimately emerges from this episode may depend on what happens next.\nMr. Netanyahu now must make a choice. Will he respond to Iran with a forceful counterattack and potentially entangle Israel and other countries in a broader war? Or will he absorb the attack, which gravely injured one 7-year-old girl but otherwise did limited damage, and defer to the coalition that helped defend Israel in the interests of regional stability?\nIsrael's allies have been urging restraint.\n'The question is whether Israel is going to retaliate immediately, or surprise the Iranians in one way or another,' said Efraim Halevy, who served as director of Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, during the latter part of Mr. Netanyahu's first term in the 1990s.\nNo Israeli leader has warned about Iran so consistently as Mr. Netanyahu or, for that matter, has spent so long in office. Israel's longest serving prime minister, he has been in power for about 17 years overall.\nSince his first year in office in 1996, Mr. Netanyahu warned that a nuclear Iran would be catastrophic and that time was running out. For the nearly three decades since, he has been sounding the same alarm.\nIran maintains a network of proxy militias across the region, including in Gaza, which the government funds and supplies with weapons. Some of those militias in Yemen, Syria and Lebanon have battled with Israel, creating distractions for the Israeli government and military amid the war with Hamas.\nBut perhaps more troubling, experts say, is that Iran is closer than ever to obtaining a nuclear weapon. Mr. Netanyahu's backers still credit him with having put Iran's nuclear program on the world agenda then, and they praise him now for investing in the mighty, multilayered air defense system that allowed Israel and its allies, including the United States, to intercept the vast majority of Iranian drones and missiles this weekend before they reached Israel.\nSometimes resorting to gimmicks and antics to draw attention to Iran's nuclear progress, Mr. Netanyahu has in the past made opposing Iran a key part of his global diplomacy. Once, at the United Nations General Assembly he held up a cartoonish drawing of a bomb marked with red lines depicting enrichment levels. Another time, at the Munich Security Conference, he waved around a piece of wreckage from what he said was an Iranian drone sent from Syria and shot down by Israel.\n'Everywhere he went he was talking about it,' recalled Jeremy Issacharoff, a former Israeli ambassador to Germany and for years the Ministry of Foreign Affairs point man coordinating diplomatic efforts on regional security and the Iranian threat.\nAt times, Mr. Netanyahu's campaign against Iran has severely strained Israel's relations with American presidents, though bipartisan U.S. support for Israel has long been considered a strategic asset.\nAround 2012, Mr. Netanyahu infuriated the Obama administration by pushing hard for President Barack Obama to set clear 'red lines' on Iran's nuclear progress that would prompt the United States to undertake a military strike. Before that, the Israeli prime minister was making plans for a unilateral Israeli strike in the face of tough opposition from Washington and public criticism from a string of former Israeli security chiefs. It was never clear if Mr. Netanyahu was bluffing, and the prospect of an imminent strike receded.\nHe further challenged Mr. Obama in 2015 with an impassioned speech to a joint meeting of Congress denouncing what he called a 'bad deal' being negotiated by the United States and other world powers with Iran to curb its nuclear program.\nWhen President Donald J. Trump came to power, Mr. Netanyahu encouraged him to withdraw from the agreement — a move that many Israeli experts have called a dire mistake and a failure of Mr. Netanyahu's Iran policy.\n'Since then, there have been no constraints on the program,' Mr. Issacharoff said, adding, 'It has never been more advanced.'\nBut it was also under Mr. Netanyahu's watch that Israel forged diplomatic relations with more Arab states that are considered part of the moderate, anti-Iranian axis, including the United Arab Emirates.\nRegardless of what comes next, Ms. Mualem, the Netanyahu biographer, said, 'Bibi is still in the game,' referring to him by his nickname. 'He's a central player, and it isn't over, diplomatically or politically. And he plays a long game.'\nMourners on Sunday with the bodies of Palestinians in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip. Credit... Ramadan Abed/Reuters As the world's attention shifted to Iran's attack on Israel, Palestinians in Gaza experienced a relatively calm night for the first time in more than six months but were quickly jolted back to reality when airstrikes there continued on Sunday morning.\nWhile Iranian drones and aircraft were making their way to Israeli territory on Saturday night, the incessant noise of Israeli drones and warplanes disappeared from Gaza's skies, residents said.\n'Finally some calmness after six months of buzzing and noises!' Yousef Mema, a Gazan activist with a significant social media following, wrote on Instagram.\nAnother influencer, Mahmoud Shurrab, recorded himself walking in the middle of the street, the skies overhead quiet. 'I can't believe it, silence,' he said in a video posted on Instagram.\nThe calm did not last. The Israeli military said on Sunday that its forces were pressing on with a raid in the central Gaza Strip for the fourth day, where they 'eliminated dozens of terrorists in face-to-face battles and with air support.' And Wafa, the Palestinian Authority news agency, reported that several Palestinians had been killed in a strike on a home in Nuseirat in central Gaza, and that at least eight others were wounded in a strike on three homes in Beit Hanoun, a city in the northeast of the strip.\nSome Palestinians worried that an escalation between Israel and Iran would distract from the dire situation in the Gaza Strip, potentially diverting international attention from the Israeli bombardment and looming famine there.\n'I think it is not at all in the Palestinians' side or favor to have a new front open with Israel,' said Amer Nasser, 64. 'This will distract the people around the world from seeing what is happening in Gaza,' he added.\nFor many, the Iranian attack was unexpected.\nFayez al-Samman, a 76-year-old car trader from Gaza City who is sheltering in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza, said he spent the night listening to the news on the radio. 'It was a surprise for me when I heard the missiles were targeting Israeli sites,' he said.\nOsama al-Hato, 53, another man from Gaza City staying in Deir al-Balah, said he was happy that Iran had targeted Israel. 'However, I did not follow the news nor expect the Iranian reaction to this extent,' he added.\nAymen Zidan, 57, a wholesale vegetable supplier from Deir al-Balah, said he had had little expectation that Iran would target Israel, although he believed Iran's attack was for its own interests, not for the sake of Palestinians in Gaza like him.\nEven so, he said, he felt 'relieved that there is a country that said no to Israel.'\nRaja Abdulrahim contributed reporting from New York.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences",

            "summary": "Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken arrived in Italy on Wednesday for a gathering of foreign ministers from the Group of 7 nations at which the Middle East turmoil and the fate of Ukraine will be central topics.\nThe meeting will take place as world leaders try to contain the growing fallout from the war between Israel and Hamas. Most urgently, they are seeking to persuade Israel not to escalate its conflict with Iran in the wake of Iran's strikes on Israel over the weekend, which did little damage but involved hundreds of missiles and drones and prompted calls within Israel for a punishing response.\nAt the opening session, the officials will also discuss Israel's invasion of Gaza and international efforts to reach a cease-fire deal.\nThe G7 is a conference of seven industrialized democracies — Italy, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Britain and the United States — as well as representatives of the European Union. The meeting, which is being held on the Mediterranean island of Capri, is a prelude to a summit of G7 leaders scheduled for mid-June in Puglia, Italy.\nThe G7, which often issues joint proclamations about world events, released a statement on Sunday condemning 'in the strongest terms Iran's direct and unprecedented attack against Israel.' The group also said it would work to 'end the crisis in Gaza' through 'an immediate and sustainable cease-fire and the release of hostages by Hamas,' and increase the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian territory.\nTalks to at least pause the fighting in exchange for the release of hostages and more aid deliveries have been snagged for weeks. U.S. officials say Hamas has rejected credible Israeli offers and is the main obstacle to resolving the conflict, even as international pressure grows on Israel because of the civilian toll in Gaza.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Ilia Yefimovich/picture-alliance/dpa, via Associated Press The top diplomats from Britain and Germany visited Jerusalem on Wednesday in a bid to calm tensions in the Middle East, as Israel signaled that it would not let Iran's large aerial attack over the weekend go unanswered. David Cameron, the British foreign secretary, and Annalena Baerbock, Germany's foreign minister, held talks with President Isaac Herzog of Israel in the morning. Israeli news media said they were also set to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, as well as with war cabinet minister Benny Gantz and Foreign Minister Israel Katz. Mr. Cameron pressed for restraint while indicating that Israeli officials appear determined to take action after Iran's missile and drone assault, believed to be the first time in the two countries' decades-long shadow war that Tehran had taken aim directly at Israeli territory. 'It is clear that the Israelis are making a decision to act,' Mr. Cameron told the BBC. 'We hope that they do so in a way that does as little to escalate this as possible.' Israel's war cabinet has met several times since the weekend with no apparent decision on when and how to strike back. Officials are said to be considering a range of options, from a direct strike on Iran to a cyberattack or targeted assassinations, trying to send a clear message to Iran while not sparking a major escalation. 'Israel will respond when it sees fit,' an Israeli official said on Wednesday, adding that it had 'multiple ways' to do so. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel on Saturday night, almost all of which were intercepted by Israel's air defenses, supported by the United States, Britain, France and Jordan. Israel's allies have condemned the assault while urging a response that does not further raise tensions with Iran. Mr. Cameron said that the Group of 7 nations, which includes the United States as well as Britain and Germany, should work together to penalize Iran with sanctions. U.S. and European officials said separately on Tuesday that they were considering placing additional sanctions on Tehran that could target its oil revenue and weapons programs. Before the meetings on Wednesday, Ms. Baerbock said that Iran's actions had 'led an entire region to the brink of the abyss.' 'The aim now is to stop Iran without further escalation,' she said in a post on social media on Tuesday. 'Iran's plan to sow further violence must not work.' Both ministers said they were also visiting to press for a humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza and call attention to the continued captivity of the hostages held there.

Barnes and Russell Goldman Buildings destroyed in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, on Tuesday. Credit... Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Iran's attack on Israel has shifted focus from the war in Gaza, but Israeli military operations press on there with the aim of eliminating Hamas, the armed group that controlled the territory before the fighting began. Israel's military launched its assault in Gaza after Oct. 7, when Hamas led an attack that Israeli authorities say killed around 1,200 people. Israel said its aims were to defeat Hamas and free the hostages taken that day, around 100 of whom remain in Gaza. Local health authorities say the war has killed more than 33,000 people, and the United Nations says the population is on the brink of famine. Here is a look at where the military conflict stands: Israel withdrew its forces from southern Gaza this month, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that the military still plans to invade Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, to 'complete the elimination of Hamas's battalions' and to destroy its tunnel networks. Mourning over the bodies of relatives in Rafah, in southern Gaza, on Tuesday. Credit... Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The timing of any operation in Rafah, on the border with Egypt, is unclear. President Biden is among many world leaders who have urged Israel not to invade the city because of the harm it could cause civilians. Rafah's population has swelled to over a million, as people have flocked there for shelter from fighting elsewhere, and border crossings in southern Gaza are a main conduit for humanitarian aid. Israel began its ground invasion in northern Gaza in late October, urging civilians to leave. Much of the north, including Gaza City, has been destroyed by airstrikes and ground combat. Israel began to pull its forces from northern Gaza in January, saying it had dismantled Hamas's military structure there. In March, however, Israeli troops mounted an operation at Al-Shifa Hospital, in Gaza City, where it said Hamas fighters had returned. Israeli troops said they had killed about 200 fighters and captured 500 more. The hospital, once Gaza's largest, was left in ruins. Israeli soldiers outside Al-Shifa Hospital, in Gaza City, during a tour by the Israeli army last month. Credit... Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times Some analysts said the raid showed that by leaving northern Gaza without a plan in place for governing the area, Israel had made it possible for Hamas to return. At the same time, some civilians who had fled south and attempted to return via a coastal road said this week that Israeli forces had fired on them. Their testimony could not be independently confirmed. The Israeli troops that remain in Gaza are mainly guarding a road that the military has built across the center of the strip to facilitate its operations. The Institute for the Study of War, a research group, said that was consistent with Israel's plans to shift to a strategy of more targeted raids rather than wider assaults. Israel retains the capacity to launch airstrikes anywhere in Gaza and it has conducted several around the central city of Deir al Balah. This month, Israeli planes attacked a convoy of the World Central Kitchen charity near the city, killing seven aid workers. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has said that Israel regrets the strikes. In Deir al Balah, in central Gaza, leaflets dropped by the Israeli army on Tuesday warned people to stay away from the area. Credit... Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Experts say the Israeli military has had considerable success in dismantling Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades. It has broken the strength of most of its battalions with tens of thousands of airstrikes and ground combat, said Robert Blecher, an expert at the International Crisis Group think tank. Israel has also killed at least one of Hamas's top commanders and has destroyed some of the tunnels in which the group operates. But Hamas retains significant organizational and military capacity, particularly in southern Gaza where its tunnel network acts as a shield, and its leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, is still at large. 'Israel has done a good job of disabling those stronger battalions,' Mr. Blecher said, but he added: 'Hamas is going to remain as an insurgent force.'

Solmaz Daryani for The New York Times The United States plans to impose new sanctions on Iran in the coming days to punish it for the attacks on Israel over the weekend, U.S. officials said on Tuesday. Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, said in a statement that the sanctions would target Iran's 'missile and drone program' and entities that support the country's military groups. 'These new sanctions and other measures will continue a steady drumbeat of pressure to contain and degrade Iran's military capacity and effectiveness and confront the full range of its problematic behaviors,' Mr. Sullivan said. Mr. Sullivan did not specify how the sanctions might undermine Iranian weapons programs, but a Treasury official, who declined to be named in order to discuss private deliberations, said the United States was looking at ways to cut off Iran's access to military components that it uses to build weapons such as the drones that it used against Israel. On Saturday night, Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel in retaliation for an Israeli airstrike that killed several senior Iranian military officials in Syria earlier in the month. Most of the missiles and drones were intercepted and shot down by Israel and its allies, including the United States and Britain. The United States has imposed extensive sanctions on Iran over the years as part of a broad effort to put pressure on its economy and prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons. At a news conference on Tuesday ahead of the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington, Janet L. Yellen, the secretary of the Treasury, suggested that the Biden administration was considering ways to further restrict Iranian oil exports. Ms. Yellen noted that the Biden administration had already targeted more than 500 Iranian individuals and entities associated with terrorist financing over the last three years. 'I fully expect that we will take additional sanctions action against Iran in the coming days,' Ms. Yellen said. Ms. Yellen said that the United States does not generally reveal the details of sanctions before imposing them but she signaled that the Biden administration is focusing on Iranian oil, which is a major source of its government revenue. 'We have been working to diminish Iran's ability to export oil,' Ms. Yellen said. 'Clearly Iran is continuing to export some oil — there may be more that we could do.' The United States will also be discussing Iran with finance ministers from the Group of 7 nations, who are in Washington this week. Those talks will be centered on how to coordinate sanctions to cut off Iran's supply of military components for weapons like the Shahed drones that it deployed against Israel, according to the Treasury official. The United States will also be talking with other countries, including China, about the need to stop supplying Iran with weapons or technology that it has been using to destabilize the Middle East. Ms. Yellen noted that since the attack by Hamas on Israel on Oct. 7 of last year, the United States has targeted Iran with more than 100 sanctions intended to debilitate its procurement networks for ballistic missiles and the terrorist groups that it finances. Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington. — Alan Rappeport Reporting from Washington Josep Borrell Fontelles, the foreign policy chief of the European Union, said on Tuesday that economic sanctions could be broadened to include Iran's missile program, as well as the delivery of those weapons systems to its proxy militias. Credit... John Thys/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The European Union is considering expanding economic sanctions against Iran's weapons program to punish it for last weekend's attack on Israel and try to prevent any escalation of violence across the Middle East, the bloc's top diplomat said on Tuesday. 'I'm not trying to exaggerate when I say that, in the Middle East, we are at the edge of a very deep precipice,' Josep Borrell Fontelles, the European Union's foreign policy chief, said after European diplomats were hastily called to discuss the crisis. Member states agreed to mobilize all diplomatic efforts to avoid a violent spillover that would be 'leading us into a regional war,' Mr. Borrell said. 'That is what we're trying to avoid.' The European Union has already penalized Iran for equipping Russia with drones in Moscow's war against Ukraine. On Tuesday, Mr. Borrell said those sanctions could be broadened to include Iran's missile program, as well as the delivery of those weapons systems to its proxy militias in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria. He also said the European Union could expand sanctions against entities that provide Iran with the necessary components to build drones, but that, by and large, such penalties were already in place. It is far from clear how the proposed restrictions would curb Iran, which has spent decades finding ways to skirt Western sanctions, including illicit shipments of oil and, notably, its armaments to Russia. But even as he voiced the bloc's support for Israel, Mr. Borrell said 'let's not forget Gaza,' where an Israeli siege has created a hunger crisis that the United Nations says borders on famine. 'Yes, we have to pay a lot of attention to the Iranian attack on Israel,' Mr. Borrell said. 'But we don't have to forget about what's happening in Gaza. Because there will be no regional stability — there will not be a possibility to build enduring peace in the region if the Gaza war continues.' He also noted the awkward disparity between the West's resistance to being pulled directly into the conflict in Ukraine and the interception of Iranian drones by the United States and several allies last weekend to protect Israel. The conflicts are vastly different, Mr. Borrell said, in part because Iran's drones put allied air bases in the Middle East at risk by flying over them to get to Israel. But, he said, if he were President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, 'I would certainly wish to highlight that Ukraine is being bombed as well.' Mr. Borrell predicted that European defense ministers could commit to sending more air defense to Ukraine at a meeting on Monday. — Lara Jakes Reporting from Brussels  © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nFrom left, Annalena Baerbock, Germany's foreign minister; Isaac Herzog, Israel's president; and David Cameron, Britain's foreign secretary, at a hotel in Jerusalem on Wednesday.

Menahem Kahana/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Israeli leaders on Tuesday were debating how best to respond to Iran's unprecedented weekend airstrike, officials said, weighing a set of options calibrated to achieve different strategic outcomes: deterring a similar attack in the future, placating their American allies and avoiding all-out war.\nIran's attack on Israel, a barrage of hundreds of ballistic missiles and exploding drones, changed the unspoken rules in the archrivals' long-running shadow war. Until this month, the two nations had refrained from launching major airstrikes from one country's territory directly at the other's.\nNow, the calculus that Israel must use to decide its next move has also changed, according to the Israeli officials, who requested anonymity to discuss Iran. The government is making the decision under diplomatic pressure from allies who want it to de-escalate the conflict. American officials have publicly and privately tried to persuade Israel that it does not need to retaliate for the Iranian strike, which did little damage.\nBut Israeli officials disagree. 'We cannot stand still from this kind of aggression,' Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the spokesman for Israel's military, said on Tuesday. Iran, he added, would not get off 'scot-free.'\nIran's attack was a response to an Israeli airstrike in Syria that destroyed a building in Damascus that was part of the Iranian embassy complex, normally considered off-limits to attack, and killed several of Iran's high-ranking military officials. Israeli officials have said the building was used as an Iranian military and intelligence base, making it a legitimate target.\nThere is now an internal debate among Israeli officials about the next step. Israel does not want Iran to conclude that it can now attack Israeli territory whenever Israel strikes Iranian interests in a third country, some of the officials said. But, they added, Israel also does not want and cannot afford a major conflict with Iran while still fighting a war in Gaza and skirmishing with Iranian proxies along its borders.\nThe members of Israel's small but fractious war cabinet, the officials said, are considering options big enough to send a clear message to Iran that such attacks will not go unanswered, but not so big as to spark a major escalation.\nAfter three days of meetings, the cabinet has yet to decide on a response. On Tuesday, the five-member cabinet met with security officials for two hours of consultations, according to one official, and they were expected to convene again on Wednesday.\n— Ronen Bergman, Isabel Kershner, Julian E.

Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Iran's attack on Israel has shifted focus from the war in Gaza, but Israeli military operations press on there with the aim of eliminating Hamas, the armed group that controlled the territory before the fighting began.\nIsrael's military launched its assault in Gaza after Oct. 7, when Hamas led an attack that Israeli authorities say killed around 1,200 people. Israel said its aims were to defeat Hamas and free the hostages taken that day, around 100 of whom remain in Gaza. Local health authorities say the war has killed more than 33,000 people, and the United Nations says the population is on the brink of famine.\nHere is a look at where the military conflict stands:\nIsrael withdrew its forces from southern Gaza this month, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that the military still plans to invade Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, to 'complete the elimination of Hamas's battalions' and to destroy its tunnel networks.\nMourning over the bodies of relatives in Rafah, in southern Gaza, on Tuesday. Credit... Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The timing of any operation in Rafah, on the border with Egypt, is unclear. President Biden is among many world leaders who have urged Israel not to invade the city because of the harm it could cause civilians. Rafah's population has swelled to over a million, as people have flocked there for shelter from fighting elsewhere, and border crossings in southern Gaza are a main conduit for humanitarian aid.\nIsrael began its ground invasion in northern Gaza in late October, urging civilians to leave. Much of the north, including Gaza City, has been destroyed by airstrikes and ground combat. Israel began to pull its forces from northern Gaza in January, saying it had dismantled Hamas's military structure there.\nIn March, however, Israeli troops mounted an operation at Al-Shifa Hospital, in Gaza City, where it said Hamas fighters had returned. Israeli troops said they had killed about 200 fighters and captured 500 more. The hospital, once Gaza's largest, was left in ruins.\nIsraeli soldiers outside Al-Shifa Hospital, in Gaza City, during a tour by the Israeli army last month. Credit... Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times Some analysts said the raid showed that by leaving northern Gaza without a plan in place for governing the area, Israel had made it possible for Hamas to return. At the same time, some civilians who had fled south and attempted to return via a coastal road said this week that Israeli forces had fired on them. Their testimony could not be independently confirmed.\nThe Israeli troops that remain in Gaza are mainly guarding a road that the military has built across the center of the strip to facilitate its operations. The Institute for the Study of War, a research group, said that was consistent with Israel's plans to shift to a strategy of more targeted raids rather than wider assaults.\nIsrael retains the capacity to launch airstrikes anywhere in Gaza and it has conducted several around the central city of Deir al Balah. This month, Israeli planes attacked a convoy of the World Central Kitchen charity near the city, killing seven aid workers. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has said that Israel regrets the strikes.\nIn Deir al Balah, in central Gaza, leaflets dropped by the Israeli army on Tuesday warned people to stay away from the area. Credit... Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Experts say the Israeli military has had considerable success in dismantling Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades. It has broken the strength of most of its battalions with tens of thousands of airstrikes and ground combat, said Robert Blecher, an expert at the International Crisis Group think tank.\nIsrael has also killed at least one of Hamas's top commanders and has destroyed some of the tunnels in which the group operates. But Hamas retains significant organizational and military capacity, particularly in southern Gaza where its tunnel network acts as a shield, and its leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, is still at large.\n'Israel has done a good job of disabling those stronger battalions,' Mr. Blecher said, but he added: 'Hamas is going to remain as an insurgent force.'\nOil and gas infrastructure in Khuzestan Province, Iran. Credit... Solmaz Daryani for The New York Times The United States plans to impose new sanctions on Iran in the coming days to punish it for the attacks on Israel over the weekend, U.S. officials said on Tuesday.\nJake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, said in a statement that the sanctions would target Iran's 'missile and drone program' and entities that support the country's military groups.\n'These new sanctions and other measures will continue a steady drumbeat of pressure to contain and degrade Iran's military capacity and effectiveness and confront the full range of its problematic behaviors,' Mr. Sullivan said.\nMr. Sullivan did not specify how the sanctions might undermine Iranian weapons programs, but a Treasury official, who declined to be named in order to discuss private deliberations, said the United States was looking at ways to cut off Iran's access to military components that it uses to build weapons such as the drones that it used against Israel.\nOn Saturday night, Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel in retaliation for an Israeli airstrike that killed several senior Iranian military officials in Syria earlier in the month. Most of the missiles and drones were intercepted and shot down by Israel and its allies, including the United States and Britain.\nThe United States has imposed extensive sanctions on Iran over the years as part of a broad effort to put pressure on its economy and prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons.\nAt a news conference on Tuesday ahead of the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington, Janet L. Yellen, the secretary of the Treasury, suggested that the Biden administration was considering ways to further restrict Iranian oil exports.\nMs. Yellen noted that the Biden administration had already targeted more than 500 Iranian individuals and entities associated with terrorist financing over the last three years.\n'I fully expect that we will take additional sanctions action against Iran in the coming days,' Ms. Yellen said.\nMs. Yellen said that the United States does not generally reveal the details of sanctions before imposing them but she signaled that the Biden administration is focusing on Iranian oil, which is a major source of its government revenue.\n'We have been working to diminish Iran's ability to export oil,' Ms. Yellen said. 'Clearly Iran is continuing to export some oil — there may be more that we could do.'\nThe United States will also be discussing Iran with finance ministers from the Group of 7 nations, who are in Washington this week. Those talks will be centered on how to coordinate sanctions to cut off Iran's supply of military components for weapons like the Shahed drones that it deployed against Israel, according to the Treasury official.\nThe United States will also be talking with other countries, including China, about the need to stop supplying Iran with weapons or technology that it has been using to destabilize the Middle East.\nMs. Yellen noted that since the attack by Hamas on Israel on Oct. 7 of last year, the United States has targeted Iran with more than 100 sanctions intended to debilitate its procurement networks for ballistic missiles and the terrorist groups that it finances.\nPeter Baker contributed reporting from Washington.\n— Alan Rappeport Reporting from Washington\n— Alan Rappeport Reporting from Washington Josep Borrell Fontelles, the foreign policy chief of the European Union, said on Tuesday that economic sanctions could be broadened to include Iran's missile program, as well as the delivery of those weapons systems to its proxy militias. Credit... John Thys/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The European Union is considering expanding economic sanctions against Iran's weapons program to punish it for last weekend's attack on Israel and try to prevent any escalation of violence across the Middle East, the bloc's top diplomat said on Tuesday.\n'I'm not trying to exaggerate when I say that, in the Middle East, we are at the edge of a very deep precipice,' Josep Borrell Fontelles, the European Union's foreign policy chief, said after European diplomats were hastily called to discuss the crisis.\nMember states agreed to mobilize all diplomatic efforts to avoid a violent spillover that would be 'leading us into a regional war,' Mr. Borrell said. 'That is what we're trying to avoid.'\nThe European Union has already penalized Iran for equipping Russia with drones in Moscow's war against Ukraine. On Tuesday, Mr. Borrell said those sanctions could be broadened to include Iran's missile program, as well as the delivery of those weapons systems to its proxy militias in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria.\nHe also said the European Union could expand sanctions against entities that provide Iran with the necessary components to build drones, but that, by and large, such penalties were already in place.\nIt is far from clear how the proposed restrictions would curb Iran, which has spent decades finding ways to skirt Western sanctions, including illicit shipments of oil and, notably, its armaments to Russia.\nBut even as he voiced the bloc's support for Israel, Mr. Borrell said 'let's not forget Gaza,' where an Israeli siege has created a hunger crisis that the United Nations says borders on famine.\n'Yes, we have to pay a lot of attention to the Iranian attack on Israel,' Mr. Borrell said. 'But we don't have to forget about what's happening in Gaza. Because there will be no regional stability — there will not be a possibility to build enduring peace in the region if the Gaza war continues.'\nHe also noted the awkward disparity between the West's resistance to being pulled directly into the conflict in Ukraine and the interception of Iranian drones by the United States and several allies last weekend to protect Israel.\nThe conflicts are vastly different, Mr. Borrell said, in part because Iran's drones put allied air bases in the Middle East at risk by flying over them to get to Israel.\nBut, he said, if he were President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, 'I would certainly wish to highlight that Ukraine is being bombed as well.' Mr. Borrell predicted that European defense ministers could commit to sending more air defense to Ukraine at a meeting on Monday.\n— Lara Jakes Reporting from Brussels\n— Lara Jakes Reporting from Brussels Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences",

The Iranian officials said that a strike had hit a military air base near the city of Isfahan, in central Iran. Initial reaction in both Israel and Iran was muted, which analysts said was a sign that the rivals were seeking to lower the temperature of their conflict. World leaders, who for nearly a week have urged Israel and Iran to avoid starting a broader war in the region, called for both sides to de-escalate tensions on Friday. The Israeli military declined to comment on the strike. A senior U.S. official said that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before the attack. All the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The explosions came less than a week after Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel — nearly all of which were shot down — in response to an April 1 strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria that killed seven Iranian officials. That attack brought the decades-long shadow war between Israel and Iran — waged on land, at sea, in air and in cyberspace — more clearly into the open. A Western official and two Iranian officials said that Israel used both missiles fired from warplanes and drones in the strike, suggesting that the attack included more advanced firepower than initial reports indicated. Iranian officials initially told The New York Times that the attack had been carried out only by small drones, possibly launched from inside Iran, and that radar systems had not detected unidentified aircraft entering Iranian airspace. They said that a separate group of small drones was shot down in the region of Tabriz, roughly 500 miles north of Isfahan.\nIn public, Iranian officials sought to downplay the strike. Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi, the commander in chief of Iran's army, said explosions heard early Friday in Isfahan 'were from our air defense firing at a suspicious object,' and that there had been 'no damage.' Iranian news agencies appeared keen to show that things were 'back to normal' in the city.\nPresident Ebrahim Raisi of Iran had warned that 'the tiniest act of aggression' on his country's soil would draw a response. But in the hours after Israel's strike, there have been no public calls for retribution by Iranian officials. One lawmaker, Seyed Nezamedin Mousavi, called the strike 'ridiculous,' saying it showed Israel 'is content with these ineffective actions.'\nIsfahan is one of Iran's most famous and historic cities. The area also hosts a number of Iranian military sites. Iranian media reported that nuclear facilities in Isfahan had not been hit.\nIsraeli leaders came close to ordering widespread strikes in Iran on the night Iran attacked, officials said, but the war cabinet postponed a decision. Mr. Biden and other world leaders urged Israel for days not to retaliate in a way that would inflame a wider Middle East war while it fights Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both allies of Iran. April 19, 2024, 8:07 p.m. ET April 19, 2024, 8:07 p.m. ET Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, who is in New York attending U.N. meetings, told Iran's state news agency that the small quadcopter targeting a military base in Isfahan did not have casualties or damage. 'Israel is determined to portray its defeat as a victory,' Mr. Amir Abdollahian said, the most senior official to comment on the attacks and draw a link to Israel publicly. Credit... Angela Weiss/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The Israeli attack on an Iranian air base in Isfahan hit a crucial part of an air defense system, a New York Times analysis of satellite imagery found. Images showed that the precision attack at the 8th Shekari Air Base damaged or destroyed the 'flap-lid' radar, which is used in S-300 air defense systems to track incoming targets. The Times used several satellite images in its analysis; the location of the damaged area was first pointed out on the social media platform X by Aurora Intel, and the findings have also been confirmed by a former U.S. government imagery analyst, Chris Biggers. The radar is typically surrounded by several vehicles, including four trucks carrying missiles. Before the strike, the missiles were seen positioned next to the radar. After the strike, they had been moved and did not appear visibly damaged. It was not clear why the missiles had been moved. However, the fact that they appear undamaged indicated that the attack had a very precise target, according to Mr. Biggers. An air defense system at the air base in Isfahan in October 2021.

Maxar Technologies, via Google Earth Other areas of the air base and adjacent airport also appeared to be undamaged. The precision of the strike, deep within Iran and with several sensitive sites close by, suggested Israel chose the specific and narrow target, the air defense system. According to the Missile Defense Project of the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies, Iran has acquired Russian-made S-300 air defense systems to deter Israeli and other airstrikes. Some Democrats are fine sending defensive weapons to Israel, but want to see some limits on offensive weapons, which could be used against civilians in Gaza. Credit... -/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images A group of left-leaning House Democrats is urging its colleagues to oppose the $26 billion aid package for Israel, hoping to maximize the number of 'no' votes from the party and send a warning to President Biden about the depth of his political coalition's discontent over his support for Israel's tactics in Gaza. Framing the upcoming vote as a make-or-break moral choice akin to Congress's votes to authorize and fund the Iraq war, progressive leaders in the House are working to muster a sizable bloc of Democratic opposition to the aid measure, which is expected to pass on Saturday and become law in the coming days. 'In the wake of those votes, people came around much, much later and said, ‘We shouldn't have allowed that to go forward,'' Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington and the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said of the decades-ago debate over Iraq. 'And I think that this is that moment.' Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas, called it a 'defining vote,' adding, 'We're either going to participate in the carnage, or we're not.' There is little doubt that the bill, which would send roughly $13 billion in military assistance to Israel as it continues its offensive in Gaza, will pass the House, along with money for Ukraine, Taiwan and other American allies. But progressive Democrats estimated that 40 to 60 members of their party may oppose it on the House floor on Saturday. That would be a striking signal from Congress, where ironclad bipartisan backing for Israel has long been the norm. And it would highlight the fraught divisions the war in Gaza has sown within the Democratic Party, even as more Democrats including Mr. Biden have begun to criticize Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's approach to the conflict and urge him to better protect civilians. The legislation would allocate $5 billion to Israel's defense capabilities and $9 billion for 'worldwide humanitarian aid,' including for civilians in Gaza. But it would not place further conditions on how Israel could use American military aid, nor block future arms transfers from the United States as an increasing number of Democrats have sought to do. Democrats who are leading the push against the Israel aid bill said they strongly supported the Jewish state and its right to defend itself, and would vote in favor of sending military aid that supports Israel's defense capabilities, such as by replenishing the Iron Dome, David's Sling and Iron Beam defense systems. They also denounced the Oct. 7 terrorist attack by Hamas that prompted the war, and said the hostages taken by Hamas must be released. But they argued that approving more offensive weaponry without conditions was an untenable moral and political position that would amount to an endorsement of Mr. Netanyahu's prosecution of the war, including his intention to invade Rafah over the objections of the Biden administration. More than 33,000 people in Gaza have been killed since the start of the conflict, according to the health ministry there, and the population is facing a hunger crisis. 'I understand the need for defensive weapons for Israel, particularly in light of the attack by Iran,' said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, who ran his first campaign on an antiwar platform and helped lead efforts to end U.S. participation in the war in Yemen. 'But there is no justification to provide bombs and weapons to Netanyahu to continue the war in Gaza that is killing thousands of innocent Palestinian women and children.' Saturday's vote will recall a similar situation from 2007, when the speaker at the time, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, split a piece of spending legislation to allow Democrats to register their opposition to funding the Iraq war while backing a domestic funding bill. Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, similarly divided the foreign aid package to be considered on Saturday in order to get each element across the finish line in the face of distinct coalitions of resistance to different pieces of the bill. In a critical test vote on Friday, the House agreed, 316 to 94, to bring up the package, with 39 Democrats — mostly progressives — joining 55 Republicans in opposition. 'This is a moment for members of Congress who support a safe and secure Israel to send a message that giving Netanyahu more offensive weapons is not a path for peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians,' Representative Becca Balint, Democrat of Vermont and the first Jewish member of Congress to call for a cease-fire, said in an interview. 'To give Netanyahu more offensive weapons at this stage, I believe, is to condone the destruction of Gaza that we've seen in the last six months. And it's also a green light for an invasion of Rafah.' Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat who led the opposition to funding for the Iraq war in 2007, said the conversations among Democrats in Congress opposing continued U.S. backing for the war in Gaza were 'not unlike' those that took place 17 years ago. 'We may well be casting the vote on whether a much wider war takes place, and whether American weapons go that result in the death of thousands of innocent people,' Mr. Doggett said. The Democrats who oppose the aid package for Israel represent a minority of their caucus. But they see a 'no' vote as part of a strategy to pressure Mr. Biden to condition aid and halt future offensive weapons transfers. Through many meetings, text chains and conversations with the administration, they have worked to shift the president's approach to Israel, while underscoring the electoral risks Mr. Biden faces among voters who helped power him to the White House in 2020 and are now furious over his handling of the war. 'The only way to get a course correction is for a sizable number within the Democratic caucus to say it must shift,' Ms. Balint said. Representative Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat who has been pressing Mr. Biden to withhold offensive weapons from Israel, said a big 'no' vote would strengthen the president's hand to do so. 'It helps the administration to have some number of Democrats express ourselves in this way,' he said. Representative Greg Casar, Democrat of Texas, said he hoped a substantial number of Democrats opposing the bill would give the Biden administration greater leverage to influence the Israeli government's approach to the war. 'I hope this vote will show the world that there is a really significant segment of the United States that doesn't want to see expanded and widening wars,' he said. An Israeli air force F-15 warplane landing at an air base in central Israel on Monday. Credit... Ohad Zwigenberg/Associated Press Israeli warplanes fired missiles on Iran during a retaliatory strike early Friday morning, one Western official and two Iranian officials said, suggesting that the attack included more advanced firepower than initial reports indicated. It was not immediately clear the types of missiles used, from where they were fired, whether any were intercepted by Iran's defenses or where they landed. The Western official and the Iranian officials requested anonymity to discuss classified information. Previously, Iranian officials said Friday's attack on a military base in central Iran was conducted by small aerial drones, most likely launched from inside Iranian territory. A separate group of small drones, they said soon after the attack, was shot down in the region of Tabriz, roughly 500 miles north of Isfahan. Israel has not publicly claimed responsibility for Friday's attack and would not comment on the use of planes or missiles. Israel's strike came in response to an Iranian attack last weekend in which Iran fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel. A majority of the weapons used in that salvo were fired from Iranian territory and intercepted by Israel and its allies before causing any damage. By contrast, the Iranian officials said, Iran's military did not detect anything entering Iran's airspace on Friday, including drones, missiles and aircraft. Iran's state news agency IRNA reported that no missile attacks occurred and that Iran's air defense system was not activated. Iran's decision to launch its strike primarily from its own soil last week was perceived by Israel as an escalation in the countries' long-simmering shadow war. The Iranians believe the large salvo is helping with deterrence. Throughout the yearslong conflict, the two countries have traded clandestine attacks, including targeted assassinations, cyberattacks and conventional strikes conducted from and within third countries. Iran's attack last week was itself prompted by an Israeli strike on April 1, in which Israeli aircraft killed several Iranian armed forces commanders in Syria. By using drones seemingly launched from inside Iran's territory rather than its own, Israel hinted at a willingness to turn down the temperature on the conflict while also demonstrating an ability to conduct attacks that Iran could not detect. One Iranian official, a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, said that even though the strike did little damage, the likelihood that drones were fired from under Iran's nose sent a message about Israel's capabilities. A guided missile fired from an undetected warplane, even if it landed outside Iranian territory, would most likely deliver a similar threat. Officials from both countries remained largely quiet about Friday's attack, a gesture that appeared aimed at de-escalating a conflict some fear could spiral into a broader regional war. Israel's silence on the attack, an Iranian official said, would allow Tehran to treat the strike as it had comparable previous attacks and not prompt an immediate response. Mahdi Mohammadi, a senior adviser to Iran's Parliament speaker, said that Israel's limited attack on Iran showed that Iran had achieved its goal of deterrence. Israel's refusal to openly claim responsibility, he said, amounts to a victory for Iran. Israel's attack, he said on the messaging app Telegram, was meant to show that it had the 'capability to access Iran but in practice it also showed that it has accepted that it should not repeat its miscalculation.' April 19, 2024, 2:43 p.m. ET April 19, 2024, 2:43 p.m. ET The White House maintained public silence about the Israeli strike on Iran. 'I'm not going to speak or speculate about any of the reports that are out there,' Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said at her daily briefing. John Kirby, the national security spokesman who typically speaks on foreign policy issues, did not join the briefing. April 19, 2024, 2:48 p.m. ET April 19, 2024, 2:48 p.m. ET Jean-Pierre did repeat the president's standard position urging against widening the war: 'We do not want to see this conflict escalate. We continue to consult with our allies and partners, including in the region, to reduce further risk of escalation in the region.' Credit... Pete Marovich for The New York Times The Israeli military struck a Syrian air defense site in southern Syria with missiles early Friday, causing material damage, though no casualties were reported, according to Syrian state news media. Syria's official news agency, SANA, provided no other details and Israel did not comment on whether it was responsible for the attack, in keeping with its usual practice. The strike happened around the same time that Israel carried out a strike on a military air base near the city of Isfahan, in central Iran. That strike came less than a week after Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel — nearly all of which were shot down — in retaliation for an April 1 attack on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria that killed seven Iranian military officers. Friday's strike in Syria targeted a radar system in the southern province of Dara'a, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group based in Britain. The Syrian military detected Israeli aircraft entering Syrian airspace, but its air defenses did not try to intercept the strikes, the Observatory said. Iranian-backed armed groups throughout Syria have been on high alert since Iran's strikes on Israel last weekend, the Observatory said. The groups obscured their positions and gave some of their leaders a week of leave. Iran is closely allied with Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia, and with the Syrian government, and both Hezbollah and Iran's Quds Force operate in Syria. For years, Iranian proxies like Hezbollah have launched strikes at northern Israel. Israel has repeatedly targeted Iran and its allies with strikes in Syria, including in Damascus, the capital, and Aleppo. Attacks across Israel's borders with Syria and Lebanon have escalated since the Oct. 7 assault by Hamas on Israel. Since the first of the year, Israel has carried out nearly three dozen attacks in Syria, destroying buildings, military headquarters and weapon and ammunition warehouses, the Observatory said. The strikes have killed 129 fighters and 12 civilians, the group said. April 19, 2024, 1:30 p.m. ET April 19, 2024, 1:30 p.m. ET Jordan will not allow its airspace to be violated by either Israel or Iran, Jordan's foreign minister told his Iranian counterpart in a phone call, the official Jordanian news agency, Petra, reported. Jordan lies between the two enemies, and it played a key role in helping shoot down the barrage of missiles and drones Iran fired at Israel on Saturday. A group at the ancient Si-o-Se Pol bridge in Isfahan, Iran, in 2023. Daily life appeared to return to normal in Isfahan on Friday, according to Iranian state news media and a resident who was interviewed, hours after Israel's attack on a nearby military base continued the cycle of strikes and counterstrikes between the two countries. But tensions from the overnight attack reverberated through the city, and some residents described the threat of full-fledged war as crippling — despite analysts' assessment that both nations were trying to avoid further escalation. Mehrdad, 43, an engineer from Isfahan, said the latest retaliation left him and his pregnant wife feeling stressed and unwell. He asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution. 'The future of this country concerns me,' he said. 'I believe nothing good is expected.' Though he said that the city had returned 'back to its normal' and reactions from officials were muted — which he believed was to help make people feel at ease — many residents remain scared after a stressful night of explosions. For the first six months of the war between Israel and Hamas, Iran's involvement in fighting had been limited to its proxies, including the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and the Yemeni Houthi militia. But after Iran's first direct strike on Israel last weekend, Mehrdad said, 'things are coming to the surface.' He hoped that diplomatic mediation would put an end to the threat of war, and he worried that the county's infrastructure would be 'ruined' by further Israeli attacks. 'Our economic situation is awful. We have 50 percent annual inflation,' he said. 'Now guess what would happen if the war materialized. What would happen to our living conditions in this country?' Mahsa, 34, an accountant from Isfahan who also asked that her last name not be used for fear of retribution, described a tense atmosphere of fear and instability. The economy is often the main topic of conversation when people gather, she said, and many are worried about the consequences of a wider war. 'When Iran attacked, we were all worried and we really didn't know what to expect,' she said, describing the cycle of retaliation between Israel and Iran as a 'show game.' 'Of course, after this Israeli attack, the direction of the game will be determined,' she added. 'Either a full-scale war, or the end of this line, or just threats.' The distress is crushing.

Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times For decades, Israel and Iran have fought a shadow war across the Middle East, trading attacks by land, sea, air and in cyberspace. A recent round of strikes — mainly an aerial barrage by Iran against Israel last weekend — has brought the conflict more clearly into the open and raised fears of a broader war. A retaliatory Israeli strike on an Iranian air base on Friday, however, appeared limited in scope, and analysts said it suggested an effort to pull back from the dangerous cycle and potentially move the war back into the shadows. Here is a recent history of the conflict: August 2019: An Israeli airstrike killed two Iranian-trained militants in Syria, a drone set off a blast near a Hezbollah office in Lebanon and an airstrike in Qaim, Iraq, killed a commander of an Iran-backed Iraqi militia. Israel accused Iran at the time of trying to establish an overland arms-supply line through Iraq and northern Syria to Lebanon, and analysts said the strikes were aimed at stopping Iran and signaling to its proxies that Israel would not tolerate a fleet of smart missiles on its borders. January 2020: Israel greeted with satisfaction the assassination of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the commander of the foreign-facing arm of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, in an American drone strike in Baghdad. Iran hit back by attacking two bases in Iraq that housed American troops with a barrage of missiles, wounding about 100 U.S. military personnel. 2021-22: In July 2021, an oil tanker managed by an Israeli-owned shipping company was attacked off the coast of Oman, killing two crew members, according to the company and three Israeli officials. Two of the officials said that the attack appeared to have been carried out by Iranian drones. Iran did not explicitly claim or deny responsibility, but a state-owned television channel described the episode as a response to an Israeli strike in Syria. In November 2021, Israel killed Iran's top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, and followed up with the assassination of a Revolutionary Guards commander, Col. Sayad Khodayee, in May 2022. December 2023: After Israel's bombardment of Gaza began in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led assault, Iranian-backed militias stepped up their own attacks. And late last year, Iran accused Israel of killing a high-level military figure, Brig. Gen. Sayyed Razi Mousavi, in a missile strike in Syria. A senior adviser to the Revolutionary Guards, General Mousavi was described as having been a close associate of General Suleimani and was said to have helped oversee the shipment of arms to Hezbollah. Israel, adopting its customary stance, declined to comment directly on whether it was behind General Mousavi's death. January 2024: An explosion in a suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, killed Saleh al-Arouri, a Hamas leader, along with two commanders from that group's armed wing, the first assassination of a top Hamas official outside the West Bank and Gaza in recent years. Officials from Hamas, Lebanon and the United States ascribed the blast to Israel, which did not publicly confirm involvement. Hezbollah, which receives major support from Iran, stepped up its assaults on Israel after Mr. al-Arouri's death. Israel's military hit back at Hezbollah in Lebanon, killing several of the group's commanders. March: An Israeli drone strike hit a car in southern Lebanon, killing at least one person. Israel's military said it had killed the deputy commander of Hezbollah's rocket and missile unit. Hezbollah acknowledged the death of a man, Ali Abdulhassan Naim, but did not provide further details. The same day, airstrikes killed soldiers near Aleppo, northern Syria, in what appeared to be one of the heaviest Israeli attacks in the country in years. The strikes killed 36 Syrian soldiers, seven Hezbollah fighters and a Syrian from a pro-Iran militia, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group that tracks Syria's civil war. Israel's military did not claim responsibility. But the country's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, wrote on social media, 'We will pursue Hezbollah every place it operates and we will expand the pressure and the pace of the attacks.' April: A strike on an Iranian Embassy building in Damascus on April 1 killed three top Iranian commanders and four officers. Iran blamed Israel and vowed to hit back forcefully. Two weeks later, Tehran launched a barrage of more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel, an unexpectedly large-scale attack, although nearly all the weapons were shot down by Israel and allies. Israel said for days it would respond, before a strike on Friday hit a military air base near the central Iranian city of Isfahan.

Planet Labs PBC Iranian officials said that the Israeli strike on Friday morning was carried out by small exploding drones, a tactic that would follow a well-established pattern in Israeli attacks on Iranian military targets. As Israel has targeted Iranian defense and military officials and infrastructure, small drones — specifically ones known as quadcopters — have been a signature of those operations. Quadcopter drones, so named because they have four rotors, have a short flight range and can explode on impact. The drones might have been launched from inside Iran, whose radar systems had not detected unidentified aircraft entering Iranian airspace, Iranian officials said. If the drones were launched within the country, it demonstrates once again Israel's ability to mount clandestine operations in Iranian territory. Israel's military has not commented on Friday's strike. Though it rarely claims responsibility publicly for attacks against Iranian targets, several attacks in recent years have used drones: August 2019: Israel sent an exploding drone into the heart of a Hezbollah-dominated neighborhood in Beirut, Lebanon, to destroy what Israeli officials described as machinery used in the production of precision missiles.\nJune 2021: A quadcopter exploded outside Tehran at one of Iran's main manufacturing centers for centrifuges, which purify uranium and are used at the country's two major uranium enrichment facilities. Western officials have closely watched activity at those facilities for signs that Iran could be moving toward producing a nuclear weapon. Iran claimed that there had been no damage to the site outside Tehran, but satellite images showed evidence of significant damage.\nFebruary 2022: Six quadcopters exploded at Kermanshah, Iran's main manufacturing and storage plant for military drones.\nMay 2022: A strike targeted the highly sensitive Parchin military site outside Tehran, where Iran develops missile, nuclear and drone technology. Quadcopter drones exploded into a building, killing an engineer and injuring another person, Iranians with knowledge of the attack said at the time.\nJanuary 2023: A drone attack on an Iranian military facility in January 2023 caused a large explosion in the center of Isfahan, the city near the air base that was struck on Friday. At the time, Iran made no effort to hide the fact that an attack had happened, but said it had done little damage. Iranian state media reported that drones had targeted an ammunition manufacturing plant but had been shot down by a surface-to-air defense system. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken at a news conference in Capri, Italy, on Friday. Credit... Gregorio Borgia/Associated Press Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Friday that the United States 'has not been involved in any offensive operations' in Iran when asked about Israel's strike on the country on Friday, but he declined to comment further. Mr. Blinken spoke on the last day of a meeting of Group of 7 ministers in Capri, Italy, where the agenda was dominated by the conflict in the Middle East, including the exchanges of strikes in the past week between Israel and Iran. In remarks to reporters before departing the island, Mr. Blinken said the G7 was unified in urging de-escalation between Iran and Israel to avoid a wider war. But Mr. Blinken would not even directly confirm the Israeli strike, which appeared to be the country's first military response to Iran's attack last weekend, referring instead to 'reported events,' and he would not say whether the United States had been notified in advance of the Israeli action. Shortly before he spoke, Italy's foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, told reporters that the United States had been 'informed at the last minute' of the Israeli strike. 'But there was no involvement on the part of the United States,' Mr. Tajani said. 'It was simply information which was provided,' adding that he believed the G7's collective efforts deserved credit for 'the small scale of the event.' Mr. Tajani did not say how he knew the United States had not been notified in advance, but he had recently come from a meeting with Mr. Blinken and other G7 ministers. A senior American official said on Friday that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before its attack on Iran. The G7 weighed in collectively in a statement concluding the three-day meeting, urging countries to prevent further escalation 'in light of reports of strikes' on Friday. The G7 includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and the European Union. The statement also said that the member nations 'condemn in the strongest terms Iran's direct and unprecedented attack' on Israel. 'Israel and its people have our full solidarity and support and we reaffirm our commitment toward Israel's security,' it added. The G7 also issued a new warning to Tehran, demanding that 'Iran and its affiliated groups cease their attacks' throughout the Middle East and saying that 'we stand ready to adopt further sanctions or take other measures.' Mr. Blinken said of Iran that 'degrading its missile and drone capabilities' was a key G7 goal. Mr. Blinken also addressed the ongoing conflict in Gaza, pointing a finger at Hamas for the failure so far to reach a cease-fire deal that would include the release of Israeli prisoners. 'The only thing standing behind the Gaza people and a cease-fire is Hamas,' he said. But he also addressed a major friction point with Israel, warning against what Israel says is its planned attack on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have sought shelter from fighting elsewhere in the enclave. Israel has said an invasion of Rafah is necessary to eliminate Hamas battalions in the city. 'We cannot support a major military operation in Rafah,' Mr. Blinken said. Mr. Blinken said that protecting and caring for civilians amid such an operation was 'a monumental task for which we have yet to see a plan.' Asked about the U.S. veto on Thursday of a United Nations Security Council resolution to recognize a Palestinian state, Mr. Blinken said that while the United States supports the creation of such a state, doing so requires negotiations and that the proposed resolution 'will have no effect on actually moving things forward and achieving a Palestinian state.' He added: 'You can put something down on a piece of paper and wave it around. It has no effect. What does and can have an effect is actual diplomacy.' Mr. Blinken also noted that, under U.S. law passed by Congress, U.N. acceptance of a Palestinian member state would require 'cutting off all of our funding for the United Nations.'

Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times World leaders on Friday urged Israel and Iran to de-escalate tensions after Israel struck an Iranian military base, the latest salvo in a cycle of retaliation that has raised fears of a broader war in recent weeks. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain, whose military participated in defending Israel last weekend against Iran's missile and drone attack, told reporters, 'Significant escalation is not in anyone's interests — what we want to see is calm heads prevail across the region.' Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, told reporters during a visit to China, 'It is absolutely essential that the region remains stable and that all sides refrain from further action.' Italy's foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said the Group of 7 nations — which includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States — had changed the agenda of its meeting Friday on the resort island of Capri to 'address the Iran issue and put priority attention on the Middle East.' 'The political goal of the G7 is de-escalation,' Mr. Tajani said. The government of Jordan, which has been criticized in the Arab world for playing a role in intercepting Iran's attack last weekend, issued an especially pointed plea. 'Israeli-Iranian retaliations must end,' Ayman Safadi, Jordan's foreign minister said on Friday. He urged the international community to turn its attention back to Gaza, where six months of Israel's bombardment and ground invasion have killed over 33,000 people and led to extreme hunger in parts of the territory. 'The inhumane war on Gaza must end now,' Mr. Safadi said. 'The focus of the world must remain on ending the catastrophic aggression on Gaza.' A senior American official said on Friday that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before its attack against Iran. Israel gave the administration an alert moments before its warplanes struck the Iranian embassy complex in Damascus on April 1, but the official said the latest attack was expected given all the warnings Israel had issued during the week. 'We were not surprised,' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters. Publicly, Biden administration officials were tight-lipped about Friday's strike, refusing to comment at all about it. Administration officials were keeping quiet to avoid getting the United States pulled into the conflict between Iran and Israel, the official said. Speaking to reporters in Capri, Italy, at a meeting of foreign ministers from Group of 7 nations, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken declined to address the strike, saying only that 'the United States was not involved in any offensive operations.' He added that the G7 was urging all parties to de-escalate. Antonio Tajani, Italy's foreign minister, told reporters in Capri that the United States had been 'informed at the last minute' of the Israeli strike. Michael Crowley contributed reporting from Capri, Italy.  © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe Israeli military struck Iran early on Friday, according to two Israeli and three Iranian officials, in what appeared to be Israel's first military response to Iran's attack last weekend but one whose scope, at least initially, appeared to be limited.\nThe Iranian officials said that a strike had hit a military air base near the city of Isfahan, in central Iran. Initial reaction in both Israel and Iran was muted, which analysts said was a sign that the rivals were seeking to lower the temperature of their conflict. World leaders, who for nearly a week have urged Israel and Iran to avoid starting a broader war in the region, called for both sides to de-escalate tensions on Friday.\nThe Israeli military declined to comment on the strike. A senior U.S. official said that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before the attack. All the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\nThe explosions came less than a week after Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel — nearly all of which were shot down — in response to an April 1 strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria that killed seven Iranian officials. That attack brought the decades-long shadow war between Israel and Iran — waged on land, at sea, in air and in cyberspace — more clearly into the open.\nA Western official and two Iranian officials said that Israel used both missiles fired from warplanes and drones in the strike, suggesting that the attack included more advanced firepower than initial reports indicated. Iranian officials initially told The New York Times that the attack had been carried out only by small drones, possibly launched from inside Iran, and that radar systems had not detected unidentified aircraft entering Iranian airspace. They said that a separate group of small drones was shot down in the region of Tabriz, roughly 500 miles north of Isfahan.\nIn public, Iranian officials sought to downplay the strike. Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi, the commander in chief of Iran's army, said explosions heard early Friday in Isfahan 'were from our air defense firing at a suspicious object,' and that there had been 'no damage.' Iranian news agencies appeared keen to show that things were 'back to normal' in the city.\nPresident Ebrahim Raisi of Iran had warned that 'the tiniest act of aggression' on his country's soil would draw a response. But in the hours after Israel's strike, there have been no public calls for retribution by Iranian officials. One lawmaker, Seyed Nezamedin Mousavi, called the strike 'ridiculous,' saying it showed Israel 'is content with these ineffective actions.'\nIsfahan is one of Iran's most famous and historic cities. The area also hosts a number of Iranian military sites. Iranian media reported that nuclear facilities in Isfahan had not been hit.\nIsraeli leaders came close to ordering widespread strikes in Iran on the night Iran attacked, officials said, but the war cabinet postponed a decision. Mr. Biden and other world leaders urged Israel for days not to retaliate in a way that would inflame a wider Middle East war while it fights Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both allies of Iran.\nApril 19, 2024, 8:07 p.m. ET April 19, 2024, 8:07 p.m. ET Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, who is in New York attending U.N. meetings, told Iran's state news agency that the small quadcopter targeting a military base in Isfahan did not have casualties or damage. 'Israel is determined to portray its defeat as a victory,' Mr. Amir Abdollahian said, the most senior official to comment on the attacks and draw a link to Israel publicly.\nCredit... Angela Weiss/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The Israeli attack on an Iranian air base in Isfahan hit a crucial part of an air defense system, a New York Times analysis of satellite imagery found.\nImages showed that the precision attack at the 8th Shekari Air Base damaged or destroyed the 'flap-lid' radar, which is used in S-300 air defense systems to track incoming targets.\nThe Times used several satellite images in its analysis; the location of the damaged area was first pointed out on the social media platform X by Aurora Intel, and the findings have also been confirmed by a former U.S. government imagery analyst, Chris Biggers.\nThe radar is typically surrounded by several vehicles, including four trucks carrying missiles. Before the strike, the missiles were seen positioned next to the radar. After the strike, they had been moved and did not appear visibly damaged. It was not clear why the missiles had been moved. However, the fact that they appear undamaged indicated that the attack had a very precise target, according to Mr. Biggers.\nAn air defense system at the air base in Isfahan in October 2021.

Maxar Technologies, via Google Earth Other areas of the air base and adjacent airport also appeared to be undamaged. The precision of the strike, deep within Iran and with several sensitive sites close by, suggested Israel chose the specific and narrow target, the air defense system.\nAccording to the Missile Defense Project of the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies, Iran has acquired Russian-made S-300 air defense systems to deter Israeli and other airstrikes.\nSome Democrats are fine sending defensive weapons to Israel, but want to see some limits on offensive weapons, which could be used against civilians in Gaza. Credit... -/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images A group of left-leaning House Democrats is urging its colleagues to oppose the $26 billion aid package for Israel, hoping to maximize the number of 'no' votes from the party and send a warning to President Biden about the depth of his political coalition's discontent over his support for Israel's tactics in Gaza.\nFraming the upcoming vote as a make-or-break moral choice akin to Congress's votes to authorize and fund the Iraq war, progressive leaders in the House are working to muster a sizable bloc of Democratic opposition to the aid measure, which is expected to pass on Saturday and become law in the coming days.\n'In the wake of those votes, people came around much, much later and said, ‘We shouldn't have allowed that to go forward,'' Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington and the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said of the decades-ago debate over Iraq. 'And I think that this is that moment.'\nRepresentative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas, called it a 'defining vote,' adding, 'We're either going to participate in the carnage, or we're not.'\nThere is little doubt that the bill, which would send roughly $13 billion in military assistance to Israel as it continues its offensive in Gaza, will pass the House, along with money for Ukraine, Taiwan and other American allies.\nBut progressive Democrats estimated that 40 to 60 members of their party may oppose it on the House floor on Saturday. That would be a striking signal from Congress, where ironclad bipartisan backing for Israel has long been the norm. And it would highlight the fraught divisions the war in Gaza has sown within the Democratic Party, even as more Democrats including Mr. Biden have begun to criticize Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's approach to the conflict and urge him to better protect civilians.\nThe legislation would allocate $5 billion to Israel's defense capabilities and $9 billion for 'worldwide humanitarian aid,' including for civilians in Gaza. But it would not place further conditions on how Israel could use American military aid, nor block future arms transfers from the United States as an increasing number of Democrats have sought to do.\nDemocrats who are leading the push against the Israel aid bill said they strongly supported the Jewish state and its right to defend itself, and would vote in favor of sending military aid that supports Israel's defense capabilities, such as by replenishing the Iron Dome, David's Sling and Iron Beam defense systems. They also denounced the Oct. 7 terrorist attack by Hamas that prompted the war, and said the hostages taken by Hamas must be released.\nBut they argued that approving more offensive weaponry without conditions was an untenable moral and political position that would amount to an endorsement of Mr. Netanyahu's prosecution of the war, including his intention to invade Rafah over the objections of the Biden administration. More than 33,000 people in Gaza have been killed since the start of the conflict, according to the health ministry there, and the population is facing a hunger crisis.\n'I understand the need for defensive weapons for Israel, particularly in light of the attack by Iran,' said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, who ran his first campaign on an antiwar platform and helped lead efforts to end U.S. participation in the war in Yemen. 'But there is no justification to provide bombs and weapons to Netanyahu to continue the war in Gaza that is killing thousands of innocent Palestinian women and children.'\nSaturday's vote will recall a similar situation from 2007, when the speaker at the time, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, split a piece of spending legislation to allow Democrats to register their opposition to funding the Iraq war while backing a domestic funding bill. Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, similarly divided the foreign aid package to be considered on Saturday in order to get each element across the finish line in the face of distinct coalitions of resistance to different pieces of the bill.\nIn a critical test vote on Friday, the House agreed, 316 to 94, to bring up the package, with 39 Democrats — mostly progressives — joining 55 Republicans in opposition.\n'This is a moment for members of Congress who support a safe and secure Israel to send a message that giving Netanyahu more offensive weapons is not a path for peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians,' Representative Becca Balint, Democrat of Vermont and the first Jewish member of Congress to call for a cease-fire, said in an interview. 'To give Netanyahu more offensive weapons at this stage, I believe, is to condone the destruction of Gaza that we've seen in the last six months. And it's also a green light for an invasion of Rafah.'\nRepresentative Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat who led the opposition to funding for the Iraq war in 2007, said the conversations among Democrats in Congress opposing continued U.S. backing for the war in Gaza were 'not unlike' those that took place 17 years ago.\n'We may well be casting the vote on whether a much wider war takes place, and whether American weapons go that result in the death of thousands of innocent people,' Mr. Doggett said.\nThe Democrats who oppose the aid package for Israel represent a minority of their caucus. But they see a 'no' vote as part of a strategy to pressure Mr. Biden to condition aid and halt future offensive weapons transfers. Through many meetings, text chains and conversations with the administration, they have worked to shift the president's approach to Israel, while underscoring the electoral risks Mr. Biden faces among voters who helped power him to the White House in 2020 and are now furious over his handling of the war.\n'The only way to get a course correction is for a sizable number within the Democratic caucus to say it must shift,' Ms. Balint said.\nRepresentative Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat who has been pressing Mr. Biden to withhold offensive weapons from Israel, said a big 'no' vote would strengthen the president's hand to do so.\n'It helps the administration to have some number of Democrats express ourselves in this way,' he said.\nRepresentative Greg Casar, Democrat of Texas, said he hoped a substantial number of Democrats opposing the bill would give the Biden administration greater leverage to influence the Israeli government's approach to the war.\n'I hope this vote will show the world that there is a really significant segment of the United States that doesn't want to see expanded and widening wars,' he said.\nAn Israeli air force F-15 warplane landing at an air base in central Israel on Monday. Credit... Ohad Zwigenberg/Associated Press Israeli warplanes fired missiles on Iran during a retaliatory strike early Friday morning, one Western official and two Iranian officials said, suggesting that the attack included more advanced firepower than initial reports indicated.\nIt was not immediately clear the types of missiles used, from where they were fired, whether any were intercepted by Iran's defenses or where they landed.\nThe Western official and the Iranian officials requested anonymity to discuss classified information.\nPreviously, Iranian officials said Friday's attack on a military base in central Iran was conducted by small aerial drones, most likely launched from inside Iranian territory. A separate group of small drones, they said soon after the attack, was shot down in the region of Tabriz, roughly 500 miles north of Isfahan.\nIsrael has not publicly claimed responsibility for Friday's attack and would not comment on the use of planes or missiles.\nIsrael's strike came in response to an Iranian attack last weekend in which Iran fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel. A majority of the weapons used in that salvo were fired from Iranian territory and intercepted by Israel and its allies before causing any damage.\nBy contrast, the Iranian officials said, Iran's military did not detect anything entering Iran's airspace on Friday, including drones, missiles and aircraft. Iran's state news agency IRNA reported that no missile attacks occurred and that Iran's air defense system was not activated.\nIran's decision to launch its strike primarily from its own soil last week was perceived by Israel as an escalation in the countries' long-simmering shadow war. The Iranians believe the large salvo is helping with deterrence. Throughout the yearslong conflict, the two countries have traded clandestine attacks, including targeted assassinations, cyberattacks and conventional strikes conducted from and within third countries.\nIran's attack last week was itself prompted by an Israeli strike on April 1, in which Israeli aircraft killed several Iranian armed forces commanders in Syria.\nBy using drones seemingly launched from inside Iran's territory rather than its own, Israel hinted at a willingness to turn down the temperature on the conflict while also demonstrating an ability to conduct attacks that Iran could not detect.\nOne Iranian official, a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, said that even though the strike did little damage, the likelihood that drones were fired from under Iran's nose sent a message about Israel's capabilities.\nA guided missile fired from an undetected warplane, even if it landed outside Iranian territory, would most likely deliver a similar threat.\nOfficials from both countries remained largely quiet about Friday's attack, a gesture that appeared aimed at de-escalating a conflict some fear could spiral into a broader regional war. Israel's silence on the attack, an Iranian official said, would allow Tehran to treat the strike as it had comparable previous attacks and not prompt an immediate response.\nMahdi Mohammadi, a senior adviser to Iran's Parliament speaker, said that Israel's limited attack on Iran showed that Iran had achieved its goal of deterrence. Israel's refusal to openly claim responsibility, he said, amounts to a victory for Iran.\nIsrael's attack, he said on the messaging app Telegram, was meant to show that it had the 'capability to access Iran but in practice it also showed that it has accepted that it should not repeat its miscalculation.'\nApril 19, 2024, 2:43 p.m. ET April 19, 2024, 2:43 p.m. ET The White House maintained public silence about the Israeli strike on Iran.

Daily life appeared to return to normal in Isfahan on Friday, according to Iranian state news media and a resident who was interviewed, hours after Israel's attack on a nearby military base continued the cycle of strikes and counterstrikes between the two countries.\nBut tensions from the overnight attack reverberated through the city, and some residents described the threat of full-fledged war as crippling — despite analysts' assessment that both nations were trying to avoid further escalation.\nMehrdad, 43, an engineer from Isfahan, said the latest retaliation left him and his pregnant wife feeling stressed and unwell. He asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution.\n'The future of this country concerns me,' he said. 'I believe nothing good is expected.'\nThough he said that the city had returned 'back to its normal' and reactions from officials were muted — which he believed was to help make people feel at ease — many residents remain scared after a stressful night of explosions.\nFor the first six months of the war between Israel and Hamas, Iran's involvement in fighting had been limited to its proxies, including the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and the Yemeni Houthi militia. But after Iran's first direct strike on Israel last weekend, Mehrdad said, 'things are coming to the surface.'\nHe hoped that diplomatic mediation would put an end to the threat of war, and he worried that the county's infrastructure would be 'ruined' by further Israeli attacks.\n'Our economic situation is awful. We have 50 percent annual inflation,' he said. 'Now guess what would happen if the war materialized. What would happen to our living conditions in this country?'\nMahsa, 34, an accountant from Isfahan who also asked that her last name not be used for fear of retribution, described a tense atmosphere of fear and instability. The economy is often the main topic of conversation when people gather, she said, and many are worried about the consequences of a wider war.\n'When Iran attacked, we were all worried and we really didn't know what to expect,' she said, describing the cycle of retaliation between Israel and Iran as a 'show game.'\n'Of course, after this Israeli attack, the direction of the game will be determined,' she added. 'Either a full-scale war, or the end of this line, or just threats.'\nThe distress is crushing. Mahsa said her mental health had deteriorated, describing an instance last week when she broke down sobbing in the middle of the street for seemingly no reason while on a run. Dreams seem 'more impossible to achieve, day by day,' she said.\n'We don't have much mental energy left,' she added.\nA correction was made on : An earlier version of this article misstated the gender of Mahsa, an accountant from Isfahan, Iran.

'It appears we are out of the danger zone and, because Israel's strike was limited, it has allowed both countries to back down for now,' said Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House.\nApril 19, 2024, 11:10 a.m. ET April 19, 2024, 11:10 a.m. ET The few Iranian officials who have talked publicly about the attack have downplayed it, suggesting a bid to de-escalate.

Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times For decades, Israel and Iran have fought a shadow war across the Middle East, trading attacks by land, sea, air and in cyberspace. A recent round of strikes — mainly an aerial barrage by Iran against Israel last weekend — has brought the conflict more clearly into the open and raised fears of a broader war.\nA retaliatory Israeli strike on an Iranian air base on Friday, however, appeared limited in scope, and analysts said it suggested an effort to pull back from the dangerous cycle and potentially move the war back into the shadows.\nHere is a recent history of the conflict:\nAugust 2019: An Israeli airstrike killed two Iranian-trained militants in Syria, a drone set off a blast near a Hezbollah office in Lebanon and an airstrike in Qaim, Iraq, killed a commander of an Iran-backed Iraqi militia. Israel accused Iran at the time of trying to establish an overland arms-supply line through Iraq and northern Syria to Lebanon, and analysts said the strikes were aimed at stopping Iran and signaling to its proxies that Israel would not tolerate a fleet of smart missiles on its borders.\nAugust 2019: An Israeli airstrike killed two Iranian-trained militants in Syria, a drone set off a blast near a Hezbollah office in Lebanon and an airstrike in Qaim, Iraq, killed a commander of an Iran-backed Iraqi militia.

A senior adviser to the Revolutionary Guards, General Mousavi was described as having been a close associate of General Suleimani and was said to have helped oversee the shipment of arms to Hezbollah. Israel, adopting its customary stance, declined to comment directly on whether it was behind General Mousavi's death.\nJanuary 2024: An explosion in a suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, killed Saleh al-Arouri, a Hamas leader, along with two commanders from that group's armed wing, the first assassination of a top Hamas official outside the West Bank and Gaza in recent years.

The strikes killed 36 Syrian soldiers, seven Hezbollah fighters and a Syrian from a pro-Iran militia, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group that tracks Syria's civil war.\nIsrael's military did not claim responsibility. But the country's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, wrote on social media, 'We will pursue Hezbollah every place it operates and we will expand the pressure and the pace of the attacks.'\nApril: A strike on an Iranian Embassy building in Damascus on April 1 killed three top Iranian commanders and four officers.

Two weeks later, Tehran launched a barrage of more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel, an unexpectedly large-scale attack, although nearly all the weapons were shot down by Israel and allies. Israel said for days it would respond, before a strike on Friday hit a military air base near the central Iranian city of Isfahan.\nThis satellite image from Planet Labs PBC shows damage on the roof of an Iranian military workshop, center, after a drone attack in Isfahan, Iran, on Feb. 2. Credit... Planet Labs PBC Iranian officials said that the Israeli strike on Friday morning was carried out by small exploding drones, a tactic that would follow a well-established pattern in Israeli attacks on Iranian military targets.\nAs Israel has targeted Iranian defense and military officials and infrastructure, small drones — specifically ones known as quadcopters — have been a signature of those operations. Quadcopter drones, so named because they have four rotors, have a short flight range and can explode on impact.\nThe drones might have been launched from inside Iran, whose radar systems had not detected unidentified aircraft entering Iranian airspace, Iranian officials said. If the drones were launched within the country, it demonstrates once again Israel's ability to mount clandestine operations in Iranian territory.\nIsrael's military has not commented on Friday's strike. Though it rarely claims responsibility publicly for attacks against Iranian targets, several attacks in recent years have used drones:\nAugust 2019: Israel sent an exploding drone into the heart of a Hezbollah-dominated neighborhood in Beirut, Lebanon, to destroy what Israeli officials described as machinery used in the production of precision missiles.\nJune 2021: A quadcopter exploded outside Tehran at one of Iran's main manufacturing centers for centrifuges, which purify uranium and are used at the country's two major uranium enrichment facilities. Western officials have closely watched activity at those facilities for signs that Iran could be moving toward producing a nuclear weapon. Iran claimed that there had been no damage to the site outside Tehran, but satellite images showed evidence of significant damage.\nFebruary 2022: Six quadcopters exploded at Kermanshah, Iran's main manufacturing and storage plant for military drones.\nMay 2022: A strike targeted the highly sensitive Parchin military site outside Tehran, where Iran develops missile, nuclear and drone technology. Quadcopter drones exploded into a building, killing an engineer and injuring another person, Iranians with knowledge of the attack said at the time.\nJanuary 2023: A drone attack on an Iranian military facility in January 2023 caused a large explosion in the center of Isfahan, the city near the air base that was struck on Friday. At the time, Iran made no effort to hide the fact that an attack had happened, but said it had done little damage. Iranian state media reported that drones had targeted an ammunition manufacturing plant but had been shot down by a surface-to-air defense system.\nJanuary 2023: A drone attack on an Iranian military facility in January 2023 caused a large explosion in the center of Isfahan, the city near the air base that was struck on Friday.

Blinken at a news conference in Capri, Italy, on Friday. Credit... Gregorio Borgia/Associated Press Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Friday that the United States 'has not been involved in any offensive operations' in Iran when asked about Israel's strike on the country on Friday, but he declined to comment further.\nMr. Blinken spoke on the last day of a meeting of Group of 7 ministers in Capri, Italy, where the agenda was dominated by the conflict in the Middle East, including the exchanges of strikes in the past week between Israel and Iran. In remarks to reporters before departing the island, Mr. Blinken said the G7 was unified in urging de-escalation between Iran and Israel to avoid a wider war.\nBut Mr. Blinken would not even directly confirm the Israeli strike, which appeared to be the country's first military response to Iran's attack last weekend, referring instead to 'reported events,' and he would not say whether the United States had been notified in advance of the Israeli action. Shortly before he spoke, Italy's foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, told reporters that the United States had been 'informed at the last minute' of the Israeli strike.\n'But there was no involvement on the part of the United States,' Mr. Tajani said. 'It was simply information which was provided,' adding that he believed the G7's collective efforts deserved credit for 'the small scale of the event.'\nMr. Tajani did not say how he knew the United States had not been notified in advance, but he had recently come from a meeting with Mr. Blinken and other G7 ministers. A senior American official said on Friday that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before its attack on Iran.\nThe G7 weighed in collectively in a statement concluding the three-day meeting, urging countries to prevent further escalation 'in light of reports of strikes' on Friday. The G7 includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and the European Union.\nThe statement also said that the member nations 'condemn in the strongest terms Iran's direct and unprecedented attack' on Israel.\n'Israel and its people have our full solidarity and support and we reaffirm our commitment toward Israel's security,' it added.\nThe G7 also issued a new warning to Tehran, demanding that 'Iran and its affiliated groups cease their attacks' throughout the Middle East and saying that 'we stand ready to adopt further sanctions or take other measures.'\nMr. Blinken said of Iran that 'degrading its missile and drone capabilities' was a key G7 goal.\nMr. Blinken also addressed the ongoing conflict in Gaza, pointing a finger at Hamas for the failure so far to reach a cease-fire deal that would include the release of Israeli prisoners.\n'The only thing standing behind the Gaza people and a cease-fire is Hamas,' he said.\nBut he also addressed a major friction point with Israel, warning against what Israel says is its planned attack on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have sought shelter from fighting elsewhere in the enclave. Israel has said an invasion of Rafah is necessary to eliminate Hamas battalions in the city.\n'We cannot support a major military operation in Rafah,' Mr. Blinken said. Mr. Blinken said that protecting and caring for civilians amid such an operation was 'a monumental task for which we have yet to see a plan.'\nAsked about the U.S. veto on Thursday of a United Nations Security Council resolution to recognize a Palestinian state, Mr. Blinken said that while the United States supports the creation of such a state, doing so requires negotiations and that the proposed resolution 'will have no effect on actually moving things forward and achieving a Palestinian state.'\nHe added: 'You can put something down on a piece of paper and wave it around. It has no effect. What does and can have an effect is actual diplomacy.'\nMr. Blinken also noted that, under U.S. law passed by Congress, U.N. acceptance of a Palestinian member state would require 'cutting off all of our funding for the United Nations.'\nApril 19, 2024, 9:49 a.m. ET April 19, 2024, 9:49 a.m. ET Cassandra Vinograd\nCassandra Vinograd Reporting from Jerusalem The Iranian news media appear keen to show that things are 'back to normal' in Isfahan. The official news agency, IRNA, published a gallery of photos — people strolling, shoppers at a market, a child with a soccer ball — that it said showed 'normal life' in the city today. Flights at the Isfahan airport, which had been suspended for a few hours, have resumed, it said.\nApril 19, 2024, 9:39 a.m. ET April 19, 2024, 9:39 a.m. ET S&P Global Ratings downgraded Israel's credit rating on Thursday evening, citing the confrontation with Iran.

There has been no damage from the incident.' He said that experts were investigating the episode.\nAn anti-Israeli gathering after Friday Prayer in Tehran. Credit... Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times World leaders on Friday urged Israel and Iran to de-escalate tensions after Israel struck an Iranian military base, the latest salvo in a cycle of retaliation that has raised fears of a broader war in recent weeks.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain, whose military participated in defending Israel last weekend against Iran's missile and drone attack, told reporters, 'Significant escalation is not in anyone's interests — what we want to see is calm heads prevail across the region.'\nUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, told reporters during a visit to China, 'It is absolutely essential that the region remains stable and that all sides refrain from further action.'\nItaly's foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said the Group of 7 nations — which includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States — had changed the agenda of its meeting Friday on the resort island of Capri to 'address the Iran issue and put priority attention on the Middle East.'\n'The political goal of the G7 is de-escalation,' Mr. Tajani said.\nThe government of Jordan, which has been criticized in the Arab world for playing a role in intercepting Iran's attack last weekend, issued an especially pointed plea.\n'Israeli-Iranian retaliations must end,' Ayman Safadi, Jordan's foreign minister said on Friday. He urged the international community to turn its attention back to Gaza, where six months of Israel's bombardment and ground invasion have killed over 33,000 people and led to extreme hunger in parts of the territory.\n'The inhumane war on Gaza must end now,' Mr. Safadi said. 'The focus of the world must remain on ending the catastrophic aggression on Gaza.'\nA senior American official said on Friday that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before its attack against Iran.\nIsrael gave the administration an alert moments before its warplanes struck the Iranian embassy complex in Damascus on April 1, but the official said the latest attack was expected given all the warnings Israel had issued during the week.\n'We were not surprised,' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters.\nPublicly, Biden administration officials were tight-lipped about Friday's strike, refusing to comment at all about it. Administration officials were keeping quiet to avoid getting the United States pulled into the conflict between Iran and Israel, the official said.\nSpeaking to reporters in Capri, Italy, at a meeting of foreign ministers from Group of 7 nations, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken declined to address the strike, saying only that 'the United States was not involved in any offensive operations.' He added that the G7 was urging all parties to de-escalate.\nAntonio Tajani, Italy's foreign minister, told reporters in Capri that the United States had been 'informed at the last minute' of the Israeli strike.\nMichael Crowley contributed reporting from Capri, Italy.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences",

Israel said almost nothing about the limited strike, which appeared to do little damage in Iran. U.S. officials noted that the Iranian decision to downplay the explosions in Isfahan — and the suggestions by Iranian officials that Israel may not have been responsible — was a clear effort by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps to avoid another round of escalation.\nInside the White House, officials asked the Pentagon, State Department and intelligence agencies to stay quiet about the operation, hoping to ease Iran's efforts to calm the tensions in the region.\nBut in interviews, officials quickly added they worried that relations between Israel and Iran were now in a very different place than they had been just a week ago. The taboo against direct strikes on each other's territory was now gone. If there is another round — a conflict over Iran's nuclear advances, or another strike by Israel on Iranian military officers — both sides might feel more free to launch directly at the other.\nMr. Netanyahu was under competing pressures: President Biden was urging him to 'take the win' after a largely ineffective aerial barrage launched by Iran last week, while hard-liners in Israel were urging him to strike back hard to re-establish deterrence after the first direct effort to strike Israel from Iranian territory in the 45 years since the Iranian revolution.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index Explosions were heard early on Friday near the Iranian city of Isfahan, according an Iranian news agency affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. The agency, Fars News, said the cause of the explosions was not immediately clear. The agency said the explosions were heard in Qahjavarestan, a small city in west-central Iran close to Isfahan airport. Flight tracking websites showed that civilian planes had diverted their routes away from the area. The explosions came five days after Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel, its first direct attack on the country, in response to an Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria that killed seven Iranian officials on April 1. For days, Israeli leaders have threatened to respond to Iran's strikes, which turned the two countries' yearslong shadow war into a direct confrontation. The Israeli military declined to comment about the explosions on Friday in Iran. Iran's army chief, Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi, said on Wednesday that Iran would respond to any Israeli aggression, according to remarks carried by the IRNA state news agency. President Biden has advised Israel against responding, amid fears that an Israeli counterattack would escalate into an all-out war. For more than six months, Israel has been fighting on two other fronts — against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Both are allies of Iran.

Mohammed Salem/Reuters President Biden's team sought again on Thursday to put the brakes on Israeli plans for a major military assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, prompting the Israelis to agree to rethink their approach and come back for further consultations, the White House said in a statement. During a virtual meeting led by Jake Sullivan, the president's national security adviser, the American side evaluated options for the attack presented by Israel but was not convinced that those plans met Mr. Biden's insistence that any operation be calibrated to minimize civilian casualties, according to the White House statement. The two sides agreed to 'meet again soon,' the statement said. The meeting was convened just days after the United States came to Israel's defense against a barrage of more than 300 missiles and drones fired by Iran; Israeli, U.S. and other allied forces knocked down nearly all of the incoming Iranian weapons, resulting in little damage and no fatalities. Despite that close collaboration, though, the discussion on Thursday underscored that the two sides remained at odds over Israel's conduct of the war against Hamas in Gaza more than six months after the Oct. 7 terrorist attack. 'U.S. participants expressed concerns with various courses of action in Rafah, and Israeli participants agreed to take these concerns into account and to have further follow up discussions between experts,' the White House statement said. The statement did not elaborate on the specific concerns. The Israeli side was led by Ron Dermer, a close adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and member of the Israeli war cabinet, and Tzachi Hanegbi, the prime minister's national security adviser. The group discussed the Iran attack and efforts to defend Israel against future threats. The White House statement emphasized that the United States shared Israel's goal 'to see Hamas defeated in Rafah,' but the president has resisted a ground operation out of fear of the consequences for more than 1 million Palestinians who have taken refuge there.

Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times Negotiations for a cease-fire and the release of Israeli hostages have stalled because Hamas rejected the latest proposal put forth by Israel, Qatar and Egypt, the C.I.A. director said Thursday, putting the blame for a lack of progress in talks squarely on the group that led the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Earlier this month, William J. Burns, C.I.A. director and lead American negotiator, traveled to Cairo and pushed what he called 'a far-reaching proposal' that Egyptian and Qatari negotiators took to Hamas. The proposal contained an offer to allow some Gazans to return to the northern part of the enclave, a key Hamas demand. While Mr. Burns did not describe the details of that proposal, he said that so far Hamas has not accepted it. 'It was a deep disappointment to get a negative reaction from Hamas,' said Mr. Burns, speaking at the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas. 'Right now, it's that negative reaction that really is standing in the way of innocent civilians in Gaza getting humanitarian relief that they so desperately need.' Last Sunday, Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, expressed regret that Hamas had rejected the proposal and argued it proved that the group was not interested in reaching a deal. Other American officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations, have said Hamas has signaled that it does not have enough women and civilian hostages in its control to consummate the first part of the deal, which would release 40 hostages over six weeks in return for a large number of Palestinian prisoners. A senior Hamas official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said there were not enough living civilian hostages left who met Israel's criteria to reach their proposed figure of 40 hostages over six weeks. He accused Israel of seeking to free captive soldiers for a lower price than that demanded by the group. Hamas has said most soldiers would be released in a later phase of a cease-fire deal. In its latest proposal to negotiators, Hamas called for releasing fewer than 20 living hostages as part of an initial, six-week phase cease-fire deal, according to two Israeli officials familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Israel had hoped to see wounded and ill hostages freed, but Hamas was insisting on a far more narrow definition limited to the elderly and women, one of the officials said. Last year, Mr. Burns helped guide talks that led to the release of roughly 100 hostages in return for a temporary halt in fighting and the release of Palestinian prisoners. Mr. Burns said he could not guarantee that the current talks would succeed. 'And it breaks your heart because you can see in very human terms what's at stake here as well,' he said. Mr. Burns also reiterated the Biden administration's desire that Israel not escalate its conflict with Iran, after what he called a failed Iranian attack last weekend. Instead, he said President Biden and other policymakers hope that 'we'll all find a way to de-escalate the situation.' 'I know the Israeli government, as we sit here this afternoon, is considering a response to what happened last Saturday night,' Mr. Burns said. 'And you know, that's their choice to make that response.' But Mr. Burns said the Israelis had 'clearly demonstrated their superiority' with shooting down Iranian drones and missiles. He said of 330 drones and missiles launched by Iran, only four or five hit the ground in Israel. 'And none of them did any significant damage,' he said. 'It's a reminder of the quality of the Israeli military. It's a reminder of the fact that the Israelis have friends, starting with the United States.' Palestinians rallied in Hebron, West Bank, to support the bid for statehood in 2011. Credit... Rina Castelnuovo for The New York Times A draft resolution that the United States vetoed at the U.N. Security Council on Thursday afternoon was the latest frustrated effort in a long-running campaign to secure recognition for Palestinian statehood. Still, that the matter made it to a Security Council vote at all reflects how the debate over Palestinian statehood has been reinvigorated by the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The United Nations voted in 1947 to create an independent Arab state alongside a Jewish one, but the plan was rejected by neighboring Arab governments and Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel was founded amid a war the following year. In the years since, plans for a two-state solution have been repeatedly proposed and stymied. Here's a look at some of the Palestinian efforts to gain recognition. Palestine became a member of UNESCO in 2011 but a bid for full U.N. membership failed. The next year, Palestine was granted the lesser status of observer at the United Nations, a level shared by the Holy See. Observers can participate in U.N. General Assembly sessions but are not allowed to vote. They also can join the International Court of Justice, which is currently hearing a case on the legality of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories. Palestine is also party to a number of treaties, and became a member of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2018.

Clary/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images With the war raging in Gaza, the Palestinian Authority asked the United Nations to take up its bid a second time. Last Monday, as the war entered its seventh month, the Security Council agreed to reopen the application. The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, called it 'a historic moment again' and said that it was high time for the world body to recognize Palestinian statehood. That, he said, would 'open the door slightly in the direction of peace.' About 140 countries have gone on record in support of the Palestinian bid that reached the Security Council on Thursday. To succeed, the application needed the votes of at least nine of the 15 member countries, and no veto by any of its five permanent members. It received 12 votes, but the United States — which has a longstanding policy that Palestinian statehood must come as part of a negotiated agreement with Israel — used its veto power as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. Already, 138 of the 193 sovereign states that belong to the United Nations recognize Palestinian statehood, according to the World Population Review, including Russia and China — both permanent members of the Security Council. While the European Union itself does not recognize the state of Palestine, nearly a third of the bloc's 28 members do. The Vatican has also recognized Palestinian statehood.

Lynsey Addario for The New York Times Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has doubled down on his opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state, rebuffing pressure from President Biden to agree to that path after the war in Gaza ends. But as the death toll has climbed in Gaza, the push for Palestinian statehood has intensified. Allies like Canada, France and Britain have long shared the Biden administration's stance about the need for a two-state solution negotiated with Israel. But some have in recent months suggested that they might recognize a Palestinian state sooner. David Cameron, Britain's foreign secretary, signaled in January that Britain was willing to move up conversations about formally recognizing a Palestinian state, saying that his country and other allies should show Palestinians 'irreversible progress' toward that long-sought goal. In February, President Emmanuel Macron of France said, 'Recognition of a Palestinian state is not a taboo for France.' It was unclear whether Mr. Macron was referring to France's longstanding support for a two-state solution in general or to the idea of giving recognition before any negotiated agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians. And last month, the leaders of Spain, Ireland, Malta and Slovenia issued a joint statement saying that they had 'discussed together our readiness to recognize Palestine and said that we would do so when it can make a positive contribution and the circumstances are right.' The Security Council has consistently called for a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Credit... Angela Weiss/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The United States blocked the U.N. Security Council on Thursday from moving forward on a Palestinian bid to be recognized as a full member state at the United Nations, quashing an effort by Palestinian allies to get the world body to back the effort. The Palestinian envoy to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, was visibly emotional after the vote, asking, 'What will you do — you, the international Security Council that is charged with the maintenance of international peace and security? What are you doing to do? What are you willing to do?' The Security Council has consistently called for a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, a result that has failed to materialize during negotiations between the two sides. In Washington, a spokesman for the State Department, Vedant Patel, said before the vote that the statehood resolution was dead on arrival. 'It remains the U.S. view that the most expeditious path toward statehood for the Palestinian people is through direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority with the support of the United States and other partners,' Mr. Patel told reporters at a news briefing on Thursday. The United States, along with the four other permanent members of the Council, can veto any action before it. Israel's foreign minister, Israel Katz, praised the U.S. decision to block the proposal on Thursday, saying, 'The shameful proposal was rejected. Terrorism will not be rewarded.' The resolution had asked the 15-member Security Council to recommend to the 193-member U.N. General Assembly that 'the State of Palestine be admitted to membership of the United Nations,' diplomats said. China was one of 12 countries that voted in favor of the proposal, and its ambassador to the United Nations, Fu Cong, said he found the U.S. veto 'most disappointing.' 'The decade-long dream of the Palestinian people ruthlessly dashed,' he said. Two countries, Britain and Switzerland, abstained from the vote, saying they supported a two-state solution but that the war in Gaza must be resolved first. 'We must keep our focus on securing an immediate pause in order to get aid in and hostages out, ' said Barbara Woodward, Britain's ambassador to the U.N. Israel was admitted as a full U.N. member in 1949. The Palestinian Authority has been seeking a state made up of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip for decades; those territories have all been captured or annexed by Israel. The Arab League founded the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1964 with a charter stressing self-determination for Palestinians and the rejection of the creation of the State of Israel. Little progress has been made on achieving statehood since Israel and the Palestinian Authority signed the Oslo Accords in the early 1990s, which established a peace process aimed at a two-state solution. In 2007, the militant group Hamas drove the Palestinian Authority — which President Mahmoud Abbas leads and which exercises limited self-rule in the occupied West Bank — from power in the Gaza Strip. Complicating the Palestinian application for statehood is the war that began when Hamas led terrorist attacks on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and prompted Israel's retaliatory attacks in Gaza. That war has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to the Gazan health ministry. The conflict has spilled into the occupied West Bank and neighboring countries like Lebanon and has drawn Iran into the fray. Anushka Patil contributed reporting. President Biden said in a statement that the sanctions aimed to 'further degrade Iran's military industries.' Credit... Al Drago for The New York Times The United States and Britain on Thursday imposed new sanctions on Iranian military leaders and weapon manufacturers to punish Tehran for its missile and drone attack on Israel last weekend, even as they implored Israeli officials not to retaliate too strongly and set off a wider war. White House officials said the sanctions were aimed at disrupting Iran's ability to produce the unmanned aerial vehicles that its military used to attack Israel by cutting off global financial transactions with companies and individuals involved in building them. The sanctions will also try to block exports by Iran's steel industry that bring Tehran billions of dollars in revenue, they said. President Biden said in a statement that the sanctions would 'further degrade Iran's military industries,' adding: 'Let it be clear to all those who enable or support Iran's attacks: The United States is committed to Israel's security.' In a coordinated move, Britain said it had imposed sanctions on seven people and six entities linked to Iran's regional military activity and its attack on Israel, which Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called a 'reckless act and a dangerous escalation.' 'These sanctions — announced with the U.S. — show we unequivocally condemn this behavior, and they will further limit Iran's ability to destabilize the region,' Mr. Sunak said in a statement. Earlier Thursday, the president of the European Council announced that new European Union sanctions would be imposed on Iran's drone and missile programs in an effort 'to isolate Iran.' The United States and European allies have been looking for ways to punish Iran while urging Israel not to retaliate in a way that could inflame a wider Middle East conflict. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that Israel will not let outside pressure determine its response, saying on Wednesday, 'We will make our own decisions.' Israel welcomed the announcement of new sanctions, with Foreign Minister Israel Katz thanking Mr. Biden 'for his ironclad commitment to Israel's security.' 'This is our opportunity to form a global front and a regional coalition against Iran, together with the US, the EU, and moderate Arab states, to stop the serpent's head that threatens global stability,' Mr. Katz wrote on social media. 'We must stop Iran now before it's too late.' But it is unclear whether the new sanctions will prove more effective at degrading the Iranian military drone program than previous U.S. efforts. Last October, the Biden administration announced similar sanctions on the Iranian drone program, which officials said at the time were aimed at frustrating Iran's ability to produce just the kind of weapons that it used against Israel in the recent attacks. In a statement at the time, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said those penalties on several individuals and companies were meant to address 'one of the greatest challenges to international peace and security.' The attack on Israel over the weekend suggests that Iran's military has found ways around the previous sanctions. In his statement, Mr. Biden acknowledged the history of sanctions and vowed to continue increasing the pressure on Iran. 'During my administration, the United States has sanctioned over 600 individuals and entities — including Iran and its proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and Kataib Hezbollah,' he said, listing armed groups that Iran supports in the Middle East. 'And we will keep at it. As Israel's war cabinet continues to weigh a possible response to Iran — whose attack was itself in retaliation for a deadly April 1 strike against an Iranian Embassy building in Syria — Tehran has warned it will act harshly against any aggression. Maj. Gen. Ahmad Haghtalab, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps commander in charge of protecting Iran's nuclear sites, said that if Israel were to hit one of those targets, 'the hands are on the trigger' to strike Israeli nuclear facilities in response, according to remarks carried by Iranian state news media.

General Assembly that 'the State of Palestine be admitted to membership of the United Nations,' diplomats said.\nChina was one of 12 countries that voted in favor of the proposal, and its ambassador to the United Nations, Fu Cong, said he found the U.S. veto 'most disappointing.'\n'The decade-long dream of the Palestinian people ruthlessly dashed,' he said.\nTwo countries, Britain and Switzerland, abstained from the vote, saying they supported a two-state solution but that the war in Gaza must be resolved first.\n'We must keep our focus on securing an immediate pause in order to get aid in and hostages out, ' said Barbara Woodward, Britain's ambassador to the U.N.\nIsrael was admitted as a full U.N. member in 1949. The Palestinian Authority has been seeking a state made up of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip for decades; those territories have all been captured or annexed by Israel. The Arab League founded the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1964 with a charter stressing self-determination for Palestinians and the rejection of the creation of the State of Israel.\nLittle progress has been made on achieving statehood since Israel and the Palestinian Authority signed the Oslo Accords in the early 1990s, which established a peace process aimed at a two-state solution. In 2007, the militant group Hamas drove the Palestinian Authority — which President Mahmoud Abbas leads and which exercises limited self-rule in the occupied West Bank — from power in the Gaza Strip.\nComplicating the Palestinian application for statehood is the war that began when Hamas led terrorist attacks on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and prompted Israel's retaliatory attacks in Gaza. That war has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to the Gazan health ministry. The conflict has spilled into the occupied West Bank and neighboring countries like Lebanon and has drawn Iran into the fray.\nAnushka Patil contributed reporting.\nPresident Biden said in a statement that the sanctions aimed to 'further degrade Iran's military industries.' Credit... Al Drago for The New York Times The United States and Britain on Thursday imposed new sanctions on Iranian military leaders and weapon manufacturers to punish Tehran for its missile and drone attack on Israel last weekend, even as they implored Israeli officials not to retaliate too strongly and set off a wider war.\nWhite House officials said the sanctions were aimed at disrupting Iran's ability to produce the unmanned aerial vehicles that its military used to attack Israel by cutting off global financial transactions with companies and individuals involved in building them. The sanctions will also try to block exports by Iran's steel industry that bring Tehran billions of dollars in revenue, they said.\nPresident Biden said in a statement that the sanctions would 'further degrade Iran's military industries,' adding: 'Let it be clear to all those who enable or support Iran's attacks: The United States is committed to Israel's security.'\nIn a coordinated move, Britain said it had imposed sanctions on seven people and six entities linked to Iran's regional military activity and its attack on Israel, which Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called a 'reckless act and a dangerous escalation.'\n'These sanctions — announced with the U.S. — show we unequivocally condemn this behavior, and they will further limit Iran's ability to destabilize the region,' Mr. Sunak said in a statement.\nEarlier Thursday, the president of the European Council announced that new European Union sanctions would be imposed on Iran's drone and missile programs in an effort 'to isolate Iran.'\nThe United States and European allies have been looking for ways to punish Iran while urging Israel not to retaliate in a way that could inflame a wider Middle East conflict. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that Israel will not let outside pressure determine its response, saying on Wednesday, 'We will make our own decisions.'\nIsrael welcomed the announcement of new sanctions, with Foreign Minister Israel Katz thanking Mr. Biden 'for his ironclad commitment to Israel's security.'\n'This is our opportunity to form a global front and a regional coalition against Iran, together with the US, the EU, and moderate Arab states, to stop the serpent's head that threatens global stability,' Mr. Katz wrote on social media. 'We must stop Iran now before it's too late.'\nBut it is unclear whether the new sanctions will prove more effective at degrading the Iranian military drone program than previous U.S. efforts.\nLast October, the Biden administration announced similar sanctions on the Iranian drone program, which officials said at the time were aimed at frustrating Iran's ability to produce just the kind of weapons that it used against Israel in the recent attacks.\nIn a statement at the time, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said those penalties on several individuals and companies were meant to address 'one of the greatest challenges to international peace and security.'\nThe attack on Israel over the weekend suggests that Iran's military has found ways around the previous sanctions.\nIn his statement, Mr. Biden acknowledged the history of sanctions and vowed to continue increasing the pressure on Iran.\n'During my administration, the United States has sanctioned over 600 individuals and entities — including Iran and its proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and Kataib Hezbollah,' he said, listing armed groups that Iran supports in the Middle East. 'And we will keep at it.\nAs Israel's war cabinet continues to weigh a possible response to Iran — whose attack was itself in retaliation for a deadly April 1 strike against an Iranian Embassy building in Syria — Tehran has warned it will act harshly against any aggression.\nMaj. Gen. Ahmad Haghtalab, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps commander in charge of protecting Iran's nuclear sites, said that if Israel were to hit one of those targets, 'the hands are on the trigger' to strike Israeli nuclear facilities in response, according to remarks carried by Iranian state news media.\nLara Jakes, Matthew Mpoke Bigg and Farnaz Fassihi contributed reporting.\nA correction was made on : An earlier version of this article misstated the date of Iran's attack on Israel. It was over the weekend, not on Friday.\nHow we handle corrections\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences",

            "summary": "Israel was mere moments away from an airstrike on April 1 that killed several senior Iranian commanders at Iran's embassy complex in Syria when it told the United States what was about to happen.\nIsrael's closest ally had just been caught off guard.\nAides quickly alerted Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national security adviser; Jon Finer, the deputy national security adviser; Brett McGurk, Mr. Biden's Middle East coordinator; and others, who saw that the strike could have serious consequences, a U.S. official said. Publicly, U.S. officials voiced support for Israel, but privately, they expressed anger that it would take such aggressive action against Iran without consulting Washington.\nThe Israelis had badly miscalculated, thinking that Iran would not react strongly, according to multiple American officials who were involved in high-level discussions after the attack, a view shared by a senior Israeli official. On Saturday, Iran launched a retaliatory barrage of more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel, an unexpectedly large-scale response, if one that did minimal damage.\nThe events made clear that the unwritten rules of engagement in the long-simmering conflict between Israel and Iran have changed drastically in recent months, making it harder than ever for each side to gauge the other's intentions and reactions.\nSince the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, an Iranian ally, and Israel's subsequent bombardment of the Gaza Strip, there has been escalation after escalation and miscalculation after miscalculation, raising fears of a retribution cycle that could potentially become an all-out war.\nEven after it became clear that Iran would retaliate, U.S. and Israeli officials initially thought the scale of the response would be fairly limited, before scrambling to revise their assessment again and again. Now the focus is on what Israel will do next — and how Iran might respond.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Ms. Lee's primary is one of the first down-ballot electoral tests of the Israel-Gaza conflict this year.\n'To fight for common sense in the House is to often be alone. I have seen Summer walk alone,' Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. 'On Tuesday, what we must do is show her and show the world and show the people in that big white house that she is not alone.'\n'It's not about winning — it's about winning big,' she added.\nMs. Lee won a close primary in 2022 against a moderate challenger on her way to become the first Black woman to represent Pennsylvania in Congress. She has garnered broad support from Democrats this year. Even so, she has also faced pressure within her district after becoming one of the first members of Congress to call for an immediate cease-fire, just over a week after Hamas attacked Israel, and Israel responded with a military assault on Gaza.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "For decades, Israel and Iran have fought a shadow war across the Middle East, trading attacks by land, sea, air and in cyberspace. A recent round of strikes — mainly an aerial barrage by Iran against Israel last weekend — has brought the conflict more clearly into the open and raised fears of a broader war.\nA retaliatory Israeli strike on an Iranian air base on Friday, however, appeared limited in scope, and analysts said it suggested an effort to pull back from the dangerous cycle and potentially move the war back into the shadows.\nHere is a recent history of the conflict:\nAugust 2019: An Israeli airstrike killed two Iranian-trained militants in Syria, a drone set off a blast near a Hezbollah office in Lebanon and an airstrike in Qaim, Iraq, killed a commander of an Iran-backed Iraqi militia. Israel accused Iran at the time of trying to establish an overland arms-supply line through Iraq and northern Syria to Lebanon, and analysts said the strikes were aimed at stopping Iran and signaling to its proxies that Israel would not tolerate a fleet of smart missiles on its borders.\nAugust 2019: An Israeli airstrike killed two Iranian-trained militants in Syria, a drone set off a blast near a Hezbollah office in Lebanon and an airstrike in Qaim, Iraq, killed a commander of an Iran-backed Iraqi militia.

            "summary": "The Israel pavilion at the Venice Biennale is closed this year, since its creative team decided not to exhibit work until there was a cease-fire and hostage deal in Gaza, but it was nonetheless the site of a large demonstration on Wednesday that drew more than 100 protesters.\n'Viva, viva Palestina!' the protesters chanted as they marched through the gardens where much of the Biennale takes place. The protest was organized by a mix of artists involved in the Biennale and activists not affiliated with the event. 'We gather as arts workers to refuse silence,' one demonstrator shouted to a crowd of onlookers.\nTensions surfaced in February, when activist groups began calling on the Biennale to ban Israel from the event over its conduct of the war in Gaza. Since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks in Israel, in which Israeli officials said about 1,200 people were killed and 240 taken hostage, and Israel's campaign in Gaza, which the authorities there say has killed more than 33,000 people, protests have rippled through the art world.\nThe Biennale's organizers and Italy's government affirmed Israel's right to participate this year, but when the media preview began on Tuesday, visitors to the pavilion found the doors locked. Ruth Patir, the artist chosen to represent Israel at the Biennale, had refused to open her exhibition, posting a sign on the window that the pavilion would remain shut until 'a cease-fire and hostage release agreement is reached.'\nBut Patir's action was not enough to calm the discontent among many artists at the event, which opens to the public on Saturday. During the preview week, attendance is restricted to art world figures, including artists, curators, gallerists and critics.\n'I think it is the right place to make a protest,' said Maj Hasager, the rector of the Malmo Art Academy in Sweden, who watched the protest. 'We need to lay out the different positions, and there is no Palestine pavilion,' she added.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Global stocks are in the green and oil prices have retreated from last week's gains after Iran's unprecedented drone and missile attack on Israel was mostly neutralized in the skies. But the calm could be short lived, as world leaders and markets focus on Israel's response.\nMilitary clashes don't always sink the markets, as was the case when Hamas attacked Israel in October and Israel retaliated.

The package, which now goes to the Senate, is almost certain to become law.\nThe Senate passed similar legislation in February. But in the face of distinct bases of opposition to different elements of the legislation, which threatened to tank the package as a whole, Speaker Mike Johnson advanced the foreign aid using a convoluted strategy: It split the package into three parts, each of which received its own vote, added a fourth bill with Republican priorities as a sweetener and melded it all together again once everything passed.\nThe plan, laid out in a rule that passed on Friday, was concocted to capitalize on the pools of support for each part of the $95.3 billion package, while preventing opposition to any one piece from taking down all of them.\nNote: Progressive Democrats are members of the House Progressive Caucus. Hard-right Republicans include members who were supported by the House Freedom Fund during the 2022 midterms, opposed Kevin McCarthy's election as speaker in January 2023, or voted to oust Mr. McCarthy from the speakership last October. The fund is the campaign arm of the House Freedom Caucus, a hard-right faction founded in 2015.\nA majority of Republicans voted against Ukraine aid on Saturday in a reflection of the stiff resistance within the G.O.P. to continuing to aid Ukraine against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia's invasion. The coalition that voted against the bill spanned right-wing members of the House Freedom Caucus to leadership, such as Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, the No. 3 House Republican. On Israel aid, on the other hand, most Republicans voted 'yes.'\nThirty-four right-wing Republicans also opposed aid to American allies in the Indo-Pacific, while Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, declined to take a yes-or-no position and voted 'present.' Representative Bob Good, Republican of Virginia and the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, was one of the 21 members of his party who voted against the Israel package. Echoing one of the many grievances shared by hard-right Republicans who opposed all of the aid measures, Mr. Good said his support for 'Israel's right to defend itself remains unshakeable' but that he disagreed with a measure that would add to the nation's debt.\nWhile all Democrats voted in favor of aid to Ukraine and all but Ms. Tlaib supported funding to Taiwan, 37 left-leaning Democrats defected to vote against the Israel aid bill. They said before the vote that they opposed unfettered aid to Israel that could be used in its offensive in Gaza. The opposition to the Israel aid bill represented a minority of Democrats, but reflected the deep resistance to unfettered aid and the divisions in the party on Gaza. Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, represented a notable new 'no' vote among Republicans, and other standouts included Representatives Donald S. Beyer Jr. of Virginia, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon and John Garamendi of California.\nStill, 37 'no' votes, while a break from Washington's ironclad support for the Jewish state, fell short of the opposition bloc progressives had hoped to muster. Thirty-nine Democrats had voted 'no' on Friday on the rule to allow the foreign aid package to come to the House floor, a target that progressives just missed on Saturday on the Israel bill. Fourteen of those Democrats voted on Saturday in favor of aid to Israel, while 12 Democrats who voted to allow the package on the floor on Friday then cast votes against the funding itself.\nTwenty-five Republicans voted against the fourth bill, which included measures that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the United States and that would redirect funds from seized Russian assets to help aid Ukraine. Democrats put up a big vote — 174 — in favor on this bill, which was intended to sweeten the overall package for conservatives.",

'Let it be clear to all those who enable or support Iran's attacks: The United States is committed to Israel's security.'\nBritain said it had imposed sanctions on seven people and six entities linked to Iran's regional military activity and its attack on Israel, which Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called a 'reckless act and a dangerous escalation.'\n'These sanctions — announced with the U.S. — show we unequivocally condemn this behavior, and they will further limit Iran's ability to destabilize the region,' Mr. Sunak said in a statement.\n'Let it be clear to all those who enable or support Iran's attacks: The United States is committed to Israel's security.'

Some of them, like the Houthis, threaten Arab governments as well.\nBut the Iranian drone and missile attack on Israel over the weekend, which put the entire region on alert, made the new reality unavoidable: Unlike past Israeli-Palestinian conflicts, and even those involving Israel and Lebanon or Syria, this one keeps expanding.\n'Part of why these wars were contained was that they were not a direct confrontation between Israel and Iran,' said Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute. 'But now we are entering this era where a direct confrontation between Israel and Iran — that could drag the region into the conflict and that could drag the U.S. in — now that prospect of a regional war is going to be on the table all the time.'\nFor the moment, the only countervailing force is the desire of both the United States and its longtime foe Iran to avoid a widening of the conflict, said Joost Hiltermann, the International Crisis Group's program director for the Middle East and North Africa.\n'I am heartened by the fact that the only ones who want a war are Israel and Hamas,' he said. 'The Iranians are still talking to the Americans,' he said, referring to messages sent in recent days between the two by intermediaries including Switzerland and Oman.\nThe Iranian message, said Mr. Hiltermann, made clear they were looking to demonstrate their power, not expand the war. 'They said, ‘There is going to be an attack, but we are going to keep it limited.''\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "excerpt": "Rishi Sunak said the government in Tehran was 'intent on sowing chaos' in the region, but he also called for restraint from 'all sides.'",
            "summary": "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain on Monday combined a strong condemnation of Iran's weekend attack on Israel with a call for restraint from 'all sides,' adding that he was working with allies to lower tensions in the region.\nSpeaking to the British Parliament, Mr. Sunak described Iran's assault as a 'reckless and dangerous escalation,' confirmed that British planes had destroyed an undisclosed number of Iranian drones, and said that — faced with such threats — 'Israel has our full support.'\nBut in a finely calibrated set of comments to lawmakers, Mr. Sunak also said that 'all sides must show restraint.' He said he plans to speak soon by phone with his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, and added: 'We are working urgently with our allies to de-escalate the situation and prevent further bloodshed. We want to see calmer heads prevail.'\nBritish condemnation of Iran was clear. Mr. Sunak said the government in Tehran was 'intent on sowing chaos' in the region, and had shown its 'true colors.'\nBut in a two-hour question and answer session, Mr. Sunak urged restraint on Israel as it considers its next steps, noting that the government in Tehran was increasingly isolated on the international stage. Given that Iranian drones and missiles mainly failed to reach their targets, Mr. Sunak urged Israel to 'take the win and avoid further escalation.'\nEarlier, in an interview with Sky News, Britain's foreign secretary, David Cameron, also condemned Iran but appeared to concede that the Iranians had the right to respond to a missile strike on April 1 on its embassy compound in Syria, which killed top commanders in Iran's armed forces and has been widely blamed on Israel.\nAsked what Britain would do if one of its consular buildings were attacked, Mr. Cameron said that it 'would take very strong action,' adding that 'countries have the right to respond when they feel they have suffered an aggression.'\nBut Mr. Cameron also described Iran's reaction as disproportionate. 'Look at the scale of that response, had those weapons not been shot down there would have been thousands of casualties,' he said.\nIn Parliament, Mr. Sunak faced relatively little direct criticism over Britain's role in the defense of Israel, and several lawmakers pressed him to take further action and proscribe Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist group.\nThere was a continuing focus on the plight of Palestinians in Gaza, however. Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said that while he supported British military involvement, and that there was no justification for Iran's actions, 'we cannot be naïve to the fact that one of the drivers of tension in the region is the ongoing war in Gaza.'\n'I urge the government again to use every ounce of diplomatic leverage that we have, to make sure aid to Gaza is unimpeded and drastically scaled up,' he added.",

            "summary": "In the early hours of Friday, Mehrdad, an engineer in Isfahan, Iran, woke to the sound of explosions rattling the windows and shaking the ground. In Tehran, passengers about to board flights were abruptly told the airspace was closed.\nIsrael, they soon learned, had attacked Iran.\nAs booms and gunfire went off in the distance, Mehrdad, 43, came to realize that the Israelis' target was a military base on the outskirts of the city. He and his pregnant wife remained fearful that war would break out, he said in an interview by phone.\n'I think Israel wanted to test the water and evaluate with last night's strikes,' said Mehrdad, who, like others interviewed for this article, asked that his last name be withheld for fear of retribution. 'I fear the worst is coming, but I also hope that things end here.'\nSo, apparently, does the Iranian government, which after a week of promising a forceful response to any Israeli attack on Iranian territory, appeared to be standing down from nearly going to the brink of war with Israel. Facing deep economic troubles and a restive population, the government seems to have adopted a two-track policy, analysts say, declaring victory over Israel and cracking down at home.\n'The external and internal challenges are two sides of the same coin for the establishment,' Abbas Abdi, a prominent analyst and writer in Tehran, said in a telephone interview. 'With both Israel and internal dissent, they are taking an aggressive approach because they think both issues have reached a boiling point where if they do nothing it will only get worse.'\nThe tit-for-tat attacks between Iran and Israel over the past three weeks were a startling and worrisome departure from the shadow warfare they have waged for decades, raising fears of a regional war. Iran responded to a deadly Israeli attack on its embassy compound in Damascus, Syria, by launching a barrage of more than 300 drones and missiles directly at Israel for the first time. A majority of them were intercepted.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Two weeks ago, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain was facing a chorus of calls to cut off arms shipments to Israel because of its devastating war in Gaza. On Monday, Mr. Sunak saluted the British warplanes that had shot down several Iranian drones as part of a successful campaign to thwart Iran's attack on Israel.\nIt was a telling example of how the clash between Israel and Iran has scrambled the equation in the Middle East. Faced with a barrage of Iranian missiles, Britain, the United States, France and others rushed to Israel's aid. They set aside their anger over Gaza to defend it from a country they view as an archnemesis, even as they pleaded for restraint in Israel's response to the Iranian assault.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose approval of a deadly airstrike on a meeting of Iranian generals in Damascus on April 1 provoked Iran's retaliation, has managed to change the narrative, according to British and American diplomats and analysts. But it could prove to be a fleeting change, they said, if Mr. Netanyahu orders a counterstrike damaging enough to pitch the region into wider war.\n'We would urge them to take the win at this point,' Mr. Sunak said in Parliament, borrowing a phrase that President Biden used in a phone call with Mr. Netanyahu on Sunday after Iran's attack had been mostly repelled.\nMr. Sunak was expected to have his own call with Mr. Netanyahu on Tuesday, part of a full-court press by European leaders to urge him not to allow the clash with Iran to spiral uncontrollably. President Emmanuel Macron of France, which played a supporting role in the military operation, told a French news channel, 'We will do everything to avoid a conflagration — that is to say, an escalation.'\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain making a statement in the House of Commons on Monday about the Iranian missile attack.

Most of the missiles and drones were intercepted and shot down by Israel and its allies, including the United States and Britain.\nThe United States has imposed extensive sanctions on Iran over the years as part of a broad effort to put pressure on its economy and prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "For people in eastern Ukraine, where nightly barrages of drones from Russia outpace the military's overwhelmed air defenses, the response by Western allies to Iran's aerial assault against Israel this weekend produced uncomfortable comparisons.\nThe militaries of the United States, Britain, France and others stepped in to help Israel defend against the fusillade of more than 300 Iranian drones and missiles, nearly all of which were intercepted. A similar number of aerial weapons are fired at Ukraine on a weekly basis, its officials say, with many of the drones in those attacks designed by Iran and now produced by Russia.\nSince the start of this year, Russia has fired 1,000 missiles, 2,800 drones and 7,000 guided aerial bombs at Ukraine, according to Ukraine's permanent representative to the United Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya. While Washington and other allies have provided Kyiv with some powerful air defense weapons, they have not directly confronted Russian forces, and Ukrainian officials have long argued that the supplied weapons are insufficient to counter the threat from Moscow.\nIn the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, where 1.3 million people live with nightly air raid alarms, many people expressed anger and disappointment over the weekend that Ukraine's allies, wary of provoking Russia, don't give it the same protection as they did Israel.\n'When rockets fly in Israel, the whole world writes about it,' said Amil Nasirov, a 29-year old singer. 'Here, rockets are flying, and we don't have American bombers that are saving the sky like over Israel.'\n'It's very stupid; it's hypocrisy,' he added. 'And it's like some devaluation of Ukrainian lives.'\nUkraine has begged since the outset of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 for more tools to close its sky to Russian missiles. But the first Patriot missile systems from the United States and Germany — the only proven defense against ballistic missiles — did not arrive until the spring of 2023.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Israel's war cabinet on Monday met to weigh possible responses to Iran's missile and drone attack over the weekend, as the United States, Britain and other allies strongly urged Israel to show restraint and sought to de-escalate tensions between the two regional powers.\nSome far-right members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government called for a swift and forceful retaliation in response to Iran.\nAn Israeli official briefed on the cabinet discussions, speaking anonymously in order to talk about security matters, said several options were being considered, ranging from diplomacy to an imminent strike, but gave no further details. There was no immediate public statement by the ministers, or by the Israeli prime minister.\n'We are weighing our steps,' Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the Israeli military chief of staff, told Israeli soldiers on Monday in televised remarks during a visit to an Israeli air base. 'The launching of so many missiles, cruise missiles and drones toward Israeli territory will be responded to.'\nMr. Netanyahu faces a delicate calculation — how to respond to Iran in order not to look weak, while trying to avoid alienating the Biden administration and other allies already impatient with Israel's prosecution of the war in Gaza.\nWhile the United States, Britain and France strongly condemned Iran's assault and stepped in to help thwart it on Saturday, their calls for restraint highlighted the pressure Israel was facing to avoid a more direct confrontation with Iran.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The free expression group PEN America has canceled its 2024 literary awards ceremony following months of escalating protests over the organization's response to the war in Gaza, which has been criticized as overly sympathetic to Israel and led nearly half of the prize nominees to withdraw.\nThe event was set to take place on April 29 at Town Hall in Manhattan. But in a news release on Monday, the group announced that although the prizes would still be conferred, the ceremony would not take place.\n'We greatly respect that writers have followed their consciences, whether they chose to remain as nominees in their respective categories or not,' the group's chief officer for literary programming, Clarisse Rosaz Shariyf, said in the release.\n'We regret that this unprecedented situation has taken away the spotlight from the extraordinary work selected by esteemed, insightful and hard-working judges across all categories. As an organization dedicated to freedom of expression and writers, our commitment to recognizing and honoring outstanding authors and the literary community is steadfast.'\nIn recent months, PEN America has faced intensifying public criticism of its response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks on Israel, which killed roughly 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities, and Israel's military response in Gaza, which has left about 34,000 people dead, according to health officials there.\nIn a series of open letters, writers have demanded that PEN America support an immediate cease-fire, as its global parent organization, PEN International, and other national chapters have done.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Israel said its aims were to defeat Hamas and free the hostages taken that day, around 100 of whom remain in Gaza. Local health authorities say the war has killed more than 33,000 people, and the United Nations says the population is on the brink of famine.\nHere is a look at where the military conflict stands:\nIsrael withdrew its forces from southern Gaza this month, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that the military still plans to invade Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, to 'complete the elimination of Hamas's battalions' and to destroy its tunnel networks.\nMourning over the bodies of relatives in Rafah, in southern Gaza, on Tuesday. Credit... Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The timing of any operation in Rafah, on the border with Egypt, is unclear. President Biden is among many world leaders who have urged Israel not to invade the city because of the harm it could cause civilians. Rafah's population has swelled to over a million, as people have flocked there for shelter from fighting elsewhere, and border crossings in southern Gaza are a main conduit for humanitarian aid.\nIsrael began its ground invasion in northern Gaza in late October, urging civilians to leave. Much of the north, including Gaza City, has been destroyed by airstrikes and ground combat. Israel began to pull its forces from northern Gaza in January, saying it had dismantled Hamas's military structure there.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Many donors, politicians and Jewish students have pressured their colleges to confront antisemitism more forcefully. But one challenge can make the whole exercise feel like quicksilver.\nThere's no consensus about what, precisely, constitutes antisemitism.\nUniversity administrators and federal bureaucrats alike have considered one contentious definition that has gained traction in recent years, put forward by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.\nThe definition itself is vague and uncontroversial, stating that antisemitism is a 'certain perception of Jews that may be expressed as hatred' toward them. But the I.H.R.A. also includes with the definition a series of examples that alarm many supporters of free expression. They include holding Israel to a 'double standard' and claiming Israel's existence is a 'racist endeavor.'\nSupporters of the alliance's definition say that it helps press colleges to stop tolerating behavior against Jews that would be unacceptable if it were directed at racial minority groups or L.G.B.T.Q. students.\nBut supporters of the Palestinian cause say those examples conflate antisemitism with anti-Zionism, and are intended to protect Israel from criticism.\nDebates over how to define antisemitism have been a flashpoint on several of the university task forces that have been created in response to student protests over the Israel-Hamas war.\nAt Harvard and Stanford, task force members have faced harsh criticism for not supporting the I.H.R.A. definition; a co-chair of the Stanford task force resigned, in part over that controversy.\nA similar committee at Columbia University has avoided settling on a definition of antisemitism — a decision that has also led to criticism.\nThe Trump administration gave supporters of the I.H.R.A. definition a major boost in 2018 by issuing a sweeping executive order that instructed all agencies to consider the I.H.R.A. definition when examining civil rights complaints.\nThe definition has been invoked in debates over whether to cancel controversial speakers, events and panels on the ground that they are antisemitic.\nMr. Trump's executive order remains in effect, and the Biden administration is considering issuing a regulation based on it.",

Just as they did back in 2020 when retaliating for the U.S. killing of Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iranian leaders this weekend gave plenty of warning that they were launching strikes.\nIran also sequenced the attack, a retaliation for airstrikes on an Iranian Embassy building in Syria on April 1, in such a way that both Israelis and Americans were able to adjust their aerial defenses once the Iranian missiles and drones were in the air.\nThe result: a lot of bang, but relatively little destruction on the ground.\nFew of Iran's drones and missiles found their intended targets, an inaccuracy level that military experts and defense officials say was probably by design.\nIran planned the attacks in a way that would send a warning to Israel and create deterrence but avoid sparking a war, according to two members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, said Iran gave countries in the region about 72 hours advance warning.\n'I think Iran is very concerned about what comes next if they were too effective,' said Gen. Joseph L. Votel, a former leader of the U.S. military's Central Command. 'The early notification of what they were doing seems a little interesting to me.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Many donors, politicians and Jewish students have pressured their colleges to confront antisemitism more forcefully.But one challenge can make the whole exercise feel like quicksilver.\nThere's no consensus about what, precisely, constitutes antisemitism.\nUniversity administrators and federal bureaucrats alike have considered one contentious definition that has gained traction in recent years, put forward by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.\nThe definition itself is vague and uncontroversial, stating that antisemitism is a 'certain perception of Jews that may be expressed as hatred' toward them. But the I.H.R.A. also includes with the definition a series of examples that alarm many supporters of free expression. They include holding Israel to a 'double standard' and claiming Israel's existence is a 'racist endeavor.'\nSupporters of the alliance's definition say that it helps press colleges to stop tolerating behavior against Jews that would be unacceptable if it were directed at racial minority groups or L.G.B.T.Q. students.\nBut supporters of the Palestinian cause say those examples conflate antisemitism with anti-Zionism, and are intended to protect Israel from criticism.\nDebates over how to define antisemitism have been a flashpoint on several of the university task forces that have been created in response to student protests over the Israel-Hamas war.\nAt Harvard and Stanford, task force members have faced harsh criticism for not supporting the I.H.R.A. definition; a co-chair of the Stanford task force resigned, in part over that controversy.\nA similar committee at Columbia University has avoided settling on a definition of antisemitism — a decision that has also led to criticism.\nThe Trump administration gave supporters of the I.H.R.A. definition a major boost in 2018 by issuing a sweeping executive order that instructed all agencies to consider the I.H.R.A. definition when examining civil rights complaints.\nThe definition has been invoked in debates over whether to cancel controversial speakers, events and panels on the ground that they are antisemitic.\nMr. Trump's executive order remains in effect, and the Biden administration is considering issuing a regulation based on it.",

            "summary": "The scale of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza — and the difficulties faced by aid workers responding to it — goes 'beyond what has been seen before' in other conflicts, the United Nations said on Wednesday.\nThe cost of addressing it may be similarly staggering.\nThe U.N. said its agencies and other aid groups would need more than $2.8 billion from their donors to continue their response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza for the rest of the year.\n'Widespread destruction. Multiple mass displacements. Looming famine. Collapsed health system,' the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a statement. 'Every day is a struggle for survival for people in Gaza, as the war rages on and needs deepen.'\nThe amount requested, $2.8 billion, is only a portion of what the U.N. has estimated the full price tag of responding to the crisis to be: $4.089 billion. A majority of the money requested ($2.5 billion) would pay for relief work in Gaza, while a smaller amount ($297.6 million) would go to the West Bank, where violence has flared for months.\nDisplaced Palestinians walked along a beach on Sunday as they sought to return to their homes in northern Gaza. Credit... Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The U.N. scaled down its funding request to $2.8 billion needed to pay only for operations that appeared to be achievable in the next nine months, during which it assumed 'many of the current security concerns and access limitations will continue.'\nThe war in Gaza began after the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, which Israeli officials said killed roughly 1,200 people. Since then, the distribution of aid in Gaza has been hobbled by a cascade of restrictions and dangers.\nMore than 200 aid workers have been killed during the conflict, a vast majority of them Palestinians from Gaza, according to U.N. Secretary General António Guterres. Earlier this month, seven aid workers from World Central Kitchen, including six foreigners, were killed in a series of airstrikes on their convoy.\nTheir deaths started an international outcry and led to an internal investigation by the Israeli military, which reprimanded the personnel responsible for the strikes and said their killings were a mistake.\nIn the early months of the war, Israel imposed a near-total blockade on goods going into the Gaza Strip, including humanitarian assistance. It eventually relented, but insisted that entering shipments be meticulously inspected, and it barred a wide range of items, like scissors, that it said could have a potential military use.\nThe aftermath of an Israeli strike on residential buildings and a mosque in Rafah, a city in Gaza, in February. Credit... Fatima Shbair/Associated Press Aid groups have said that whole trucks of aid have been turned away by Israeli inspectors because a single item on board was determined to have a possible military use. Groups are sometimes not told what the item was or why it was rejected, they say.\nIsrael has also accused Hamas of diverting aid. But American officials, including Samantha Power, the director of the U.S. Agency for International Development, and David Satterfield, the U.S. special envoy for humanitarian issues in the Middle East, have said there is no evidence for that claim.\nThe U.N. demanded that Israel improve the conditions under which aid is delivered, including by guaranteeing aid workers safe access to people in need, increasing the number of entry points and secure roads for humanitarian supplies, and improving the ability of aid workers to safely move around in Gaza.\nIn recent weeks, Israel has been eager to show that more aid is flowing into Gaza, and it has also been keen to blame the U.N. for delays in its distribution.\nThis week, Israel said that 553 aid trucks passed through the Kerem Shalom and the Nitzana border crossings and that 126 trucks were permitted to travel from southern Gaza to northern Gaza.",

            "summary": "Speaker Mike Johnson on Monday said he planned this week to advance a long-stalled national security spending package to aid Israel, Ukraine and other American allies, along with a separate bill aimed at mollifying conservatives who have been vehemently opposed to backing Kyiv.\nMr. Johnson's announcement, coming after he has agonized for weeks over whether and how to advance an infusion of critical aid to Ukraine amid stiff Republican resistance, was the first concrete indication that he had settled on a path forward. It came days after Iran launched a large aerial attack on Israel, amplifying calls for Congress to move quickly to approve the pending aid bill.\nEmerging from a meeting in which he briefed G.O.P. lawmakers on his plan, Mr. Johnson said he would cobble together a legislative package that roughly mirrors the $95 billion aid bill the Senate passed two months ago but is broken down into three pieces. Lawmakers would vote separately on a bill providing money for Israel, one providing funding for Ukraine and a third with aid for Taiwan and other allies. They would cast a fourth vote on a separate measure containing other policies popular among Republicans.\nlawmakers on his plan, Mr. Johnson said he would cobble together a legislative package that roughly mirrors the $95 billion aid bill the Senate passed two months ago but is broken down into three pieces. Lawmakers would vote separately on a bill providing money for Israel, one providing funding for Ukraine and a third with aid for Taiwan and other allies. They would cast a fourth vote on a separate measure containing other policies popular among Republicans. 'The overall concept is the same' as the Senate-passed bill, Mr. Johnson said. 'It's the same places that the funding would be sent, and you'll see the House's take on it.'\nIn addition the House would take up legislation that would require that some of the aid to Ukraine to be paid back and that some of it be financed by selling off Russian sovereign assets that have been frozen. That package also would include a bill that could ban TikTok, which passed the House overwhelmingly last month but has since languished in the Senate.\nIt is not clear whether the convoluted strategy will be successful in the House, where Mr. Johnson has a tenuous hold on his divided conference and a bare majority. Its success would require a complicated mix of bipartisan coalitions around each piece of the package. Both Senators Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, had urged Mr. Johnson to pass the Senate-passed aid package as is.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed and detained in raids in the West Bank, which Israeli officials describe as counterterrorism operations against Hamas and other armed groups.\nSunday's strike 'paralyzed all aspects of life' in the West Bank, according to the official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, with shops, schools, universities and banks shuttered. Public transportation also came to a standstill.\nIt was not the first shutdown in the occupied West Bank — where about 500,000 Israeli settlers live alongside roughly 2.7 million Palestinians — as an act of protest in recent months. The Israeli authorities have tightened restrictions in the territory since Oct. 7, canceling thousands of work permits that allowed Palestinians to work in Israel and squeezing the West Bank's economy.\nAnd violence in the West Bank has sharply escalated in recent months. Nearly 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces there since the Israel-Hamas war started, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Deadly violence against Palestinians by Israeli settlers in the West Bank has also reached record levels since Oct. 7.\nEarly on Sunday, two Palestinian males in their late teens were fatally shot by Israeli forces, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The Israeli military said one of them had opened fire at soldiers at a military post north of Hebron and the other had tried to stab them.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

On Monday morning, prices for Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, fell by about 1 percent to $89.49 a barrel.\nSo far, there has been relief that the much-anticipated attack did little damage and had no effect on supplies. Oil prices had already increased substantially in the days before the assault, rising above the symbolic $90 a barrel level last week.\nThere is a sense in the market that prices are higher than would be justified based on the fundamentals of supply and demand. In a note after Iran's onslaught on Saturday, Goldman Sachs estimated this risk premium at $5 to $10 a barrel.\nRystad Energy, a consulting firm, calculates that on fundamentals, Brent should be selling for $84 a barrel.\nEssentially, the markets seem to be waiting to see what happens next. Iran appears to want to end this particular episode for now, while Israel is pondering its response.\nThe big worry is that if the conflict escalates, Iran, which occupies a strategic position on the shipping lanes from the Persian Gulf, could resort to 'attacking tankers, pipelines and critical energy infrastructure,' said Helima Croft, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, an investment bank.",

            "summary": "The House on Saturday was heading toward passage of a $95 billion foreign aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, as Speaker Mike Johnson put his job on the line to advance the long-stalled legislation in defiance against hard-liners his own party.\nLawmakers were expected on Saturday afternoon to vote separately on aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, as well as on another bill that includes a measure that could result in a nationwide ban of TikTok and new sanctions on Iran. The fourth bill was meant to sweeten the deal for conservatives.\nMr. Johnson structured the measures, which will be melded together into one after each piece is approved, to capture different coalitions of support without allowing opposition to any one element to sink the whole deal. Each of the aid bills for the three nations is expected to pass overwhelmingly, and the Senate is expected to take it up quickly and send the legislation to President Biden's desk, capping its tortured path to enactment.\nThe legislation includes $60 billion for Kyiv; $26 billion for Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza; and $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific. It would direct the president to seek repayment from the Ukrainian government of $10 billion in economic assistance, a stipulation supported by former President Donald J. Trump, who has pushed for any aid to Ukraine to be in the form of a loan. But the legislation also would allow the president to forgive those loans starting in 2026.\nThe scene that is expected to play out on the House floor on Saturday will reflect both the broad bipartisan support in Congress for continuing to help the Ukrainian military beat back Russian forces, and the extraordinary political risk taken by Mr. Johnson to defy the anti-interventionist wing of his party who had blocked the measure for months. In the end, the speaker, himself an ultraconservative who had previously voted against funding Ukraine's war effort, circumvented his right flank and was relying on Democrats to push the measure through.\nFor months, it was uncertain whether Congress would approve another round of funding for Ukraine, even as the momentum of the war in Ukraine shifted in Russia's favor. Republicans dug in against another aid package for Kyiv unless President Biden agreed to stringent anti-immigration measures, and then refused to take up legislation that paired the aid with stiffer border enforcement provisions.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

As protests over Israel's war in Gaza continue to intensify, especially on college campuses, activists are preparing to be in Chicago this summer for the Democratic National Convention.\nImage Demonstrators faced off against National Guardsmen outside of the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Credit... Barton Silverman/The New York Times The very idea sends some Democrats right back to 1968, when their convention, also in Chicago, was overshadowed by infighting and violence between the police and antiwar protesters. Back then, many voters watching the nightly news got the impression that the party could not control its own delegates, never mind a country that was wrestling with an unpopular war.\nProtests over the Israel-Hamas war could also complicate this year's convention and the Democratic messaging for President Biden, whom Republicans have eagerly cast as too indulgent of chaos and disorder in American society. Last week, Fox News and other conservative outlets repeatedly showed demonstrations that made the country seem on the edge: Columbia University sending in the police to arrest students on campus; protesters shouting 'genocide!' at President Biden at a campaign stop; demonstrators chaining themselves to cars to block traffic, creating gridlock.\n'The whole Republican message is, ‘The world is out of control and Biden is not in command,'' said David Axelrod, the Democratic strategist and adviser to former President Barack Obama. 'They will exploit any images of disorder to abet and support it.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

And it would ultimately mean cobbling together just enough support from Democrats and mainstream Republicans to pass the legislation amid resistance from hard-right Republicans to Ukraine funding and among left-wing Democrats to unfettered aid for Israel.\nMr. Johnson plans to advance a legislative package that roughly mirrors the $95 billion aid bill the Senate passed two months ago with aid to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and other American allies — but broken down into three separate pieces that would each be voted on individually. There would also be a fourth vote on a separate measure containing other policies popular among Republicans, including conditioning Ukraine aid as a loan.\nThe strategy has run into a flurry of opposition from members of his own party, including one Republican, Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who on Tuesday announced that he would join a threatened bid to remove Mr. Johnson from the top post.\nRepresentative Thomas Massie on Tuesday joined Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to remove Mr. Johnson as speaker.

            "summary": "Since October 7th, this Committee and the nation have watched in horror as so many of our college campuses, particularly the most expensive, so-called elite schools, have erupted into hotbeds of antisemitism and hate. Dr. Shafik [shuh-feek], Mr. Schizer [shiz-zer, rhymes with scissor], Ms. Shipman, and Mr. Greenwald, you are here testifying today because Columbia University is one of the worst of those hotbeds and we have seen far too little, far too late done to counter that and protect students and staff. Columbia stands guilty of gross negligence at best and at worst has become a platform for those supporting terrorism and violence against the Jewish people. For example, just four days after the harrowing October 7 attack, a former Columbia undergraduate beat an Israeli student with a stick while shouting racial epithets. The following day, a crowd of anti-Israel protestors marched on the university's Kraft Center for Jewish Life, causing the building to be locked down and forcing Jewish students to shelter inside. More recently, on March 24, anti-Israel groups hosted a \"Resistance 101\" event in a Columbia dorm featuring speakers linked to U.S. and Israel-designated foreign terrorist organizations, including the PFLP. Speakers explicitly endorsed terrorism and called on students to support it. This unauthorized event was nevertheless promoted by Columbia faculty and staff. That a taxpayer funded institution would become a forum for the promotion of terrorism raises serious questions. Moreover, Columbia administrators have repeatedly failed in their duty to protect Jewish students from this hateful, retrograde form of discrimination. Don't take my word for it. In February, Columbia undergraduate Eden Yadegar told the Committee, 'It is impossible to exist as a Jewish student at Columbia without running face first into antisemitism every single day. Jew-hatred is so deeply embedded into campus culture, that it has become casual and palatable among students and faculty and neglected by administrators.\" Let me repeat: neglected by administrators. Eden and some of her fellow Jewish classmates are in attendance today. I believe they deserve direct and clear answers about how you will address their concerns. I need not remind you that this is not just a moral duty, but a legal duty set forth in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.",

            "excerpt": "After months of delay at the hands of a bloc of ultraconservative Republicans, the package drew overwhelming bipartisan support, reflecting broad consensus.",
            "summary": "The House voted resoundingly on Saturday to approve $95 billion in foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, as Speaker Mike Johnson put his job on the line to advance the long-stalled aid package by marshaling support from mainstream Republicans and Democrats.\nIn four back-to-back votes, overwhelming bipartisan coalitions of lawmakers approved fresh rounds of funding for the three U.S. allies, as well as another bill meant to sweeten the deal for conservatives that could result in a nationwide ban of TikTok.\nThe scene on the House floor reflected both the broad support in Congress for continuing to help the Ukrainian military beat back Russia, and the extraordinary political risk taken by Mr. Johnson to defy the anti-interventionist wing of his party who had sought to thwart the measure. Minutes before the vote on assistance for Kyiv, Democrats began to wave small Ukrainian flags on the House floor, as hard-right Republicans jeered.\nThe legislation includes $60 billion for Kyiv; $26 billion for Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza; and $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific region. It would direct the president to seek repayment from the Ukrainian government of $10 billion in economic assistance, a concept supported by former President Donald J. Trump, who had pushed for any aid to Kyiv to be in the form of a loan. But it also would allow the president to forgive those loans starting in 2026.\nIt also contained a measure to help pave the way to selling off frozen Russian sovereign assets to help fund the Ukrainian war effort, and a new round of sanctions on Iran. The Senate is expected to pass the legislation as early as Tuesday and send it to President Biden's desk, capping its tortured journey through Congress.\n'Our adversaries are working together to undermine our Western values and demean our democracy,' Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said Saturday as the House debated the measure. 'We cannot be afraid at this moment. We have to do what's right. Evil is on the march. History is calling and now is the time to act.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "excerpt": "The Republican speaker, with his job on the line, said he expected Saturday evening votes on the long-stalled package of aid to Ukraine, Israel and other American allies.",
            "summary": "Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday told Republicans that the House would vote Saturday evening on his foreign aid package for Israel and Ukraine, pushing through resistance in his own party to advance a long-stalled national security spending package for U.S. allies.\nHis announcement came amid a crush of opposition from Republicans who are vehemently against sending more aid to Ukraine, and have vented for days as congressional aides race to write the legislation Mr. Johnson proposed on Monday.\nThe speaker, whose job is at risk as he defies his right flank on the measure, also announced that he would hold a separate vote on a border security bill 'that includes the core components' of House Republicans' stringent legislation passed last May that would crack down on unlawful immigration and revive severe Trump-era border restrictions. The move was a nod to ultraconservatives who have demanded that the speaker not advance aid to Ukraine without securing sweeping concessions from Democrats on immigration policy.\nThe legislative package Mr. Johnson is trying to advance roughly mirrors the $95 billion aid bill the Senate passed two months ago with aid to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and other American allies, but he has proposed breaking that package into three pieces that would be voted on individually. There would be a fourth vote on a separate measure containing other policies popular among Republicans, including conditioning Ukraine aid as a loan and a measure that could lead to a nationwide TikTok ban.\nMr. Johnson said the text of the legislative package would be released later Wednesday.\nThe multipart plan has been painstakingly structured to cobble together just enough support from Democrats and mainstream Republicans to pass over the opposition of the hard right to funding for Ukraine funding and left-wing Democrats who do not support unfettered aid for Israel. If all four pieces passed the House, they would then be folded into a single bill for the Senate to take up, in an effort to ensure that senators could not cherry-pick pieces to approve or reject.\nIts success will require everything to go right for Mr. Johnson this week to prevail.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "excerpt": "Lawmakers grilled officials over comments the faculty members Joseph Andoni Massad, Katherine Franke and Mohamed Abdou made after the Hamas-led attack on Israel.",
            "summary": "Several Columbia faculty members — and particularly their apparent pro-Palestinian stances — were in the spotlight at Wednesday's hearing.\nOne of the professors, the focus of Representative Tim Walberg's questioning, was Joseph Andoni Massad. Dr. Massad, who is of Palestinian Christian descent, teaches modern Arab politics and intellectual history at Columbia, where he also received his Ph.D. in political science.\nLong known for his anti-Israel positions, he published a controversial article in The Electronic Intifada last October, in the wake of the Hamas attack, describing it as a 'resistance offensive' staged in retaliation to Israel's settler-colonies near the Gaza border.\nThe piece drew a visceral response and demands for his dismissal in a petition by a Columbia student that was signed by tens of thousands of people. The petition specifically criticized Dr. Massad's use of the word 'awesome' to describe the scene of the attack.\nDr. Massad's posture has drawn controversy for years. When he was awarded tenure in 2009, 14 Columbia professors expressed their concern in a letter to the provost. Generally, professors with tenure face a much higher bar for termination than those without the status.\nMore recently, however, professors nationally have rallied to support him, emphasizing his academic right to voice his opinion.\nIn testimony responding to questions from Mr. Walberg, a Michigan Republican, Columbia's President, Nemat Shafik, disclosed that Dr. Massad had since been removed from a leadership role at the university, where he headed an academic review panel.\nKatherine Franke, a law professor at Columbia, was also mentioned in the hearing for her activist role and a comment that 'all Israeli students who served in the I.D.F. are dangerous and shouldn't be on campus,' referring to the Israel Defense Forces.\nMs. Franke recently wrote a piece in The Nation raising questions about academic freedom at Columbia, where she has taught since 1999.\nDr. Shafik, who goes by Minouche, said Professors Massad and Franke were 'under investigation for discriminatory remarks.'\nMohamed Abdou was also named in the hearing. Dr. Abdou was hired as a visiting scholar for the Spring 2024 term, and was teaching a course called 'Decolonial-Queerness and Abolition.'\nA biography on Columbia's website describes Dr. Abdou as 'a North African-Egyptian Muslim anarchist interdisciplinary activist-scholar of Indigenous, Black, critical race and Islamic studies, as well as gender, sexuality, abolition and decolonization.'\nRepresentative Elise Stefanik asked why he was hired even after his social media post on Oct. 11 that read, 'I'm with Hamas & Hezbollah & Islamic Jihad.' Dr. Shafik said, 'He will never work at Columbia again.'",

            "summary": "An article on Saturday about the expansion of two California national monuments misstated the breadth of the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument. While the monument extends to one coastal county in California, it does not border the Pacific Ocean itself.\nAn article on Thursday about the debate over free speech and antisemitism happening at universities in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war misstated when the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Groups issued a public letter in which they said they held 'the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all the unfolding violence.' The letter was issued on the weekend of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, not the weekend after the attack.\nA theater review on Thursday about a revival of 'The Wiz' misstated the show's opening day. It was Wednesday, not Tuesday.\nAn obituary on Friday about O.J. Simpson misstated who owned the Ford Bronco in which he fled after being charged with the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman. It was Mr. Simpson's friend Al Cowlings, the driver — not Mr. Simpson himself. The obituary also misstated what Mr. Simpson's lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. told the jury at his murder trial about a glove. It was 'If it doesn't fit, you must acquit' — not 'If the glove don't fit, you must acquit.' And it referred incorrectly to the contract Mr. Simpson signed with ABC in 1969. It was for appearances on 'Wide World of Sports' and other ABC shows — not for work as a color commentator. (ABC would hire him as a color commentator for 'Monday Night Football,' but not until 1983.)",

            "summary": "Rough seas were a fitting symbol for this week's meeting of Group of 7 foreign ministers on the Italian island of Capri. Coast Guard ships that ferried V.I.P.s across the Gulf of Naples to the island on Wednesday swayed precariously, leaving the passengers reaching for their motion-sickness medicine — and, in some cases, their sick bags.\nThough no ministers from this elite international coalition, including Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, were known to have lost their lunch, the global problems they confronted were enough to make even a seasoned diplomat queasy: the risk of war between Iran and Israel, the nightmare in Gaza and Ukraine's uncertain fate.\nAt the luxurious Grand Hotel Quisisana, Mr. Blinken came determined to project unity within a group that includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and the European Union.\nFirst created to help stabilize the world economy, the G7 has grown more active and ambitious in recent years, seeking to shape geopolitics and to be 'a steering committee for the world's most advanced democracies,' as Mr. Blinken put it in a closing news conference on Friday.\nItaly's foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said the Group of 7's calls for restraint deserved credit for 'the small scale' of an Israeli strike against Iran.

            "summary": "Negotiations for a cease-fire and the release of Israeli hostages have stalled because Hamas rejected the latest proposal put forth by Israel, Qatar and Egypt, the C.I.A. director said Thursday, putting the blame for a lack of progress in talks squarely on the group that led the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\nEarlier this month, William J. Burns, C.I.A. director and lead American negotiator, traveled to Cairo and pushed what he called 'a far-reaching proposal' that Egyptian and Qatari negotiators took to Hamas. The proposal contained an offer to allow some Gazans to return to the northern part of the enclave, a key Hamas demand.\nWhile Mr. Burns did not describe the details of that proposal, he said that so far Hamas has not accepted it.\n'It was a deep disappointment to get a negative reaction from Hamas,' said Mr. Burns, speaking at the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas. 'Right now, it's that negative reaction that really is standing in the way of innocent civilians in Gaza getting humanitarian relief that they so desperately need.'\nLast Sunday, Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, expressed regret that Hamas had rejected the proposal and argued it proved that the group was not interested in reaching a deal.\nOther American officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations, have said Hamas has signaled that it does not have enough women and civilian hostages in their control to consummate the first part of the deal, which would release 40 hostages over six weeks in return for a large number of Palestinian prisoners.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Mr. Netanyahu said in a social media post that his government would 'act by all means' against any such move.\nThe news about the possible sanctions, reported earlier by Axios, came only a day after the House approved $26 billion for Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza. The sanctions, if imposed, would not hold up the military aid that was just approved in Congress.\nOn Sunday, Palestinians in the West Bank went on a general strike to protest a deadly Israeli military raid at a refugee camp. At least 10 people were killed in the raid on Saturday, the latest operation in a sweeping economic and security clampdown in the Israeli-occupied territory.\nSince the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed and detained in raids in the West Bank, which Israeli officials describe as counterterrorism operations against Hamas and other armed groups.\nThe strike on Sunday 'paralyzed all aspects of life' in the West Bank, with shops, schools, universities and banks shuttered, according to the official Palestinian news agency, Wafa. Public transportation also was halted.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "When Iran agreed to a deal in 2015 that would require it to surrender 97 percent of the uranium it could use to make nuclear bombs, Russia and China worked alongside the United States and Europe to get the pact done.\nThe Russians even took Iran's nuclear fuel, for a hefty fee, prompting celebratory declarations that President Vladimir V. Putin could cooperate with the West on critical security issues and help constrain a disruptive regime in a volatile region.\nA lot has changed in the subsequent nine years. China and Russia are now more aligned with Iran's 'Axis of Resistance' to an American-led order, along with the likes of North Korea. When President Biden gathered the leaders of six nations for a video call from the White House on Sunday to plot a common strategy for de-escalating the crisis between Israel and Iran, there was no chance of getting anyone from Beijing or Moscow on the screen.\nThe disappearance of that unified front is one of the many factors that make this moment seems 'particularly dangerous,' said Vali Nasr, an Iranian-born professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, 'maybe the most dangerous in decades.'\nBut it is hardly the only one.\nPresident Donald J. Trump's decision to pull out of the Obama-era nuclear deal triggered a predictable counterreaction from Tehran, and after a long pause, Iran resumed enriching uranium — some to near-bomb-grade quality. Today it is far closer to producing a bomb than it was when the accord was in effect.\nIran has moved forward with its ballistic missile programs, and some of those weapons were used against Israel this weekend.

            "summary": "The House vote on Saturday to provide $61 billion in American aid to Ukraine was the clearest sign yet that at least on foreign policy, the Republican Party is not fully aligned with former President Donald J. Trump and his 'America First' movement.\nBut more Republicans voted against the aid than for it, showing just how much Mr. Trump's broad isolationism — and his movement's antipathy to Ukraine — has divided the G.O.P. in an election year.\nMr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the third time, had actually soft-pedaled his opposition to Ukraine aid in recent days as the dam began to break on the House Republican blockade. He stood by Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, who assembled the complicated aid packages for Ukraine, Israel and America's Asian allies, and against threatened efforts to bring down Mr. Johnson's speakership and plunge the House back into chaos. And he stayed quiet on Saturday, declining to pressure Republicans to vote no.\nBut few issues have been more central to the former president's creed than his foreign policy isolationism, his call for Europe to raise military spending in its own backyard, and his foreign policy shift toward Vladimir V. Putin's Russia.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson after the House passed the foreign aid bills for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Credit... Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times Though he has in recent days stayed quiet, his most vociferous allies in the House, such as Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida, had led efforts to block the aid. Another pro-Trump firebrand, Representative Lauren Boebert of Colorado, jeered Democrats during the vote as they waived Ukrainian flags on the House floor.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "In the 1970s, leaders at the Japanese American Citizens League, one of the oldest and largest Asian American civil rights organizations, felt the prospect of reparations for their wartime incarceration was out of reach.\nMany Americans knew little about how the government had imprisoned more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent, most of whom were American citizens, during World War II. Large civil rights organizations were preoccupied with the broader fight for gender and racial equality, and even other Asian American groups were reluctant to support reparations.\nThen came a surprising endorsement from the American Jewish Committee. It was the start of a decades-long bond between two of the country's most established Jewish and Japanese American civil rights groups — a relationship cherished by both of their communities.\nBut a new generation of Japanese Americans is now pushing to sever ties with two prominent Jewish American organizations. In a recent letter, a group of mostly young activists calling themselves Nikkei4Palestine urged the Japanese American Citizens League to take a stronger stance in support of Palestinians by calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and renouncing affiliations with Jewish groups they labeled 'Zionist.'\nIt was the latest example of how the Israel-Hamas war has roiled cultural and political institutions far beyond the Middle East, and not just among groups with direct ties to the region. While most Japanese Americans vote Democratic, an increasingly vocal generation of young activists is trying to push their parents' and grandparents' civil rights group further to the left.\nThe Nikkei4Palestine leaders wrote in late December that the American Jewish Committee and the Anti-Defamation League had promoted human rights 'while consciously omitting calls for equal and fair treatment of Palestinians' and conflating any criticism of Israeli government policies with antisemitism. They argued that Japanese Americans were being complicit with the Israeli military attacks in Gaza by standing with those organizations and not denouncing U.S. financial support for Israel.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Pro-Palestinian protesters shut down traffic Monday morning in cities across the country, part of a global effort to disrupt economies and pressure world leaders to push for a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip.\nIn California, protesters chained themselves to barrels and blocked lanes on northbound I-880 in Oakland, while another group of demonstrators carrying banners disrupted southbound traffic. On the Golden Gate Bridge, protesters obstructed traffic in both directions, with some carrying a banner that read 'Stop the world for Gaza.'\nThe disruptions did not just impact drivers. In Chicago, protesters on I-190 blocked traffic coming into O'Hare International Airport, and passengers who'd already arrived started walking on foot with their luggage to catch their flights. The airport announced on X that there were substantial delays and encouraged passengers to use alternative transportation. By mid morning, traffic was moving into O'Hare again, according to the airport.\nIn San Antonio, protesters carrying Palestinian flags blocked both sides of the Valero energy company headquarters, jamming traffic on the city's northwest side. And in Philadelphia, pro-Palestinian protesters organized a teach-in that blocked rush-hour traffic. Others led a funeral-like procession of cars up Interstate 95, and a third group gathered outside of City Hall, calling on local leadership to stop sending millions of dollars to Israel. They also made their way to Day & Zimmermann headquarters, which is a weapons manufacturer that organizers said supplies weapons to Israel, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.\nThe protests were part of A15 Action, a solidarity agreement to 'identify and blockade major choke points' that would cause the most economic impact, according to its website.\nIn Middletown, Conn., for example, pro-Palestinian protesters blocked employees entering and leaving a Pratt & Whitney factory that exports military engines for aircrafts. Police arrested multiple protesters, the Hartford Courant reported.\nThe movement on Monday purposefully coincided with Tax Day in the United States. Protesters and activists across the country said they were calling for a cease-fire in Gaza and for the United States to stop providing military aid to the Israeli government.\nProtesters also gathered in major cities globally, including in Athens; Belfast, Ireland; Sydney, Australia; and Barcelona, Spain. All echoed calls for a cease-fire.",

            "summary": "Israeli airstrikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah on Saturday killed several civilians, including women and children, according to Palestinian state media, sending more fear through an area where over one million displaced Palestinians are crowded into tents and temporary quarters.\nFor many weeks, Palestinians have been bracing for an announced Israeli ground offensive on Rafah, the southernmost part of Gaza, where more than half of the strip's 2.2 million residents fled after being forced from their homes by more than six months of Israeli bombardment and a ground invasion.\nThe airstrikes hit two family homes, killing 10 residents, and missiles and artillery also struck other areas of Rafah and the surrounding area, according to the Wafa news agency.\nThe Israeli military would not immediately comment on the strikes. It has said the goal of its offensive in Gaza is to eradicate Hamas, the armed group that has controlled the Gaza Strip for nearly two decades.\n'It was like an earthquake,' Mohammad al-Masri, a 31-year-old accountant who is sheltering with his family in a tent in a large Rafah encampment, said of the shaking from the strikes.\nThe first strike hit at a little past midnight, shaking the earth and lighting up the night sky, and a second one came soon after, he said. 'When we hear these strikes we don't know what to do,' he said. 'Everyone is saying the same thing, ‘Where can we go?''\nPresident Biden and other world leaders have urged Israel not to invade Rafah because it would make an already dire humanitarian crisis even worse.\nBut Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not heeded those calls and claims a ground offensive is necessary to 'complete the elimination of Hamas's battalions' and to destroy its tunnel networks.\nSaturday's strikes stoked fears for Palestinians in Rafah that an invasion could be imminent.\nIn a briefing to the Security Council this week, Secretary-General António Guterres said that Israel's military offensive in Rafah would 'compound this humanitarian catastrophe.'\nRahaf Al-Madhoun, 17, was streaming live on TikTok to talk about the living conditions in Rafah, when the first airstrike hit very close, she said. She stopped to collect herself before continuing. Then she described the terror sown by the strikes and the ever-present buzz of surveillance drones overhead.\n'We're at a loss, I swear,' she said. 'The fear itself is killing us.'\nRawan Sheikh Ahmad contributed reporting.",

Four months ago, the same congressional committee questioned the presidents of Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and M.I.T. about similar allegations. After that hearing, the presidents of the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard stepped down, in part because of blowback over their responses.\nLawmakers will also have much more material to work with this time. Since the earlier hearing, Columbia's campus has been host to heated protests related to the war, and the school has become the target of criticism by both pro-Israel groups and supporters of Palestinians over how it has handled them. The committee, led by Representative Virginia Foxx, a Republican of North Carolina, has also received roughly 4,000 pages of internal information from Columbia related to the antisemitism investigation, a committee spokesman said.\nDr. Shafik, an Egyptian-born economist who started in her job last July, will be flanked by the co-chairs of Columbia's board of trustees: Claire Shipman, a journalist and author, and David Greenwald, a corporate attorney. Here are a few things to watch out for:\nElise Stefanik's line of questioning. She is the No. 4 Republican in the House and a potential vice-presidential pick for Donald J. Trump. It was her aggressive grilling of the presidents at the last hearing about whether calling for the genocide of Jews would violate campus rules that got the most traction. She has counted their subsequent resignations as personal wins.\nDr. Shafik's reactions under pressure. Dr. Shafik has decades of experience dealing with complex situations as an executive in organizations including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. But she has not before faced a highly partisan congressional committee.\nWhat lawmakers and university officials say about academic freedom . The committee's questioning is taking place amid a wider battle over what can be taught in American classrooms, and how much influence the government should have over those decisions. Some of Dr. Shafik's supporters are hoping she defends the right of students and faculty to express unpopular, and even controversial, views.\nWhat lawmakers and university officials say about academic freedom.

            "summary": "House Republicans took a critical step late Thursday night toward bringing up the long-stalled foreign aid bill for Ukraine and Israel, after being forced to rely on Democratic votes to move a plan to consider it out of a key committee and onto the floor.\nThe 9-to-3 vote in the critical Rules Committee was an early step in the convoluted process the House is expected to go through over the next couple of days to approve the $95 billion aid package. It reflected the extent of far-right anger over Speaker Mike Johnson's plan to push through the legislation over the opposition of ultraconservative Republicans, and underscored how heavily the speaker will have to rely on Democrats to push it across the finish line.\nIn a spasm of anger, three far-right Republicans on the panel, which controls what legislation comes to the House floor, refused to back the rule needed to bring up the foreign aid bill, putting it on track to die in committee. But Democrats on the panel stepped in to save it in an extraordinary breach of custom.\nAll Democrats voted to advance the plan out of committee.\nThe Rules Committee has traditionally been an organ of the speaker, and legislation is typically advanced to the floor in a straight party-line vote.\nDemocrats will all but certainly have to provide the votes on the House floor to approve the rule and allow the aid package to be brought up, lending their support in an yet another unorthodox vote in the face of Republican opposition.\nThe rule is critical to Mr. Johnson's plan for pushing the foreign aid package through the House, because it would allow separate votes on aid to Israel and aid to Ukraine, which are supported by different coalitions, but then would fold them together without requiring lawmakers ever to cast an up-or-down vote on the entire bill.\nThe group of far-right lawmakers who sought to block the measure in committee won their seats on the Rules panel as part of a concession made last year by the speaker at the time, Kevin McCarthy, who had to haggle with ultraconservatives who opposed electing him to the top post and agreed to back him only after he granted them critical leverage. They refused to support the measure to bring up the foreign aid package because it would not allow a vote on severe border security provisions they have said should be prioritized over aiding Ukraine.\nThat amounted to a remarkable act of rebellion, and left Democrats to bail out the speaker and push the measure through the panel.\nMr. Johnson earlier said he expected a House vote to pass the aid package on Saturday.\n'I'd rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,' he said in an interview on Newsmax on Thursday night. 'We don't want to have boots on the ground, and we can prevent that by allowing them to hold Putin at bay.'",

Sign up to get it by email. When my wife messaged me about a stabbing at the shopping center in Sydney's Bondi Junction last Saturday, she had just left that mall and did not seem especially concerned. I was in Maui, on a trip with my son and father-in-law, and she was mostly just keeping me informed — as she often does — to make sure The Times didn't miss a potential story.\nI checked in with my colleagues at our editing hub in Seoul. They were already monitoring the situation and, at first, with zero information about casualties, we were all assuming that it was a small, targeted episode — maybe a bar fight or domestic violence. That would be horrible, yes, but probably not worth covering for a global audience.\nThen the situation changed. Suddenly, there were reports of five or more deaths. My son, who goes to school near the shopping center and often hangs out there with friends, started getting messages and photos from classmates who had been there during the attack or had some connection to someone at the scene. A friend and father I know reported that his son had been working at a store there and made it out safely. My son showed me a video someone had shared with him, of a shopper using some kind of bollard to hold off a man with a knife on an escalator. That was followed by more grisly photographs of victims wounded or killed, their bright red blood staining the shiny white tile floors.\nI warned him that just looking at those images would affect him emotionally — and contributed a few paragraphs to an early draft of the story that went up on The Times's website a few minutes later. From there, I mostly handed off to my colleagues, including a couple of Australians who started their Times career in our Sydney bureau before moving on to new jobs in London and Seoul.\nWe were all stunned at the horrific violence in a city and a country that is usually so safe. Early on, I feared that it would be a case of terrorism, a spillover from the Israel-Gaza conflict. Two-thirds of Sydney's Jewish population lives in the Eastern Suburbs, where the attack occurred, and the company that built the mall, Westfield, was co-founded by one of Australia's most prominent Jewish businessmen.\nWithin my son's teen messaging network, there were competing rumors along those lines — someone said the attacker was pro-Israel, another said he looked Arab. Both claims were wrong. So, too, was the warning that there were two attackers, including a man who had fled.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Her mother was already dead when she was born, he said. Instead of a name, doctors wrote 'the baby of the martyr Sabreen al-Sakani' on a piece of tape across her chest.\nRami al-Sheikh, the baby's uncle, told a video journalist from Reuters that her older sister, Malak, had wanted to name her Rouh, the Arabic word for soul. Malak also died in the strike.\nHe said the family was 'ordinary civilians.'\n'My brother is a barber and used to work with me in the shop,' Mr. al-Sheikh said about the baby's father. 'They were happy people, and the little girl Malak was happy that her sister was coming into the world.'\nThe baby was in a perilous state after her birth, but now, aside from some respiratory problems, her condition is stable, Dr. Salama said. She will spend three to four weeks in the hospital, and then doctors will figure out whom to send the baby home with.\n'Hopefully after her respiratory distress improves, she will need to be breastfed,' Dr. Salama said. 'She has been denied everything — denied her mother, denied her milk. Some substitutions can be made, but nothing will ever replace her mother.'",

The university said all of the 100 or so students involved in the protest had been informed that they were suspended, with just a couple of weeks left in the semester.\nFor some of those students, that means they must vacate their student housing, with just weeks before the semester ends.\nYet whatever the consequences, several of the students said in interviews that they were determined to keep protesting Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.\nThey said that after being loaded onto buses with their hands tied, they had sung all the way to police headquarters. Many expressed a renewed belief in their cause, and were glad that the eyes of the nation were on Columbia and Barnard, its sister college.\nThe protests, the arrests and the subsequent disciplinary action came a day after the Congressional testimony this week of Columbia's president, Nemat Shafik, at a hearing about antisemitism on campus. Columbia has said there have been a number of antisemitic episodes, including one attack, and many Jewish students have seen the protests as antisemitic.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Representative Elise Stefanik leaned into the microphone and volleyed a series of questions at the university president sitting in front of her. It was about three hours into a congressional hearing examining antisemitism at Columbia University, and the president, Nemat Shafik, paused, sighed and gave a nervous laugh.\nMs. Stefanik had asked whether the university would remove a professor who praised the Oct. 7 Hamas attack from a role as chair of the university's academic review committee.\nAfter a few seconds, Dr. Shafik responded. 'I think that would be — I think, I would, yes. Let me come back with yes,' she said.\nRepublican lawmakers on the House Committee on Education and the Work Force had come ready to pounce. They tested for weaknesses and prodded vulnerabilities, while their witnesses, a group of Columbia leaders, seemed conciliatory.\nAnd yet, by the end, it seemed Dr. Shafik and other campus leaders had successfully diffused Republican lines of attack, repeatedly and vigorously agreeing that antisemitism was a serious problem on their campus and vowing that they would do more to fight it.\nBut as Dr. Shafik spoke, the tempest that she had been brought in to account for appeared to intensify. Back on campus in Manhattan, pro-Palestinian students erected an encampment with dozens of tents on a central campus lawn, vowing not to move until Columbia divested from companies with ties to Israel and met other demands. Hundreds of other students joined them to rally throughout the day.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The president of Columbia said the university had suspended 15 students. She promised that one visiting professor 'will never work at Columbia again.'\nAnd when she was grilled over whether she would remove another professor from his leadership position, she appeared to make a decision right there on Capitol Hill: 'I think I would, yes.'\nThe president, Nemat Shafik, disclosed the disciplinary details, which are usually confidential, as part of a all-out effort on Wednesday to persuade a House committee investigating Columbia that she was taking serious action to combat a wave of antisemitism following the Israel-Hamas war.\nIn nearly four hours of testimony before the Republican-led Committee on Education and the Workforce, Dr. Shafik conceded that Columbia had initially been overwhelmed by an outbreak of campus protests. But she said its leaders now agreed that some had used antisemitic language and that certain contested phrases — like 'from the river to the sea' — might warrant discipline.\n'I promise you, from the messages I'm hearing from students, they are getting the message that violations of our policies will have consequences,' Dr. Shafik said.\nTestifying alongside her, Claire Shipman, the co-chair of Columbia's board of trustees, made the point bluntly. 'We have a moral crisis on our campus,' she said.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The University of Southern California said it has canceled plans for a graduation speech by this year's valedictorian, Asna Tabassum, who is Muslim. The school said the decision stemmed from security concerns, after several pro-Israeli groups objected to her social media posts supporting Palestinians.\nThe decision drew immediate criticism from the Los Angeles office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, as well as from Ms. Tabassum, a biomedical engineering major.\n'I am both shocked by this decision and profoundly disappointed that the university is succumbing to a campaign of hate meant to silence my voice,' Ms. Tabassum wrote in a statement. She has identified herself as a first-generation American of South Asian descent.\nFree-speech controversies have overwhelmed many universities since the Israel-Hamas war began. University officials have had to handle vociferous debates over pro-Palestinian student protests, which many Jewish students and alumni say often veer into antisemitism. Protesters say that the pushback is an attempt to censor their political beliefs.\nThe U.S.C. decision to cancel the speech was announced on Monday by Andrew T. Guzman, the provost, who said he had made the final decision to choose Ms. Tabassum.\n'Over the past several days, discussion related to the selection of our valedictorian has taken on an alarming tenor,' Dr. Guzman wrote. 'The intensity of feelings, fueled by both social media and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, has grown to include many voices outside of U.S.C. and has escalated to the point of creating substantial risks relating to security and disruption at the commencement.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The new tents popped up — one, two, three — on Columbia's campus. It was a defiant gesture on Thursday afternoon by student activists, who were furious about the university's decision to call in the police to clear an encampment used to protest the Israel-Hamas war.\nIf university officials thought that getting rid of the encampment, or arresting more than 100 protesters, would persuade students to give up, they may have been very wrong.\nBy Thursday night, the tents had disappeared. But scores of students took over a campus lawn. Planning to stay all night, they were in a rather upbeat mood, noshing on donated pizza and snacks. An impromptu dance party had even broken out.\n'The police presence and the arrests do not deter us in any way,' said Layla Saliba, 24, a Palestinian-American student at the School of Social Work, at a news conference organized by Apartheid Divest, a coalition of student groups.\n'If anything,' she added, 'all of their repression towards us — it's galvanized us. It's moved us.'\nAt a moment when some campuses are aflame with student activism over the Palestinian cause — the kind that has disrupted award ceremonies, student dinners and classes — college administrators are dealing with the questions that Columbia considered this week: Will more stringent tactics quell protests? Or fuel them?\nThe decision by Nemat Shafik, Columbia's president, to bring in law enforcement came a day after a remarkable congressional hearing in which she said that the university's leaders now agreed that certain contested phrases — like 'from the river to the sea' — might warrant discipline.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Ms. Omar, who is on the committee that held the hearing, was one of several Democrats who questioned Ms. Shafik about her actions toward Palestinian and Muslim students.\nMs. Hirsi, 21, said on social media that she was an organizer with Columbia University Apartheid Divest, the student coalition that has been pushing the university to cut ties with companies that support Israel. Such divestment is the key demand of protesters in the encampment. She is also involved with the Columbia chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, one of two student groups that was suspended in November for holding unauthorized protests.\n'I have never been reprimanded or received any disciplinary warnings,' she wrote. 'I just received notice that I am 1 of 3 students suspended for standing in solidarity with Palestinians facing a genocide.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Dozens of student protesters at Columbia University gathered outside early Friday afternoon, just across from where their tent encampment had been demolished by university officials the day before. Some students had been there through the night. Others, including a few who had been arrested Thursday, had only recently arrived.\nThere were heaps of blankets, deliveries of water bottles and food, and a faculty speaker, Mahmood Mamdani, an anthropology professor, who congratulated them for remaining there despite the university's attempts to shut down their demonstration in solidarity with Gaza and for a free Palestinian state.\n'You are erasing the line between education and politics,' he told them. 'It is a new phase in this mobilization.'\nA day after Columbia's president, Nemat Shafik, called in the police to arrest some 100 students and take down their encampment, the activists showed little sign of losing steam.\nThe new protest camp, while peaceful, is still officially breaking university rules. Some of the chants — 'We don't want no Zionists here' and 'Israel is a racist state' — are the same ones that President Shafik suggested were creating 'a harassing and intimidating environment for many of our students.'\nBut there seemed to be a lull in enforcement, at least for the moment, as university administrators consider whether they should suspend and arrest even more students for a movement that clearly has considerable campus support. One student organizer said on Friday that protesters had been told by campus security that as long as they did not pitch tents, they could remain there as an informal gathering.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "A New Jersey man was charged on Monday with a federal hate crime after a Palestinian flag was stolen and $40,000 worth of damage was done to religious artifacts at an Islamic student center at Rutgers University during the Eid-al-Fitr holiday, officials said.\nThe man, Jacob Beacher, is accused of breaking into the Center for Islamic Life at the main Rutgers campus in New Brunswick, N.J., this month, vandalizing Turbah prayer stones, and stealing a charity box and the flag.\nThe Rutgers episode and the arrest of Mr. Beacher, 24, come as tensions over the Israel-Hamas war continue to fester on university campuses across the United States, where Muslim and Jewish students alike have complained of feeling that they are under attack.\nMr. Beacher, of North Plainfield, was charged in a criminal complaint with one count of intentional or attempted obstruction of religious practice and one count of making false statements to the federal authorities. He was ordered detained after an initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge André M. Espinosa of Federal District Court in Newark.\nA federal public defender representing Mr. Beacher did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nA Rutgers spokeswoman, Megan Schumann, said in an emailed statement that the university 'condemns this act of violence against the Rutgers-New Brunswick Muslim community and the desecration of a religious and community space.' She said there was no record of Mr. Beacher's having attended the university.\n'Such acts of hatred and bigotry against anyone in our community have no place at Rutgers,' Ms. Schumann added.\nIn a statement, Islamic center leaders expressed 'a sense of relief and safety knowing that the suspect is in custody.'\n'This incident did not occur in a vacuum,' the center said in its statement, adding that 'this incident is representative of a bigger issue — the dehumanization of Palestinian lives and voices abroad and locally.'\nAccording of an F.B.I. agent's affidavit attached to the complaint, security camera footage shows Mr. Beacher approaching the center's back door around 2:40 a.m. on April 10, the first day of Eid-al-Fitr. The holiday marks the end of Ramadan, the Muslim calendar's holiest month.\nAfter breaking a glass pane on the door, the affidavit says, Mr. Beacher reached inside and unlatched a deadbolt lock. Once inside, he vandalized the prayer stones and other items containing holy language from the Quran, and stole the flag and the charity box.\nHe left the center after about 20 minutes and rode his bike to a nearby park, where the charity box was later found, the affidavit says, citing surveillance footage.\nMr. Beacher spoke with investigators voluntarily two days after the break-in and acknowledged being the person captured by security cameras near the Islamic center but denied breaking into the building, according to the affidavit.",

            "summary": "President Biden will kick off a three-day tour of Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state, with a speech on Tuesday that focuses on taxes and aims to contrast his policies with those of former President Donald J. Trump.\nIn Scranton, his hometown, Mr. Biden is expected to talk about the tax code in the frame of economic fairness, arguing that Mr. Trump's tax cuts benefited billionaires while his own agenda has helped working- and middle-class families.\nThe president 'will outline how Trump's tax plan is a handout to the rich and leaves the middle class holding the bag,' Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign's communications director, said during a call with reporters. 'The address will drive home a simple question: Do you think the tax code should work for rich people and for corporations or for the middle class?'\nAll of that is standard election-year fare. But the backdrop to Mr. Biden's campaign swing could not be more unusual. In an unprecedented trial, Mr. Trump is spending most of this week, and much of the coming month or two, in a Manhattan courtroom facing criminal charges. Democrats hope that the contrast of Mr. Biden campaigning and carrying out the duties of a president while Mr. Trump's lawyers plead his innocence will highlight the choice voters face in November.\nAnd Mr. Biden must also contend with the fallout from Iran's weekend attack on Israel, which raised new fears of a wider regional war in the Middle East.\nOn Tuesday, the day after Tax Day, Mr. Biden is likely to promote his plans for changes to the tax code, including expanding the child tax credit, instituting a tax credit for first-time home buyers and making permanent tax credits for those who buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "She may not be a committee chair, but perhaps no single Republican lawmaker has done more to exert pressure on elite universities since the Israel-Gaza war began than Representative Elise Stefanik of New York.\nMs. Stefanik was already a rising star within her party, the top-ranking woman in Republican House leadership and considered a potential presidential running mate when the House Education and Workforce Committee began investigating antisemitism on college campuses. But her grilling of the presidents of Harvard, University of Pennsylvania and M.I.T. at a December hearing became a defining moment.\nMs. Stefanik pressed the leaders to say whether students would violate their universities' codes of conduct if they called for the genocide of Jews. Their dispassionate, lawyerly answers about context and free speech set off a firestorm that ultimately helped cost two of them, Claudine Gay of Harvard and Elizabeth Magill of the Penn, their jobs.\nThe exchange also helped win Ms. Stefanik widespread attention and rare plaudits from grudging liberals, who typically revile her for embracing former President Donald J. Trump and his lies about the 2020 election. On Wednesday, she was named one of Time's 100 most influential people of 2024.\nMs. Stefanik is a graduate of Harvard herself. When she first won her seat in 2014, she was the youngest woman ever elected to the House of Representatives. She beat a centrist Democrat, and in the early days of her career, she took on more moderate stances.\nThese days, she describes herself as 'ultra MAGA' and 'proud of it.'\nMs. Stefanik, 39, has said she was 'stunned' by the responses of the presidents during the last hearing. She plans to reprise that role on Wednesday, grilling the president of Columbia University, Nemat Shafik, and members of its board of trustees.\nIn an opinion piece in The New York Post before the hearing, Ms. Stefanik said antisemitism at Columbia had become 'egregious and commonplace.' She charged Dr. Shafik with failing 'to ensure Jewish students are able to attend school in a safe environment.'",

            "excerpt": "The Republican speaker's problems spring from his predecessor's efforts to placate the far right as he grasped for the gavel. Now they are seeking to use the leverage they won then to get their way on…",
            "summary": "Speaker Mike Johnson's push to advance an aid package for Ukraine in the face of vehement opposition from his own party was never going to be easy.\nBut it has been made even more politically perilous by a pair of concessions to the far right that he inherited from his predecessor: allowing a single lawmaker to call a snap vote to oust the speaker, and giving ultraconservatives a bloc of seats on a crucial panel that controls what legislation can make it to the House floor.\nBoth of those concessions, agreed to by former Speaker Kevin McCarthy more than a year ago, are now tormenting Mr. Johnson as he tries to push through a $95 billion aid bill for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. They have hemmed him in to having to rely heavily on Democrats — not only to clear the way for the legislation and drag it across the finish line, but potentially to save his job.\nMr. Johnson's predicament was on vivid display on the House floor on Thursday as a group of ultraconservatives huddled around him in a heated back and forth. One after another, they urged the speaker to tie the foreign aid package to stringent anti-immigration measures, but Mr. Johnson pushed back, replying that he would not have enough Republican support to advance such a measure, according to people involved in the private conversation.\nMinutes after the clash, some hard-right lawmakers who previously resisted joining the G.O.P. push to oust him began to sound more open to the idea.\n'My hope was that the motion to vacate would be an elixir that only required one dose for effectiveness,' said Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, who led the ouster of Mr. McCarthy. 'But sometimes there are some therapies that require more than one dose. And I hope that's not the case with the motion to vacate, but we'll administer the elixir as many times as is necessary to save the country.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "excerpt": "The far right finds itself marginalized in the House as Speaker Johnson pushes through aid to Ukraine and Israel by relying on Democrats.",
            "summary": "When Congress convened in 2023, an empowered far-right Republican faction in the House threatened to upend Washington and President Biden's agenda.\nBut the intransigence of that bloc instead forced Republicans and Democrats into an ad hoc coalition government that is now on the verge of delivering long-delayed foreign military aid and a victory to the Democratic president.\nThe House approval on Saturday of money for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan over angry objections from the extreme right was the latest and perhaps most striking example of a bipartisan approach forged out of necessity. The coalition first sprang up last year to spare the government a catastrophic debt default, and has reassembled at key moments since then to keep federal agencies funded.\nUnable to deliver legislation on their own because of a razor-thin majority and the refusal of those on the right to give ground, House Republicans had no choice but to break with their fringe members and join with Democrats if they wanted to accomplish much of anything, including bolstering Ukraine in its war against Russia.\n'Look at what MAGA extremism has got you: nothing,' Representative James P. McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, told Republicans on the House floor as lawmakers took their first steps toward approving the aid package. 'Nothing. Not a damn thing. In fact, it has empowered Democrats. At every critical juncture in this Congress, it has been Democrats who have been the ones to stand up for our country and do the right thing for the American people.'\nThe moments of bipartisan coming-together are hardly a template for a new paradigm of governing in polarized times. The grudging G.O.P. collaboration with Democrats has only come about on truly existential, must-pass legislation — and typically only at the last minute after Republicans have exhausted all other options, making the coalition unlikely to hold on less critical bills and the social policy issues that sharply divide the two parties.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "For weeks after the Senate passed a sprawling aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, Speaker Mike Johnson agonized over whether and how the House would take up funding legislation that would almost certainly infuriate the right wing of his party and could cost him his job.\nHe huddled with top national security officials, including William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, in the Oval Office to discuss classified intelligence. He met repeatedly with broad factions of Republicans in both swing and deep red districts, and considered their voters' attitudes toward funding Ukraine. He thought about his son, who is set to attend the U.S. Naval Academy in the fall.\nAnd finally, when his plan to work with Democrats to clear the way for aiding Ukraine met with an outpouring of venom from ultraconservatives already threatening to depose him, Mr. Johnson, an evangelical Christian, knelt and prayed for guidance.\n'I want to be on the right side of history,' Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, recalled the speaker telling him.\nMr. Johnson's decision to risk his speakership to push the $95 billion foreign aid bill through the House on Saturday was the culmination of a remarkable personal and political arc for the Louisiana Republican. It was also an improbable outcome for a man plucked from relative obscurity last fall by the hard right — which had just deposed a speaker they deemed a traitor to their agenda — to be the speaker of a deeply dysfunctional House.\nAs a rank-and-file hard-liner, Mr. Johnson had largely opposed efforts to fund Kyiv's war effort. And early in his speakership, he declared he would never allow the matter to come to a vote until his party's border demands were met.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The House took a critical step on Friday toward approving a long-stalled package of aid to Ukraine, Israel and other American allies, as Democrats supplied the crucial votes to push the legislation past Republican opposition so that it could be considered on the floor.\nThe 316-94 vote cleared the way for the House to bring up the aid package, teeing up separate votes on Saturday on each of its parts. But passage of those measures, each of which enjoys bipartisan support from different coalitions, was not in doubt, making Friday's action the key indicator that the legislation will have the backing needed to prevail.\nThe rule for considering the bill — historically a straight party-line vote — passed with more Democratic than Republican support, but it also won a majority of G.O.P. votes, making it clear that despite a pocket of deep resistance from the far right, there is broad bipartisan backing for the $95.3 billion package.\nThe vote was an enormous victory in the long effort to fund to Ukraine as it battles against Russian aggression, a major priority of President Biden that has met with bitter resistance from the right. It was a triumph against the forces of isolationism within the G.O.P. and a major moment of bipartisan consensus in a Congress that for the past year has been mostly defined by its dysfunction.\nBut it came only after Speaker Mike Johnson, who put his own job on the line to push through the plan over his party's objections, was forced to turn to Democrats in a significant breach of custom in the House, further imperiling his position even as he paved the way for the legislation to be voted on and approved.\nOn the House floor, Democrats held back their votes until it was clear there was not enough Republican support for the measure to pass without their backing, and then their 'yes' votes began pouring in. Ultimately, 165 Democrats voted for the measure, more than the 149 Republicans who supported it.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Google on Wednesday fired 28 workers after dozens of employees participated in sit-ins at the company's New York and Sunnyvale, Calif., offices to protest the company's cloud computing contract with the Israeli government.\nA day earlier, nine employees were arrested on charges of trespassing at the two offices.\n'Physically impeding other employees' work and preventing them from accessing our facilities is a clear violation of our policies, and completely unacceptable behavior,' a Google spokeswoman said in a statement.\nYears before the dismissals, tensions had been simmering between the company's management and some activist employees over Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion Google and Amazon deal to supply the Israeli government with cloud services, such as artificial intelligence.\nThat discord had deepened since the war in Gaza began in October. Google recently fired an employee who disrupted an Israeli technology conference in New York. And the company is even planning to make changes to a corporate forum because employees were bickering about the conflict.\nGoogle said it would continue to investigate the Tuesday protests. In Sunnyvale, employees refused to leave the office of Thomas Kurian, the chief executive of Google Cloud.\nGoogle employees affiliated with the group that organized the sit-ins, called No Tech For Apartheid, said in a statement that the firings were 'a flagrant act of retaliation.'\n'Google workers have the right to peacefully protest about terms and conditions of our labor,' the employees said. They added that some of the employees Google fired had not participated in the sit-ins.\nThe Nimbus contract, announced in 2021, was to supply various Israeli government ministries with cloud software. Since the contract's inception, some Google employees have expressed concern that the company was aiding Israel's military.\nA Google spokeswoman said that Nimbus 'is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.'\nIn 2018, Google workers successfully pushed the company to end a deal with the U.S. Defense Department. Called Project Maven, it would have helped the military analyze drone videos.\nEmployees who have taken part in Nimbus activism said in their statement that they would continue protesting 'until the company drops Project Nimbus.'",

            "summary": "The prospect of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. threatening to upend the presidential race went from an idea to a reality in one of the country's most consequential battlegrounds on Thursday, when Mr. Kennedy qualified for the ballot in Michigan.\nThe decision by the Natural Law Party to grant Mr. Kennedy its ballot line in November ensures he will be a factor in a pivotal swing state where the presidential election is expected to be incredibly close and where President Biden has already shown vulnerability with key Democratic constituencies. During Michigan's primary in February, a protest movement over Mr. Biden's support for Israel's war in Gaza drew significant support.\nMr. Kennedy, a lifelong Democrat and the scion of perhaps the nation's most famous Democratic family, is running as an independent in 2024 and polling higher in early surveys than any third-party candidate since Ross Perot, the self-funding billionaire who ran in the 1990s.\nHis independent candidacy has earned him the estrangement of his own family — who campaigned this week with Mr. Biden in Pennsylvania — and many of his previous colleagues from the environmental movement, who denounced his candidacy publicly on Friday.\nMr. Kennedy has emerged as a leading voice of vaccine skepticism, both before and after Covid-19 vaccine, and dabbled in conspiratorial theories, including about the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, his father. He had initially declared his 2024 campaign as a Democratic challenger to Mr. Biden — and was heavily featured in conservative media — until he switched last fall to run as an independent.\nBoth parties are already rushing to define Mr. Kennedy as he races to get on the ballot nationwide.\nBrian Hughes, an adviser to Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, called Mr. Kennedy 'a leftist and liberal with a history of supporting an extreme environmental agenda that rivals Joe Biden for its ability to kill American jobs.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
