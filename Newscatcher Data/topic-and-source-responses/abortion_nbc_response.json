            "excerpt": "The presentation lays out a menu of GOP options on abortion policy after a state Supreme Court ruling upholding a near-total abortion ban in Arizona law.",
            "summary": "PHOENIX — Republican state legislators in Arizona are considering pushing alternative ballot measures competing with a proposed constitutional amendment expanding abortion rights in the state, according to a PowerPoint presentation obtained by NBC News, as the GOP faces the fallout from a state Supreme Court ruling upholding a near-total abortion ban.\nThe strategy document includes a slide titled: 'PHASE 2: SEND VOTERS TWO OTHER OPTIONS THAT CONFLICT WITH AAA INITIATIVE,' in reference to the Arizona for Abortion Access ballot measure which aims to enshrine abortion rights into the state's constitution through fetal viability and vastly expand the scope for exceptions.\nThe document outlines a plan to give the voters alternatives to the Arizona for Abortion Access ballot measure, presenting options for other constitutional amendments like the '15-week Reproductive Care and Abortion Act and Heartbeat Protection Act.'\nAnd the document also discusses presenting voters with an option for a limit on abortions after 15 weeks that would actually be a stricter ban.\n'Could scale back 15-week law to 14-week law,' reads the presentation. 'In reality, a 14-week law disguised as a 15-week law because it would only allow abortion until the beginning of the 15th week,' it goes on.\nThe Arizona state Legislature is slated to reconvene on Wednesday as pressure mounts from Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, to repeal Arizona's 1864 abortion ban.\nState House Speaker Ben Toma said in a statement responding to the presentation: 'The document presents ideas drafted for internal discussion and consideration within the caucus. I've publicly stated that we are looking at options to address this subject, and this is simply part of that.'\nDawn Penich, spokesperson for Arizona for Abortion Access, the coalition of reproductive rights organizations including the ACLU of Arizona and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona, said that the document 'shows yet again why Arizonans can't leave our most basic and personal rights in the hands of politicians in the state legislature.\nThe Republican PowerPoint also outlines a plan to 'constitutionalize existing laws,' on the books in Arizona in response to the debate over abortion policy. That includes 'forbidding anyone who is not a licensed physician from performing an abortion,' and outlawing 'discriminatory abortions' or 'prohibiting physicians from performing an abortion when a physician knows the purpose is based on genetic abnormality or race or gender.'\nThe purpose of putting forward those proposals, according to the document: 'Changes narrative — Republicans have a plan!' It says the GOP needs to give voters 'give voters something other than the extreme abortion-on- demand AAA Initiative' to choose in November. The 24-week ballot measure has gotten a surge of attention in the last week after the state Supreme Court ruled that Arizona's near-total ban dating from 1864 was enforceable.\nThe Republican strategy document also has a contingency plan in the event that the Arizona For Abortion Access Act's referendum succeeds in November by adding a 'conditional enactment' to it.\nThe PowerPoint presentation ends with a slide that includes a meme of late-night television host Seth Meyers and the text, 'BOOM. EASY AS THAT.'\nAlex Tabet Adam Edelman",

            "excerpt": "The speech in Florida is part of a series of Biden campaign events trying to nationalize the issue of state abortion limits.",
            "summary": "President Joe Biden will on Tuesday deliver a speech in Florida denouncing that state's new six-week abortion ban and other efforts to restrict abortion access across the country, according to Biden campaign aides who shared details of the trip first with NBC News.\nAt the event, which is scheduled to take place in Tampa about one week before the state law is set to go into effect, the president will talk about the 'the stakes of this election for reproductive freedom across the entire country.'\nBiden will also tie Florida's restrictions on the procedure to other consequences of Roe v. Wade being overturned in 2022, including the Arizona state Supreme Court decision last week which upheld a near-total abortion ban dating from 1864, according to the aides.\n'From Arizona to Florida, more and more Americans are seeing up close the devastating impact of Trump overturning Roe v. Wade,' Morgan Mohr, senior advisor for reproductive rights for the Biden-Harris campaign, said in a statement. 'While Donald Trump continues to brag about unleashing these extreme and dangerous bans, President Joe Biden is running to restore reproductive freedom. Since the overturning of Roe, whenever reproductive rights have been on the ballot, they have won, and this November will be no different.'\nThe event is significant for Biden: While voicing full support for abortion access, he has often looked to Vice President Kamala Harris to be the administration's most prominent voice on the issue. Since the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturned the federal right to abortion, Harris has held more than 80 events across 20 states focused on reproductive freedom, including delivering a speech last week in Arizona criticizing the ban in that state and tying in former President Donald Trump's role allowing abortion restrictions to take place.\nOn Tuesday, though, Biden will take center stage on the issue. The president is expected to attack Trump for saying he is proud of appointing the Supreme Court justices who made overturning Roe v. Wade possible, as well as for other comments related to recently enacted state abortion bans. Biden is also expected to say that if re-elected, Trump and his allies will enact a federal abortion ban, though Trump has recently claimed he would not do so, saying instead that he wanted the issue left to the states.\nMeanwhile, the Biden-Harris campaign has been hammering Republicans as more and more states restrict abortion. The campaign has rolled out emotional ads focused on the issue and has used women impacted by the abortion restrictions as campaign surrogates across the country.\nBiden's trip to Tampa is part of the campaign's broader effort to nationalize the fallout and the conversation around state abortion bans. The campaign sees Florida's abortion ban as especially salient because, once in effect, the six-week ban will impact the entire Southeast, given that many women have previously traveled to Florida from states with stricter abortion bans to get abortions.\nYamiche Alcindor",

            "excerpt": "Arizona's Supreme Court ruled last week that an 1864 law banning most abortions from the moment of conception could be enforced, sending the state into chaos.",
            "summary": "'The communities most impacted are those who are undocumented, those who live in rural communities with very little resources, immigrant communities where language barriers are present for them, low income communities, and individuals who are facing other intersecting issues,' said Eloisa Lopez, executive director of the nonprofit abortion rights group Pro-Choice Arizona.\nMany U.S. women are crossing the border to access the abortive drug misoprostol, which is sold over-the-counter in most of Mexico to treat stomach ulcers.\nIn Sonora, a sophisticated network of local activists have formed organizations that help get misoprostol to Mexican women — and American women — despite the state's abortion ban.\nBut activists in Sonora say they've seen misinformation and price gouging by pharmacies in Mexican states with stringent abortion restrictions.\nAndrea Sánchez, an organizer with the Sonora-based abortion advocacy network Aborto Seguro Sonora, said that most pharmacists in the state will require a prescription or overcharge women for the drug on the black market.\n'We have heard of women who are sold a dose of no more than four misoprostol pills for 5,000 ($300) or 6,000 pesos ($360) and with that dose they generally will not achieve a successful abortion,' Sánchez said. 'The serious thing is that women's vulnerability is being abused, the situation they are going through, but also that they are playing with women's health.'\nA blueprint for cross-border collaboration After Texas implemented a six-week abortion ban in 2021, activists in Mexican border states began receiving a flurry of calls and messages from American women seeking care on their side of the border.\nOnly one state along the Texas border, Coahuila, allows abortion in the first trimester.\nVanessa Jiménez, an activist with the Necesito Abortar México network in Nuevo León, another state bordering Texas, said she remembers on June 24, 2022, when Roe v. Wade was overturned, her organization received 70 calls, many from women in the U.S.\n'There were very frightened women, there were even girls who had their appointments scheduled and had them canceled at that moment,' recalls Jiménez, who said that for decades — before Texas implemented strict abortion restrictions — women protesting for their reproductive rights in Nuevo León shouted slogans like 'poor women can't have an abortion, but rich women can go to Houston.'\nIn Nuevo León, there are only two legal grounds for obtaining an abortion: in the case of rape and when the person's life is in danger if the pregnancy continues.\nDue to these restrictions, Jiménez and a group of 20 women have focused on guiding and offering recommendations to people who wish to have an abortion using medications such as misoprostol and mifepristone, following the guidelines established by entities such as the World Health Organization and other leading groups.\n'Apart from American women who write and speak only English, we also get a lot of women who are migrant women who cannot go to a clinic or pay for a trip to New York or California, where abortion is legalized, and who cannot cross into Mexico,' said Jiménez, who has been an abortion activist for more than 15 years. 'Most of the women we help in the U.S. we also provide the medication free of charge.'\n'We help more than 1,000 women per month,' said Jiménez, who estimated that approximately 30% of the counseling offered by her organization is for people from the United States, who contact them through social media or arrive in person.\nIn addition, seven years ago Jimenez founded a project called La Abortería, which is a space in her home where she helps women who don't have a place to have a medical abortion. 'There is a belief that you need to have a doctor at your side and a nurse, but the World Health Organization itself has stated that medical abortion can be performed as an extremely safe procedure,' she explains.\nIn Arizona, Lopez said that women affected by the state's impending ban will likely seek abortions in California, Nevada or New Mexico before resorting to options in Mexico.\nWhether Arizona's ban stands after Election Day remains to be seen. State organizers say they have more than enough signatures to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would let voters weigh in on whether to create a 'fundamental right' to abortion in the state until fetal viability. Dawn Penich, a spokesperson for the nonprofit coalition Arizona for Abortion, said the amendment has gained widespread support and momentum since last week's ruling.\n'Appreciation for one's personal freedoms and liberty is a very Arizona idea,' said Penich, who added that, especially in the state's rural communities, 'the idea of getting the government out of your bedroom, out of your private life and out of your exam room is very popular.'\n'It's about having the choice and the ability to make the decision that's right for you and your family,' she said.\nIsabela Espadas Barros Leal reported from New York, and Albinson Linares from Mexico City.\nIsabela Espadas Barros Leal reported from New York, and Albinson Linares from Mexico City.\nAlbinson Linares",

            "excerpt": "Abortion is at the center of President Joe Biden's re-election campaign — an improbability for a politician who long expressed his personal discomfort with the practice.",
            "summary": "The issue has been particularly fraught for Biden, an 81-year-old steeped in Catholic teachings and reliant on religious faith to cope with unthinkable tragedy: the deaths of two children and his first wife, Neilia.\n'One of the things that carried him through his numerous difficulties is his Catholic approach of giving yourself to the Lord,' said Ted Kaufman, a longtime Biden confidant and his former Senate chief of staff.\nOn a human level, Biden has never fully overcome his misgivings about abortion. That's evident even in the language he occasionally uses. Two years ago, talking to reporters before he boarded Air Force One, Biden referred to the procedure as aborting 'a child' rather than a fetus, a clue about the point at which he believed life began.\nStill, his stance is that he won't impose his personal views on Americans who believe differently. In 1974, the year he said in an interview that Roe. v. Wade went 'too far,' he also voiced opposition to a constitutional amendment to ban abortion, albeit with some ambivalence, a hometown news report at the time shows.\nA column in the Morning News of Wilmington in January 1974 said Biden told a group of anti-abortion activists: \"I am not sure my stand against such a constitutional amendment is right, nor am I sure the anti-abortionist stand is right, but right now I think I am more right than you are.\"\nLauren Hitt, a campaign spokesperson, said in a prepared statement: 'Joe Biden has opposed abortion bans since the 1970s. As a senator, he voted repeatedly to protect Roe, and as President, he has used his full executive authority to fight back on extreme MAGA attacks on reproductive freedom.'\nBiden described the tensions between faith and policy last year at a Maryland fundraising event.\n'I happen to be a practicing Catholic,' he said. 'I'm not big on abortion. But guess what? Roe v. Wade got it right.'\nA look at his record shows that his path has had its share of starts and stops. As a senator in 1982, he voted in a committee meeting in favor of a constitutional amendment that would have given states the power to restrict abortion if they chose, effectively overturning Roe v. Wade.\nAt the time, Biden said his aim was to push the vote to the Senate floor, where it would finally be resolved. The measure never got that far, and when it came up again the next year, he voted against it.\nIn 2019, as the Democratic front-runner for the presidential nomination, he reversed his long-held position in favor of the so-called Hyde Amendment banning federal funding for abortions.\nThat about-face came at head-spinning speed. One day, his campaign said he supported the Hyde Amendment; the next day, amid blowback from fellow Democrats, he dropped that position. He justified the switch by saying he could no longer support the policy because Republicans were restricting access to abortion in poor neighborhoods.\n'Joe Biden is an Irish Catholic kid from Scranton,' said John Carr, founder of the Initiative on Catholic Life and Social Thought at Georgetown University. 'He seems to stay with Catholic orthodoxy until he thinks the political or other costs are too high.'\nBiden recognized early on that his nuanced position — wary of abortion at his core, accepting of abortion rights in the public square — was bound to cause him grief. He told fellow Sen. Abe Ribicoff of Connecticut in 1973 that his stance would most likely please no one, according to his 2007 memoir, 'Promises to Keep.'\nThat proved prescient.\nIn Biden's first year as president, conservative Catholic bishops argued that he shouldn't receive communion given his backing of abortion rights. He met privately with Pope Francis at the Vatican in October of that year, and afterward he said the pope had assured him that communion shouldn't be withheld.\nKathleen Sebelius, who was health and human services secretary in President Barack Obama's administration, said in an interview that she sympathized with Biden's predicament.\n'I'm born and raised Catholic and went to Catholic schools for 17 years of my life,' said Sebelius, a former governor of Kansas. 'I understand this issue. I've been called out by the archbishop. I was ordered not to take communion.\n'I've been on the personal side of this and the political side of this, and I understand the struggle that those of us who are raised in a faith community and then live in a political world deal with,' she added. 'It's not easy. I think Nancy Pelosi [the former House speaker, who is also Catholic] understands that. I think Joe Biden understands it. It's not a simple choice.'\nWhatever Biden's journey, most advocates say they now have full confidence that he is a reliable champion of abortion rights. When Biden left the Senate in 2009, he had a 100% rating from what was then called NARAL Pro-Choice America, a group promoting abortion access.\n'Biden is not the same man as he used to be when it comes to abortion rights,' said Ilyse Hogue, former president of the organization. 'I don't think he's been hiding his agenda just to win a second term and then secretly plans to turn around and become this anti-choice guy. I'm not worried about it at all.'\nSome still don't believe Biden goes far enough to promote reproductive rights.\nRenee Bracey Sherman, founder and a co-executive director of We Testify, an abortion rights advocacy group, said Biden should use his megaphone to remove the stigma tied to abortion instead of airing his personal doubts. She pointed to recent surveys indicating that 6 in 10 Catholics support abortion rights.\n'He's the president of the United States; he's not the pope of the United States,' Bracey Sherman said. 'I'm sorry, he's allowed to have his personal feelings. But at the end of the day, he is the president, and he is supposed to defend the Constitution and people in this country who need abortions.'\nBracey Sherman said her organization reached out to the Biden administration multiple times offering to bring Catholics who have had abortions into the White House to share their stories — but has yet to hear back.\n'He makes it seem as though he's the one who's following the Catholic teachings,' she said. 'But what about the rest of the Catholics in America who do support access to abortion and have abortions?'\nElections are a choice. Even Biden detractors say they're fully aware that the only realistic alternative at this point is Trump, whom they view as an extremist on the issue.\nAbortion looks to be one of Trump's glaring vulnerabilities. He has boasted about his role in overturning Roe v. Wade through his appointment of three conservative Supreme Court justices during his single term.\n'There is a fundamental question and a fundamental difference between the president and Donald Trump and their belief on whether the Constitution affords women a right to choose. Donald Trump does not; Joe Biden does,' said Kate Berner, a former Biden White House official.\nTrump recently said abortion decisions should be left to the states after he was criticized that he has been murky about what he believes. Even so, he sought to dissociate himself from a recent state court ruling in Arizona upholding a 19th century law imposing a near-total abortion ban.\nDisavowing Arizona's strict anti-abortion measure isn't so easy for Trump. The reason it can take effect springs directly from the votes of conservative Supreme Court justices whom Trump worked to install.\n'The fact is that he announced he was going to stack the court with justices who could be counted on to overrule Roe v. Wade,' said Laurence Tribe, a Harvard Law School professor emeritus. 'He succeeded in that. They did it. That led to the revival of laws like Arizona's, even if Trump says: ‘Oops, I'm sorry that's the consequence. It doesn't make me look good politically.''\nBiden was at the White House last Sunday, dealing with the fallout from Iran's attack on Israel. When he's in Washington on the weekends, he'll often attend services at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Georgetown, the church frequented by the nation's first Catholic president, John F. Kennedy. A Black Lives Matter banner hangs from a fence outside.\nBiden wasn't in the pews that day; he was attending a virtual meeting with U.S. allies about the Iranian attack.\nThe Rev. Patrick Earl led the Mass and greeted congregants at the doorway afterward. He said in an interview that Biden is a 'good presence' during services, recalling how he once left his seat to congratulate a boy's family celebrating his First Communion.\nEarl said he understood Biden's position, even if it conflicts with church teaching.\n'As the political leader of a very varied country, you can't just say, ‘You've got to believe as I believe,'\" he said. \"You just can't.\"\nPeter Nicholas Natasha Korecki",

            "excerpt": "In states with abortion bans, there's little guidance for dispensing the FDA-approved drug misoprostol, which is often prescribed for miscarriage.",
            "summary": "Alarm bells ring in Matt Murray's head when a prescription for misoprostol comes through his independent pharmacy in Boise, Idaho.\n'Are there directions on the prescription that show what it's being used for?' said Murray, a pharmacist and director of operations for Customedica Pharmacy. 'If not, then we would probably need to call the [doctor's] office and confirm why it's being prescribed.'\nThe medication is legal — approved by the Food and Drug Administration to prevent stomach ulcers — but it can also be used for abortions, which became illegal in Idaho with few exceptions when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\nWhen that happened, misoprostol went from 'something that wasn't on the radar but now sends up an alert in the pharmacy,' Murray said.\nMisoprostol, which works by contracting the uterus, is also commonly used ahead of gynecologic procedures, such as the insertion of intrauterine devices for birth control, or after miscarriages, when pregnancies end on their own. The drug helps speed up the time it takes for a woman's body to expel the failed pregnancy.\nMurray's hesitation in dispensing misoprostol isn't based on personal feelings about abortion. It's the fear of legal action or jail time.\nIdaho's 'Defense of Life Act' says any person who performs or assists in an abortion could face felony criminal charges and up to five years in prison. Exceptions include to save the life of the woman and in cases of rape or incest.\nDoes that mean pharmacists could be liable for dispensing a drug that could be used in an abortion — even if it's not?\nPharmacists like Murray in Idaho aren't sure.\n'The law isn't clear whether a pharmacist is committing a felony for dispensing the medication,' he said. 'What level of due diligence are we expected to perform?'\nAlison Tanner, senior legal counsel at the National Women's Law Center, said, 'Pharmacists are understandably scared by these incredibly strict abortion laws that have been enacted, and they are afraid that they might be charged with a felony simply for doing their job.'\nIn some cases, pharmacists have refused to prescribe misoprostol, no matter its purpose.\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told NBC News it isn't able to confirm the number of complaints it has received from women who have been denied prescribed medications.\nIn a public statement last year, Melanie Fontes Rainer, director of HHS' Office for Civil Rights, acknowledged that women across the country have faced delays in getting medication even when they weren't seeking abortions.\n'The overturning of Roe v. Wade is causing chaos in our healthcare system, including in our pharmacies, where healthcare providers are suddenly being asked to not only provide healthcare, but also become legal experts in navigating the patchwork of abortion bans,' Rainier wrote in a statement.\nThe Idaho Board of Pharmacy said that because of the 'uniqueness of every situation,' it isn't providing guidance for its pharmacists who dispense medications that could be used to terminate a pregnancy.\n'Pharmacists licensed in Idaho are expected to comply with the law. Idaho law, in most circumstances, prohibits abortion,' a board representative wrote in an email, adding that 'abortion does not mean the removal of a dead unborn child or the treatment of a woman who is no longer pregnant.'\nKristin Colson, 36, of Boise, experienced her own distressing delay.\nWhen she and her husband, Loren, realized she was having a miscarriage in January, her doctor prescribed misoprostol. The natural process of a miscarriage can be unpredictable, and it can take months, but misoprostol helps speed it.\nIt was the couple's fifth pregnancy loss. Kristin had used the drug successfully in the past.\n'Everybody processes grief differently. But for me, I like to have a plan,' Colson said. 'Choosing to use the medication, I can time when this happens.'\nShe waited more than a day to hear back from her local Walgreens, she said. When she called to ask about the status of her order, the pharmacist, Colson said, told her that he 'didn't feel comfortable filling the misoprostol prescription at that dosage, given the Idaho laws.'\nThe response was a shock, she said.\n'It's a tough time. You're trying to process your loss. And I was frustrated, confused,' Colson said. 'You just want to move on.'\nLoren Colson, also 36, said: 'We're trying to start a family. We're not old, but we're not young, either. We are on a little bit of a timeline if we want to start our family. It really impacts us, any delay in that process.'\nIn a statement, Walgreens said that while it doesn't require 'pharmacists with moral objections to dispense reproductive medications,' it actively works to make sure other pharmacists are available to fill prescriptions.\nAnother Walgreens ultimately filled Kristin Colson's misoprostol prescription.\nBut the concern among pharmacists remains.\n'Ultimately, the fear is that people aren't getting the medical care that they're needing,' Murray said.\nErika Edwards Marina Kopf",

            "summary": "PHOENIX — Arizona lawmakers kicked off a highly anticipated legislative session Wednesday, amid mounting pressure on Republicans to repeal a near-total ban on abortion from 1864 that was upheld by the battleground state's Supreme Court.\nFollowing that ruling, Republicans across Arizona and the country — including former President Donald Trump — called on state legislators to repeal the ban as the party has continued to deal with blowback on the issue of reproductive rights in the nearly two years since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade.\nThe Arizona Supreme Court ruling last week allowed a Civil War-era law in Arizona to stand that made abortion a felony punishable by two to five years in prison for anyone who performs one or helps a woman obtain one. The law — which was codified in 1901 and again in 1913, after Arizona gained statehood — outlaws abortion from the moment of conception but includes an exception to save the woman's life.\nThe bombshell decision added the swing state to the growing lists of places where abortion care is effectively banned — and set off an explosion of political activity. Democrats furiously undertook efforts to repeal the ban, while Republicans scrambled feverishly to offset the political fallout by discussing a series of possible contingencies.\nThose options include pushing alternative ballot measures to compete with a proposed constitutional amendment to expand abortion rights in the state, according to a leaked strategy document circulated among Arizona Republicans obtained Monday by NBC News.\nThe document made no mention of repealing the ban and Arizona House Republicans squashed an effort by Democrats during their session last Wednesday to repeal the ban.\nDespite the growing pressure on Arizona Republicans, Democratic lawmakers face an uphill climb in repealing the ban: Republicans hold a narrow two-seat majority in both legislative chambers, meaning that Democrats need three Republicans in both the state House and state Senate to repeal the ban.\nArizona political insiders and experts told NBC News that because Republicans are considering so many varying courses of action Wednesday, it remained unclear whether, or when, a bill to repeal the ban will even be introduced during the session.\nAdam Edelman Alex Tabet",

            "summary": "Voters in Michigan will head to the polls Tuesday for a pair of state House special elections that will determine partisan control of the chamber.\nIn the race for the open seat in the 13th state House District — which encompasses a large part of the city of Warren, within purple Macomb County — Democrat Mai Xiong, a member of the Macomb County Board of Commissioners, is running against Republican Ronald Singer, who ran for the seat unsuccessfully in 2022. The seat, which leans Democratic, became vacant last fall when the incumbent Democrat, Lori Stone, resigned after she won an election to be the mayor of Warren.\nIn the race for the open seat in the 25th state House District — which includes, within Wayne County, some of the western suburbs of Detroit, like Westland and Sheldon — Democrat Peter Herzberg, a Westland City council member, is running against Republican Josh Powell, a U.S. Army veteran. The seat, which also leans Democratic, became vacant last fall when the incumbent Democrat, Kevin Coleman, resigned after winning an election to be the mayor of Westland.\nThe winner of each race will only serve the remainder of their predecessors' two-year terms through the end of 2024.\nPrior to the two lawmakers' resignations, Democrats had held a two-seat advantage in the state House. Their departures created a 54-54 tie in the chamber. Democrats also hold the governorship and the state Senate in Michigan, meaning that a pair of victories would again provide the party with a trifecta in state government.\nBoth districts heavily lean Democratic: In 2022, Stone won her seat with 67% support, while Coleman received 63% of the vote. But the races could still serve as a referendum on the Democratic trifecta — and on the long list of policy moves they made with it. Led by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, over the past two years Michigan Democrats have enacted laws protecting abortion rights, boosting union rights, combatting gun violence and expanding LGBTQ protections.\nFueled by continued success across the country on the issue of abortion, Democrats in the state have largely made the races about reproductive rights.\nXiong and Herzberg have emphasized their support for reproductive rights and the litany of moves made by the Democratic Legislature protecting them. Powell has said he opposes all abortion care 'without exception' and has suggested he'd try to repeal the state's abortion protections, while Singer has focused his campaign on economic issues.\n'It's significant,' Michigan Democratic state House Speaker Joe Tate said, referring to the role abortion rights is playing in both of the special elections. 'It's large — and for good reason.'\n'It's top of mind for voters,' he added.\nThe Democratic candidates have also run heavily on the accomplishments that the party achieved during its trifecta, betting that voters in these two districts within the pivotal presidential battleground will reward that list of progressive policies.\n'Michigan is a shining example of what Democrats do in leadership,' said Abhi Rahman, a spokesperson for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee — the national Democratic Party arm in charge of funding candidates for state legislative races — which invested about $48,000 in the pair of races.\n'Fundamental freedoms are at stake in Michigan,' he said. 'The Democratic trifecta is at stake.'\nDemocrats have enjoyed a solid record in special state legislative elections in recent months.\nIn February, Democrats won a state House special election in Pennsylvania, preserving the party's narrow majority in the closely watched battleground state. And last month, the Democratic candidate in a special election for a state House seat in Alabama won after she made in vitro fertilization and abortion rights central to her campaign.\nAdam Edelman",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The policy contrasts between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are sharpening as the general election campaign gets fully underway.\nBut what does the choice represent for ordinary voters and the economic and cultural issues they care about? A rematch between the Democratic incumbent and his Republican predecessor may feel uninspiring to many voters, but the policy stakes are enormous for tens of millions of Americans — and the world.\nHere are seven big issues at stake in the 2024 election.\nAbortion The contrast: Biden favors federal abortion protections; Trump opposes them. Trump supported nationwide restrictions on abortion as president but now downplays the need for a federal ban, as Republicans are divided over the issue. Biden does not support federal limits.\nThe contrast: Biden favors federal abortion protections; Trump opposes them. Trump supported nationwide restrictions on abortion as president but now downplays the need for a federal ban, as Republicans are divided over the issue. Biden does not support federal limits. Biden has championed the Women's Health Protection Act, a bill to protect abortion rights in all 50 states under federal law and prohibit medically unnecessary hurdles to accessing the procedure. He has asked voters to send him a Democratic Congress that supports legal abortion to achieve that.\nTrump has boasted that he \"broke Roe v. Wade\" by picking three of the five Supreme Court justices who overturned it, delivering on a four-decade goal of the GOP. More recently, Trump has openly fretted that the backlash may cost him and his party the election. Last week, Trump said the issue should be left to states, a shift from his support for nationwide restrictions when he was president. His new stance has drawn pushback from GOP allies, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and anti-abortion-rights advocates, who say that he is wrong and that Republicans should not be deterred from their long-standing goal of enacting some nationwide abortion limits.\nSome Republicans downplay the prospects of federal abortion restrictions' passing Congress, even if they win full control. Biden and his allies are telling voters to look at the GOP's long history of championing federal restrictions and not their recent rhetoric.\nImmigration The contrast: Trump has promised a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration and tougher executive actions; Biden is asking Congress to give him more tools to manage an overwhelmed border and create new legal pathways to immigrate to the U.S.\nThe contrast: Trump has promised a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration and tougher executive actions; Biden is asking Congress to give him more tools to manage an overwhelmed border and create new legal pathways to immigrate to the U.S. Trump has called existing border laws an existential threat to the U.S., saying migrants are 'poisoning the blood of our country' and bringing new 'languages.' His campaign website says: 'President Trump will shut down Biden's border disaster. He will again end catch-and-release, restore Remain in Mexico, and eliminate asylum fraud. In cooperative states, President Trump will deputize the National Guard and local law enforcement to assist with rapidly removing illegal alien gang members and criminals.'\nAfter having rescinded some of Trump's policies, Biden has recently shifted to support stricter immigration laws as the system remains overwhelmed. He championed a bipartisan bill to raise the bar for gaining asylum, grant more U.S. resources to process asylum claims and turn away migrants who do not qualify, and empower the president to temporarily shut down the border if migration levels hit certain triggers. (Republicans blocked the bill in the Senate amid lobbying by Trump, who wants to use the border as an election issue.) Biden has also endorsed the U.S. Citizenship Act, which would grant a pathway to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally if they pass background checks and pay their taxes.\nFundamentally, Trump has aligned with forces who want less immigration into the country, while Biden has embraced the belief that immigrants make the U.S. better.\nHealth care and prescription drugs The contrast: Biden wants to extend Affordable Care Act provisions and empower Medicare to negotiate more prescription drugs; Trump has aggressively criticized the ACA but not offered a health care plan.\nThe contrast: Biden wants to extend Affordable Care Act provisions and empower Medicare to negotiate more prescription drugs; Trump has aggressively criticized the ACA but not offered a health care plan. Biden, who was vice president when the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, sees it as a cherished achievement to protect and strengthen. The law, also known as \"Obamacare,\" which has extended coverage to 45 million people through subsidies, insurance mandates and a Medicaid expansion, continues to face conservative opposition.\nSeparately, Biden has touted a provision in his party-line Inflation Reduction Act that empowers Medicare to negotiate lower prices for 10 prescription drugs. He said he wants to boost that to 50 if he is re-elected, with the goal of $200 billion in savings.\nTrump spent his four years as president fighting unsuccessfully to repeal and unravel the law — through legislation and executive action and endorsing lawsuits to wipe it out. In November, Trump called for revisiting plans to \"terminate\" the ACA. He has recently sought to downplay that and insists he only wants to improve the law. But he has not offered a health care plan. Many of his GOP allies in Congress still favor repealing or undoing the ACA, including a budget by the Republican Study Committee, which boasts about 80% of the House GOP conference as members, including Speaker Mike Johnson, of Louisiana.\nTaxes The contrast: Trump's 2017 tax cuts expire at the end of next year, and he has called for extending them; Biden has called for raising taxes on families earning over $400,000 to fund various priorities.\nThe contrast: Trump's 2017 tax cuts expire at the end of next year, and he has called for extending them; Biden has called for raising taxes on families earning over $400,000 to fund various priorities. A series of Trump tax cuts, which Republicans passed on a party-line basis in 2017, expire at the end of 2025. Congress and the winner of the election will decide what happens to them.\nIn a recent private speech to wealthy donors, Trump said his policies include \"extending the Trump tax cuts\" if he is elected, according to a Trump campaign official. That would preserve lower rates across the income spectrum, with the biggest benefits for top earners.\nBiden has attacked that law as a giveaway to the wealthiest Americans, vowing to make \"big corporations and the very wealthy finally pay their fair share.\" He has backed a corporate tax rate hike from 21% to 28% and said that \"nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny in federal taxes.\" Biden is also calling for a $3,600-per-child tax cut for families, an $800 average tax break for \"front-line workers\" and a 25% minimum tax on billionaires, according to a newly released campaign plank.\nThe expiration of the Trump tax cuts will restore the unlimited federal deduction for state and local taxes, which Republicans had capped at $10,000 in the 2017 law. Republicans broadly support preserving the cap, with some exceptions, while most Democrats want to lift it.\nJudges and the Supreme Court The contrast: Their track records tell a clear story. Trump has picked young conservative judges to serve on the federal bench, while Biden has picked liberals with a focus on professional and personal diversity.\nThe contrast: Their track records tell a clear story. Trump has picked young conservative judges to serve on the federal bench, while Biden has picked liberals with a focus on professional and personal diversity. One of the clearest contrasts is what kinds of judges Trump and Biden would pick for lifetime appointments on the federal courts. A simple way for voters to think about it is whether they prefer new judges with the conservative views of Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump's first Supreme Court pick, or with the liberal views of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, Biden's (so far only) high court pick.\nAs president, Trump nominated young conservative judges who will serve for generations. Biden has focused on finding judges with diverse backgrounds and résumés, including more civil rights lawyers and public defenders.\nPerhaps the biggest question is whether a Supreme Court vacancy will open up in the next four years. The presidential election winner and the party that controls the Senate would fill it.\nTrade The contrast: Trump is pushing a 10% across-the-board tariff on imports; Biden's White House opposes that, saying it would raise inflation.\nThe contrast: Trump is pushing a 10% across-the-board tariff on imports; Biden's White House opposes that, saying it would raise inflation. Trump, long a skeptic of U.S. trade deals, has proposed to impose a 10% tariff on all imported goods if he returns to the White House. He recently told Fox News that it could be 60% — or potentially 'more than that' — on imports of Chinese goods.\nBiden opposes that idea. In a memo over the weekend, the White House slammed the idea of \"across-the-board tariffs that would raise taxes and prices by $1,500 per American family,\" without naming Trump; it referred to an estimate by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, that Trump's 10% tax on imports could cost an average American household $1,500 per year.\nBiden, instead, has sought to boost domestic manufacturing with major federal investments in semiconductors and electric vehicles.\nForeign policy and NATO The contrast: Biden favors Ukraine aid, while Trump is skeptical of it; Biden supports NATO and a traditional view of American power, while Trump has criticized NATO and voiced some isolationist views.\nThe contrast: Biden favors Ukraine aid, while Trump is skeptical of it; Biden supports NATO and a traditional view of American power, while Trump has criticized NATO and voiced some isolationist views. The clearest example of the foreign policy differences between the two concerns the fate of Ukraine, which is running low on ammunition and says it needs U.S. assistance to continue holding off Russia's aggression. Biden is an ardent proponent of helping Ukraine, while Trump has poured cold water on U.S. aid to Ukraine and successfully pressured House Republicans to block it since they took the majority in January 2023.\nAnd that points to a deeper divide: Biden is an outspoken supporter of the NATO alliance as a bulwark against adversaries like Russia and China and of preserving the post-World War II order. Trump has dialed up his criticisms of NATO and aligned with a growing isolationist wing in the U.S. that wants to be less involved in global affairs. Trump recently said that as president, he 'would encourage' Russia 'to do whatever the hell they want' to member countries who are 'delinquent' in their dues.\nSahil Kapur",

            "excerpt": "NBC News' latest national poll shows Biden's numbers inching up as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., inflation and abortion all scramble the 2024 contest.",
            "summary": "The share of voters who say they have high interest in the 2024 election has hit a nearly 20-year low at this point in a presidential race, according to the latest national NBC News poll, with majorities holding negative views of both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.\nThe poll also shows Biden trimming Trump's previous lead to just 2 points in a head-to-head contest, an improvement within the margin of error compared to the previous survey, as the president bests Trump on the issues of abortion and uniting the country, while the former Republican president is ahead on competency and dealing with inflation.\nAnd it finds inflation and immigration topping the list of most important issues facing the country, as just one-third of voters give Biden credit for an improving economy.\nBut what also stands out in the survey is how the low voter interest and the independent candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. potentially scramble what's been a stable presidential contest with more than six months until Election Day. While Trump holds a 2-point edge over Biden in head to head , Biden leads Trump by 2 points in a five-way ballot test including Kennedy and other third-party candidates.\n'I don't think Biden has done much as a president. And if Trump gets elected, I just feel like it's going to be the same thing as it was before Biden got elected,' said poll respondent Devin Fletcher, 37, of Wayne, Michigan, a Democrat who said he's still voting for Biden.\n'I just don't feel like I have a candidate that I'm excited to vote for,' Fletcher added.\nAnother poll respondent from New Jersey, who declined to provide her name and voted for Biden in 2020, said she wouldn't be voting in November.\n'Our candidates are horrible. I have no interest in voting for Biden. He did nothing. And I absolutely will not vote for Trump,' this voter said.\nDemocratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies, said that 'Americans don't agree on much these days, but nothing unites the country more than voters' desire to tune this election out.'\nThe poll was conducted April 12-16, and it comes during yet another turbulent time in American politics, including the beginning of Trump's criminal trial in New York, as well as new attacks and heightened tensions in the Middle East.\nAccording to the poll, 64% of registered voters say they have a high level of interest in November's election — registering either a '9' or a 10' on a 10-point scale of interest.\nThat's lower than what the NBC News poll showed at this same point time in the 2008 (74%), 2012 (67%), 2016 (69%) and 2020 (77%) presidential contests.\nThe question dates back to the 2008 election cycle. The lowest-ever level of high election interest in the poll during a presidential cycle was in March 2012 — at 59%. But it quickly ticked up in the next survey.\nThis election cycle, high interest has been both low and relatively flat for months, according to the poll.\nMcInturff, the Republican pollster, says the high level of interest in the poll has 'always been a signal for the level of turnout' for a presidential contest.\n'It makes it very hard for us to predict turnout this far in advance of November, but every signal is turnout will be a lower percentage of eligible voters than in 2020,' he said.\nBy party, the current poll shows 70% of self-identified Republicans saying they have high interest in the upcoming election, versus 65% of Democrats who say this.\nIndependents are at 48%, while only 36% of voters ages 18 to 34 rate themselves as highly interested in the election.\n'They just aren't low interest,' McInturff said of young voters. 'They are off-the-charts low.'\nBiden trims Trump's lead The poll also finds Trump narrowly ahead of Biden by 2 points among registered voters in a head-to-head matchup, 46% to 44% — down from Trump's 5-point advantage in January, 47% to 42%.\nThat movement, within the poll's margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, is consistent with what other national polls have showed in the Trump-Biden race.\nTrump's biggest advantages are among men (53% to 37%), white voters (54% to 37%) and white voters without college degrees (65% to 25%).\nBiden's top advantages are among Black voters (71% to 13%), women (50% to 39%) and Latinos (49% to 39%).\nThe poll shows the two candidates are essentially tied among independents (Biden 36%, Trump 34%) and voters ages 18-34 (Biden 44%, Trump 43%). One of the big polling mysteries this cycle is whether young voters have defected from Biden (as the NBC News poll has shown over multiple surveys), or whether Democrats have maintained their advantage among this demographic.\nWhen the ballot is expanded to five named candidates, Biden takes a 2-point lead over Trump: Biden 39%, Trump 37%, independent Robert F. Kennedy 13%, Jill Stein 3% and Cornel West 2%.\nAgain, that result between Biden and Trump is within the poll's margin of error.\nNotably, the poll shows a greater share of Trump voters from the head-to-head matchup supporting Kennedy in the expanded ballot compared with Biden voters, different than the results of some other surveys.\n(Read more here on how Kennedy's candidacy impacts the 2024 race, according to the poll.)\n(Read more here on how Kennedy's candidacy impacts the 2024 race, according to the poll.) The president's approval rating ticks up to 42% Additionally, the poll shows 42% of registered voters approving of Biden's overall job performance — up 5 points since January's NBC News poll, which showed Biden at the lowest point of his presidency.\nFifty-six percent of voters say they disapprove of the job he has done, which is down 4 points from January.\nBiden's gains over the past few months have come from key parts of his 2020 base, especially among Democrats and Black voters. But he continues to hold low ratings among Latinos (40% approval), young voters (37%) and independents (36%).\nbase, especially among Democrats and Black voters. But he continues to hold low ratings among Latinos (40% approval), young voters (37%) and independents (36%). 'The data across this poll show that Joe Biden has begun to gain some ground in rebuilding his coalition from 2020,' said Horwitt, the Democratic pollster. 'The question is whether he can build upon this momentum and make inroads with the groups of voters that still are holding back support.'\nBut McInturff, the GOP pollster, points out that the only recent presidents who lost re-election had approval ratings higher than Biden's at this point in the election cycle: George H.W. Bush (43%) and Donald Trump (46%).\nwho lost re-election had approval ratings higher than Biden's at this point in the election cycle: George H.W. Bush (43%) and Donald Trump (46%). 'President Biden has a precarious hold on the presidency and is in a difficult position as it relates to his re-election,' McInturff said.\nOn the issues, 39% of voters say they approve of Biden's handling of the economy (up from 36% in January); 28% approve of his handling of border security and immigration; and just 27% approve of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war (down from 29% in January).\nVoters gave Biden his highest issue rating on addressing student-loan debt, with 44% approving of his handling of the issue, versus 51% who say they disapprove.\naddressing student-loan debt, with 44% approving of his handling of the issue, versus 51% who say they disapprove. Biden leads on abortion and unity; Trump leads on inflation and competency The NBC News poll asked voters to determine which candidate they thought is better on several different issues and attributes.\nBiden holds a 15-point advantage over Trump on dealing with the issue of abortion, and the president is ahead by 9 points on having the ability to bring the country together — though this is down from Biden's 24-point advantage on this issue in the Sept. 2020 NBC News poll.\nTrump, meanwhile, leads on having the ability to handle a crisis (by 4 points), on having a strong record of accomplishments (by 7 points), on being competent and effective (by 11 points), on having the necessary mental and physical health to be president (by 19 points) and on dealing with inflation and the cost of living (by 22 points).\nInflation, immigration are the top 2024 issues As for inflation and the cost of living, it tops the list of issues in the poll, with 23% of voters saying they're the most important issue facing the country.\nThe other top issue concerning voters is immigration and the situation at the border (22%) — followed by threats to democracy (16%), jobs and the economy (11%), abortion (6%) and health care (6%).\nimmigration and the situation at the border (22%) — followed by threats to democracy (16%), jobs and the economy (11%), abortion (6%) and health care (6%). Additionally, 63% of voters say their family's income is falling behind the cost of living — essentially unchanged from what the poll showed in 2022 and 2023.\nAnd 53% of voters say the country's economy has not improved, versus 33% who say it has improved and Biden deserves some credit for it and another 8% who agree the economy has improved but don't give the president credit for it.\n'If I look back to when I had all three of my children in the house — we only have one child left in the house now, and we're spending more now than what we did when we had a family of five,' said poll respondent Art Fales, 45, of Florida, who says he's likely voting for Trump.\nBut on a separate question — is there an issue so important that you'll vote for or against a candidate solely on that basis? — the top issue responses are protecting democracy and constitutional rights (28%), immigration and border security (20%) and abortion (19%).\nIndeed, 30% of Democrats, 29% of young voters and 27% of women say they are single-issue voters on abortion.\n'I have a right to what I do with my body,' said poll respondent Amanda Willis, 28, from Louisiana, who said she's voting for Biden. 'And I don't believe that other people should have the ability to determine that.'\nOther poll findings With Trump's first criminal trial now underway, 50% of voters say the former president is being held to the same standard as anyone else when it comes to his multiple legal challenges. That compares with 43% who believe he's being unfairly targeted in these trials.\n52% of voters have an unfavorable view of Biden, while 53% share the same view of Trump.\nAnd Democrats and Republicans are essentially tied on congressional preference, with 47% of voters preferring Republicans control Congress and 46% wanting Democrats in charge. Republicans held a 4-point lead on this question in January. The NBC News poll was conducted April 12-16 of 1,000 registered voters nationwide — 891 contacted via cell phone — and the poll has an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\nThe NBC News poll was conducted April 12-16 of 1,000 registered voters nationwide — 891 contacted via cell phone — and the poll has an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\nMark Murray Sarah Dean",

            "summary": "A neo-Nazi former U.S. marine who firebombed a Planned Parenthood clinic in California in an act of \"hateful extremism\" — and planned attacks on a LGBT event and on Jewish families — was sentenced to 9 years in federal prison on Monday.\nDistrict Judge Cormac J. Carney said that Chance Brannon, 24, \"engaged in cruel and indefensible domestic terrorism\" while stationed at Camp Pendleton,\nBrannon pleaded guilty in November last year to one count of conspiracy, one of malicious destruction of property by fire and explosives for the clinic attack in 2022, and one count of possession of an unregistered destructive device.\nBrannon, from San Juan Capistrano, was also told to pay $1,000 in restitution. He has been in federal custody since he was arrested and charged in 2023.\nMehtab Syed, acting assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office, said that law enforcement efforts prevented more acts of domestic terrorism.\n\"Mr. Brannon's deep-rooted hatred and extremist views inspired him to target individuals or groups who did not conform to his neo-Nazi worldview and, in one case, led him to carry out a violent attack which could have killed innocent people,\" he said.\nBurn marks on the exterior of the Planned Parenthood clinic in Costa Mesa, Calif., on March 13, 2022. U.S. District Court for the Central District of Calif. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division said the Molotov cocktail attack on the Planned Parenthood clinic in Costa Mesa was part of a \"hate-fueled agenda\" and \"was designed to terrorize patients seeking reproductive healthcare and the people who provide it.\"\nBrannon and two co-defendants — Tibet Ergul, 22, and Xavier Batten, 21, — conspired to use a Molotov cocktail to destroy a commercial property, The United States Attorney's Office said in a statement.\n\"Brannon considered various targets, including the Anti-Defamation League office in San Diego, but ultimately chose to target a Planned Parenthood clinic in Costa Mesa to scare pregnant women, deter doctors and staff from providing abortion services, and encourage similar violent acts,\" the statement said.\nIn the Planned Parenthood attack in March 2022, the clinic's entrance was set alight by Brannon and Ergul, but no one was hurt. The pair returned hours later to review their work, the attorney's office said. Around 30 appointments at the clinic had to be rescheduled.\nIn a sentencing memorandum, the government said Brannon praised Adolf Hitler and told fellow Marines that \"all Jews deserve to die. He \"took matters into his own hands, weaponizing fear and intimidation to achieve his political ends,\" it said.\nThen in June 2022, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe. Vs Wade, ending 50 years of constitutional access to abortion services, the court heard that Brannon and Ergul planned a second attack on a Planned Parenthood clinic — which was abandoned due to increased police presence at abortion centers.\nThe pair also \"discussed starting a race war by attacking an electrical substation\" and taking out the power grid of Orange County, the attorney's office said. \"Can we just be done with elections and have the race war already,\" he texted a friend, the sentencing memorandum said.\nA file containing a plan for this and list of gear required was kept on a thumb drive disguised as a military-style necklace, the statement said.\nOn that gear list was a rifle with \"Total [N-word] Death\" written in Cyrillic and a recording of the 2019 mosque shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, in which a white supremacist terrorist murdered 51 people and injured dozens more. The Christchurch attack has since provided inspiration for multiple white nationalist terror plots.\nIn summer 2023, Brannon and Ergul also discussed attacking Dodger Stadium in LA on the night it celebrated LGBTQ pride — they were arrested two days before the event.\nAlso before his arrest, Brannon was planning to rob Jewish households in Hollywood Hills, actions that prosecutors said \"would at worst harm or even kill real victims.\" At the time of his arrest, Brannon possessed a short-barreled rifle and two silencers, which he had not registered with the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.\nBattan and Ergul separately pleaded guilty to their charges earlier this year and will have their own sentencing hearings on May 13 and May 30 respectively.\nPatrick Smith",

            "excerpt": "The president's re-election campaign, meanwhile, was sending out some thinly veiled jabs about the former president's legal woes.",
            "summary": "As he kicked off a series of events in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania on Tuesday, President Joe Biden freely ripped into his nemesis.\nFrom his hometown, Scranton, Biden chided Donald Trump about his past tax plan for giving tax breaks to billionaires and his comments about Social Security. He joked about Trump's personal financial predicament. He accused Trump of ballooning the federal debt, razzed him for suggesting that injecting bleach could battle Covid-19 and called him ' Donald Herbert Hoover Trump.'\n'Donald Herbert Hoover Trump.' What Biden didn't do is touch the lowest-hanging fruit of all — the fact that at the same time, Trump was sitting in a New York City courtroom, the first president or former president in history to stand criminal trial.\nAs eventful as the trial commencement has been and as salacious as the details of Trump's case are — involving paying off a porn star to evade political reprisal — Biden didn't budge from his longtime practice of steering clear of any specific talk about Trump's legal predicaments. Though he has nibbled around the edges from time to time, Biden doesn't delve into the indictments Trump faces even, it seems, when a criminal trial is actually underway.\nAt the same time, Biden's campaign was having a field day with memes coming out of the trial, ribbing Trump for possibly having nodded off in court. It also put out a news release this week titled: 'After Stormy Abortion Ban Coverage, Trump Poll Memo Attempts to Hush Panic.'\nIt tried to capture the onslaught of rough media Trump faced after last week's Arizona Supreme Court decision that cleared the way for a near-total ban on abortion in the state, while playing off of porn star Stormy Daniels and 'hush money,' the oft-repeated shorthand for the charges he faces.\nThe campaign seemed to relish poking fun at Trump, calling him 'Sleepy Don,' turning the tables on his onetime nickname for Biden, 'Sleepy Joe.' But beyond that, the campaign, like Biden, evaded actual commentary on the charges themselves. The White House did the same. Asked whether Biden was being briefed or was watching Trump's courtroom happenings, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre shifted and laid out Biden's itinerary in Pennsylvania.\n'The president is going to Pennsylvania today, and he's going to do a three-stop tour,' she said before the event. 'He's going to focus on how he's continuing to help the American people.'\nThere is an inherent danger for Biden in getting too close to the criticism of Trump's indictments. Trump has repeatedly told his supporters that the array of court charges he faces is akin to election interference and accused Biden of persecuting him. Celebrating criminal charges against Trump could play into that narrative.\nA Biden campaign official said the recent references to Daniels were a creative way to get out a broader message about abortion. As for picking at Trump for falling asleep, the official said that's consistent with the campaign's highlighting Trump's gaffes and that, in this case, it was too good to pass up.\n'It's smart of the president to continue doing what he's doing, which is talk about his positive vision for the American people,' said Brandon Weathersby, a spokesman for American Bridge 21st Century, the key opposition research group for Biden.\nHis group, in the meantime, is rapidly responding to the trial, highlighting 'chaos' surrounding Trump.\n'With Donald Trump being in court just the last few days, we've seen a lot of chaos. He's intimidating jurors. He's getting reprimanded by the judge. He's going on rants on social media,\" Weathersby said, pointing to the split screen with Biden, who was out campaigning and laying out his platform. 'Right now he's doing the job. He looks like a president.'\nOn Tuesday, against a backdrop that read 'Tax Fairness for All Americans' Biden, 24 hours after Tax Day, laid out a tax plan he said would benefit the middle class and working-class people. It would expand the child tax credit, he said, and add a minimum tax for billionaires. At the same time, he vowed he wouldn't raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year.\nBut he was far from sparing about Trump, seeming to take joy in a string of snarky comments.\nHe bashed Trump, saying he cut taxes only for the wealthy.\n'I have to say if Trump's stock in Truth Social, his company, drops any lower, he might do better under my tax plan than his,' Biden joked to the Scranton crowd.\nHe had the supporters clapping and laughing at another point when he told a story about being confronted by someone who complained about not feeling the benefits of the economy. He was, however, setting up a joke at Trump's expense.\n'Just the other day a defeated-looking guy came up to me and asked if I could help. He was drowning in debt,' Biden said. Then he delivered the punchline: 'I said, ‘I'm sorry, Donald, but I can't help you.''\nIt was a line Biden had used in private events but hadn't said publicly before.\nBiden is to spend the next two days traversing Pennsylvania in a series of events, including in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.\nNatasha Korecki",

In trial's first week, Trump tried to control the narrative Jabin Botsford / Pool via Getty Images The rest of the 12 jurors — and one alternate — in Donald Trump's hush money trial were seated yesterday, but not without some hiccups along the way.

Today, the search continues for five more alternate jurors. And then the first week of the former president's criminal trial will come to a close. Looking back, the ways Trump tried to control the narrative are clear. On Monday, Trump stood in front of reporters ready to unleash a grievance-laced tirade that, at times, did not totally reflect reality. He fixated on Judge Juan Merchan's decision to not yet rule on whether Trump can attend his son Barron's high school graduation next month. The key words to keep in mind are 'not yet.'\nBut Trump painted a picture for his supporters of a biased judge blocking a loving father from seeing his son's graduation. The disdain toward Merchan from Trump's supporters was swift.\nThen there were arguments about whether Trump fell asleep at one point and about jury selection rules. Those sorts of distortions and fights about nearly every aspect of the trial dominated the first week — and earned him $1.6 million in small-dollar donations.

Ilhan Omar's daughter, pictured above — were arrested yesterday at a pro-Palestinian protest at New York's Columbia University after school officials voiced concerns about demonstrators violating campus policies. The protests grew throughout the afternoon and eventually, more than 500 students entered the quad area, according to NYPD Commissioner Edward Cuban. The students who were arrested did not resist and said what they wanted to say 'in a peaceful manner,' Cuban said.\nThe demonstration came a day after Columbia President Nemat 'Minouche' Shafik attended a congressional hearing about antisemitism and faced questioning by Rep.

Inside a convention for a far-right sheriffs movement Conspiracy theorists, felons and election deniers flocked to a Las Vegas hotel. They were there to attend a far-right sheriffs convention, where discussions centered around their belief in encroaching federal power and rampant voter fraud, despite a lack of evidence. The event by the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, or CSPOA, included a lackluster Pledge of Allegiance, a smooth jazz rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" disgruntled former politicians and a pizza party. Only a few actual sheriffs attended.\nMark Abramson for NBC News CSPOA, which sees sheriffs as more powerful than the federal government, used the event to set a course for the coming election. The conference's low attendance indicates just how fringe the group's ideas are, but critics fear the organization's focus on U.S. elections will nonetheless legitimize disinformation.\nSenior reporter Brandy Zadrozny was at the annual meeting, where she listened to speakers (and their conspiracy theories) and talked to a few attendees.

Lumen claims a third-party company caused the outage while installing a light pole.\nHowever, experts say a single pole should not be able to disable 911 in multiple states.

Staff Pick: A regional reproductive care void on both sides of the border A growing number of American women are seeking abortion care in Mexico, and they're navigating a medley of laws that, like the U.S., vary according to Mexico's different states. My colleague Albinson Linares and I dug into some of these laws . What we found is that most Mexican border states ban elective abortions, despite a Supreme Court ruling last year that decriminalized the procedure nationwide. Add Arizona's recent ruling on an 1864 law that will ban most abortions in the state, and women on both sides of the border could soon find themselves in a remote and politicized region with little reproductive care. — Isabela Espadas Barros Leal, associate editor\ndug into some of these laws.

            "summary": "The ad war is heating up in the Arizona Senate race, with both sides launching digital attacks this week foreshadowing the battleground campaign to come.\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee launched an attack ad on Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego Thursday, after Gallego hit the Republican frontrunner, Kari Lake, with his own ad earlier this week. And it's just the appetizer in a campaign expected to run up one of the costliest tabs of any Senate contest across the country.\nNeither campaign or party is running attacks on TV right now. But the early themes previewed in digital ads, which can be released with much less expense, are likely to show up throughout the campaign.\nGallego's online jab slammed Lake for flip-flopping her stance on the state's 1864 abortion ban, rolling back tape showing the former TV anchor praising the law in 2022 during her unsuccessful bid for Arizona's governorship.\n'We have a great law on the books right now,' Lake said in the clip featured in Gallego's digital advertisement. 'I believe it's ARS 13-3603,' Lake goes on, leaving little doubt about which law she was referencing.\nThe NRSC's attack gets personal. 'Ruben Gallego walked out on his family, abandoning his newborn son, leaving his wife, and then marrying a D.C. lobbyist,' a female narrator says, calling him 'deadbeat dad Ruben Gallego.'\nGallego split from his then-wife, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, in 2016. The mayor has since endorsed the congressman in his bid for retiring independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema's seat.\nThe NRSC said its new ad will run across digital platforms and target female voters. 'Arizona women can't trust a man who divorced his wife when she was weeks away from having their child,' NRSC spokesperson Tate Mitchell said in a statement.\nWhile the online ad spending is dipping into negative territory, Gallego is already spending millions of dollars on positive statewide TV ads, introducing himself to voters as a Marine veteran who was raised by a single mother and voted in Congress to lower drug prices.\nGallego has spent nearly $3.8 million on TV ads so far this year, according to AdImpact, while Lake has spent about $30,000.\nGallego's not just outspending Lake — he's outraising her too. His campaign raised $7.5 million in the first quarter of 2024, while Lake's raised $3.6 million, according to recent Federal Election Commission filings. Gallego spent $4.4 million and ended the quarter with about $9.6 million in the bank, while Lake spent $2.2 million and ended the quarter with $2.5 million on hand.\nDuring a rally in Lake Havasu City over the weekend, Lake noted these spring splurges are just the beginning.\n'This is going to be an expensive race — $250 million is going to be spent in the U.S. Senate race in Arizona,' Lake predicted to the crowd.\nShe added, 'You guys are gonna get so sick of the TV ads, you're gonna want to, like, throw your TV off the balcony.'\nAlex Tabet",

More than half raised their hands and were excused from serving on the jury.\nThe jury selection process got off to a slow start because lawyers from both sides spent much of the day arguing over some of the more sensational evidence in the case. Prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office want to use material — including the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, headlines from the National Enquirer from the 2016 GOP presidential primary and the timing of Trump's alleged affair with another woman — to show why Trump was eager to bury negative stories about him during the 2016 presidential election.\nMerchan said prosecutors could use a transcript of the 'Access Hollywood' tape but not the tape itself. He also greenlit the request to show jurors Enquirer headlines and said he would allow testimony about the alleged affair.\nTrump, who spent much of the day seated at the defense table flanked by his attorneys, called the case 'an assault' on the nation and repeatedly attacked the prosecution for waging 'election interference.'

NBC News found that at least 150 paid 'Premium' subscriber X accounts and thousands of unpaid accounts have posted or amplified pro-Nazi content on X in recent months, often in apparent violation of X's rules.

            "excerpt": "The agenda is heavy on economics and lighter on cultural issues, carrying echoes of FDR's New Deal. It omits some issues that lack Democratic consensus, like \"Medicare for All.\"",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Top House progressives will unveil a sweeping agenda Thursday to lay down a marker for the policies they'll push next year if Democrats win the 2024 election, from a higher minimum wage and strengthening antitrust laws to new federal benefits for seniors on Social Security and parents raising kids.\nThe Congressional Progressive Caucus agenda, first shared with NBC News, doubles as a blueprint of political advice for how it believes President Joe Biden can win over progressives and young voters who are uninspired by his re-election bid ahead of a rematch with former President Donald Trump.\n'If the progressive base is not excited and enthusiastic — and if they don't feel like we are trying to earn their votes and that they are important — then I think the horrific idea of a second Donald Trump presidency could become reality,' Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the progressive caucus chair, said in an interview. 'We cannot afford to let that happen. And we won't.'\nThe seven-point agenda is heavily focused on economics and lighter on cultural issues, carrying echoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. It begins with provisions to boost the federal minimum wage to $17 per hour by 2028 and pass the PRO Act to strengthen unions, as well as other provisions, such as guaranteeing overtime pay. It includes policies to reduce the cost of living — by capping child care costs at 7% of income for all families; expanding Social Security benefits by closing tax loopholes; adding dental, vision and hearing benefits to Medicare; and enacting a series of policies to protect renters and make housing more affordable.\n2028 and pass the PRO Act to strengthen unions, as well as other provisions, such as guaranteeing overtime pay. It includes policies to reduce the cost of living — by capping child care costs at 7% of income for all families; expanding Social Security benefits by closing tax loopholes; adding dental, vision and hearing benefits to Medicare; and enacting a series of policies to protect renters and make housing more affordable. 'It's really about worker power and raising wages and lowering costs for poor people, middle-class Americans and the working people across this country,' Jayapal said.\nThe five other planks are investments in education, including universal pre-K and kindergarten; aggressive clean energy standards to tackle climate change; 'making our democracy work' with federal voting rights mandates, Washington, D.C., statehood and elimination of the Senate filibuster; taking on corporations and monopolies; and 'advancing justice' though abortion rights, pro-LGBTQ measures, pro-immigrant policies and setting national policing standards.\nThe agenda is also notable for what's not included. 'Medicare for All,' a rallying cry of the left for years, is excluded. Foreign policy issues like Israel and Gaza, which have sparked fiery pro-Palestinian protests across the country, are also kept out. Jayapal said that's partly because the caucus decided to make it a domestic-issue-only blueprint and partly out of pragmatism — to focus more on unifying issues for Democrats and steer clear of the ones that divide them.\n'The way we came to this agenda is to say that we were going to put into this agenda things that were populist and possible ... and affected a huge number of people,' she said. 'We haven't taken a position on particularly Israel and Gaza in the progressive caucus, and so that's not on here.'\nA supermajority of the 103 lawmakers in the caucus weighed in on the agenda, and 98% supported it, a spokesperson said.\nMuch of the agenda will have no realistic chance of passage unless Democrats sweep control of the White House, the House and the Senate this fall. And Jayapal emphasized that, in addition, Democrats would need 50 senators ready to pierce the 60-vote filibuster rule to get around likely GOP opposition. That would be a herculean task, as Democrats face a daunting map in 2024 Senate races, defending a slew of seats in purple and red states.\n'We are assuming that this is an agenda for a Democratic president with a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House,' Jayapal said.\nProgressives have had a rough two years, having been marginalized after Republicans took control of the House and steered the agenda rightward. Biden has broken with the left on issues like tougher asylum laws and crime. Some prominent Democrats, like Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, have eschewed the 'progressive' label as conservatives have found success in associating it with the left's most divisive ideas. Gallego, who is running for the Senate in his purple state, quietly left the progressive caucus. The caucus recently missed an opportunity to elect one of its members to a rare open Senate seat in deep-blue California, with two of them running and losing.\nStill, Jayapal said she believes that if Democrats win the 2024 elections, the progressive caucus will be well-positioned to advance the ideas in its new agenda, as it did with it opening bid that shaped two of Biden's signature laws, the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act. She has sought to institute changes to make the caucus more cohesive. It recently raised its dues for members.\nSome of the provisions in the new agenda represent items in Biden's 'Build Back Better' agenda that were left on the cutting room floor because of the thin majorities. Others could spark intraparty disagreements, including a far-reaching liberalization of the immigration system with a path to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally. Yet other pieces resemble popular causes that progressives want Biden to get behind, like expanding Social Security and legalizing marijuana.\n'We have to excite our base. We have to show them what the path forward is — not just say, ‘This is the most important election of your life, and we expect you to vote.' I don't think that's going to turn people out. And so I think this agenda, really, speaks to the needs of poor people, working people, progressives across the country who want us to make that case to them,' Jayapal said. 'We are not seeing the momentum that we would like to see. We're going to have a tough election. ... We know we're going to have to put together that progressive coalition. And I think this is the thing that allows us to say, ‘Look, here's what we're fighting for.''\nSahil Kapur",

'European skies could have received the same level of protection long ago if Ukraine had received full support from its partners in intercepting drones and missiles,' he said. 'We can now see how unity can work.'\nMost galling, perhaps, is that Russia has been deploying the very same drones as Iran in its assault on Ukrainian cities. And this apparent double standard comes at a particularly perilous moment, as Ukrainian officials sound the alarm that it will be unable to hold off Russian forces from advancing without new military support. The most apparent example of how a lack of Western air defenses is affecting Ukraine is in its second-largest city, Kharkiv, where Russian missiles and drones destroyed a heat and power plant last week.\nBut the U.S. and its Western partners have made clear their reluctance to go as far in Ukraine as they did in the Middle East.\nRead the full story here.\nRead the full story here.

First jurors in Trump hush money trial are chosen The first seven jurors in Donald Trump's hush money trial have been chosen, a process that got off to a bumpy start yesterday as New Yorkers were pressed about whether they could fairly judge the former president. The selected jurors include a former waiter, an oncology nurse, an attorney, an IT consultant, a teacher and a software engineer. Their names won't be used in open court. They were told to return Monday, signaling that the selection process will be finished by the end of the week. The court still needs to select five more jurors and likely six alternates.\nTrump's lawyers excavated ancient social media posts, asked jurors to explain inconsistent answers on their questionnaires and tried to strike from the pool of candidates they feared could spell danger for their case. At one point, Judge Juan Merchan read unflattering memes about Trump after apologizing in case it caused offense. Merchan also delivered a stern warning to Trump lawyer Todd Blanche after Blanche and Trump were 'audibly' speaking in the direction of a juror.

Mayorkas impeachment trial could be a swift ordeal Republicans are hoping to drag out the impeachment trial of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, but they might not get that what they wish for. This afternoon, an impeachment trial will kick off with all 100 senators getting sworn in as jurors. Then, Senate Democrats, led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, are expected to quickly move to dismiss or table the two impeachment articles against Mayorkas and move on to other business. A conviction against Mayorkas is likely impossible because none of the Senate's 51 Democrats have said they support his impeachment.\nMayorkas is charged with 'high crimes and misdemeanors' for failing to enforce immigration and border security laws and for knowingly lying under oath in Congress. The trial comes a day after the House of Representatives sent its articles of impeachment to the Senate in a solemn procession that included escorting the pair of impeachment articles across the Rotunda and onto the Senate floor.

Autopsy for ‘Unabomber' Ted Kaczynski details cancer, depression before death John Youngbear / AP file An autopsy report for Ted Kaczynski, the domestic terrorist known as the 'Unabomber,' shows that he was diagnosed with rectal cancer and 'was noted to be depressed' before his death last year at the age of 81. The report, obtained 10 months after his death by suicide, offers new details into Kaczysnki's health and final months and raises questions about whether his death was preventable.\nKaczynski was diagnosed with rectal cancer in March 2021, and he received biweekly chemotherapy until March 2023, medical examiners said. About a month before Kaczynski's death, an oncologist noted that he 'appeared depressed.' On June 10, 2023, Kaczynski attempted suicide, and later died at a hospital.\nWhether Kaczynski's depression resulted in a suicide watch is unclear. But given Kaczynski's status within the federal prison system, one expert says 'it's somewhat surprising' he was able to end his life. Read the exclusive story here.\nRead the exclusive story here. Boeing whistleblower doubles down ahead of Senate hearing A Boeing whistleblower is expected to testify before a U.S. Senate subcommittee today about his concerns with the company's 787 Dreamliner, which he said is unsafe to fly and could 'drop to the ground' midflight unless problems are addressed. Sam Salehpour, a former quality engineer for Boeing, first raised his allegations publicly last week. He said the company has yet to properly address tiny nonconforming gaps found in multiple planes after two sections of their fuselages were joined together during assembly. The \"safety issues,\" he said, could lead to catastrophic outcomes.\nSalehpour doubled down on those claims yesterday in an interview with 'NBC Nightly News.' When asked if he would put his own family on a 787 right now, Salehpour didn't hesitate. 'Right now, I would not,' he said. Watch the full interview here.\nWatch the full interview here.

            "summary": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Former U.S. Sen. and two-term Florida Gov. Bob Graham, who gained national prominence as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks and as an early critic of the Iraq war, has died. He was 87.\nGraham's family announced the death Tuesday in a statement posted on X by his daughter Gwen Graham.\n'We are deeply saddened to report the passing of a visionary leader, dedicated public servant, and even more importantly, a loving husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather,' the family said.\nGraham, who served three terms in the Senate, made an unsuccessful bid for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, emphasizing his opposition to the Iraq invasion.\nBut his bid was delayed by heart surgery in January 2003, and he was never able to gain enough traction with voters to catch up, bowing out that October. He didn't seek reelection in 2004 and was replaced by Republican Mel Martinez.\nGraham was a man of many quirks. He perfected the 'workdays' political gimmick of spending a day doing various jobs from horse stall mucker to FBI agent and kept a meticulous diary, noting almost everyone he spoke with, everything he ate, the TV shows he watched and even his golf scores.\nGraham said the notebooks were a working tool for him and he was reluctant to describe his emotions or personal feelings in them.\n'I review them for calls to be made, memos to be dictated, meetings I want to follow up on and things people promise to do,' he said.\nGraham was among the earliest opponents of the Iraq war, saying it diverted America's focus on the battle against terrorism centered in Afghanistan. He was also critical of President George W. Bush for failing to have an occupation plan in Iraq after the U.S. military threw out Saddam Hussein in 2003.\nGraham said Bush took the United States into the war by exaggerating claims of the danger presented by the Iraqi weapons of destruction that were never found. He said Bush distorted intelligence data and argued it was more serious than the sexual misconduct issues that led the House to impeach President Bill Clinton in the late 1990s. It led him to launch his short, abortive presidential bid.\n'The quagmire in Iraq is a distraction that the Bush administration, and the Bush administration alone, has created,' Graham said in 2003.\nDuring his 18 years in Washington, Graham worked well with colleagues from both parties, particularly Florida Republican Connie Mack during their dozen years together in the Senate.\nAs a politician, few were better. Florida voters hardly considered him the wealthy Harvard-educated attorney that he was.\nGraham's political career spanned five decades, beginning with his election to the Florida House of Representatives in 1966.\nHe won a state Senate seat in 1970 and then was elected governor in 1978. He was re-elected in 1982. Four years later, he won the first of three terms in the U.S. Senate when he ousted incumbent Republican Paula Hawkins.\nGraham remained widely popular with Florida voters — winning reelection by wide margins in 1992 and 1998 when he carried 63 of 67 counties. In that latter election, he defeated Charlie Crist, who later served as a Republican governor from 2007 to 2011.\n'He blew me out of the water, and I came to know even more so why during the course of the campaign,' Crist said Tuesday night. 'I learned to respect him even more than I already had, and love him for the good, decent man that he was.'\nCrist, who has since switched parties and most recently served as a U.S. representative, said Graham was an influence on him.\n'I always felt that when he was governor, that he was trying to govern for the people of Florida — not in any way political or partisan — and I took that to heart and tried to, in some small way, emulate it,' Crist said.\nHouse Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi called Graham 'a patriotic American' and thanked him for his 'distinguished public service.' She highlighted his work on the inquiry into 9/11 and said he 'bravely opposed entry into the war in Iraq.'\n'He brought his love for his family and for his state of Florida to the Senate, where he served with immense dignity and courage,' she said in a statement Tuesday.\nEven when in Washington, Graham never took his eye off the state and the leadership in Tallahassee.\nWhen Gov. Jeb Bush and the Republican-controlled Legislature eliminated the Board of Regents in 2001, Graham saw it as a move to politicize the state university system. He led a successful petition drive the next year for a state constitutional amendment that created the Board of Governors to assume the regents' role.\nDaniel Robert Graham was born Nov. 9, 1936, in Coral Gables, where his father, Ernest 'Cap' Graham, had moved from South Dakota and established a large dairy operation. Young Bob milked cows, built fences and scooped manure as a teenager. One of his half-brothers, Phillip Graham, was publisher of The Washington Post and Newsweek until he took his own life in 1963, just a year after Bob Graham's graduation from Harvard Law.\nGraham was president of the student body at Miami Senior High School and attended the University of Florida, graduating in 1959.\nIn 1966 he was elected to the Florida Legislature, where he focused largely on education and health care issues.\nGraham got off to a shaky start as Florida's chief executive, and was dubbed 'Gov. Jello' for some early indecisiveness. He shook that label through his handling of several serious crises.\nAs governor he also signed numerous death warrants, founded the Save the Manatee Club with entertainer Jimmy Buffett and led efforts to establish several environmental programs.\nGraham pushed through a bond program to buy beaches and barrier islands threatened by development and started the Save Our Everglades program to protect the state's water supply, wetlands and endangered species.\nGraham also was known for his 408 'workdays,' including stints as a housewife, boxing ring announcer, flight attendant and arson investigator. They grew out of a teaching stint as a member of the Florida Senate's Education Committee and then morphed into a campaign gimmick that helped him relate to the average voter.\n'This has been a very important part of my development as a public official, my learning at a very human level what the people of Florida expect, what they want, what their aspirations are and then trying to interpret that and make it policy that will improve their lives' said Graham in 2004 as he completed his final job as a Christmas gift wrapper.\nAfter leaving public life in 2005, Graham spent much of his time at a public policy center named after him at the University of Florida and pushing the Legislature to require more civics classes in the state's public schools.\nGraham was one of five members selected for an independent commission by President Barack Obama in June 2010 to investigate a massive BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that threatened sea life and beaches along several southeastern Gulf states.",

            "summary": "PITTSBURGH — In the heart of one of America's most prominent historically Jewish neighborhoods, Dan and Baila Cohen keep the front entrance of their 70-year-old Judaica store locked during business hours.\nIt's not how they'd prefer it. But in light of Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack in Israel, Israel's ongoing military campaign in Gaza and tensions at home, they said, the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh told them they needed to be vigilant about who enters their business.\n'That's the reality of the world,' Dan Cohen said.\nIt's not the first time they've had to take additional safety precautions. The couple completed their purchase of Pinsker's Books and Judaica in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood in 2018 just days after a white supremacist gunned down 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue a few blocks away in the deadliest antisemitic attack in American history. But this time feels different.\n'Oct. 27 really unified' Squirrel Hill and Pittsburgh, Baila Cohen said of the Tree of Life massacre. 'Oct. 7 … really started polarizing the community itself, because that's when we started seeing much more of the infighting and conflicts.'\nConversations with more than 30 political strategists, activists and voters outlined how that tension has put Jewish voters in an unfamiliar spot ahead of the 2024 elections: on the front lines of the fight for control of the White House and Congress. Nowhere is that more apparent than in Pennsylvania, the swing state with the largest Jewish population — about 300,000 voting-age Jews in a state President Joe Biden won by roughly 80,000 votes in 2020.\nWhat's more, the congressional district that includes Squirrel Hill features a primary Tuesday that is among the first electoral tests of sentiment on both sides of the conflict in Gaza and concerns over rising antisemitism in the U.S. Democratic Rep. Summer Lee, a 'squad'-aligned progressive critical of Israel's handling of the war and one of the first lawmakers to call for a cease-fire last year, will face Bhavini Patel, an Edgewood Borough Council member who has painted Lee's advocacy as harmful to Biden's re-election chances and out of step with her district.\n'We have communities that are hurting. The Jewish community is one of them. And there are people who are … not going to agree 100% on everything that you say,' Lee said in an interview, adding she has been 'very clear and very upfront' about her cease-fire position. 'I have condemned Hamas. We've worked with the families of hostages; we've done everything that I think is necessary to do that. And at the end of the day, we disagree.'\nA dozen Jewish voters in the district who spoke to NBC News, whether supporting Lee or Patel, almost universally said their votes in November would be driven by issues beyond Israel, saying that the Jewish electorate isn't a 'monolith' and that democracy, abortion rights and the economy weighed heavily on them.\nMost Jewish voters in Squirrel Hill — and nationally — align with the Democratic Party. A Pew Research Center survey released this month found 69% of Jews leaning Democratic, while 29% aligned Republican.\nBut Republicans aren't looking for a massive defection. GOP strategists and Republicans involved in Jewish outreach expressed confidence that Democratic divisions over Israel will help move a small but potentially significant number of Jewish voters into their camp in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona. They pointed to surveys showing President Donald Trump's improved performance among Jews in 2020, compared with his 2016 race, as evidence of a slow shift that could continue.\n'Before Oct. 7, most candidates would say this issue is so messy. … It's not necessarily something that I want to focus on in my campaign,' said Tali deGroot, political director for the liberal Jewish group J Street. 'And I would have said, ‘Absolutely, this isn't a voting issue for people we poll year after year.' And it's too soon to tell if it's going to be a voting issue. But not talking about it is not an option.'‘Playing with fire' In Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, the war and its impact at home took center stage last week at a campaign event where Lee launched her 'Jews for Summer' coalition.\nLee talked about 'how our liberation is tied together,' whether 'in western Pennsylvania or the West Bank.' She spoke about how the district still needs 'deep healing' following both the Oct. 7 attack and the killing of Jews at Tree of Life. And she framed her primary as a covert Republican effort to divide a multiethnic, cross-religious support base by using splits over Israel.\n'There are people who have to convince you that the only reason why I could believe in peace is because I actually hate some of our neighbors, not because we love each other,' said Lee, who overcame significant spending by groups aligned with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group, when she narrowly won her first congressional primary in 2022.\nIsrael didn't have the salience it does now. Lee has accused the Israeli government of committing 'war crimes,\" called for an end to unconditional military aid to the country and joined a handful of other progressives in mid-2022, before the Israel-Hamas war, who voted against a GOP-led resolution that said Israel wasn't 'a racist or apartheid state.' She has also condemned Hamas' attack and repeatedly spoken out against antisemitism.\nOn Saturday, she joined 36 Democrats and 21 Republicans in voting against an aid package to the country, which passed overwhelmingly. She and Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., were the only Pennsylvania members to vote against it.\nHer early call for a cease-fire is now largely in step with Democratic voters, but Jewish leaders have expressed unease with how Lee and some of her allies have discussed the issue. Last month, more than 40 Pittsburgh-area rabbis wrote in a letter, after an earlier meeting with Lee, that she has 'continued to use divisive rhetoric' that the group has at times 'perceived as openly antisemitic.'\nTheir letter didn't describe that rhetoric, but it said Lee opposed House measures to condemn antisemitism and criticized her calls for an 'unconditional cease-fire from one side,' which they said 'devalues the lives and beliefs of one group.' They also called on her to return campaign contributions 'from people who have voiced virulently antisemitic sentiments.' In February, Lee canceled an appearance before the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations amid backlash over other speakers' antisemitic and homophobic remarks, which she condemned.\nKaren Hochenberg, president of a local Democratic club that has endorsed Patel, said Lee has lost considerable support in the Jewish community, including hers. While Hochenberg aligns with Lee on many issues, she and others have been 'hurt' by some of her votes and actions, and she said she wished Lee had been more vocal about the Hamas attack.\n'Many Jews now are starting to question where are we on the road map of intersectionality,' Hochenberg said. 'Jews are starting to really take a look at how comfortable we are and if we're going to send candidates to Congress who's going to be there and have the voice of the Jewish community in mind, as well.'\nJeremy Kazzaz, a Pittsburgher leading a new Jewish voter group, said the pushback Lee faces isn't so much about Israel but about what he called an unwillingness to meet with constituents who don't share her views.\n'She finds the individuals who agree with her already who are anti-Zionist, who are extremist or fringe of the left of politics, and she will hold them up on a pedestal while spreading things' that, Kazzaz said, make local Jews 'less safe.'\nBut overall, Lee is looking stronger in her district now than in her first run, even to some opponents. AIPAC-linked groups aren't getting involved in her primary this time. Lee has framed her campaign around efforts to counter MAGA Republicans and bring federal dollars to the district.\nJonathan Mayo, a Squirrel Hill resident co-leading the Jews for Summer coalition, told NBC News he aligns with Lee's position on Israel but emphasized that he's not a single-issue voter.\n'It is so important to speak out and show that there are members of the Squirrel Hill Jewish community who still very much support Summer Lee,' he said.\nPatel, meanwhile, is framing her challenge to Lee around who offers Biden the most support, hitting Lee for not criticizing activists and groups calling for 'uncommitted' votes against the president in Tuesday's primary.\n'It's essentially playing with fire,' Patel said in an interview, arguing it could boost Trump.\nLee allies have countered that anti-Biden GOP megadonors support Patel's campaign. An outside group boosting Patel recently disclosed that it received an $800,000 donation from right-wing billionaire Jeffrey Yass. (Patel said she 'denounces' Yass, calling any focus on him a distraction.)\nLee has said she is supporting Biden in the fall. She's endorsed by congressional Democratic leadership and by Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who has become arguably the most staunchly pro-Israel Democrat in Congress. And in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, Biden shouted out Lee as someone 'who had my back.'\n'We're going to make sure that the person who's sitting in the White House is not going to be replaced,' Lee said at her event on a recent Sunday.\nSeveral attendees said they were casting anti-Biden protest votes Tuesday. But most said they would support him this fall.\nOne of them, Harry Hochheiser, said Biden 'is the only legitimate choice' against Trump. He said the divisions opened up in the Jewish community over the war have been devastating.\n'I don't think any of us enjoy these divisions,' Hochheiser, a University of Pittsburgh professor and pro-Palestinian activist voting uncommitted in the primary but backing Biden against Trump, said of tensions in the Jewish community over Israel.\n‘More salient than it has been' The fight for Jewish votes in Pittsburgh is only part of a bigger landscape. Across Pennsylvania, Republican Dave McCormick has put Israel at the forefront of his campaign against Democratic Sen. Bob Casey. Nationally, groups in both parties are preparing for what they say could be the largest investment ever made to court the Jewish vote at the presidential level.\nBiden's handling of the war is the main flashpoint. Initially, he was more deferential to Israel. But as the death toll mounted in Gaza and left-wing blowback intensified at home, he has sharpened his criticism of Israeli leadership, pushed for increased humanitarian aid and ramped-up efforts to reach a cease-fire agreement. Still, he hasn't gone as far as his critics to his left would like.\nAs for whether Republicans can pick up voters disaffected by the Democratic divide over Israel, Mark Mellman, president of Democratic Majority for Israel, said it's 'mostly noise' but cautioned 'there is a serious chance' depending how the coming months play out.\nJewish voters have 'been extraordinarily appreciative of the support that President Biden and Democratic leaders have given Israel over the course of this conflict,' he said. 'I hear from some people that is beginning to change as people perceive some change in the positions of those Democratic leaders. But look … Biden has been extraordinary.'\nA 2021 Pew Research Center survey found a wide split in partisanship among Jewish voters depending on which movement they aligned with. Orthodox Jews favored Republicans over Democrats by 75% to 20%, while 70% of Conservative Jews and 80% of Reform Jews backed Democrats.\nSam Markstein, national political director at the Republican Jewish Coalition, said much of the Jewish vote is based in states where Republicans have no shot at all, contributing to the gulf in support between Republicans and Democrats. Pointing to an Associated Press VoteCast survey after the 2020 election that found Trump improved on his 2016 performance among Jewish voters, Markstein predicts the Republican Jewish Coalition will make its 'largest investment at the top of the ticket ever' this cycle to target Jewish voters in battlegrounds.\n'That's where you're going to see the most success this year,' he said.\nSome other surveys had more positive trends for Democrats. This month's Pew survey found the share of Jewish voters who align with Democrats has increased 8 points since 2020.\nDan Siegel, who led Jewish outreach for Biden's 2020 campaign, said Jewish voters' foremost concerns are similar to those of any other voting group: the economy, health care and education.\n'I do think [Israel] may be a little bit more top of mind. But I also think at the end of the day, elections are a binary choice,' Siegel said, predicting Jewish voters 'are going to want that strong, steady hand, not an authoritarian demagogue who is unwieldy at best in a crisis.'\nTrump, who strongly favored Israel as president, has offered limited commentary on the war. Speaking last month with Israel Hayom, an Israeli newspaper, Trump said, 'You have to finish up your war. You have to get it done. We have to get to peace. We can't have this going on.'\nBiden's campaign has zoomed in on recent comments Trump has made about Jewish voters; he said on Real America's Voice that 'any Jewish person who votes for Biden does not love Israel and, frankly, should be spoken to.'\nIn a statement, Karoline Leavitt, Trump's national press secretary, slammed Democrats for caving in 'to the demands of far-left Palestinian extremists.\"\nAsked about Trump's comments on the war, Markstein said he believed Trump 'was just giving voice to the frustration of … people [who] want this to be concluded, with Israel defeating Hamas and rescuing the hostages.' On Trump's remarks about Jewish voters, Markstein said Trump 'was just trying to say in a Trumpian way … why haven't they been more vocal in their opposition to what their own leaders of their party are doing?'\nBack in Pittsburgh, Kipp Dawson, a Jewish civil rights activist backing Lee, said she would be horrified by Trump's re-election and expressed hope that Lee would be able to bring skeptical Democrats back on board with Biden this fall.\n'My sense is that things are extraordinarily in flux in this country right now,' she said. 'The big issue for November is who's going to come out to vote.'\nAt Pinsker's, the Cohens declined to say whom they'd support in next week's primary or the general election, though they said a number of Jews in Squirrel Hill were eager to back Patel.\n'The Jewish community really feels that if they don't take the stand now, [U.S. support for Israel] is not going to be assured,' Baila Cohen said. 'Everyone's very interested in getting actively involved and being part of the political scene in a way that doesn't always play out.'\nAllan Smith Emma Barnett",

Welcome to Sunday, it's Meet the Press.\nANNOUNCER:\nFrom NBC News in Washington, the longest-running show in television history. This is Meet the Press with Kristen Welker.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nGood Sunday morning. We begin with our brand new NBC News poll and the headline President Biden is closing the gap with former President Trump. Trump leads Biden by two points in a head-to-head matchup, 46 to 44%. Biden has narrowed that deficit against Trump from 5 points in January. And when third party candidates, including Robert F. Kennedy, are included, Biden leads by two points, 39 to 37%. The president's job approval has also ticked up to 42%, up five points from January. The last time we've seen a five-point increase for an incumbent president in their re-election year was Bill Clinton in 1996. There are still troubling numbers in the poll for Biden. He trails Trump by 22 points on dealing with inflation and the cost of living. All of it comes amid a major foreign policy development. Six months after the president delivered an Oval Office speech pleading for wartime aid for Ukraine, $61 billion dollars in new funding finally passed on Saturday 311 to 112.\n[START TAPE]\nREP. MARC MOLINARO:\nThe bill is passed.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nA moment of bipartisanship in a Congress primarily defined by its dysfunction. 101 Republicans and 210 Democrats voted in favor. But more Republicans, 112, opposed it. Congress also passed new aid for Israel and Taiwan, along with a measure to force TikTok parent company ByteDance to sell the app. New aid for Ukraine came only after Republican Speaker Mike Johnson, who once opposed it, did an about-face and put his job on the line to get it through, amid threats from three far right Republicans to oust him.\n[START TAPE]\nSPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON:\nIf we turn our backs right now, the consequences could be devastating.\nREPORTER:\nYou're being asked to resign, will you?\nSPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON:\nNo, listen, I – I – as I've said many times I don't walk around this building being worried about a motion to vacate. I have to do my job. We – we did. I've done here what I believe to be the right thing and that is to allow the house to work its will and as I've said you do the right thing and you let the chips fall where they may.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThe Pentagon has said it has a massive infusion of military aid for Ukraine ready to go. It comes as Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said that without this support, we will have no chance of winning. Ukraine's top military commander issued a bleak assessment of the army's positions on the eastern front, saying they have worsened significantly in recent days. And the top American military commander in Europe told members of Congress that Russia will soon be able to fire ten shells for every Ukrainian shell.\n[START TAPE]\nGEN. CHRISTOPHER CAVOLI:\nIf one side can shoot and the other side can't shoot back, the side that can't shoot back loses.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nJoining me now is the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. President Zelenskyy, welcome back to Meet the Press.\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nGood morning, and greetings to you.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, President Zelenskyy, it is an historic morning. I want to get your reaction to this major news, the House approving $61 billion in aid to Ukraine. It's expected to pass through the Senate. But you have been asking for this aid for six months. In that time, you have run out of ammunition. You've suffered setbacks on the battlefield. Will you get this aid in time to make a difference?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nYeah, it's been so important. And we'd like to say thanks to the Congress for the bipartisan support. And we'd like to say thanks to Speaker Johnson and President Biden. Indeed, it is so important, the support from the United States of America. Of course, we need the support of the American people because, of course, the political decisions depend on the public opinion. And this aid will strengthen Ukraine, and send the Kremlin a powerful signal that it will not be the second Afghanistan. The United States will stay with Ukraine, will protect the Ukrainians, and they will protect – they will protect democracy in the world. This is the show of leadership and strength of the United States. And I think, indeed, now we've reached this important moment. For half a year we've been waiting and I would like to say thanks to all the team on my side and on the U.S. side, the team who did everything so that we would get this positive vote. And today, we definitely need this aid. And Kristen, we really need to get this to the final point. We need to get it approved by the Senate. And then we want to get things as fast as possible so that we get some tangible assistance for the soldiers on the front line as soon as possible, not in another six months, so that they will be able to move ahead.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou know, you said this week, President Zelenskyy, that Ukraine would have 'no chance of winning' without more U.S. support. And I guess the question is can Ukraine now win this war? Or is the United States merely giving you enough aid to prolong this war?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nThank you. I think this support will really strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine. And we will have a chance for victory if Ukraine really gets the weapon system which we need so much. We - thousands of soldiers need so much, and this aid should not be just spread into layers all over, but it has to end up in tangible weapon systems. Some really crucial weapon systems which are hard to get. The long-range artillery and I really appreciate that it mentions ATACMs, long-range weapons. And it's important because we need long-range weapons to not lose people on the front line. Because we have – we have casualties because we cannot reach that far. Our weapons are not that long-range. So we need it, and air defense. This is crucial. These are the priorities now.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, as you know, this aid was held up for half a year because there is fierce opposition to sending war aid to Ukraine, particularly amongst some Republicans. How long should Americans be expected to fund the war in Ukraine?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nThe Americans are not funding the war in Ukraine. They foremost protect freedom and democracy all over Europe. And Ukraine is fighting, and Ukraine is sending its best sons and daughters to the front line and this reduces the price for all Europe, for all NATO. It reduces the price for everyone, including the U.S. as the leaders in NATO. U.S. army now does not have to fight protecting NATO countries. Ukrainians are doing that. And it's only the ammo that the civilized world is providing. And I think it's a good decision. That is why we do need to keep supporting. While Ukraine stands, there's no direct war between U.S. or NATO and Russian aggression. So Ukraine is still fighting, and Ukraine is protecting all the others.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nBut President Zelenskyy, can you give Americans a sense of the timeline? Will you still need as much aid this time next year? Or do you think you can turn the corner on Russia? What's the timeline?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nWell, it depends on when we actually get weapons on the ground, as you said it Kristen. If we get it in half a year. Well, we've had the process to hold for half a year. And we had losses in several directions. The losses in men, in equipment. In the east it was very difficult. And we did lose the initiative there. Now we have all the chance to stabilize the situation and to overtake the initiative. And that's why we need to actually have the weapon systems. When we get it, when we have it in our arms, then we do have the chance to take this initiative and to move ahead to protect Ukraine. But giving U.S. specific timeline of the war, well, it depends on how soon we get this aid. There are so many variables, so many factors. And sometimes when we protect the important line, you retreat because you don't have enough forces and equipment. And then retaking the climb would take two or three times more. And I'm not saying that this is how it's going to end up. But things are possible, and I can give you an example with F-16. It's a great example. The decision to supply F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, we've had it a year ago. One year ago, we got the positive response. Ukraine should receive these fighter jets, so that not only air defense could protect the sky, but we also have more than jets. A year has passed. We still don't have the jets in Ukraine. So it's very difficult to do any forecast. I would like us to be open and very, very specific. From the moment we get our hands on these weapon systems, well, from that moment, we can talk about the timeline.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, Ukrainian intelligence suggests that the Kremlin is preparing for a major offensive in the coming months. You have said by your own account that they are prepared to outgun you ten to one in fire power by some estimations. Will you be ready for that offensive?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nWe are preparing. The personnel is preparing. The soldiers are engaged in training. And I don't want to repeat myself, but we are waiting for the weapon systems because we want to have the brigades fully equipped. Some of them are exhausted. We need to replace them. But these new brigades, they have to have the equipment. Russia wants to mobilize 300,000 people by June 1st. We are getting ready for this. By May 9th, Russia expects that in the east of Ukraine they will take Chasiv Yar city. I visited the region recently. I talked to the soldiers. The soldiers say that they lack equipment. They need to fight Russian reconnaissance drones, which essentially guide the artillery and we need artillery shells. I hope we will be able to stay, and the weapons will come on time, and we will repel the enemy and then we'll break the plans of the Russian Federation with regards to this full-scale offensive.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nI want to ask you, President Zelenskyy, about reports of a lack of morale. Some 650,000 men who are eligible to fight, we are told, have fled Ukraine. You have lowered the draft eligible age, but you've resisted a full call-up of all Ukrainian men. What do you say to young men who don't want to fight, who don't want to risk their lives in this war for their country?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nThis war is the war for the sake of all of us. This is our land. We don't have another place to go. And the citizens of Ukraine understand that. Of course, there are people who don't want to, are not ready. But we do have this mobilization campaign. We do have the draft. We do have a strong army. And we can be frank. In Russia, of course they have more people and people are forced there. So, for example, if someone in Russia is deserting the battlefield, they just shoot them on sight. We cannot do that because we have the democratic values, believe in the democratic country. So, to be frank, in Ukraine we have a lot of people who are ready to protect the motherland. But of course the motivation, the morale can go down, especially when they go to the front line and they see that, well, there are no shells. There is no equipment. That's why the aid from the states is so important. And people need to be trained by professional people and they need to have the equipment to be used so that they have this so people, not only on the training field, but also on the actual battlefield. And then, indeed, they can show the performance on the front line. This is very important.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy –\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\n– And then the morale will go high. And then they will indeed defend the motherland.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThe Washington Post is reporting that Donald Trump has said privately he could end Russia's war in Ukraine by pressuring Ukraine to give up some territory like Crimea, like the Donbas region. What is your reaction and realistically speaking do you see this war ending in a negotiation with Russia.\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nLet's just say that, well, I'm a president of a country at war. And rumors and different hearsay, I don't believe that. When Trump comes here and would tell me their formula of peace, then I would be able to provide the response. At the moment, I know that, well, things Putin wants to show, they cannot happen.And I'm sure that people who know him well, they know. But you can never trust Putin. It's impossible. So the strategy of ending the war should be based not on the words which Putin says or some other people from his entourage say, but on something very specific. Something – something very tangible in Ukraine that is independent and democratic. And I'm confident that everyone is interested in that. All the political leaders in the U.S., they are also interested to have Ukraine independent and sovereign and democratic. It's of interest for both the Republicans and the Democrats.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, back in February Donald Trump encouraged Putin to invade NATO countries that he doesn't believe are contributing enough to defense spending. What kind of a message do you think that sends to the world?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nWell, I don't know the details of that speech. I know for sure if Ukraine fails, then Putin – then Putin definitely will invade the Baltic countries. Why? Not because there's some interesting idea, strategy, but because Putin wants to return the influence of the Soviet Union. And he really wants to retake the force to war. He wants to retake all former Soviet republics and now independent states. Whether they are in the NATO or not, he doesn't care. That is why this is his strategy. Of course, after the Baltic states, also Poland and parts of Germany would also –\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, big picture. Germany's top military official has warned that Putin could be ready to attack NATO countries in as soon as five years, following up on what you're saying. How big of a threat do you see Putin to the West?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nI think he does want to go further. As I said, he wants to reinstate Soviet Union and the Soviet – the Soviet bloc. And they do that in terms of information, misinformation. They just drive different political groups and democracies. Not only Europe, in Latin America, in Africa, they have the influence everywhere. And they do this to split the world. So the risk is high. I think this German diplomat said that it's not even about the wish of Putin, but it's that if Putin is not stopped, then Putin is ready to attack NATO. Even look at the sheer size of the army and the weapons that they have. So we have to be ready to stop him now. Because the froze in conflicts, well, we've seen that in Georgia. We've seen that in other countries. So if we give the big pause to Putin, if we freeze the war right where we are, this will enable him because all his industry will start working not for the war in Ukraine, but will start working for the war against NATO.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, you are not just a president. You are also a father. You have survived multiple assassination attempts. Tens of thousands of your fellow citizens have been killed and injured. Millions have left their homes. Have you ever lost hope?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nYou can never lose hope. You can never lose hope. You can never lose freedom. You can never lose independence. Otherwise, you just lose everything. You lose your state. You lose your security for your children, for – all the children in Ukraine are my children. I will then lose everything. And I have to show the example. If I lose hope, well, my children would lose their future independent country. And then we would lose Ukraine as – as the nation. It's not only about the territory. It's about ourselves, our identity. So we cannot lose hope. We've had different moments, some very cruel. There were moments of challenge. And I'm sure in the history of the United States they also had many moments when the people of the U.S. had to fight for their independence. We remember the period of struggling, when many people lost hope. Or some people emigrated to France. But some people raised the banner, the United States, the banner of independence. And some people were skeptical on both sides of the ocean, in Europe too. But people didn't give up. And I think, well, you got the independent country. And the world got this great democracy. So we cannot lose hope either.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, thank you for being here on this monumental morning. We really appreciate your perspective and having a chance to talk to you. When we come back, Steve Kornacki is here with the results of our latest NBC News poll.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. For more on the NBC News poll, I'm joined by National Political Correspondent Steve Kornacki to break down the numbers. A lot of headlines here, Steve.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nAbsolutely, Kristen. I think the biggest headline, this. Let's give you the bottom line. Donald Trump does lead Joe Biden 46% to 44% in our poll. But this is a tightening from our last poll. You could see three months ago Donald Trump had a five-point lead against the current president. That five-point lead, now down to two points, so there is progress here for Biden in the last three months.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nComing after the State of the Union, and he's had a campaign blitz.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nYeah, and the Democratic primaries, such as they were, coming to an end. Perhaps there's Democrats rallying around Biden, too. Also, I think not coincidentally, this slight improvement here for Biden tracks with a slight improvement in his job approval rating. It now sits at 42%. Again, go back to our last poll, look at this. He was in all-time-low-for-him territory last time around. Now up back over 40%, the highest Biden's job approval has been in our poll since last spring. So, again, these are encouraging signs for Joe Biden; although, broader picture here, this 42% approval rating, history says probably by itself not enough. He's probably going to need more because put this in some context here: these are other recent presidents. At this point in their reelection campaigns, where were their approval ratings? Again, you see Biden's 42%. One thing that jumps out: they were all higher than Joe Biden. The other thing, the two presidents on this list who did not win reelection of course: Donald Trump four years ago, he was at 46%; and back in 1992 George H.W. Bush, he was at 43%. Biden below both of those. The last time Biden's been at this level, 46%, you've got to back to the start of 2023. The last time he was higher than that, you've got to go back to the summer of 2021, his first year as president. So Biden has some work to do on that front. And also troubling for the Biden campaign, the erosion of public confidence on a number of critical fronts. We asked voters in this poll about a number of leadership characteristics here. \"Which candidate would be better?\" There are two, only two, where Biden has the edge over Trump. Abortion, we've talked about this one, seen this for a long time here.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThat's a big one.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nIt is. Certainly, that's the biggest Biden advantage in this poll. And then bringing the country together, Biden you see performing better than Trump. But I think the headline here is you add those two numbers together, you're not even close to 100. That means a lot of voters think neither candidate is better on that. And then on every other front here, we talk about the erosion for Biden and now, you start to see it. Look at these numbers. Trump advantages on all of these traits.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd I stop here because competent and effective, that was President Biden's, the crux of his campaign pitch back in 2020.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nAnd we actually polled this question in 2020, and it was basically the exact opposite. It was Biden with about a ten-point advantage over Trump and, again, same with handling of crisis. Biden had the edge over Trump. And how about this? It's the former president, the current president. We don't really see matchups like this. Well, now we can measure it. Who has the strongest record as president? And, again, Trump outpacing Biden on that front. And, again, you've got to mention this one, too. \"Necessary mental and physical health.\" We asked this four years ago, it was a wash. It's now a clear liability for Joe Biden. So these are all troubling numbers for Biden, but it's not to say there aren't warning signs for Donald Trump in this poll either.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, Trump and his campaign are hoping a third-party candidate might give them a little bit of a boost, but our poll shows it's a little bit murkier than that.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nThat's the thing, because, again, we show a 46-44 race here for Donald Trump. Again, all those liabilities for Biden, Trump only ahead two. What the Trump folks have been hoping is RFK, third-party candidates, they gobble up some votes and Trump doesn't need to get to 50%. But look what happens when we add RFK's name to the mix. Suddenly, we have a new leader. Joe Biden, 39%; Donald Trump, 37%. There's Kennedy getting 13%. In other words, we're seeing by a better than 2:1 margin, it's Trump voters who are flipping over to Kennedy in this scenario, not Biden voters. You see it right here. 15% of Trump voters, when we add RFK's name to the mix, they go to RFK. Only 7% of Biden voters. There's a big change right there.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nDefies conventional wisdom. There's no doubt about that.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nAbsolutely. I think we haven't seen this in other polls. And one final note, Kristen, as well, is the question of enthusiasm. And I thought this really jumped out here. The most engaged voters, those who voted in 2020, voted in the midterm elections, those folks are voting for Biden by nine points. Where Trump's strength is, why he leads Biden, it's voters who don't typically turn out in many elections. Didn't vote in '20, didn't vote in '22, they are with Trump by more than 20 points. And the warning sign for Trump in relying on this kind of voter is this: we are seeing the lowest level of –\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWow.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\n– interest since we started asking this question back in 2008. \"Are you very interested in the election?\" Sixty-four percent, that's lower than any other time at this point where we have polled this before. So, again, lower interest. Maybe those voters who in the polls are saying they're for Trump, are we sure they're going to actually vote in November? The Trump campaign better hope so.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWe'll have to see if that ticks up if we get closer to Election Day. Steve Kornacki, thank you so much for being here.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nYou got it.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWe really appreciate it. When we come back, the jury will hear opening statements in Donald Trump's first criminal trial. What impact will it have on voters? The panel is next.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. The panel is here: NBC News chief Washington correspondent Andrea Mitchell; Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher; and Matt Gorman, former senior communications advisor for Tim Scott for America. Andrea, I have to start with you. There's a lot to unpack. Let's start with President Zelenskyy. What were your key takeaways from our conversation?\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nThat he's really worried about the surge – the Russian surge in what we expect to be May, June, July. This six months was critical. They had a really good chance of winning, before the six months of no aid from the U.S., the weapons that only the U.S. can provide. And after six months, they can lose. They can lose, if the weapons don't get there soon enough. So now it's supply chain. He pointed out that the F-16s are still not there, and they were approved a year ago. And talking to Ukrainian officials, and you heard him today, they need the long-range weapons. They still don't have the ATACMS, those long-range missiles. They're supposedly in the package, the administration is deciding. Ukrainian officials say they've got to get them because the Russian launches, the artillery launches, not only do they have the ammo – they don't have the ammo, they don't have the manpower, Ukraine doesn't have any more – but Russia has that huge advantage, 10:1 in artillery, but they can't take that artillery out, because they don't have the long-range missiles. U.S. has been really worried about not letting them fire into Russian territory. The Ukrainians tell me they really want to, but they do have that restriction. They have restrictions that, frankly, are not placed on Israel. And they're watching Israel getting, you know -- despite all the controversy over Gaza, Israel has the support that Ukraine doesn't have. And I also think that it was really interesting that he ducked the two questions you asked about Donald Trump. He knows this is a close election. And the bottom line is he knows that Donald Trump has said that Ukraine can be forced at the negotiating table to give territory up to Russia. By next November, if Donald Trump is elected, I think it's all possible that Ukraine can still lose this war, despite their great spirit.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, I'm so glad that you bring up two points: One, that he did choose his words very carefully on Donald Trump; and the factor of Israel, the fact that Ukraine is so concerned, Matt Gorman, that the world has forgotten about them as attention has turned to the Middle East, to what's happening in Gaza. And of course, House Speaker Mike Johnson really at the center of the battles for more aid for Ukraine and Israel. Both were approved yesterday, but there's so much opposition within his own party, three conservative Republicans threatening to oust him over this. But it seemed like the temperature was turned down a little bit, yesterday. What is your assessment? How in jeopardy is his job?\nMATT GORMAN:\nIn the short term, not as much as I think people think. The real threat to Mike Johnson isn't now; it's November, it's post-election. Republicans are going to choose their leaders for the next Congress. They'll already have to choose a Senate leader. I think, until then, Democrats and Republicans will cobble together a majority on a motion to vacate, if it comes up. And I think Republicans want to hold on until then. Let's face it: also, too, no one really wants to be speaker right now, other than Mike Johnson. I thought it was notable that Steve Scalise and Tom Emmer voted with Johnson; notable who didn't, Elise Stefanik. If a successful move is going to be made, it's not until November.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYeah. Only member of the Republican leadership who did not vote for it. Cornell, let's talk about this poll: President Biden narrowing the gap with former President Trump, not a big surprise. But what stood out to you in the crosstabs?\nCORNELL BELCHER:\nWhat stands out to me is – well, first of all, great interview, by the way, groundbreaking interview. Spot on. What stood out to me is – surprise, surprise – polls are closing. And polls continue to shrink and get tighter and tighter because that's what happens in this country. And if you go back to our polling, go back to our polling back in October of last year, Donald Trump was at 46%. What is he, throughout all our NBC polling? He's at 46%. What is he at right now? At 46%. Donald Trump, what did he get in the last election? He got 46%. His support stays solid. Where I'm worried about or where I see you can see growth here is, I think Donald Trump is at his ceiling, and Biden is close to his floor. Where he's off most? He's off most among young voters. He is – and the other part about this is the enthusiasm, which I think is really the headline, is that if these young voters aren't enthusiastic and they don't show up and break for Biden big, that's how Trump wins.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAndrea, pick up on that point, because this is all going on against the backdrop of Donald Trump in court for his first criminal trial this week.\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nYet, the fact is we don't know how that is going to play. Up until now, these legal cases have only helped him fundraising, made him, you know, tell people he's a victim, energized his base. And so he's risen in the polls with every indictment. Now, we're going to see him really powerless. The judge has been very effective. And how they handle the gag order is yet to be seen, while Joe Biden is campaigning. The problem for Joe Biden and the Democrats is it's is crowding out – the trial is crowding out the trial, is crowding out everything else. So Joe Biden goes out and does major policy things, the steel tariffs in Pennsylvania, everything else that he's doing. Student loans is breaking through, a lit bit. But everything else is crowded out. And it's the Trump story. And that's what happened in 2016 to Hillary Clinton. And that could be replicated this year. I think it's really – I think the enthusiasm issue and the young voter issue is critical. And as long as this war in Gaza goes on, this is going to be a problem with young voters because they have off ramp. That off ramp is RKF Jr. And I know your poll shows that RKF Jr. would hurt Trump more than Biden, hypothetically, and it's very early in polling, you know, to say who, but I know the White House is more afraid of –\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nIs jittery, yeah.\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nThe family certainly is because it was very hard for those siblings to come out and do that. They only did it because they think he really hurts them, Joe Biden, more than Donald Trump.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nMatt Gorman, what about all of that?\nMATT GORMAN:\nYeah. Look, I was encouraged because when I was going into the trial, I was nervous that all the talk was going to be simply coming from Trump, his message was going to be about himself and the trial. I was surprised, going in the bodega, I thought it was smart, it leaned into issues like immigration, the migrant crisis, and crime that are winning issues, as we saw in the poll, for Republicans and Trump. He needs to continue to do that, get a message that's not just about himself, while he's sitting in the courtroom.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nHow does the courtroom optics play, Cornell?\nCORNELL BELCHER:\nAndrea, you're spot on about him – about him dominating the news, but it's negative news, right? This is different –\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nThat's a very good point.\nCORNELL BELCHER:\nAnd he doesn't look strong. He looks - he looks weak there. And so, to a certain extent, I don't –I don't mind if he's in court every day, dominating the news, because it's negative news.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nOkay. All right. Great conversation. We covered a lot of ground, but thank you.\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nCongratulations on a great interview.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThank you, Andrea. Thank you, all. When we come back, as the athletes prepare for the Summer Olympics in Paris, we look back on the U.S. decision to boycott the games after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Our Meet the Press Minute is next.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. We have officially crossed the 100-day mark to the 2024 Olympics, as Paris prepares to host the competition, this summer. But the Olympics are not just about sports; they've also made history. The United States led an international boycott of the 1980 games in Moscow to protest the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. President Jimmy Carter announced his historic decision right here on Meet the Press.\n[START TAPE]\nPRES. JIMMY CARTER:\nNeither I know the American people would support the sending of an American team to Moscow with Soviet invasion troops in Afghanistan. I'll send a message today to the United States Olympic Committee, spelling out my own position, that unless the Soviets withdraw their troops, within a month, from Afghanistan, that the Olympic games be moved from Moscow to an alternate site or multiple sites, or postponed, or canceled. If the Soviets do not withdraw their troops immediately from Afghanistan within a month, I will not support the sending of an American team to the Olympics.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd you can watch the Paris Olympics this summer on NBC and streaming on Peacock. When we come back, presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin joins me for our Meet the Moment conversation with lessons from the past, as America's democracy is being tested once again.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. As she likes to say, Doris Kearns Goodwin has spent most of her career writing about dead presidents, immersing herself in their papers, diaries and letters in an attempt to being them back to life. In a new book, \"An Unfinished Love Story,\" the presidential historian turns that same attention to her marriage. Before his death, she opened more than 300 boxes of documents and memorabilia with her husband Richard Goodwin, who served as a speechwriter for President John F. Kennedy: a time capsule of their life in the 1960's. In her twenties, Doris was chosen to be a White House fellow for President Lyndon Johnson, one of only three women out of the 16 fellows selected, and developed a loyalty and closeness to President Johnson which has lasted her entire life. I sat down with Doris for a Meet the Moment conversation on her new book and the resilience of America, even in turbulent times.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou have typically written presidential biographies. This is a biography to some extent of your husband, and it is also a love story. What was the process like of writing this book as compared to all of your other incredible works?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nWell, I was so used to writing about presidents who had archives, and I would want to talk to them. I knew them so well, because it took me so long to write those books, longer to write the book about World War II than the war to be fought, longer to write about the Civil War than twice the Civil War. And I would always ask them questions, and they never answered me. So this time, I had this guy, my guy, right across the hall from me in the same study, and I was able to talk to him. And he could answer my questions. And he had an archive – a mini archive of what presidents have – memos, diaries, letters. He just had saved everything in 300 boxes and finally decided when he turned 80 to open them. And what it really opened was a door to the 1960s, a decade that I'd lived in but I was able to learn through him starting at the beginning with John Kennedy, ending with Bobby Kennedy's death and the Democratic Convention.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou talk about the fact that after your husband passed, it was a struggle for you to finish this project that was a labor of love. You write, \"I found myself edging toward a commitment to finish the project influenced by headlines announcing divisions between Black and white, old and young, rich and poor, divisions that made it increasingly evident that the momentous issues emanating from the '60s remain the unresolved stuff of our everyday lives.\"\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nYeah, I think that's what really decided me. I knew if I were going to work on it, it was going to take years. My books take so long, so it was a huge commitment, and I was going to be writing as an historian, not simply as somebody writing about my husband. And so, once I realized that the '60s really had a message to the people today, and I believe that's so. Because we look at the '60s in a sad way because it ended with the riots, it ended with anti-war violence, it ended with Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy being killed. But when you start at the beginning, it was a decade in which young people in particular were powered by the conviction they could make a difference. And they joined the Peace Corps. The people who were in the Freedom Rides and the sit-ins, in the marches against segregation, marches for the vote. The beginning of the women's movement is there, the gay rights movement. It's a time when the air is filled with that belief that if you work together, you can change the government.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, when you look across the political spectrum, do you see leaders right now who are meeting this moment where so many people wonder if our democracy will stay intact?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nI mean, I don't know that we're fighting it the same way we need to be. This is one of the most perilous moments, and there are people obviously in local areas. There are people in states. There are some people in Washington. But the overall sense is, sometimes we've become too much of spectators watching what's happening to ourselves. And – and one of the things Dante said is that \"The lowest place in Hell are for those people in a moral crisis who remain neutral or remain silent.\" We are in a moral crisis right now, and that's what history – I always feel so – so positive about what history can teach us, because we've lived through really hard times before. And these are hard times, however, and it won't get better unless we act, unless we take seriously our citizen responsibilities and use the qualities of character that we need to bring into politics.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nHow afraid, how concerned are you that January 6th could happen again?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nWell, because we're not remembering it correctly. That – that – what history – I was so certain as an historian, and I was on television saying, \"This is going to change public sentiment.\" Just as certain things happened in the '50s that made people understand in the '60s that slavery had to be ended, public sentiment finally got changed. I thought it had, but everything is so breaking news today, and one thing tops on another. I thought the summer after January 6th when the hearings took place, that would change public sentiment. But I still think in the end that the majority of the people understood what happened in that election. I think the majority of people are for the basic values that we're talking about right now for democracy. And it's just a matter of them speaking out and recognizing that it is in danger, and it's up to us. It's not up to somebody else, it's up to us to save it.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd the Republican nominee has yet to accept the results of the last election. Within the context of this conversation and your concerns about the nation's democracy, how much of a threat do you think the democracy is facing right now, and do you think the country can survive this threat?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nWell, I think the real threat is when the Republican – former President says that \"if he doesn't win, he won't accept the results of this next election,\" which means that we may have a recurring battle for who's really – who's really elected each time we do this. And that's a real problem. I mean, all the candidates, when you look at the ones who lost, it's really hard to lose, and every single one was able to say, as – as Carter did, \"I promised I'd never tell you a lie. This hurts, it really hurts.\" Or Al Gore working on that concession speech that my husband was honored enough to help him on, where he talked about the fact, \"The law of the land has said that this election is lost. I don't agree with it, but I must do it.\" And Hillary Clinton say, \"We not only believe in the transition of power, we cherish it.\" I looked at all those, and it just makes you so proud of each one of those candidates who had been through an election. They'd lost it, they'd let down their constituents, and they were able to make that transfer of power. And it's an essential part of our democracy that has to happen this next November.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAs we sit here today, how concerned are you that it may not happen?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nI am concerned that it may not happen, but I somehow think if the majority of the people come out who have different values from that and they vote, voting is absolutely essential. It's the premium value. As Lyndon Johnson said, \"It's the – it's the one thing that all the rest of our democracy depends on.\" And what is democracy? You throw a candidate out or you call him in. You either want him to come in, or you want to throw him out. We have to be able to do that. And I think, if the majority comes out to vote, and the majority never comes out in enough numbers to vote, not only young people. They've made a big difference in 2020, 2018, 2022, and they're saying now that they may not vote if they're not happy with either candidate. Again, if they only could know what we felt like in the '60s when we felt we were making a difference, you feel larger. You feel a sense of – of exhilaration, the word you used earlier. And I just hope they feel that this election could turn on them, and the uncommitted people and the undecided people have to come out and vote, and we have to just take the results of the election. That doesn't mean we know how it's going to happen, but if the overwhelming majority vote, then somehow maybe it won't be as close as we think it is going to be. And then we'll have a clear-cut choice.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nI hear so much optimism in your voice still.\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nYes, I think I was born that way, and I think it's the only way we can live. I mean, it sometimes may sound naïve. I remember thinking what I was feeling when I was at the Civil Rights march, that we're going to change America. Maybe we didn't change America completely, but we made huge changes at that time. And if you have optimism, at least you have the confidence that if you act, something will happen. And it may take a long time, as – as Martin Luther King talked about, \"the arc of the universe,\" all that stuff takes a long time, but it moves toward justice. And I do believe that.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThank you, Doris Kearns Goodwin for this incredible conversation.\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nThank you. I'm so glad to have been with you.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell that's all for today, thanks for watching. We'll be back next week, because if it's Sunday it's Meet the Press.",
