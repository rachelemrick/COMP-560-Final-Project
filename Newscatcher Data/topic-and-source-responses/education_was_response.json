            "summary": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden's latest plan for student loan cancellation is moving forward as a proposed regulation, offering him a fresh chance to deliver on a campaign promise and energize young voters ahead of the November election.\nThe Education Department on Tuesday filed paperwork for a new regulation that would deliver the cancellation that Biden announced last week. It still has to go through a 30-day public comment period and another review before it can be finalized.\nIt's a more targeted proposal than the one the U.S. Supreme Court struck down last year. The new plan uses a different legal basis and seeks to cancel or reduce loans for more than 25 million Americans.\nConservative opponents, who see it as an unfair burden for taxpayers who didn't attend college, have threatened to challenge it in court.\nAdvertisement\nThe Democratic president highlighted the the plan during a trip to Wisconsin last week, saying it would provide 'life-changing' relief. He laid out five categories of people who would be eligible for help.\nThe new paperwork filed by the Education Department includes four of those categories, while a separate proposal will be filed later addressing how people facing various kinds of hardship can get relief.\nThe broadest forgiveness category would help borrowers who owe more than they originally borrowed because of runaway interest. It would eliminate up to $20,000 in interest for anyone in that situation, while those with annual incomes below $120,000 and enrolled in income-driven repayment plans would get all their interest erased with no maximum limit. It would be done automatically.\nAnother category would cancel loans for people who have been paying back their undergraduate student loans for at least 20 years, and those who have been paying graduate loans at last 25 years.\nAdvertisement\nIt would automatically cancel loans for those who went to colleges or programs considered to have low financial value. Borrowers would be eligible for cancellation if they attended a program that leave graduates with earnings no better than those with a high school diploma, for example, or programs that leave graduates with large shares of debt compared with their incomes.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBorrowers who are eligible for other federal forgiveness programs but haven't applied would also get loans erased. Federal education officials would use existing data to identify those people and offer relief. It's intended to reach those who don't know about other programs or have been deterred by complicated application processes.\nThe proposal was hashed out over the course of several hearings as part of a federal rules process that gathers advice from outside experts. The plan was drafted with the help of students, college officials, state officials, borrower advocates and loan servicers.\nAdvertisement\nDuring that process, advocates pushed for a fifth category of forgiveness for people who have different kinds of hardship that prevent them from being able to repay their loans. The Education Department said it's still working on the details of that rule, with a separate proposal to come 'in the coming months.'\nThe department said the hardship proposal will offer cancellation to borrowers who are at high risk of defaulting on their loans along with those who face other hardships, including high medical and caregiving expenses. That proposal will mirror one agreed upon by outside experts during the rulemaking process, the agency said.\nIt usually takes months for a proposed rule to be finalized, and months more before it can take effect. The Biden administration said it plans to start implementing some parts of the new proposal as soon as this fall, using the education secretary's authority to implement rules early in certain cases.\nAdvertisement\nRepublicans are staunchly opposed to any broad student loan cancellation, saying it's an unfair bailout for people who went to college. Two coalitions of Republican states have sued the Biden administration to block a separate repayment plan that offers an accelerated path to loan forgiveness.\nThe White House says it's confident the new plan is on solid legal ground, saying the Higher Education Act gives the education secretary the power to waive student loans in certain cases.\n___",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with a decorated veteran of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq in a protracted fight with the government over 12 months of G.I. Bill educational benefits.\nThe court ruled 7-2 that the Department of Veterans Affairs improperly calculated the educational benefits for James Rudisill, a retired Army captain who lives in northern Virginia.\nRudisill, who's now an FBI agent, is in a category of veterans who earned credit under two versions of the G.I. Bill. One version applied to people who served before the Sept. 11, 2001, attack. Congress passed new legislation after Sept. 11.\nBut Rudisill served both before and after the attack, including tours in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nEach program gives veterans 36 months of benefits, and there's a 48-month cap. Rudisill thought he had 10 months of benefits remaining under the old program, plus another year in the new system. But the VA denied the additional year.\nAdvertisement\nRudisill said the decision forced him to give up his plan to attend Yale Divinity School, be ordained as an Episcopal priest and reenter the Army as a chaplain.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nHis lawyers said the decision could affect roughly 1.7 million veterans, but the VA disputed that the number is 'anything close' to 1.7 million, noting that his lawyers didn't identify any other cases that presented the same issue.\n___",

            "excerpt": "The rights of LGBTQ+ students will be protected by federal law and victims of campus sexual assault will gain new safeguards under new rules from the Biden administration",
            "summary": "The rights of LGBTQ+ students will be protected by federal law and victims of campus sexual assault will gain new safeguards under rules finalized Friday by the Biden administration.\nThe new provisions are part of a revised Title IX regulation issued by the Education Department, fulfilling a campaign pledge by President Joe Biden. He had promised to dismantle rules created by former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who added new protections for students accused of sexual misconduct.\nNotably absent from Biden's policy, however, is any mention of transgender athletes.\nThe administration originally planned to include a new policy forbidding schools from enacting outright bans on transgender athletes, but that provision was put on hold. The delay is widely seen as a political maneuver during an election year in which Republicans have rallied around bans on transgender athletes in girls' sports.\nAdvertisement\nInstead, Biden is officially undoing sexual assault rules put in place by his predecessor and current election-year opponent, former President Donald Trump. The final policy drew praise from victims' advocates, while Republicans said it erodes the rights of accused students.\nThe new rule makes 'crystal clear that everyone can access schools that are safe, welcoming and that respect their rights,' Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said.\n'No one should face bullying or discrimination just because of who they are, who they love,' Cardona told reporters. 'Sadly, this happens all too often.'\nBiden's regulation is meant to clarify schools' obligations under Title IX, the 1972 women's rights law that outlaws discrimination based on sex in education. It applies to colleges and elementary and high schools that receive federal money. The update is to take effect in August.\nAdvertisement\nAmong the biggest changes is new recognition that Title IX protects LGBTQ+ students — a source of deep conflict with Republicans.\nThe 1972 law doesn't directly address the issue, but the new rules clarify that Title IX also forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. LGBTQ+ students who face discrimination will be entitled to a response from their school under Title IX, and those failed by their schools can seek recourse from the federal government.\nMany Republicans say Congress never intended such protections under Title IX. A federal judge previously blocked Biden administration guidance to the same effect after 20 Republican-led states challenged the policy.\nRep. Virginia Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina and chair of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, said the new regulation threatens decades of advancement for women and girls.\nAdvertisement\n'This final rule dumps kerosene on the already raging fire that is Democrats' contemptuous culture war that aims to radically redefine sex and gender,' Foxx said in a statement.\nThe revision was proposed nearly two years ago but has been slowed by a comment period that drew 240,000 responses, a record for the Education Department.\nMany of the changes are meant to ensure that schools and colleges respond to complaints of sexual misconduct. In general, the rules widen the type of misconduct that institutions are required to address, and it grants more protections to students who bring accusations.\nChief among the changes is a wider definition of sexual harassment. Schools now must address any unwelcome sex-based conduct that is so 'severe or pervasive' that it limits a student's equal access to an education.\nAdvertisement\nUnder the DeVos rules, conduct had to be 'severe, pervasive and objectively offensive,' a higher bar that pushed some types of misconduct outside the purview of Title IX.\nColleges will no longer be required to hold live hearings to allow students to cross-examine one another through representatives — a signature provision from the DeVos rules.\nLive hearings are allowed under the Biden rules, but they're optional and carry new limits. Students must be able to participate from hearings remotely, for example, and schools must bar questions that are 'unclear or harassing.'\nAs an alternative to live hearings, college officials can interview students separately, allowing each student to suggest questions and get a recording of the responses.\nThose hearings were a major point of contention with victims' advocates, who said it forced sexual assault survivors to face their attackers and discouraged people from reporting assaults. Supporters said it gave accused students a fair process to question their accusers, arguing that universities had become too quick to rule against accused students.\nAdvertisement\nVictims' advocates applauded the changes and urged colleges to implement them quickly.\n'After years of pressure from students and survivors of sexual violence, the Biden Administration's Title IX update will make schools safer and more accessible for young people, many of whom experienced irreparable harm while they fought for protection and support,' said Emma Grasso Levine, a senior manager at the group Know Your IX.\nDespite the focus on safeguards for victims, the new rules preserve certain protections for accused students.\nAll students must have equal access to present evidence and witnesses under the new policy, and all students must have equal access to evidence. All students will be allowed to bring an advisor to campus hearings, and colleges must have an appeals process.\nIn general, accused students won't be able to be disciplined until after they're found responsible for misconduct, although the regulation allows for 'emergency' removals if it's deemed a matter of campus safety.\nAdvertisement\nThe latest overhaul continues a back-and-forth political battle as presidential administrations repeatedly rewrite the rules around campus sexual misconduct.\nThe DeVos rules were themselves an overhaul of an Obama-era policy that was intended to force colleges to take accusations of campus sexual assault more seriously. Now, after years of nearly constant changes, some colleges have been pushing for a political middle ground to end the whiplash.\n___",

            "excerpt": "Thousands of migrant children, some bused to Colorado from Texas, have helped stave off enrollment-related cuts, but now some schools are running out of space and teachers are growing fatigued.",
            "summary": "AURORA, Colo. — Until early this year, Alberto, 11, had never stepped into a classroom.\nThe closest school was many miles from his village in Venezuela, and Alberto's father never allowed him or his mom, Yuliver, to stray far, according to mother and son. The school also charged far more than they could afford.\n'I wanted to go school, but Dad wouldn't let me,' Alberto said through an interpreter. (The Hechinger Report is identifying Alberto and Yuliver and other migrants by only their first name because of concern for their safety or privacy.)\nLast summer, Yuliver and her son left their home country, walking across two continents before arriving six months later in Denver, where Yuliver's sister lives. Alberto enrolled in suburban Aurora Public Schools as a fourth-grader, and he has learned enough English that his teachers hide their smirks when he makes a particularly witty, and inappropriate, pun.\nAdvertisement\nAlberto is one of approximately 2,800 migrant and refugee children who've arrived in Aurora, located just east of Denver, this academic year. The Denver school district — the state's largest, with a total enrollment of about 88,000 — similarly has enrolled at least 3,700 newcomer students since last summer. In May 2023, Greg Abbott, the Republican governor of Texas, started sending immigrant families by the busloads to the Colorado capital, adding it to a destination list of other Democrat-led cities including Chicago, Philadelphia and Washington.\nAurora and Denver, like many school systems in Colorado, have long welcomed students new to the United States. In recent years, they have designated specific campuses to serve as resource hubs for migrant and refugee families. But the ongoing surge of immigrants — local educators hesitate to call it a crisis — have exposed clear signs of strain: Classrooms don't have enough seats for students. Teachers are fatigued by large class sizes and discipline issues. And state and local leaders are increasingly resistant to helping shoulder the costs.\nThe city council in Aurora, for example, recently passed a resolution restricting migrants from receiving local public services, a move that opponents fear will place undocumented residents at risk if they experience a fire, medical emergency or violent crime. But when it comes to schools, requirements under the U.S. Constitution are clear that states are obligated to allow children living in the country without legal documentation to access a basic education. That's created a dilemma for schools in communities like Aurora and Denver: The steady arrival of newcomers has all but reversed years of declining enrollment, staving off budget cuts and layoffs, but the costs associated with addressing the new arrivals' basic needs are steep.\nAdvertisement\n'It doesn't matter what your opinion is. You have to serve these kids,' said Julie Sugarman, an associate director for K-12 education research at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. 'There are civil rights that support these kids, but it does come with real, significant costs.'\nIn a typical year, Denver Public Schools enrolls about 500 students who've just moved to the country. The district so far this year has been receiving an average of 250 each week, according to Adrienne Endres, the district's executive director of multilingual education.\n'We have some very full classrooms,' she said. 'We hear most from teachers, ‘This is kind of overwhelming. There's a lot more kids and they all need a lot more from me.''\nThe majority of migrant families in Denver have chosen to place their kids in schools with existing bilingual programs, Endres added. But many students who have little, or any, formal experience with education find a better fit in one of the district's newcomer centers. Denver opened its first center back in 1999, in an unused gym at Denver South High School.\nAdvertisement\nThe district has since expanded the program to six campuses, where students learn literacy skills for one to two semesters before gradually moving into general classes.\nOn a recent morning at South High's newcomer center, teacher Karen Vittetoe worked with 14 teenagers from nearly as many countries — including Burundi, El Salvador and Sudan — on how to tell time and describe a daily schedule in English.\n'Marta goes to work at 9:50 in the morning. Is that 9:15 or 9:50? Do you hear the difference?' she asked as two teaching assistants walked around the classroom.\nThe adults together speak six different languages, allowing them to help during small group and one-on-one instruction. But that's not nearly enough in Vittetoe's larger second period, where 33 students speak 11 different languages.\n'Can you imagine?' she said. 'I don't even have enough desks for them all.'\nAdvertisement\nOne of her students, 18-year-old Momena, spoke no English when she first enrolled at South High late last year. Her family left Afghanistan, where the Taliban banned girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade.\n'I like everything about this school — except the food,' Momena said. 'They have a nice curriculum and also kind teachers.'\nMomena hopes to one day work in the medical field.\n'This is very important for me,' she said of getting an education in the United States. 'I want to go to college, go into nursing. I try hard every day.'\nLike Momena, most students in Vittetoe's classes arrived after Oct. 1 — the date on which Colorado determines its annual funding for K-12 schools based on enrollment. Only 10 other states rely on a single count day to allocate funding to districts. And in Denver, that's required central administrators to draw from cash reserves and other department budgets to make up for the roughly $17.5 million that the district hasn't received in per-pupil funding despite enrolling so many migrant and refugee children since last fall.\nAdvertisement\nState lawmakers in February fast-tracked a plan to provide $24 million — to be split among districts across Colorado — to ease the strain on local school budgets. Gov. Jared Polis signed the legislation in early March, but the money has yet to trickle down to local districts.\n'Without action in D.C., it's up to each state if schools get any support at all,' said Jill Koyama, vice dean of educational leadership and innovation at Arizona State University's teachers college.\nAt Boston P-8 School in Aurora, the first few weeks made for a rough transition for Alberto.\nHe failed a vision screening test and received a voucher for an eye exam, but passed it. Teachers eventually determined he had such little schooling that he simply couldn't identify letters to follow along in class. The school nurse also learned about trauma Alberto had experienced back home and on his journey to this country. School staff would have placed him with a therapist on campus, but no one on the mental health support team speaks Spanish. Many newcomers, including Alberto, have been referred to an online therapy service.\nThe school, however, had recently hired Danielle Pukansky, one of two English language development teachers who, in a tiny and cramped room, lead daily 45-minute classes for multilingual learners like Alberto.\nAdvertisement\n'The trauma showed when he first got here,' Pukansky recalled, noting he had been aggressive toward other students. 'How to re-regulate when these big emotions come up in such a little body, that is part of my background — and thank goodness.'\nBoston P-8 is one of six community schools in Aurora that provide intensive support services — such as medical care, food, clothing and adult education and language classes — to help stabilize families so kids can focus on academics in class. It's similar to the community hub model that Denver Public Schools operates at six campuses.\nLate on a Wednesday afternoon, Yuliver sat in Boston P-8's community room with her head in her hands. A worsening toothache had kept her awake for days. After making a couple calls, a staff member booked her a tooth extraction, free of charge, at a nearby dental clinic.\nAdvertisement\n'This is the only place I feel supported,' Yuliver said. 'Clothes, WiFi, food, shoes — they help with everything.'\nStatewide, enrollment has continued to fall for two straight years, prompting school closures, budget cuts and potential layoffs. But in the Denver area, the surge of students from other countries has more than made up the difference.\nSo far this year, Ellis Elementary in southeast Denver has absorbed 60 more students than initially expected. The large class sizes and student turnover have been tough on teachers: Principal Jamie Roybal said that on hard days, many of her staff members contemplate leaving the profession.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'We're swimming in the deep end,' she said, looking into a classroom. 'That's a first-grade teacher with 35 newcomers. That's a lot. When she goes home, she's exhausted.'\nAdvertisement\nBy winter break, Denver's Hamilton Middle School had absorbed 100 additional students over its projected enrollment. Priscilla Rahn, a Republican candidate for the Douglas County commission who teaches band and orchestra at Hamilton, said it's been a joy to welcome so many new musicians who have never had an instrument of their own.\nStill, Rahn wondered whether the community's generosity had been exhausted.\n'We're cutting city services,' she said, referring to the mayor's budget. 'As a teacher, we can't ask if you're legal. It doesn't matter. I teach all kids. But as a city, we're pretty much at capacity.'\nTeachers who speak Spanish are in particularly high demand. Some Denver principals have been able to recruit migrant parents who used to teach in their home countries, but the checklist of requirements they must meet for eligibility to work in the state is long. At Ellis Elementary, for example, a classroom aide from Venezuela finally got her teaching license approved in Colorado — three years after she first applied to teach in the U.S.\nThe latest bipartisan immigration reform proposal, which collapsed in Congress in February, would have expedited access to work authorization for asylum seekers, potentially allowing people like Yuliver to begin employment before the current six-month waiting period.\nWithout a job, Yuliver has struggled to afford an apartment — even one without hot water or central heating — for her and Alberto. She would like to work in a beauty shop, doing nails and hair, but already has considered making the trek back to Venezuela if she can't find employment.\n'I wish for him to keep studying,' she said of Alberto. 'He's intelligent. He just wants to learn everything.'\nAlberto, meanwhile, said he misses his friends and swimming at the beach back home. But here he's learning to ride a bike — provided by the community school program — and has already made five new friends at Boston P-8.\nDuring a sunny but chilly recess, Alberto drew a heart with wood chips on the ground in his school's playground. He placed a stray feather in the middle, and said it was for those friends he'd made at his first-ever school.\nThis story about Denver migrants was produced by The Hechinger Report , a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

            "summary": "Columbia University leaders will face scrutiny from lawmakers Wednesday about what they have done to combat campus antisemitism since the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza war, which has touched off intense protests at colleges across the country.\nIn December, the presidents of MIT, Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania testified on campus antisemitism before the Republican-led House Committee on Education and the Workforce. Lawmakers repeatedly asked whether calls for the genocide of Jews violated their campus policies, and the presidents' cautious, legalistic responses shocked many when they declined to say yes. Within weeks, the presidents of Penn and Harvard, under pressure on various fronts, had resigned.\n'Certainly, that hearing touched a nerve in the public,' said Jonathan Fansmith, a senior vice president at the American Council on Education, 'and elevated the issue.'\nAdvertisement\nWhat had been a policy discussion in higher education abruptly became part of the popular conversation, he said — complete with a 'Saturday Night Live' skit mocking the presidents. People debated free speech on campus and the political context, with questions about whether colleges are excessively left-leaning or if conservative critics had chosen elite private schools as an easy target.\nSix months after the war began, many colleges are still struggling to find the balance between students' right to speak out and protest with the need to ensure campuses are safe, welcoming environments. The University of Southern California announced Monday that it would not have the school's valedictorian — who is pro-Palestinian — speak at commencement because of security risks.\nThe House committee opened an investigation into campus antisemitism, demanding information from Harvard, Penn, MIT, Rutgers, the University of California at Berkeley and Columbia.\nAdvertisement\nColumbia's president, Minouche Shafik, had been asked to testify in December as well but had a prior commitment. In February, Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), the chair of the House committee, sent a letter to Columbia leaders expressing concerns over reports of antisemitism on campus, including a professor saying Zionists believe in a racist apartheid state, and pro-Palestinian protesters disrupting classroom buildings with demonstrations.\nLast month, Foxx summoned Shafik and the co-chairs of Columbia's board of trustees, Claire Shipman and David Greenwald, to answer questions before the committee, saying the university has not enforced its policies to protect Jewish students despite severe and pervasive antisemitism.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nDavid M. Schizer, dean emeritus of Columbia's law school, who is helping lead the university's antisemitism task force, will be a witness at the hearing Wednesday, as well.\nAdvertisement\nShafik declined an interview before the hearing. But in an essay in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, she wrote about what she planned to tell the committee. She explained how deeply and personally the war has been felt by thousands of people on campus.\n'Many knew people who had been killed or taken hostage. Indeed, to many in our community, Israel's very survival appeared to be at stake.' For others, 'Oct. 7 and the ensuing war in Gaza were part of a larger story of Palestinian displacement, as well as a continuing and escalating humanitarian catastrophe.'\nShe wrote about the difficulty of balancing the free speech rights of pro-Palestinian protesters and the impact their demonstrations had on Jewish students, and said the university is figuring out boundaries, such as designating appropriate space for protests.\nAdvertisement\nShe said official university statements should be limited to issues about life on campus, and 'the university should return to its core mission of fostering a range of perspectives and the scholarship, discoveries and good citizenship that flow from it. At the same time, students and faculty should feel unconstrained in developing their own opinions.'\nColumbia's website already states the answer to a question that tripped up the other presidents: 'Calls for genocide against the Jewish community or any other group are abhorrent, inconsistent with our values and against our rules. Incitement to violence against members of our community will not be tolerated.'\nThe university is being scrutinized on several fronts. Lawsuits have been filed by both pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian groups, and the Education Department has an open investigation, as it does into numerous schools.\nAdvertisement\nWednesday's hearing will be the first since the committee opened investigations into the issue at multiple universities, Fansmith noted, and Columbia has been asked to produce numerous related documents.",

She and Mendelson strongly disagreed with Lee, arguing he had no legal basis for the demand, but Bowser nevertheless proposed the cuts to meet that request.\nAdvertisement\nOn Friday night Mendelson upped the ante, saying he would ignore Lee's requirement.\n'The budget I will present will restore most if not all of the Pay Equity Fund, and do so by rejecting the Chief Financial Officer's insistence that $217 million needs to be added to the District's already-robust reserve funds,' Mendelson wrote. 'The CFO exceeded his authority when he told the Mayor and me that the reserves need to be topped-off now — because the law provides otherwise.'\nMendelson appeared to lend support to Bowser, who has been facing intense blowback from advocates for the decision to slash the Pay Equity Fund, while blaming Lee. 'This was a policy choice he forced on the Mayor,' Mendelson said, 'and I've made clear to him that I will not comply.'\nA spokeswoman for Lee did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday evening.

Many had gone back to school to pursue higher education and gain credentials, on the promise of a better salary. Some made long-term investments, finally having higher wages.\nAdvertisement\nMendelson said his proposed budget would restore at least $217 million to the Pay Equity Fund.\nLee had insisted on replenishing the reserve fund because he projected the District may need to rely on reserve funds to pay its bills in late 2027 and 2028. Mendelson said, 'lest anyone think I am being irresponsible,' that he would look for other ways to ensure the reserve fund is stable and fully funded in the next four years, including devoting year-end surplus dollars to it.

'I do not know one single school that says it has enough resources to do everything they want to do to improve learning.'\nMendelson accused the Bowser administration of flouting a 'schools first' law passed by the council several years ago, intended to ensure that schools are funded at the same level as the year before, and that if there is an overall increase in funds for the school system, 'the schools get more money,' Mendelson wrote.

He also noted that one-time funds and pandemic-era aid boosted hiring at a significantly faster rate than student enrollment, and contributing to the staffing and funding challenges the school system was encountering now. 'We knew though, at that time, that we couldn't sustain that level of increase in perpetuity,' Ferebee said about the new hires. 'The challenge of this moment is, we're now there where we're phasing out the last elements of that investment.'\nAdvertisement\nLastly, he said it will be 'most difficult' to restore funds for the Access to Justice Initiative, which provides lawyers for people facing various challenges ranging from eviction to domestic violence. Funded at $31 million last year, the fund would be cut by two-thirds this year, with Bowser proposing $10.4 million for the initiative. Mendelson said he would be looking for cuts elsewhere in the $10 billion local funds budget to keep Access to Justice at $31 million.\nMendelson will formally present his budget proposal on May 28.",

And Felder is among the most politically wired candidates as the former chairman of the Ward 7 Democrats.\nIn such a packed field, even the campaign signs seem to be competing for attention along Ward 7's key intersections and corridors. Making matters more interesting, three of the candidates have similar-sounding names, leading to some talking-point shticks to help voters remember who they are, as if in a radio jingle.\n'My name is Ebony Payne, and I'm running for D.C.

Thompson, for her part, raised more than $160,000 with matching funds; Felder, Rasheed and Brown also have a notable fundraising edge over the remaining candidates.\nPatricia Stamper, an advisory neighborhood commissioner in Deanwood, called this year's Ward 7 campaign a 'generational race,' believing that in such a period of transition for the ward, whoever pulls off the win could shape the community's agenda for years to come. If you ask Stamper, that person should be Thompson or Felder, the two she believes have the strongest track records of service in the ward and whom she has supported with donations this year.\nAdvertisement\nLisa Rice, a Ward 7 advisory neighborhood commissioner, said she was rooting for Rasheed or Brown, even though as an independent she wouldn't be voting in the primary. She said she liked the fire they brought in challenging Gray four years ago, a more difficult campaign against an incumbent, and appreciated their approach to public safety and the root causes of crime, showing they'd given the issue 'deep thought.'\nBut Rice, who is leading a ballot initiative to bring ranked-choice voting and open primaries to D.C., said a top concern was that the winner of the Democratic primary could end up advancing with very limited support.\nWith so many platforms for voters to consider, others have wondered whether an endorsement from Gray could shake up the race, or offer clarity for those who might be struggling to choose.\nhave wondered whether an endorsement from Gray could shake up the race, or offer clarity for those who might be struggling to choose.\nAdvertisement\nChuck Thies, Gray's spokesman, said the outgoing council member hasn't decided whether he will back a candidate, but said he's watching the debates virtually and consulting with those who have been paying close attention to the race — including Thies, who says he reports back to Gray after attending candidate events.\nThies, a longtime political consultant, said he thinks it's a contest between Rasheed, Felder, Thompson and Payne — calling the latter two candidates' first name similarities a 'disaster' of a campaign hurdle. ('The first thing people should know is my name is Eboni-Rose, not Ebony,' Thompson later told The Washington Post).\nThies called Felder the closest to an 'establishment' candidate in the field because of his previous roles in the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development and as a community relations rep for Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D). But there was a catch, he said, that has caused some trouble for him: Felder told the ACLU in a recent questionnaire that he would advocate for Congress to overturn legislation passed by the D.C. Council if he disagreed with it.\nAdvertisement\nFelder faced immediate backlash online after the ACLU's questionnaire published, creating easy fodder for critics and awkward positions for some of his baffled supporters. He sought to clarify his remark later in statements posted to social media, adding that he would first 'pursue amendments or revisions' to legislation he didn't like. 'However, if a bill's reversal is necessary to safeguard the well-being and rights of D.C. residents, I would not hesitate to urge Congress to intervene,' Wendell said in the April 7 statement.

'This action, although significant, underscores the broader issue of D.C.'s need for statehood — an issue I have tirelessly advocated for.'\nBut at the forum in Hill East a week later, Felder addressed the questionnaire once again in his closing statement: 'I just want to clear the record: under no circumstances do we support [congressional interference],' he said, adding that it was a 'reflective response to a hypothetical question.'\nOther candidates have taken shots at Payne as the race has heated up, painting her as the big-money candidate but a relative newcomer to Ward 7 politics. At a March forum, Rasheed homed in on an ad that Payne released calling for harsher penalties for people who kidnap dogs, questioning why she was focusing on dogs when people were dying; Payne said dog-nappings were traumatic for dog owners as well. Felder took aim at the ubiquity of Payne's campaign materials around the ward, questioning if her expenditures were adequately documented.\nAdvertisement\n'I think you're just upset that I'm running a better campaign than you,' Payne retorted.\nThe Hill East forum was tamer by comparison, illustrated by an area of consensus. When the 10 candidates were asked to raise their hand if they thought Bowser's fiscal 2025 budget proposal was 'good,' none of them did.\nHaving spent weeks collecting signatures and knocking on doors, candidates had no problem identifying areas of concern shared across the ward. While Ward 7's neighborhoods are somewhat less starved for commercial development than in years past, many residents are keenly aware that their economy still lags behind most other sectors of the city, from the median income to the unemployment rate, as the cost of housing has skyrocketed across the region. And the candidates have been pressed repeatedly on their proposals to drive down crime and rapidly improve traditional public schools facing declining enrollment.\nAdvertisement\nIn the 2021-2022 school year, according to data compiled by the D.C. Policy Center, less than half of all students who live in Ward 7 attended school within the ward — the lowest percentage among all eight wards. Several candidates tied the ward's literacy rates to its poor economic outcomes: According to last year's statewide assessments, just 19 percent of students in Ward 7 traditional public and charter schools are proficient in reading — compared with 71 percent in D.C.'s more affluent Ward 3.\nAsked at the Hill East candidate forum how he would try to strengthen Ward 7's schools, Brown, a former high school math teacher, said the city's leaders have spent time debating who should have control over the school system instead of focusing on needed improvements. He also said school funding levels and the allocation of resources should be determined by the individual needs of each school, community and its students — a line that drew applause.\n'I'm of the belief we should take politics out of the school system and allow our teachers, faculty, staff and administrators the opportunity and autonomy to teach what's important to our students on a daily basis,' Brown said. 'Not politicians, and not anyone else who has ulterior motives.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThompson, the school board president, has said she does not support mayoral control 'as it exists today,' believing that parents have a difficult time advocating for and resolving concerns about their children's education in the existing government structure, which does not allow the State Board of Education to change policy.\nAnd amid citywide concerns about truancy, Thompson emphasized the need for children to have safe passage to school: 'I have a lot of access to kids as the state board president, and they've told us that they actually do not feel safe traveling to school, and they used to get to do it online during the pandemic so why should they go?'\nWhen Payne, Thompson, Brown, Rasheed and Felder were asked if they supported a professional football stadium at the RFK complex, Rasheed was the only one to fully raise her hand — although she has said she would not prioritize taxpayer funds for the stadium itself. Felder equivocated, repeating a call to create a task force composed of the stadium's surrounding neighborhoods. Payne, who told residents that her opposition to an NFL stadium at RFK is 'a big reason why I'm running,' called Felder out at a separate candidate forum later that day, asserting that he hadn't been clear on his position on the stadium.\n'What I've come to know as a leader, I don't make decisions that may impact thousands of lives until I have all the facts,' Felder said in response to Payne's challenge. 'And where we are with the stadium, we're not there yet.'\nMidway through the Hill East forum, D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) grabbed a seat, hoping to get an early read on who might join him on the council.

            "summary": "MR. LYNCH: Hello, and welcome to Washington Post Live. I'm David J. Lynch, global economics correspondent here at The Post.\nToday we have two segments on American manufacturing and the emerging workforce. Later we'll hear from the president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Valerie Sheares Ashby. But first, I'm joined by Jay Timmons, the president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers.\nJay, welcome to Washington Post Live.\nMR. TIMMONS: Great to be here, David. Thanks for having me.\nMR. LYNCH: Well, we're glad you could join us.\nSo let's set the stage for how things look in manufacturing. The number of factory jobs is up almost 800,000 since President Biden took office. As a percentage of total employment, however, it's about flat. But spending on new factories has shot through the roof. It's roughly double what it was three years ago. So what's your assessment of the overall health of the American manufacturing sector right now?\nAdvertisement\nMR. TIMMONS: So David, I would say we're--you know, look, we're very strong right now. There's no question about it.\nI think it's important to put this into a historic perspective, if you will. I think back to the work that President Bush 43, and even before him, Clinton and Bush 41 and Reagan and then President Obama, the work that they did to expand our trade agreements so that we could sell more products overseas. I think of the investments that were made during the Trump administration because of those just record tax reforms that were put in place as well as the regulatory certainty. And then, of course, you fast forward to this administration, and you look at the investments that were made through the President's manufacturing strategy in terms of infrastructure investment, the CHIPS and Science Act, and many provisions of the IRA. All of that has led to a place today where manufacturing is stronger than we've seen it in more than a generation.\nAnd, in fact, you referenced the number of manufacturing workers that are out there today. It's the highest number since 2008. The sector is seeing record investment in new plants and equipment, and you've also seen record wage growth. That's all because of these policies that were put in place by administrations of different political stripes. Now our challenge is to maintain this momentum that we have and ensure that America continues to lead the world economically and certainly leads the world through manufacturing prowess.\nAdvertisement\nMR. LYNCH: Well, that's a perfect segue into a question from one of our viewers. Anthony Vance from Washington, D.C., asks, 'Is the surge in manufacturing a temporary phenomenon largely stimulated by government policies instituted in the last three years, or is it likely to remain with us for a decade or so?'\nMR. TIMMONS: Well, I guess the answer to that is yes to both of those questions, Anthony, depending on what public policies are put into place.\nI mentioned this continuum that we've seen, this focus by both political parties, which is great, on growing the manufacturing economy here in the United States and making manufacturing even stronger. But we have some choices to make. We're at a crossroads. There's no question about that, and those choices, they all relate back to all of those issues that I've mentioned. And I would add one other, which I'll get to in a second.\nAdvertisement\nBut you have tax policy that has expired in terms of our ability to really prioritize innovation through the research and development tax deduction, interest deductibility, and immediate expensing. Those three things alone contribute to a significant amount of manufacturing investment here in the United States, and the fact that that has ceased to exist in the last couple of years and we're waiting for Congress to renew those incentives, it's chilling future manufacturing investment--or current and future manufacturing investment.\nThen you have the tax reforms of 2017 that are up for discussion and action in 2025, and those are specifically the rates for small- and medium-sized manufacturers who file as S-corporations. Those rates expire at the end of 2025. And what I fear is that there will be politicians, probably of both political stripes, who are trying to appease a very important part of their constituency and a very important part of the manufacturing economy, small businesses, by saying, well, why don't we just capitulate on the C-corp rate and raise that a few percentage points so that we can keep the rate low for small and medium manufacturers? And I say that is a losing strategy. You've got to have competitive rates across the board, and right now we're at 21 percent at the C-corp level. We need to maintain that. We also have to get--and in the promo video, the initial video, David, that you ran, it said that I argued against--I'm arguing against additional regulation. That's not quite accurate.\nI'm arguing actually for smart regulation, and that means business and government sitting down together to talk about what the possibilities are. We all agree on what the issues are before us, whether it's lowering carbon intensity or making sure that our drinking water is safe and our air is cleaner and our communities are healthier for our children and our grandchildren, but you can't just be aspirational about what your objectives are. You have to be very pragmatic and level-headed, and you have to understand what is possible in the world today as well as what will be possible in the world tomorrow. And then that goes right back to those incentives like the research and development tax deduction. If you want to innovate here in America, you've got to have all of those tools.\nAdvertisement\nI would also add that it's important to have trade agreements. We haven't negotiated one for over 10 years.\nAnd then, lastly, I would say it's extraordinarily important, Anthony, that we have the workforce that we need to fill the jobs that are open. We have almost 600,000 open jobs in manufacturing today. We're doing really well. But by the year 2033, we're going to need to fill 3.8 million jobs in our sector because of retirements or growth in our sector, and if things keep going the way they are, it's going to be about 1.9 million of those jobs that we can't fill. That's not sustainable. That doesn't allow us to be the leader in the world.\nMR. LYNCH: Let's--I want to--I want to talk about the administration's industrial policies, which are, at least in part, in good part, probably, responsible for some of this manufacturing uptick, which is the good news.\nAdvertisement\nMR. TIMMONS: No question.\nMR. LYNCH: But this sort of government-directed steering of the economy or steering of capital represents a big change from the market-oriented policies that we've seen in recent decades. Are you uncomfortable at all with the notion of government getting bigger and more involved in the economy?\nMR. TIMMONS: So I don't think there's any pure system when it comes to a free market economy, David. I think--you know, I think you have to be, again, pragmatic.\nThe fact is that China, sure, they're an economic competitor, and, you know, we can--we can deal with that if we were dealing with a level playing field and they were truly a free market economy, but they're not. They're a command economy. They manipulate. They manipulate markets. They manipulate how products are made.\nAdvertisement\nBut even more important than that is our national security interests. So, for instance, CHIPS and Science, that legislation that passed that provided billions of dollars of grants to incentivize chip fab facilities being built here in the United States, that was absolutely critical for our national security. We could not allow these devices to be made in the country where we may not always have the ability to have decent relations.\nSo I was pleased from a national security perspective that we invested there, but it also adds to our economic security, because everything today, as we all know, has some sort of an electronic component or a chip in its manufacture, in its body. So we have to have that capability here as well as some of the other investments, I think, that have been really important for ensuring our worldwide mantle of leadership.\nMR. LYNCH: Now, many of these industrial policy projects that the administration is promoting are in the clean energy space aimed at addressing climate change. Many of them are located, as you know, in so-called \"red states,\" where Republican lawmakers often have voted against the legislation that has created the projects in the first place. So what do you think is the likelihood that that kind of work, that kind of funding would survive a change in administrations?\nAdvertisement\nMR. TIMMONS: Well, to the best of my understanding, a lot of these--a lot of these grants and loans are going to be moving very quickly. The administration is trying to move them through the process very quickly.\nBut, you know, I'd like to take the politics maybe out of some of--some of these discussions. Yes, there are philosophical disagreements on how we're enacting some of these policies that are part of the president's manufacturing strategy, but ultimately, we all have the same goal. And the same goal is for the United States to be the leader, for the United States to grow its manufacturing base, and for the United States to be able to increase the number of workers in the manufacturing sector, because, quite frankly, manufacturing has led to a stronger and healthier quality of life and economic status for Americans all across the board. And politicians of both parties understand that.\nThey might look at things a little bit differently, right? So you may see--you may see some elected officials say, well, let's have a program where we can spend money, and you might have others say, well, let's have a program where you can incentivize through tax policy. I think either of those can work, and we can debate all day about which one is more effective or which one is more free market oriented. But ultimately, we all want to get to the same objective.\nAdvertisement\nMR. LYNCH: You mentioned earlier the need for smart regulation. I'd be interested if you could provide sort of your favorite example of a grossly misguided regulation that puts burdens on your members that would strike the audience as almost ludicrous, not something that's a minor irritant that might take just a little bit more paperwork but something that you think is just obviously counterproductive and ought to be eliminated.\nMR. TIMMONS: Well, you want to make this really dramatic, it seems, so I--[laughs].\nMR. LYNCH: No, I want to--I want to give--I'm giving you a chance to--\nMR. TIMMONS: Yeah, I understand.\nMR. LYNCH: --help explain to viewers what changes you need to see.\nMR. TIMMONS: Yeah. Let me start with a positive because I think--I think--and then I'll get to a specific regulation that answers your question.\nOn the positive side, I can point to the Securities and Exchange Commission and their work about two years ago to introduce a climate emissions regulation that was going to be imposed on all businesses of all sizes. We had some real concerns with that proposal, because in the end, we couldn't comply. There was literally no way to comply with that regulation. This was an example of a regulatory agency, regulators, and the business community collaborating, talking, discussing what the goals and objectives are from the regulatory side or the regulator side of the aisle, and what the possibilities were and the realities were from the business side. And in the end, David, the SEC literally addressed every single thing that we said was problematic. So that's an example of how you can work together.\nNow, we don't love that regulation. Let me just be very clear about that. But it's a regulation that I think is at least achievable, and the agency listened. The other side of that is the particulate matter, PM2.5 regulation that was issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, which is--you know, it is onerous for manufacturers and actually is counter to what the president is trying to achieve through his manufacturing strategy. What the PM2.5 regulation will do, quite simply, is it will shut down the ability of businesses to invest and build new facilities in many communities across this country. It's going to cause mayors and governors to make a choice between, say, building a bridge that might be available or might be possible through the infrastructure funding legislation that was passed or having the private sector come in and build a new chips facility. These choices are going to be--these tradeoffs are going to be present very soon. That regulation is now in place, and it's going to cause a lot of very difficult decisions, and it's going to impede growth. It's going to impede the ability of manufacturers who could actually help solve the climate issue, to build facilities and innovate and create new products, to be a part of the solution. So it's one of those regulations that, frankly, is just not smart.\nMR. LYNCH: Now, you mentioned permitting issues a bit earlier, and that's been a perennial complaint for years. There was some movement, I think, at one point last year. There was a brief glimmer of hope for improvement that, I think, faded away. Are you at all optimistic about anything changing in that regard, say, in this calendar year, or is that inevitably something that gets pushed over to a new administration or the next administration?\nMR. TIMMONS: I am always an optimist, and on this, I am really optimistic. And the reason I am, David, is because Republicans and Democrats have both indicated--or they have all indicated to me that they're very concerned about the permitting process.\nIf you think about it, again, from the business perspective, where you want to put that shovel in the ground, but it's taking years for a permit to be able to do so, whether that's because of state agencies or federal agencies, and then you have--think about the clean energy investments that the administration is making right now, we simply can't get things built because of the lack of a streamlined permitting process.\nAnd then also think about if we're--if we're talking about our competition with China and China's ability to produce and mine critical minerals for many of those batteries and clean energy technologies that we're trying to employ here in the United States, but our inability to do so here because it takes 15 years to get a mine permitted, 15 years from now, I'm sorry, but China will have the advantage.\nSo we've got to figure out how to make sure that we are protecting safety, we're protecting environmental standards, but moving the process along much more quickly. And I would say also coordinating the various agencies that have to sign off on permits, coordinating their work, so that you have one--you know, one timeline rather than, say, 10 timelines, because you have 10 agencies that are part of the process.\nMR. LYNCH: Now, the unemployment rate remains quite low by historical standards, still plenty of job openings out there. What's the labor market look like for your members? Are they having trouble finding enough workers? And is that going to be a choke point, particularly for some of these projects in the chip world, where I think some of the efforts out in Arizona by TMSC have already run into snags in terms of the availability of skilled labor?\nMR. TIMMONS: Yeah, it is definitely a problem. As I mentioned, we have almost 600,000 jobs open in our sector.\nI'm really proud of our industry, though, because there are, of course, many open jobs throughout the entire economy. I don't know what it is now, eight-, nine-, ten million open jobs. But I'm proud of our industry because they took it head on, and they are continuing to do so. Not only are they upskilling and training the workers that are part of their--part of their employee base now so that those jobs are future-proofed as new technologies come on board, but they've also invested in programs to recruit the next generation of manufacturing workers.\nHere at the NAM, we had a campaign called Creators Wanted, and Creators Wanted went to communities all over the country to inspire young people with a--kind of a hands-on escape room concept to show them what skills are necessary in manufacturing. And, David, you could just see these young people come out beaming and saying, \"I want to be a part of manufacturing. How can I do this?\"\nWe went to my hometown of Circleville, Ohio, for the Circleville Pumpkin Show. We had thousands of kids going through that experience and coming out and saying, \"I want a job,\" and that's really important, because in central Ohio, you have two very big investments. You have the Honda and LG battery facility that's being created in the Mount Sterling area, and then you have the Intel facility that I was happy to attend the groundbreaking of with President Biden in the Columbus area. And those two plants alone are going to hire thousands and thousands of people.\nSo we've got an obligation, right, as the industry to take this on, but making sure that we have the right educational tools in place at the local level and having states work with us, which many are doing to ensure that we have the technical training that's necessary, that's important as well.\nMR. LYNCH: Yep. Well, Jay, I've still got several more questions for you, but unfortunately, we are out of time. So thanks for a great conversation. Jay Timmons, thanks for joining us today.\nMR. TIMMONS: Thanks for having me, David.\nMR. LYNCH: Next up, we'll hear from the President of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Valerie Sheares Ashby, right after this. So please stay with us.\n[Video plays]\nMR. ETZWILER: Hi. I'm David Etzwiler, CEO of the Siemens Foundation. Last fall, the Siemens Foundation created an EV charging workforce initiative called Everyone Charging Forward. Because the electric vehicle charging sector is experiencing rapid growth, there is and will be for the foreseeable future a significant need for workers in EV manufacturing, installation, and maintenance. What we recognized was a confluence of need and opportunity to draw more people from all backgrounds into this growing industry, and that's really what this initiative is all about, working together with our government, business, labor, philanthropy, and community partners to ensure everyone, especially those from underserved communities, has access to resources that can connect them to clean energy careers.\nHere with me today is Cheryl Sanford, director of Workforce Programming, MUST Careers, in Detroit, Michigan, which is developing a career readiness program with a heavy focus on the electrical field.\nHi, Cheryl. How are you?\nMS. SANFORD: I'm doing well, David. Thank you for having the conversation today.\nMR. ETZWILER: Absolutely, my pleasure.\nCheryl, MUST works with the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program, one of the foundation's partners, implementing statewide strategies and local partnerships. Tell us more about EVITP's and MUST's Electric Fast Track program and how it operates.\nMS. SANFORD: Thank you. I'm really excited about this new initiative in partnership with Siemens.\nThe program is really twofold, the purpose of the program is twofold. One is to upskill the current electricians with the EVITP training and certification, and that's for electricians that will be working on the EV charging installation projects going on all over the country.\nThe second part of the program--and this is really something that's new. It's only been piloted in--well, in our experience, we've piloted this program once in Michigan, and that is to provide a work-based learning opportunity for individuals who are thinking maybe they want a career in EV electrical industry but lack that hands-on experience. So this is an opportunity to provide career awareness and some of the hands-on experience that we always hear from our contractors. You know, when we're trying to help individuals make that connection and get into building trades, especially electrical, they lack the hands-on experience. So this is an opportunity to do that with a 10-week paid work experience component that will really take individuals who have had some classroom training and provide them with the kind of work-based learning, hands-on experience. So they'll get to work alongside journeyworker electricians and really decide if this is the best fit for them.\nMR. ETZWILER: Cheryl, that's great background. Help us understand the current demographic makeup of the electrical field and the future of the sector. Why the focus on new entrants?\nMS. SANFORD: Because we know over the foreseeable future that we are going to need more electricians, based on the historic investment in infrastructure in the country, which is fantastic.\nBut we know, for example, in the state of Michigan, that between now and 2030, we will need approximately 13.5 percent increase in electricians. In North Carolina, which is the other area where we will be piloting the program, the demand is expected to increase up to 17 percent.\nMR. ETZWILER: Wow.\nMS. SANFORD: And we know just looking at the demographics, again, in the state of Michigan, when you look at construction overall, less than 6 percent of the construction apprentices are females, approximately 17 percent for people of color, and for youth, it's less than 1 percent. So all of this investment provides a historic opportunity for us to really expand the pipeline of talent and to be more inclusive and diverse and to do it in a very intentional way. So we want to make sure that we are reaching out to those previously underserved populations to make sure that they are included, and the fact is that more and more of the skilled electricians are retiring.\nSo according to the National Electrical Contractors Association, approximately 10,000 electricians--this is nationwide, but 10,000 electricians retire every year. About 7,000 are coming in. So we--you know, we know that there's a gap, and again, that provides an opportunity for programs like the Electric Fast Track to fill that need and to reach out to those individuals who probably never thought they could work in this field. They never even thought about it. So with career exploration outreach, it just gives us an opportunity to be much more inclusive.\nMR. ETZWILER: Yeah. So much urgency in the statistics you give. What are the partnership trends or best practices that you're seeing around the country? What, for example, is necessary and helpful in these types of partnerships in local communities?\nMS. SANFORD: Well, we know from the work that we've done in this space, and MUST and EVITP have worked together for a long time working on providing those kind of programming opportunities for the building trades industry. And what we've learned is that industry engagement is key, and those partnerships are really key to the successful outcomes of this kind of program. So if we don't have industry at the table, then we're just training for the sake of training. We want to make sure that every participant who goes through this program will have a successful outcome, hopefully employment in the industry in a registered apprenticeship, and if by chance they decide after 10 weeks of working in the Electric Fast Track that this just isn't a good fit for you--maybe you've decided, you know, you thought you wanted to be an electrician, but you really don't--we have workforce development partners, community-based partners. And this provides an opportunity for us to redirect them back through the system.\nSo, you know, we don't want it to be a failure for someone because you decided you don't want to work in the construction industry or in the electrical industry. Our goal is to help those individuals find the occupation that is a better fit for them.\nMR. ETZWILER: That's great, Cheryl. That's a wonderful overview of all of that.\nAnd if I had to underline one takeaway from today's discussion, it's the importance of business, labor, and communities coming together to engage and support new and diverse entrants in the clean economy workforce. It's the right thing to do, and it's imperative to the success of our country's decarbonization, economic, and security goals. We simply must ensure participation by everyone in our economy.\nCheryl, thank you for being here today and for the insightful conversation. I look forward to our continued partnership, and with that, I'll turn it back to the Washington Post.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nMS. SANFORD: Thank you.\n[Video plays]\nMR. LYNCH: Hello, and welcome back. For those just tuning in, I'm David J. Lynch, global economics correspondent here at The Post.\nI'm joined now by Valerie Sheares Ashby, president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Valerie, welcome to Washington Post Live.\nDR. ASHBY: Thank you so much. It's a pleasure to be here.\nMR. LYNCH: Well, we're glad to have you with us.\nNow, for any of our viewers who may not be familiar with UMBC and its historical role, its traditional role as an enormous pipeline of Black graduates in the STEM fields, perhaps you could just take a moment and educate us all. In particular, what was the opportunity that attracted you to the school a couple of years ago, and how do you plan to build on its already impressive legacy?\nDR. ASHBY: Well, I so appreciate that question. This is the question that energizes me daily.\nSo I'm really proud of UMBC. So for those who may not be familiar, UMBC is located in this Baltimore County area, which is very close to Washington, D.C., obviously, and so we are situated in a place where we have industry around us, we have government agencies around us, where the STEM workforce that they need is just tremendous. And we're also situated, obviously, in the state of Maryland that is very diverse, and so we are a public institution. It is our job to actually educate the Marylanders first and provide this workforce that is needed, and UMBC has been a leader for decades in this space.\nWe produce--we're number one in the production of Black undergraduates in the fields of the life sciences, mathematics, and computer science combined. That's quite a feat for us. And we produce these students, and they go on to do amazing things, not only in the state of Maryland but all over the country.\nWe're also the number one producer of Black graduates who go on to get MD-PhDs. So now they are scholar researchers in medicine, and so we're really proud of that. That has been our history.\nAnd I would just note that the goal is just to produce excellent scholars, and it turns out that when you actually have a goal of producing excellent scholars, you become more inclusive.\nAnd so for UMBC, part of what we say in our vision statement, in the very first sentence, is that we are not going to call ourselves excellent if we're not inclusive, and so that really then has been the impetus for everything that we do for years. And so we have now achieved this status, and it has become a part of our culture that we just expect all of our students to be excellent. And underrepresented minority students, in particular, are just thriving in this environment.\nAnd by the way, that's what drew me here. I am a chemist by training, as you know. So to come to an institution with this history and at this moment for our country, we really need to continue to do what we're doing, and we not only need us to do it, but we need all of higher education to really take this on as a priority.\nMR. LYNCH: Well, first of all, I promise not to ask you any questions about chemistry. That would be a\nshort conversation, at least on this side of the camera.\nDR. ASHBY: [Laughs] If I had a blackboard, I'd draw some organic chemistry formulas behind me, but, okay, not this time.\n[Laughter]\nMR. LYNCH: Not this time.\nSo Black students, in general, of course, are underrepresented in the sciences but not at your institution. So what's your secret? What should other universities be doing that they're not doing if they wanted to replicate your success?\nDR. ASHBY: So, you know, we can look back and really understand and learn, you know, some best practices that aren't rocket science, which that's the good news. It's not rocket science. Literally, anybody who has the desire can do this.\nAnd so what we have learned, mostly as a start from our Meyerhoff Scholars Program, which is nationally known, is that if you give students the opportunity, you give them the support, you give them a cohort, you give them the encouragement, you give them the opportunity to do research and to see themselves as scientists, then you really have given them everything that they need. And those students become successful. They get the highest grades in our courses. They go on to do internships and great research, and they go on to get PhDs and MDs and MD-PhDs. And so it's about this culture where our expectation is that our students will be successful, and so it is not about remedial anything. They're quite capable. The question is, are we giving them all the opportunities and the support in order to be successful in these disciplines? So that's the way we have approached this.\nMR. LYNCH: Let's talk a little bit about national policy now. I don't know if you caught our earlier segment, but we were talking a little bit about the Biden administration's industrial policies, particularly in the area of semiconductors, clean renewable energies, and the like. What's your assessment of the outlook for producing the size, skilled workforce that we're going to need to make those programs a success, and do you see that--those areas as an opportunity for your future graduates?\nDR. ASHBY: Without a doubt. These are the areas that we are training our students. It is the basic sciences. It is engineering. It's the social sciences. It's the fullness of the liberal arts education that's rooted in STEM. So absolutely, our students are qualified now and will be qualified for emerging technologies.\nThe other piece to this is that we are very clear about giving our students--I heard in a previous--in the previous segment--hands-on opportunities as a part of that preparation.\nSo for example, you were talking to Jay, who was mentioning about--talking about manufacturing. There, we have real digitized manufacturing facilities on this campus where students can now understand cybersecurity threats in relationship to digitized manufacturing, and not only that, we are upscaling those who are actually in the manufacturing fields, where these are professionals who come onto our campus. And they are allowed to now--they can upscale and really understand the connection between cybersecurity and manufacturing. And so it's a combination of tools that we are using to prepare our students, and we absolutely have students that are so well prepared. And the question is, how many more can we produce?\nMR. LYNCH: Now, artificial intelligence is obviously a topic that everyone in business and government and your neighborhood is talking about these days, and there seem to be broadly two views of it in a labor market context. Mark Cuban, I saw, quoted the other day, saying that the disruption we're going to experience in the next several years will dwarf anything we've seen in past technological changes.\nAt the same time, David Autor of MIT, who's a very well-known economist who popularized the term \"China shock\" in regard to the effect on unskilled labor in this country from the rise of China's manufacturing power, he's actually quite optimistic about the effects of AI. He says it may, in fact, revitalize the middle class. I'm curious what your view is, as someone who's in the field. Should we be worried about this from a labor market standpoint, or is it mostly upside?\nDR. ASHBY: So I would have to say to you, first of all, that I am an optimist, and as a scientist, new technology does not scare me. And I understand all of the downsides and the possibilities for people who--look, anytime you have new technology, people can use it for bad or they can use it for good, and so it's our job to actually train our students in order--so that they will be able to use the technologies for good. So it does not scare me.\nAnd also, I should just mention that not everybody needs a college degree. Let me just say that. So when we talk about the workforce that's going to be needed, it's going to be a number of college-educated students. It's going to be a number of students who have advanced degrees. But it's also going to be people who are going to community colleges or people who have high school diplomas who just have the skill set.\nSo we have an opportunity to have an impact on the education from high school all the way through an advanced terminal degree, and so with that kind of optimism, I'm confident that we can upscale a workforce that is broad. And also, by the way, I should mention this is why universities that educate their students in a liberal arts fashion are so important, because we will not only teach our students the science, but we will teach them the ethics. And that's critical for what we are talking about whether you--and by the way, we need to do that in high school and middle school and every other place. But that's why I am optimistic.\nI see our students. They are brilliant. They want to use this technology for good, and that gives me hope every day.\nMR. LYNCH: I think that last remark about liberal arts deserves a moment, because I think some people see a sharp choice between what they regard as meaningful, career-focused endeavors like the STEM fields, and then liberal arts, which is regarded as some sort of playground of listening to music and going to plays. But it's really much more than that, isn't it? It's about learning how to think and learning where ideas come from and learning the history even of scientific thought.\nDR. ASHBY: Yes, without a doubt. And so this is a place where we are not delivering a full education, if it is not a full liberal arts and sciences education. It is all of those disciplines that you just mentioned.\nBut just think about any of these scientific fields, and think about how you are going to apply that in a community where you don't understand their history. You don't understand the challenges. You don't understand the environment. You don't understand the culture. So we can produce all sorts of wonderful technologies, but communities may not adopt them or they may not trust our science if we don't understand how to enter communities and how to engage them as a part of the scientific process. So this is really important.\nAnd let me just throw in a little bit of data, because I know sometimes people say, oh, anecdotally, people love a liberal arts education. Ninety-two percent of my undergraduates walk out of this institution either going into employment or into graduate school, and 93 percent of them, of my undergraduates who have--with a college degree finished their four-year degree, are in disciplines that they studied. And so I just, you know--the talk about a liberal arts education and music and art and all those things and that's all you do--and let me just also say, I think it's a little bit of a matter of the mental health and well-being of our entire world.\nPeople need a whole life, and a whole life includes music and art and understanding religion and culture and the environment, all of those things, and there's something that happens in communities when people are happy. And so when you just think about just the ways that we don't even know how to have conversations with each other anymore, not just about STEM-related issues, but about anything--so I'm a real fan of a liberal arts and sciences education. I am a chemist, but I treasure my religion class and my philosophy class and my writing course and my communications courses. So it's a full package.\nMR. LYNCH: Now, UMBC obviously remains quite affordable, but colleges across the country are under pressure, deservedly so, for rising costs. There's a lot of frustration about tuition bills, and you hear a lot of voices saying, you know, with it being just so expensive, you know, college just isn't worth it anymore. What would you say to those folks, even acknowledging that, you know, college is not necessarily for everybody? But what do you say to folks who say it's just gotten way out of hand how expensive it is?\nDR. ASHBY: So several things. So first, let me say I am delighted to be in the University System of Maryland, which is a public system in the state of Maryland, and our costs in public higher education in the state of Maryland are, you know, relatively reasonable compared to many other institutions across the country.\nThat being said, there literally is not a single other game changer in a person's life that's more significant than a college education. It changes our health. It changes our communities. It changes our service. It changes the way we engage the political system. It changes everything that makes a life full.\nAnd for people particularly who come from economically challenged backgrounds, there is no greater game changer than a college degree, and so this is critical for us to state.\nNow, I do appreciate all of the talk about how expensive it is. Indeed, it can be. Even at our reasonable cost, it can seem expensive. Therefore, it's incumbent upon us to actually make it more accessible. So whether that's through increased need-based financial aid or various types of scholarships, it is important for us to make it available to students. It changes their lives. It changes their families' lives for generations. It changes communities. But it's our job in higher education to make our case and so to really help families understand the difference maker that this is.\nMR. LYNCH: Now, the Supreme Court last year severely limited the use of affirmative action and race in college admissions. How are universities adjusting to this change? How worried are you that that's going to be a further headwind working against efforts to increase minority representation in the STEM fields in particular?\nDR. ASHBY: So let me speak just about UMBC, and then maybe I can speak about it more broadly. I'm really proud. I go back to your original question of why I decided to come to UMBC and what drew me here.\nThis is an institution that, again, has understood that if you are not inclusive, you cannot be excellent. So when you think about STEM fields where we're talking about innovation and creativity, you need diverse teams of people from diverse backgrounds, diverse disciplines. All of that is necessary to be as creative and innovative as possible, and so for UMBC, this is not a challenge for us because we are simply looking for excellence. And by doing so, we are actually very inclusive, and so we have a campus that looks like our community, which is a beautiful thing.\nAnd so for me, this is just rooted in excellence. If we don't have multiple perspectives at the table and in the creation process and in the problem-solving process and the solution-making process, then we cannot be excellent.\nSo for us, it is not a challenge. If you walk across our campus, it looks like our community. It looks like the world, and because of that, students are getting a phenomenal education.\nNow, if you were actually using quotas to just check the box, to say that we have some diversity on our campus, you have a problem, because now you have to decide how serious are you about that, and do you really think you can be excellent without it?\nNow, that's--I'm glad that's not our question. It is not. But for universities and maybe some other institutions where it wasn't a priority, because you didn't really believe that excellence equaled diversity or diversity equaled excellence, now this is a challenge.\nAnd so I would say that my students who sit in a classroom, whether it's in the social sciences or humanities or natural sciences and they sit in that classroom with a diverse group of students to discuss hard, challenging topics, they are receiving a world-class education. And so it's a challenge for us in higher education to decide, do we really believe you can be excellent without diversity or not? And at UMBC, that's not our question.\nMR.

            "summary": "NEW YORK — American workers expect to retire at a median age of 65, according to a 2023 survey from the Employee Benefit Research Institute, or EBRI. But the actual median age for retirement is 62, the survey found.\nThat may not seem like a big gap, but if you retire three years earlier than planned, that's three fewer years of savings and three more years of retirement to fund.\nThis could happen for all sorts of reasons: You (or your partner or your parents) could get sick or disabled, there could be changes at your company, or you could simply burn out on the job. Forty-six percent of retirees exit the workforce sooner than they had planned, according to the EBRI survey, and of those, 35% say they did so due to a hardship (like health issues or disability).\nLiz Windisch, a certified financial planner in Denver, has two clients who were laid off in their early 60s and who both ended up retiring. 'They looked for a couple of years and finally just gave up,' Windisch says. 'It is more likely than not that you won't get to work as long as you're planning.'\nAdvertisement\nWith this in mind, it's helpful to prepare financially for an earlier retirement, even if you plan to work forever. Here are some moves that will help.\nSAVE AGGRESSIVELY\nThe more you can save now, the less you'll be pressed if you can't work as long as you'd like. Be realistic about how much you'll need to maintain the lifestyle you want.\nAshley Folkes, a CFP in Hoover, Alabama, has clients test-drive living on less for a month or two to see what it might be like in retirement. 'A lot of them realize that they really can't get by, or they don't want to have to lower their standard of living to that degree,' he says. 'It reinforces the fact that they need to save more money now.'\nOnce you're 50 or older, you can make catch-up contributions to your retirement accounts. In 2024, you can contribute an extra $7,500 to your 401(k) and an extra $1,000 to a traditional or Roth IRA. If you're 55 or older, you can also put an extra $1,000 into a health savings account, or HSA, if you have access to one.\nAdvertisement\nAVOID LIFESTYLE CREEP\nIf you bump up spending every time you get a raise, you're making it more expensive to maintain your lifestyle later. Rather than buying a bigger house, consider paying off your mortgage instead, says Michael Hausknost, a CFP in Long Beach, California.\n'Don't think (that) just because you can afford to buy a $100,000 car that you have to buy a $100,000 car,' Hausknost says. 'Live below your means.'\nFolkes notes that clients expand their spending to match their new paycheck but don't boost their savings rate accordingly. 'You've got to show them they've got to live off about 40% of this inflated lifestyle,' he says.\nINCLUDE HEALTH CARE IN YOUR SAVINGS GOAL\nUnless you've got retirement health benefits or a spouse who's still working, retiring before 65 means paying for your own health insurance until you're eligible for Medicare. This can be done, but you should account for it in your savings plan.\nAdvertisement\nDonnie LaGrange, a CFP in Dallas, estimates that a couple should expect to spend at least $15,000 a year on a health insurance policy that covers both of them before age 65. If someone retires early without taking this expense into account, he says, 'it can really drain the portfolio.'\nPRIORITIZE RETIREMENT OVER COLLEGE\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nDon't skimp on retirement savings in favor of funding your child's education. You can finance college — but you're on your own for your golden years.\n'We are so focused typically, as parents, to provide for our kids' education that we abandon all logic and common sense,' Hausknost says. 'You have to first be taking care of yourself.'\nFolkes has worked with clients who want to retire at a certain age but pull six-figure amounts out of their portfolios to pay for college for their children. 'I've had to have those tough conversations with clients,' he says. 'That's a big chunk of money for a lot of people, plus the fact that it doesn't have the ability to compound over the years.'\nAdvertisement\nRUN THE NUMBERS\nIf you're guessing whether you'll have enough money if you have to leave the workforce earlier than planned, get a checkup from a financial professional to be sure. You might be OK saving 10% a year, or you might find that you should be putting away 20% (or more) a year, plus trimming expenses.\nSome financial planners will charge by the hour or charge a flat fee for a snapshot financial plan or basic financial consultation. If your situation isn't overly complicated, you could expect to pay $500 to $1,500 for the service.\n'It's better to find out early,' Windisch says. 'Spend that money and course-correct while you still have the opportunity. Investing in your future is worth it.'\n_______________\nThis column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

            "excerpt": "The Biden administration finalized sweeping Title IX rules barring discrimination against transgender students and ordering a new system for sexual assault claims.",
            "summary": "The Biden administration on Friday finalized sweeping new rules barring schools from discriminating against transgender students and ordering significant changes for how schools adjudicate claims of sexual harassment and assault on campus.\nThe provisions regarding gender identity are the most politically fraught, setting up an election-year culture clash with conservative states and school boards that have limited transgender rights in schools, banned discussion of gender identity in classrooms and removed books with LGBTQ+ themes. Mindful of the politics, the administration is delaying action on the contentious issue of whether transgender girls and women should be allowed to compete in women's and girls' sports.\nThe long-awaited regulation represents the administration's interpretation of Title IX, a 1972 law that bars sex discrimination in schools that receive federal funding. Title IX is best known for ushering in equal treatment for women in sports, but it also governs how schools handle complaints of sexual harassment and assault, a huge issue on many college campuses.\nAdvertisement\nNow the Biden administration is deploying the regulation to formalize its long-standing view that sex discrimination includes discrimination based on gender identity as well as sexual orientation, a direct challenge to conservative policies across the country.\nTen states, for instance, require transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their biological sex identified at birth, according to tracking by the Movement Advancement Project. Some school districts will not use the pronouns corresponding with a trans student's gender identity. Both situations might constitute violations of Title IX under the new regulation. In addition, if a school failed to properly address bullying based on gender identity or sexual orientation, that, too, could be a violation of federal law.\n'No one should face bullying or discrimination just because of who they are or who they love. Sadly, this happens all too often,' Education Secretary Miguel Cardona told reporters in a conference call.\nAdvertisement\nThe Education Department's Office for Civil Rights investigates allegations of sex discrimination, among other things, and schools that fail to come into compliance risk losing federal funding. A senior administration official said that the office could investigate cases where schools were potentially discriminating, even if they were following their own state's law.\nThe final regulation also includes provisions barring discrimination based on pregnancy, including childbirth, abortion and lactation. For instance, schools must accommodate students' need to attend medical appointments, as well as provide students and workers who are nursing a clean, private space to pump milk.\nThe combination of these two issues — sexual assault and transgender rights — drew enormous public interest, with some 240,000 public comments submitted in response to the proposed version published in 2022. The new rules take effect Aug. 1, in time for the start of next school year.\nAdvertisement\nThe final regulation unravels a Trump-era system for handling sexual assault complaints, discarding some of the rules that bolstered due process rights of the accused. Supporters said those rules were critical to ensuring that students had the opportunity to defend themselves; critics said they discouraged sexual assault survivors from reporting incidents and turned colleges into quasi-courtrooms.\nEducation Department officials said they had retained the elements that made sense but created a better overall framework that gave equal treatment and balanced the rights of all involved. 'A fair process will help ensure that investigations lead to accurate, reliable and effective resolution of sex discrimination complaints,' Cardona said.\nUnder the Trump administration's regulation, finalized in 2020, colleges were required to stage live hearings to adjudicate complaints, where the accused could cross-examine witnesses — including the students who were alleging assault. Supporters said that live hearings were critical to ascertaining what actually happened when facts are contested, but others argued cross-examination could retraumatize assault survivors.\nAdvertisement\nUnder the new Biden rules, colleges will have more flexibility. The investigator or person adjudicating the case may question witnesses in separate meetings or employ a live hearing.\nThe new rules also will allow schools to use a lower bar for adjudicating guilt. In weighing evidence, they are now directed to use a 'preponderance of the evidence' standard, though they may opt for a higher standard of 'clear and convincing evidence' if they use that standard in other similar proceedings. Under the Trump version, universities had a choice, but they were required to use the higher standard if they did so in other settings.\nThe proposal also expands the definition of what constitutes sexual harassment, discarding a narrower definition used under President Donald Trump, and broadens who on campus has a responsibility to respond to allegations.\nAdvertisement\nSome of the Trump provisions were retained. Schools, for instance, will continue to have the option to use informal resolution of discrimination complaints, unless the allegation involves an employee of a K-12 school.\nThe Biden administration's approach was welcomed by advocates for sexual assault survivors.\nThe rules 'will make schools safer and more accessible for young people, many of whom experienced irreparable harm while they fought for protection and support,' said Emma Grasso Levine, senior manager of Title IX policy and programs at Know Your IX, a project of the advocacy group Advocates for Youth.\n'Now, it's up to school administrators to act quickly to implement and enforce' the new rules, she added.\nSexual assault has been a serious issue on college campuses for years, and in releasing the regulation, the Biden administration said the rates were still 'unacceptably high.'\nAdvertisement\nBut the most controversial element of the regulation involves the rights of transgender students, and it came under immediate fire.\nAdministration officials point to a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that sex discrimination in employment includes gender identity and sexual orientation to bolster their interpretation of the law. But conservatives contend that Title IX does not include these elements and argue that accommodations for transgender students can create situations that put other students at risk. They object, for instance, to having a transgender woman — someone they refer to as a 'biological man' — using women's bathrooms or locker rooms.\nRep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), chairwoman of the House Education Committee, called the regulation an escalation of Democrats' 'contemptuous culture war that aims to radically redefine sex and gender.' The department, she said, has put decades of advancement for women and girls 'squarely on the chopping block.'\n'Evidently, the acceptance of biological reality, and the faithful implementation of the law, are just pills too big for the Department to swallow — and it shows,' she said in a statement.\nAdvertisement\nStill, the administration sidestepped the contentious issue of athletics, at least for now. A separate regulation governing how and when schools may exclude transgender students from women and girls teams remains under review, and administration officials offered no timetable for when it would be finalized. People familiar with their thinking said it was being delayed to avoid injecting the matter into the presidential campaign, where President Biden faces a close race against Trump.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nA senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in a briefing with reporters Thursday, declined to comment on the politics of this decision but noted that the athletics rule was proposed after the main Title IX regulation.\nPolling shows that clear majorities of Americans, including a sizable slice of Democrats, oppose allowing transgender athletes to compete on girls' and women's teams. Twenty-five states have statewide bans on their participation.\nAdvertisement\nThe proposed sports regulation disallows these statewide, blanket bans, but it allows school districts to restrict participation more narrowly defined — for instance on competitive high school or college teams. The main Title IX regulation does not address the issue, and an administration official said the status quo would remain. Still, some have argued that the new general ban on discrimination could apply to sports even though the administration does not intend it to.\nThe rules governing how campuses deal with harassment complaints have changed repeatedly in recent years.\nThe Obama administration issued detailed guidance in 2014 for schools in handling complaints, but that was later tossed out by Trump Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Her department went through its own laborious rulemaking process to put a new system in place.\nAs a candidate for president in 2020, Biden promised to put a 'quick end' to that version if elected, saying it gave colleges 'a green light to ignore sexual violence and strip survivors of their rights.' Friday's action makes good on his promise.",

            "summary": "It was with wonder and great interest that I read Monica Hesse's April 11 Style column, 'Tradwives, stay-at-home girlfriends and ‘a thing called ease.'' As the president of a college for women, I found myself wondering why so many people are entranced by the spectacle of young women making a highly questionable choice — though it's absolutely their choice to make — instead of lifting up the many women who are, in fact, striving to change their lives by getting an education and tackling the travails of the world.\nThe only mentions of higher education came in an anecdote about a teenage girl who would rather husband-hunt than go to college and Ms. Hesse's obligatory dig about the cost of tuition: 'If college weren't so ghastly expensive here, maybe that one lady's daughter wouldn't be so keen on the patriarchy as a route to leisure that bypasses the long, uphill road to financial independence.' But there is no better road to intellectual freedom and ease of life than education.\nU.S. women's colleges know and address this every day. We serve young women who are eager to lead despite messages that they lack the value or the resources to be successful. More than 93 percent of our students receive financial aid to go to college, and many women's colleges serve the most financially vulnerable young people in the nation. Yet we endeavor to equip young women to pursue their educational ambitions in support of a more just world.\nAdvertisement\nTo be clear: I don't object to the suggestion that what many young women — or really, all people — want today is more leisure or a sense of ease. I and my students would like a nap, too. What keeps us awake? A deep sense of purpose. We recognize that the same world that prevents 'ease' needs us to change it; that the miseries women face in the world will not go away while we rest. We know we have a purpose in this world and that this purpose is to fashion a better experience for us all. Women don't have to compromise their own sense of self to achieve that.\nMary Dana Hinton , Roanoke\nMary Dana Hinton, Roanoke\nThe writer is president of Hollins University.\nThe writer is president of Hollins University.\nWas it intentional irony that the April 11 Style section paired 'Nick Adams wants you to man up,' a profile of the misogynistic provocateur, with Monica Hesse's column on the appeal and pitfalls of the tradwife lifestyle? Perfect! Now there's a real GOP platform.\nAdvertisement\nPamela Kincheloe , Manassas\nPamela Kincheloe, Manassas\nJust when I thought there was no way The Post could foist Donald Trump on me more often, the April 11 Style section led with a profile of Nick Adams, an off-putting Trump surrogate.\nAs the writer eventually pointed out, there are genuine problems facing men and boys but women coming for their testicles isn't one of them. How ironic and insulting that while women are the ones under policy assaults such as the resurrection of Arizona's ancient ban on abortion, The Post chose to devote space to another con man tapping into anger.\nNaomi Salus , Washington\nNaomi Salus, Washington\nSlow down those pitches\nAs a longtime baseball observer and fan, I read Chelsea Janes's April 11 Sports analysis, 'No easy fix after rash of injuries to pitchers,' with interest.\nWith the increasing emphasis on pitch velocity, spin rates and other measures of force, Major League Baseball teams are effectively 'killing their young.' Potentially great pitching careers are being sacrificed at the altar of money as pitchers try to master throws such as the sweeper.\nAdvertisement\nAs a result, professional baseball risks becoming a niche sport like thoroughbred racing, in which horses are driven to the point of exhaustion and ghastly injury for the entertainment of gamblers, with whom Major League Baseball and other professional sports leagues have aligned themselves. Sadly, America's pastime has become a sign of the times.\nArthur Edward Schwartz , Arlington\nArthur Edward Schwartz, Arlington\nGolf is not ‘sustainable'\nI had to laugh ruefully when I read the word 'sustainable' in reference to the sport of golf in the April 10 front-page article 'On eve of Masters, chasm still divides golf.' The fragile balance between the competing golf tours might be sustainable. But when it comes to the environment, golf is anything but.\nAcres of land are cleared of forests or fields to be turned into grassy lawns that are ecological dead zones. Swaths of fairways and greens sequester little carbon and fail to support the food chain or pollinators. Courses require massive quantities of water, competing with people and agriculture for scarce resources even in the most drought-prone parts of the world. Polluting and toxic weed killers and chemical fertilizers flow into groundwater and streams, endangering wildlife and people. The carbon footprint for manicuring golf courses with armies of gas-powered equipment is huge.\nAdvertisement\nGolfers say they enjoy 'being in nature,' but that's like comparing a water park wave pool to the ocean. About the only thing sustainable about a golf course might be an electric cart — or maybe an organic beer.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nSally Kelly , Chevy Chase\nSally Kelly, Chevy Chase\nSave the Circulator\nI read with dismay the April 12 Metro article 'Circulator bus service might end in March 2025.'\nOur family has resided in D.C. for decades and became aware of the services of the Circulator bus system just two years ago. The atmosphere on the bus is festive and friendly, in large part because of the drivers and the excited tourists who ride it. It provides an invaluable service to tourists and residents alike who want to get around the National Mall at a reasonable price or to Georgetown conveniently from Union Station.\nDon't shut down routes, raise prices or eliminate the Circulator altogether. Just advertise it more. So many residents are unaware of its routes or their convenience. Get fliers out to all the hotels that tourists frequent. Get information to the public in general. People love a bargain, and at $1 per ride, the Circulator is the best bargain in D.C.\nAdvertisement\nKathleen Wood , Washington\nKathleen Wood, Washington\nTax rich D.C. residents like me\nTaxes support thriving communities where people want to live. They fund quality schools and reliable public transportation, in addition to providing food and shelter for people who have hit hard times. Right now, D.C. faces major budget pressures that jeopardize these vital programs and services. But lawmakers can meet this moment by raising taxes on wealthy people, including me.\nI came to the city more than a decade ago as a student at George Washington University (Raise High!) and fell in love with D.C. I enjoy a car-free life with convenient access to friends, stores and cultural activities. D.C. Minyan provides a robust Jewish community. Playing softball on the National Mall never gets old. I can't imagine living anywhere else. But as a frequent cheerleader for D.C., I have never even considered discussing my relatively low tax burden as a draw to encourage friends and family to move here.\nAdvertisement\nMy financial situation is not out of the ordinary for White residents of D.C. An Urban Institute study found that as of 2016, White households in D.C. had a net worth 81 times greater than that of Black households and 22 times that of Latinx households.\nOur tax system does little to correct the historic injustices that have contributed to this wealth inequality. Instead, tax preferences and loopholes protect and further concentrate wealth.\nFor example, D.C.'s property tax system uses a single rate for residences, meaning I pay the same property tax rate as someone who owns a small studio far away from public transit and other amenities.\nAnd Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) has now proposed an increase to the sales tax, which takes a larger percentage of income from low- and middle-income earners than high-income earners. Combined with Ms. Bowser's proposal to halt the planned increase to D.C.'s earned-income tax credit, which helps people with low incomes keep more of what they earn, this would raise the effective tax rate on D.C. residents with the lowest incomes relative to the current baseline.\nAdvertisement\nRaise taxes on me and other wealthy residents instead. I say this with confidence that the marginally higher taxes I would pay would not materially affect my quality of life.\nBut the investments the District could make in public services with a little more of my tax money would be life-changing for others. By taxing D.C.'s concentrated wealth, the D.C. Council can ensure that child-care workers are paid fairly, rental assistance programs are fully funded and transformative initiatives such as the earned-income tax credit aren't gutted. I can afford to pay more in taxes so everyone can have their basic needs met.\nWe all agree D.C. faces major budget pressures and needs more revenue, so let's find a way to raise it. Why not increase the tax rate on capital gains — profits from selling assets such as stocks that overwhelmingly flow to the top 1 percent? And why not increase taxes on homes valued at more than $1.5 million, instead of taxing them at the same rate as lower-value homes?\nAdvertisement\nBefore being disrupted by business lobbyists, D.C.'s Tax Revision Commission laid out other proposals to raise revenue that, unlike the mayor's proposals, wouldn't put the burden on D.C. residents who are already struggling. We all contribute to the strength of D.C.'s economy, but only a few households see the most benefits. The D.C. Council should make the wealthy pay more, so D.C. can be a place where everyone can share in the growth and enjoy a good life.",

            "summary": "TOPEKA, Kan. — State universities in Kansas would be banned from requiring prospective students, potential hires and staffers seeking promotion to disclose their views on diversity initiatives under a policy change being considered by the state's higher education board.\nThe Kansas Board of Regents was set to discuss the policy change during a meeting Wednesday at Fort Hays University. The proposal would revise policy language that currently emphasizes 'multiculturism and diversity' on campus and replace it with language barring universities from requiring statements 'pledging allegiance to, support for or opposition to' diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in applications for admission, hiring or promotion — without setting any penalties for violations.\nThe proposed change comes as the state's Democratic governor faces pressure to enshrine the anti-DEI policy in law following Republicans' approval of a bill in the Legislature that would put the same policy into state law. That bill allows a fine of up to $10,000 for a violation and includes provisions in the next state budget to withhold nearly $36 million from the state universities unless they publicly confirm that they don't have such requirements. Gov. Laura Kelly has until Friday to act on the bill and until April 25 to act on the budget provisions.\nAdvertisement\n'I don't think we ever would have had a state law if this was their policy at the outset,' Republican state Sen. J.R. Claeys, the author of the budget provisions, said ahead of Wednesday's board discussion.\nRepublicans in at least 20 states have sought to limit DEI initiatives, arguing that they are discriminatory and enforce a liberal political orthodoxy. Alabama and Utah enacted new anti-DEI laws this year, and a ban enacted in Texas last year has led to more than 100 job cuts on University of Texas campuses.\nClaeys, who is also an adviser to GOP state Attorney General Kris Kobach, another DEI critic, said a new regents policy is a positive step because it ensures that all of the universities are following the same guidelines.\nBut, he added, 'I wouldn't expect them to enact any enforcement on themselves.'\nAdvertisement\nOthers say that such policies reflect 'a gross misrepresentation' of the purpose behind DEI statements from applicants.\n'The intended purpose is to provide an opportunity for prospective employees to reflect on their experiences and how those experiences complement the mission and values of an institution to support a diverse campus community,' said Paulette Granberry Russell, president of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Educations, in an email statement.\nIt's unclear how widespread required DEI-related statements on applications are, but GOP lawmakers have said they are responding to complaints and applications they'd seen online. Granberry Russell said she was unaware of any university expecting students, job applicants or employees to actually 'pledge allegiance to diversity.'\nAdvertisement\nA legislative audit released in February said that just 1.6% of spending by Kansas' six state universities — $45 million — went to DEI initiatives but noted that each university defined DEI differently. Besides initiatives traditionally seen as DEI, such as training and recruiting, resources included food pantries for poor students and services for military veterans and disabled students.\nKelly told reporters after a Tuesday event that she has not had time to review the anti-DEI bill. While the bill specifically mentions diversity, equity and inclusion, it also says universities cannot require a statement about 'any political ideology or movement.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nLast year, Kelly used her power under the state constitution to veto individual budget provisions to scuttle anti-DEI provisions in the current budget, and GOP lawmakers did not have the two-thirds majorities necessary in both chambers to override her actions.\nAdvertisement\nBut Kelly also signed legislation last year that bars Kansas officials from using environmental, social and governance factors in investing public funds or deciding who receives government contracts.",

            "summary": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Former U.S. Sen. and two-term Florida Gov. Bob Graham, who gained national prominence as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks and as an early critic of the Iraq war, has died. He was 87.\nGraham's family announced the death Tuesday in a statement posted on X by his daughter Gwen Graham.\n'We are deeply saddened to report the passing of a visionary leader, dedicated public servant, and even more importantly, a loving husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather,' the family said.\nGraham, who served three terms in the Senate, made an unsuccessful bid for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, emphasizing his opposition to the Iraq invasion.\nBut his bid was delayed by heart surgery in January 2003, and he was never able to gain enough traction with voters to catch up, bowing out that October. He didn't seek reelection in 2004 and was replaced by Republican Mel Martinez.\nAdvertisement\nGraham was a man of many quirks. He perfected the 'workdays' political gimmick of spending a day doing various jobs from horse stall mucker to FBI agent and kept a meticulous diary, noting almost everyone he spoke with, everything he ate, the TV shows he watched and even his golf scores.\nGraham said the notebooks were a working tool for him and he was reluctant to describe his emotions or personal feelings in them.\n'I review them for calls to be made, memos to be dictated, meetings I want to follow up on and things people promise to do,' he said.\nGraham was among the earliest opponents of the Iraq war, saying it diverted America's focus on the battle against terrorism centered in Afghanistan. He was also critical of President George W. Bush for failing to have an occupation plan in Iraq after the U.S. military threw out Saddam Hussein in 2003.\nAdvertisement\nGraham said Bush took the United States into the war by exaggerating claims of the danger presented by the Iraqi weapons of destruction that were never found. He said Bush distorted intelligence data and argued it was more serious than the sexual misconduct issues that led the House to impeach President Bill Clinton in the late 1990s. It led him to launch his short, abortive presidential bid.\n'The quagmire in Iraq is a distraction that the Bush administration, and the Bush administration alone, has created,' Graham said in 2003.\nDuring his 18 years in Washington, Graham worked well with colleagues from both parties, particularly Florida Republican Connie Mack during their dozen years together in the Senate.\nAs a politician, few were better. Florida voters hardly considered him the wealthy Harvard-educated attorney that he was.\nAdvertisement\nGraham's political career spanned five decades, beginning with his election to the Florida House of Representatives in 1966.\nHe won a state Senate seat in 1970 and then was elected governor in 1978. He was re-elected in 1982. Four years later, he won the first of three terms in the U.S. Senate when he ousted incumbent Republican Paula Hawkins.\nGraham remained widely popular with Florida voters — winning reelection by wide margins in 1992 and 1998 when he carried 63 of 67 counties. In that latter election, he defeated Charlie Crist, who later served as a Republican governor from 2007 to 2011.\n'He blew me out of the water, and I came to know even more so why during the course of the campaign,' Crist said Tuesday night. 'I learned to respect him even more than I already had, and love him for the good, decent man that he was.'\nAdvertisement\nCrist, who has since switched parties and most recently served as a U.S. representative, said Graham was an influence on him.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'I always felt that when he was governor, that he was trying to govern for the people of Florida — not in any way political or partisan — and I took that to heart and tried to, in some small way, emulate it,' Crist said.\nHouse Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi called Graham 'a patriotic American' and thanked him for his 'distinguished public service.' She highlighted his work on the inquiry into 9/11 and said he 'bravely opposed entry into the war in Iraq.'\n'He brought his love for his family and for his state of Florida to the Senate, where he served with immense dignity and courage,' she said in a statement Tuesday.\nEven when in Washington, Graham never took his eye off the state and the leadership in Tallahassee.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Gov. Jeb Bush and the Republican-controlled Legislature eliminated the Board of Regents in 2001, Graham saw it as a move to politicize the state university system. He led a successful petition drive the next year for a state constitutional amendment that created the Board of Governors to assume the regents' role.\nDaniel Robert Graham was born Nov. 9, 1936, in Coral Gables, where his father, Ernest 'Cap' Graham, had moved from South Dakota and established a large dairy operation. Young Bob milked cows, built fences and scooped manure as a teenager. One of his half-brothers, Phillip Graham, was publisher of The Washington Post and Newsweek until he took his own life in 1963, just a year after Bob Graham's graduation from Harvard Law.\nGraham was president of the student body at Miami Senior High School and attended the University of Florida, graduating in 1959.\nAdvertisement\nIn 1966 he was elected to the Florida Legislature, where he focused largely on education and health care issues.\nGraham got off to a shaky start as Florida's chief executive, and was dubbed 'Gov. Jello' for some early indecisiveness. He shook that label through his handling of several serious crises.\nAs governor he also signed numerous death warrants, founded the Save the Manatee Club with entertainer Jimmy Buffett and led efforts to establish several environmental programs.\nGraham pushed through a bond program to buy beaches and barrier islands threatened by development and started the Save Our Everglades program to protect the state's water supply, wetlands and endangered species.\nGraham also was known for his 408 'workdays,' including stints as a housewife, boxing ring announcer, flight attendant and arson investigator. They grew out of a teaching stint as a member of the Florida Senate's Education Committee and then morphed into a campaign gimmick that helped him relate to the average voter.\nAdvertisement\n'This has been a very important part of my development as a public official, my learning at a very human level what the people of Florida expect, what they want, what their aspirations are and then trying to interpret that and make it policy that will improve their lives' said Graham in 2004 as he completed his final job as a Christmas gift wrapper.\nAfter leaving public life in 2005, Graham spent much of his time at a public policy center named after him at the University of Florida and pushing the Legislature to require more civics classes in the state's public schools.",

            "summary": "'I was like, that's my goal, exactly that!' Taub, who plays Paul, said from her dressing room later. 'Do everything I can to make you fall in love with these women, root for them, care about them. So that was a really satisfying moment to witness.'\nAdvertisement\nSatisfying but sobering, too. Fact is, few audience members know much about the American suffrage movement. So the all-female creative team behind 'Suffs,' which had a high-profile off-Broadway run and opens Thursday on Broadway with extensive revisions, knows they're starting from zero.\nIt's an opportunity, says Taub, who studied social movements — but not suffrage — at New York University. But it's also a huge challenge: How do you educate but also entertain?\nOne member of the 'Suffs' team has an especially poignant connection to the material. That would be producer Hillary Clinton.\nShe was, of course, the first woman to win the U.S. presidential nomination of a major party, and the first to win the popular vote. But Clinton says she never studied the suffrage movement in school, even at Wellesley. Only later in life did she fill in the gap, including a visit as first lady to Seneca Falls, home to the first American women's rights convention some 70 years before the 19th Amendment gave women the vote.\nAdvertisement\n'I became very interested in women's history through my own work, and writing and reading,' Clinton told The Associated Press. And so, seeing 'Suffs' off-Broadway, 'I was thrilled because it just helps to fill a big gap in our awareness of the long, many-decades struggle for suffrage.'\nIt was Taub who wrote Clinton, asking her to come on board. 'I thought about it for a nanosecond,' Clinton says, 'and decided absolutely, I wanted to help lift up this production.' A known theater lover, Clinton describes traveling often to New York as a college student and angling for discounts, often seeing only the second act, when she could get in for free. 'For years, I'd only seen the second act of ‘Hair,'' she quips.\nClinton then reached out to Malala Yousafzai, whom Taub also hoped to engage as a producer. As secretary of state, Clinton had gotten to know the Pakistani education activist who was shot by a Taliban gunman at age 15. Clinton wanted Yousafzai to know she was involved and hoped the Nobel Peace Prize winner would be, too.\nAdvertisement\n'I'm thrilled,' Clinton says of Yousafzai's involvement, 'because yes, this is an American story, but the pushback against women's rights going on at this moment in history is global.'\nYousafzai had also seen the show, directed by Leigh Silverman, and loved it. She, too, has been a longtime fan of musicals, though she notes her own acting career began and ended with a school skit in Pakistan, playing a not-very-nice male boss. Her own education about suffrage was limited to 'one or two pages in a history book that talked about the suffrage movement in the U.K.,' where she'd moved for medical treatment.\n'I still had no idea about the U.S. side of the story,' Yousafzai told the AP. It was a struggle among conflicting personalities, and a clash over priorities between older and younger activists but also between white suffragists and those of color — something the show addresses with the searing 'Wait My Turn,' sung by Nikki M. James as Wells, the Black activist and journalist.\nAdvertisement\n'This musical has really helped me see activism from a different lens,' says Yousafzai. 'I was able to take a deep breath and realize that yes, we're all humans and it requires resilience and determination, conversation, open-mindedness … and along the way you need to show you're listening to the right perspectives and including everyone in your activism.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nWhen asked for feedback by the 'Suffs' team, Yousafzai says she replied that she loved the show just as it was. (She recently paid a visit to the cast, and toured backstage.) Clinton, who has attended rehearsals, quips: 'I sent notes, because I was told that's what producers do.'\nClinton adds: 'I love the changes. It takes a lot of work to get the storytelling right — to decide what should be sung versus spoken, how to make sure it's not just telling a piece of history, but is entertaining.'\nAdvertisement\nIndeed, the off-Broadway version was criticized by some as feeling too much like a history lesson. The new version feels faster and lighter, with a greater emphasis on humor — even in a show that details hunger strikes and forced feedings.\nOne moment where the humor shines through: a new song titled 'Great American Bitch' that begins with a suffragist noting a man had called her, well, a bitch. The song reclaims the word with joy and laughter. Taub says this moment — and another where an effigy of President Woodrow Wilson (played by Grace McLean, in a cast that's all female or nonbinary) is burned — has been a hit with audiences.\n'As much as the show has changed,' she says, 'the spine of it is the same. A lot of what I got rid of was just like clearing brush.'\nMost of the original cast has returned. Jenn Colella plays Carrie Chapman Catt, an old-guard suffragist who clashed with the younger Paul over tactics and timing. James returns as Wells, while Milholland, played by Phillipa Soo off-Broadway, is now played by Hannah Cruz.\nAdvertisement\nGiven its parallels to a certain Lin-Manuel Miranda blockbuster about the Founding Fathers, it's perhaps not a surprise that the show has been dubbed 'Hermilton' by some.\n'I have to say,' Clinton says of Taub, 'I think she's doing for this part of American history what Lin did for our founders — making it alive, approachable, understandable. I'm hoping ‘Suffs' has the same impact ‘Hamilton' had.'\nThat may seem a tall order, but producers have been buoyed by audience reaction. 'They're laughing even more than we thought they would at the parts we think are funny, and cheering at other parts,' Clinton says. A particular cheer comes at the end, when Paul proposes the ERA. 'A cast member said, ‘Who'd have ever thought the Equal Rights Amendment would get cheers in a Broadway theater?'' Clinton recalls.\nAdvertisement\nOne clear advantage the show surely has: timeliness. During the off-Broadway run, news emerged the Supreme Court was preparing to overturn Roe vs. Wade, fueling a palpable sense of urgency in the audience. The Broadway run begins as abortion rights are again in the news — and a key issue in the presidential election only months away.\nTaub takes the long view. She's been working on the show for a decade, and says something's always happening to make it timely.",

Mike Wilson said he hopes lawmakers use the coming months to craft another version of DEI legislation for the 30-day session in 2025.\n'It'll be something that we'll work on in the interim and hopefully come to some sort of agreement with the House,' Wilson said Tuesday during a news conference featuring Senate Republican leaders.\nDebates around DEI efforts on college campuses have played out in statehouses across the country this year. Republicans in at least 20 states have sought to limit such initiatives, claiming they are discriminatory and enforce a liberal orthodoxy. Alabama and Utah enacted anti-DEI laws this year, and a ban enacted in Texas last year has led to more than 100 job cuts on University of Texas campuses.\nAdvertisement\nIn Kentucky, the issue generated contentious debates when the Senate and House passed different versions of anti-DEI bills. Opponents warned that proposed restrictions on campuses could roll back gains in minority enrollments and stifle campus discussions about past discrimination.\nState Sen. Gerald Neal, the top-ranking Democrat, said Tuesday that anti-DEI efforts were 'a shameless attempt to reverse the progress that our commonwealth has made.'\nWilson, who is the Senate majority whip, sponsored the bill passed by chamber Republicans in February. It would have prohibited 'discriminatory concepts' in non-classroom settings, such as training sessions and orientations, and would have barred schools from providing preferential treatment based on a person's political ideology. It also would have prohibited requiring people to state specific ideologies or beliefs when seeking admission, employment or promotions.\nAdvertisement\nAbout a month later, the House stripped away the Senate's language and inserted a replacement that took a tougher stance by also defunding DEI offices and officer positions. Wilson's original bill didn't call for dismantling those offices.\nSenate Republicans had concerns about portions of the House version, Wilson said Tuesday without offering specifics. Both versions died when the legislative session ended Monday night.\nDemocratic Gov. Andy Beshear denounced anti-DEI efforts last month while commemorating the 60th anniversary of a landmark civil-rights rally in Frankfort, the state's capital city.\n'DEI is not a four-letter word,' Beshear said. 'DEI is a three-letter acronym for very important values that are found in our Bible. Diversity, equity and inclusion is about loving each other. It's about living out the Golden Rule. ... Diversity will always make us stronger. It is an asset and never a liability.'\nAdvertisement\nWith supermajorities in both chambers, Republicans can easily override the governor's vetoes.\nNeal, who is Black, said Tuesday that supporters of the anti-DEI bills want to 'suppress that part of history that makes them feel uncomfortable' instead of acknowledging and learning from the past.\nDuring the Senate debate in February, Wilson said his bill would counter what he called a broader trend in higher education toward denying campus jobs or promotions to faculty refusing to espouse 'liberal ideologies fashionable in our public universities.' He said such practices extended to students and staff.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'Diversity of thought should be welcomed in our universities and higher education,' Wilson said. 'But we've seen a trend across the United States of forcing faculty, in order to remain employed, to formally endorse a set of beliefs that may be contrary to their own, all in violation of the First Amendment.'\nAdvertisement\nLooking ahead to renewed work on the issue, Wilson said Tuesday that there were portions of the House bill that GOP senators 'thought we could live with,' without offering details.\nRepublican Senate Majority Floor Leader Damon Thayer predicted Tuesday that GOP senators will reach out to House Republicans to try to strike an agreement on DEI legislation that he hopes lawmakers could take up early in next year's session. Thayer is retiring from the Senate at the end of 2024.",

Canceling a gift-giving holiday several months in advance will not mean much to a child your daughter's age; it is best to respond in the moment to behavior you don't like.\nFor instance, if you presented an Easter basket loaded with goodies and your daughter tore through them (common behavior for a child her age), and immediately started complaining that there weren't more, you and your husband should express your own disappointment — calmly and decisively. 'Wow — you seem very unhappy. You have a lot of treats there, and if you don't enjoy them, we will take them away until you can figure out how to enjoy the things that are right in front of you.'\nAdvertisement\nSeven-year-olds are impulsive; that's a characteristic that can make kids this age really fun to be with. The downside to this is that they are still learning how to modulate their behavior. Right after disciplining your daughter, once she calms down you should ask her whether she understands how her behavior led to the consequence. At Eastertime, you could also transition from giving a basket full of sweets, treats and trinkets to coloring and hunting for eggs and jelly beans, and giving flower seeds, small pots and soil for planting a window garden.\nI agree to cut way down.

The challenge wasn't against her college, it was against Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, a prestigious magnet school in Northern Virginia. And the case wasn't challenging affirmative action — it was challenging a new 'race-neutral' approach for admissions.\nHu, a lawyer, thought the new admissions policy was admirable, and deserved to stay in place.

'I think it would really be a shame if we lost programs like that, if we lost the ability to think thoughtfully about how we ensure a better, more equal society.'\nHu said she first found out about the TJ case when her parents — both first-generation Chinese American immigrants — told her in 2021 that the Northern Virginia magnet high school was doing something 'crazy' and capping Asian attendance.

'Hello, Exodus students,' she said, addressing the group of 90 fifth- through 12th-graders who would eventually watch the video as part of their lessons from the Exodus Institute, an online Christian K-12 school Kali and her husband founded in 2021 with the motto 'Exit Public Education.' The video, which Kali was recording in her guest bedroom-turned-office, was the latest in a special enrichment program dubbed the 'Young Patriots Academy,' which aims to 'debunk the ‘woke' lies taught in most public schools,' per the Exodus website.\nAdvertisement\nKali, who is half Black and half White, had a particular target that Friday: what she calls the left's unquestioning advocacy of reparations, the theory that the government should pay restitution to descendants of enslaved Americans.\nShe told her virtual class they were about to learn of the Quakers, and how White members of that religion helped fight slavery. She said that, throughout American history, there were good people and bad people. But focusing only on the bad, like she believes many public school teachers do, would be wrong.\n'Whenever you learn history,' she said, 'it's important to learn the full context of it.'\nKali Fontanilla leads 'Young Patriots Academy,' a program that aims to counter 'left-wing indoctrination' and the 'lies taught in most public schools.\" (Video: TWP)\nKali's online job marked a sharp departure from the years she and her husband, Joshua Fontanilla, spent teaching middle- and high school English in California's deep-blue Salinas district. The couple quit their jobs a year after the coronavirus pandemic began, disillusioned by school shutdowns and displeased by some colleagues' embrace of the Black Lives Matter movement, which both thought was wrongheaded and hateful for what they saw as its anti-police stance.\nKali, 41, and Joshua, who is 42 and of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent, had also grown convinced their school was teaching harmful ideas about race and history, including what they believe is the false theory America is systemically racist. Across the nation, mostly conservative mothers and fathers were raising similar alarms — anxiety that soon fueled an explosion of legislation restricting how educators can teach about race, sex and gender.\nBy April 2024, such laws had spread to affect half the nation's students. The claim that public schools teach left-wing 'indoctrination, not education' had become a commonplace on the right, repeated by parents, politicians and pundits.\nBut not, usually, by teachers. And that's why the Fontanillas felt compelled to act: They came direct from the classroom. They had seen firsthand what was happening. Now, they wanted to expose the propaganda they felt had infiltrated public schools — and offer families an alternative.\nIn 2021, eager to fulfill their mission, the couple moved to Florida to found their own Christian school in a state which, under Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), had become a haven for people with views like theirs. In the years since, they have grown their school to nearly 200 students, partly through Kali's appearances on conservative media like Fox News — but mostly through her social media.\nKali's Instagram videos, filled with right-wing rhetoric and delivered almost daily to her 333,000 followers, proved a powerful recruiting tool. But they also spurred thousands of critical messages from online observers who contended she was indoctrinating students into a skewed, conservative worldview. 'RACIST, ONE SIDED, WHITEWASHED OPINION,' one wrote on a recent post, just above someone else who declared: 'No one [is] impressed by the trash you are trying to sell.'\nNow, half an hour into her lesson on slavery, Kali told students how some Quakers risked prison time to assist people fleeing enslavement.\n'There are certain people that are saying, ‘oh, White people owe Black people for slavery,'' Kali said. 'But what about the White people who were descendants of the Quakers, who actually had a lot of negative consequences that happened to them for helping free the slaves?'\nShe urged her students to keep pondering the question as they turned to their next assignment.\nK ali was a few years into studying for her master's degree in education at the University of California at Santa Cruz when, she recalled, a professor told her class to take a 'privilege walk.'\nKali was a few years into studying for her master's degree in education at the University of California at Santa Cruz when, she recalled, a professor told her class to take a 'privilege walk.'\nHe formed the students into a line, Kali said, and asked a series of questions: Have you ever seen a play? What about a concert? Students stepped forward if the answer was 'yes,' backward if the answer was 'no.'\nKali hated it. Although she came from a challenging background — her Jamaican father left her White mother early on, she said, and the family was always strapped for money — she wound up standing ahead of wealthier White classmates because her grandmother had insisted she be exposed to the arts. And she couldn't believe the professor didn't ask about sexual abuse. 'Even if you are the richest young person, White, whatever, if you've been sexually abused, that's the worst trauma you could ever receive,' Kali said.\nA spokesman for UC Santa Cruz confirmed Kali attended the school, but said he could not 'easily verify anything beyond that.'\nYears later, teaching English in Salinas, she was horrified when she saw other teachers giving students a 'privilege quiz' during a ninth-grade ethnic studies class. (The course became a statewide requirement a year later.) Curious and worried, Kali looked up the ethnic studies lesson plans in the school's internal systems and found evidence some colleagues were using the class to introduce students to 'critical race theory,' a college-level academic framework that holds racism is baked into American institutions. Kali had encountered the theory in graduate school — and loathed it, fearing it would convert students into victims who lay blame on racist systems rather than accept any individual responsibility.\nAdvertisement\nIn the ethnic studies class, teachers were urging students to study school policies 'through a Critical Race Theory framework,' according to screenshots of a presentation that Kali shared with The Washington Post, meaning they should analyze how 'race affects our experiences.' Students were told to take three 'Steps Against Hegemony,' per the power point: 'Analyze ‘hidden curriculum.'' 'Use Critical Race Theory.' 'Be Active participants.'\nAsked about the ethnic studies course, district officials wrote in a statement that 'embedded in the lesson outcomes was the question for students to analyze whether or not race may be viewed as a contributor to one's experiences.' The district surveyed students who completed the class in 2022, officials wrote, and their 'feedback was overwhelmingly positive.'\nAround the same time, Joshua Fontanilla said he was also spotting what he perceived as bias at school. His suspicions stirred, he said, when he noticed his high school always announced meetings of the Gay-Straight Alliance club over the loud speakers — but not those of other clubs, like his chess group.\nbias at school. His suspicions stirred, he said, when he noticed his high school always announced meetings of the Gay-Straight Alliance club over the loud speakers — but not those of other clubs, like his chess group.\nJoshua then began combing through the 'American Dream' unit of the English curriculum, researching the politics of every author. He concluded that too many (at least 12 of 19) were 'left-leaning,' including — as Joshua saw it — 'leftist' historian Studs Terkel, 'socialist' poet Langston Hughes and 'Dem' Walt Whitman.\nDistrict officials wrote in a statement that 'there is no evidence nor complaint ever brought forward regarding inequity in clubs being recognized during the announcements' and noted that the English curriculum conforms to California state standards. Officials added that the Fontanillas 'never made a complaint formally or informally to any district official.'\nA decade ago, Kali and Joshua said, they would have agreed with what their school was teaching. Both were raised in a blue slice of California by what they described as liberal families, and for a long time accepted those views without question.\nWhen Sira Taylor hired Kali to tutor her son in 2012, Kali was 'definitely left-leaning in her politics,' Taylor recalled. But Taylor, a Santa Cruz-area mother of two and self-professed independent, didn't care: She just knew Kali was good for her son, who was struggling to read and focus. Under Kali's tutelage, Taylor said, the boy's reading skills and academic performance soared. She still remembers how Kali let him run around the block whenever he got antsy.\n'She just really got the fact he was a young little boy who had a lot of energy,' Taylor said. 'He's a sophomore in college and an amazing student now, and he wouldn't be without her.'\nBy the time Kali finished tutoring Taylor's son, she and Joshua had begun to reconsider their Democratic allegiances.\nKali grew disillusioned with President Barack Obama when he signed a 2014 law cutting $8.7 billion in food stamps — a benefit that she, her mother and two siblings relied on throughout her childhood, she said. Joshua came to realize he agreed with many of President Donald Trump's policies, including his hard line stance on immigration.\nAnd both were disgusted with liberal politicians' response to the pandemic, especially their willingness to shut down schools, which Kali and Josh believed should have been last to close. The couple's concern over curricula, most notably the ethnic studies class, was the final straw.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIn summer 2021, her mind made up, Kali wrote a letter to the school board.\n'If the district continues to move forward with all these divisive teachings, it will only harden the hearts of many of our students,' she wrote in the letter, which the superintendent read aloud at a June board meeting after she submitted it for public comment. 'I have decided to resign from the district, which is the only reason I feel brave enough to speak out without fear of repercussions.'\nSalinas Union School District Superintendent, Dan Burns, reads a letter by Kali Fontanilla at a school board meeting on June 22, 2021. (Video: TWP)\nAt the board meeting following the letter-reading, several students gave speeches in favor of the ethnic studies course that helped prompt Kali's resignation. 'I would like to be able to learn my people's history at schools,' said one student, noting she is of Mexican and Latina heritage.\n'I feel like ethnic studies unites us more because we have a new understanding,' another student told a local reporter. It 'makes us understand why certain stereotypes are in our communities and how to fix them.'\nBut Kali wasn't there to hear them. Before that summer ended, she and Joshua packed their bags, put their chihuahua in a travel crate and headed for the Sunshine State.\nT he couple cashed out their California teacher retirement pensions to start up Exodus — and more than two years later, the school is just profitable enough to break even. Students pay between $2,000 and $8,000, based on need, for the standard K-12 offerings at Exodus, which include lessons on a wide variety of subjects including math, science, horticulture, French, business and the Christian faith. The Fontanillas said their student body is 50 percent Hispanic and Black, and 60 percent non-Christian. The degree Exodus confers counts as a regular high school diploma.\nThe couple cashed out their California teacher retirement pensions to start up Exodus — and more than two years later, the school is just profitable enough to break even.

The Fontanillas said their student body is 50 percent Hispanic and Black, and 60 percent non-Christian. The degree Exodus confers counts as a regular high school diploma.\nKali and Joshua said their K-12 curriculum and accredited status come courtesy of Southlands Christian Schools, a 45-year-old private school located in California which in the past five years spun up an online, faith-based schooling program. Joshua said he discovered Southlands in 2019 at an event for the California chapter of Blexit, right-wing commentator Candace Owens' campaign to make Black Americans leave the Democratic Party.\nAt the event, Joshua met Joshua Duncan, an employee of Cornerstone Education Management Organization Inc., the company Southlands pays to manage the logistics of its online schooling arm — including hiring teachers and finding people, like the Fontanillas, who want to start their own schools.\nThe two Joshuas hit it off, and eventually, the Fontanillas won approval to launch the Exodus Institute. 'Josh and Kali are good people, they have a good message, there is definitely a market for what they're doing,' Duncan said.\nUnder the deal, the Fontanillas use the Southlands standard K-12 curriculum and teachers provided by Cornerstone. Tuition payments go directly to the companies, and the Fontanillas get a commission for every pupil, Duncan said.\nAdvertisement\nThe Fontanillas also offer their 'Young Patriots Academy,' which Kali leads, as a special enrichment program. Classes cost $29 a month and revolve around topics of the couple's choosing. The first class asked 'The American Dream: Is it just a dream?'\n'There's actually people in America, and some of them are teachers, that are teaching kids that the American Dream is not real,' Kali said in that video, which she shared with The Post. 'We're going to look at that and see if that's true or not.'\nKali and Joshua declined to make students and parents available for interviews, citing worries over privacy, but shared screenshots of enrollees' reviews of academy lessons.\n'I love love LOVE your teaching Ms. Fontanilla,' one student wrote. 'It is so encouraging that you explain and exposing [sic] the stupid things on the internet in a logical way.'\nThe couple have ambitions to scale up: Kali and Joshua hope to eventually cross 1,000 students, at which point, they calculate, they will no longer have to pursue side jobs like Kali's current gig as a senior fellow at the Capital Research Center, a conservative think tank. So far, Kali has found most success attracting clients through Instagram, despite the fact her account is regularly suspended for 'community violations,' she said.\nThe more right-wing and 'out there' Kali's commentary, the more attention and families she draws to Exodus, she said. In one recent video, she complained that 'Black history month has turned into Black idolatry month.' In another, she exhorted her followers to be 'preppers' and stock up on food and medicine in case 'all hell breaks loose' after what she predicted will be Trump's victory in November.\nafter what she predicted will be Trump's victory in November.\nBut the videos also inspire hate — messages by the dozen every day telling Kali to shut up, according to screenshots she shared with The Post. Online commenters regularly sling racial slurs and derogatory names: 'slave sellout roach.' 'dumb fukn bitch.' 'wish dot com Candice Owen.' 'Auntie Tomella.'\nThe harassment got so bad last year that, coupled with her chihuahua's death and an injury that prevented her daily workouts, it proved too much for Kali. She went into a depressive spiral and had to take a break from social media. She barely managed to film her lessons.\nJoshua and her faith pulled her through. Kali said she was raised Seventh-day Adventist; Joshua discovered the religion online after researching dozens of faiths. Their beliefs also brought the couple together: They met in their 20s through a Seventh-day Adventist dating website.\nThe enforced quiet of their religion's Sabbath had proven healing for the couple. Close to sunset almost every Friday, the Fontanillas took a walk by the water to usher in their 24 hours of rest, during which they were supposed to refrain from schoolwork, housework and social media.\nOn a recent Friday, they strolled hand-in-hand through a grassy park with ocean views. Joshua led the way to a bench, tapping the space beside him.\nWalking over to join him, Kali passed a series of posters featuring student artwork, erected every spring as part of a public art installation. This year's iteration included a painting of a book in chains — and another of a student wearing earrings that each bore the slogan, 'ASK ME ABOUT MY PRONOUNS.'\nIt was just one more reason, Kali told herself, to pray. She sat beside her husband and closed her eyes. Together, they bent their heads to thank God.\nB ack in the guest bedroom-office, Kali prepared to finish out her lesson on slavery, reparations and the Quakers.\nack in the guest bedroom-office, Kali prepared to finish out her lesson on slavery, reparations and the Quakers.\nShe told her students how Quakers formed some of the first anti-slavery organizations in American history.

Or that, in 2022, British Quakers committed to make reparations for their past involvement in the transatlantic slave trade and colonialism.\nAdvertisement\nAsked about this, Kali said in an interview that she knows not all Quakers were perfect, and that some owned slaves, but that her lesson was meant to give a contrast and a balance to the 'overemphasis' on reparations coming from the left. She also noted that some Quakers have become 'very left-leaning now.'\nThe most important thing to know about the Quakers, Kali told her class that Friday, is they lived out their values. They 'put their values into practice.' Everything the Quakers did — from what they ate to where they shopped to how they prayed — upheld their values.\n'And what does that mean, to actually live your values?' she asked.",

Ron DeSantis, who dismissed critics opposed to mixing religion with public education.\nThe only requirements for a chaplain to participate would be passing a background check and having their name and religious affiliation listed on the school website. The chaplains would 'provide support, services, and programs to students as assigned by the district school board.' The law that takes effect July 1.\nDeSantis stressed that the program is voluntary. Schools don't have to have a chaplain and students don't have to work with them. Parental permission would be required if they do.\n'No one's being forced to do anything, but to exclude religious groups from campus, that is discrimination,' DeSantis said. 'You're basically saying that God has no place. That's wrong.'\nAdvertisement\nFlorida is among more than a dozen states that have sought to create school chaplain programs. Texas became the first under a law passed in 2023.\nSupporters in Florida argued the legislation will provide another resource for children and pointed out that chaplains already serve in other government roles by working with police and serving in the military. The Legislature itself hosts a chaplain of the day when it's in session and there's a non-denominational chapel in the state Capitol.\nOpponents cite several problems with the new Florida law, including there being no training requirements for chaplains. They also fear that some students might be ostracized if they are atheist or belong to a non-Christian religion in a Christian majority district.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'When you have a military chaplain, they go through intensive training and they have to be in a position where they can provide information which is factually correct and appropriate to the situation,' said Democratic Sen. Lori Berman of Palm Beach County.\nWithout that training, a chaplain could provide psychologically damaging counseling, Berman said. She suggested schools add more social workers, guidance counsellors or psychologists if they need them.",

            "summary": "ORLANDO, Fla. — The NFL has implemented new rules, banned another type of tackle and introduced equipment aimed toward improving player safety.\nKeeping players healthy has been a priority for a league that had so many star players suffer significant injuries in 2023. Aaron Rodgers, Joe Burrow, Kirk Cousins and Justin Herbert — four franchise quarterbacks — combined to miss 36 games. They were just a handful of the high-profile players to finish the season on injured reserve, though overall, NFL players missed a combined total of 700 fewer games in 2023 than in 2022.\nFiguring out the best ways to help players stay on the field is a collaborative effort for the league and its teams, so the NFL last month held a combined medical summit believed to be the first of its kind in any sport.\nWhile owners, general managers and coaches gathered for the league's annual spring meeting at a resort 18 miles away, more than 400 athletic trainers, equipment managers, strength and conditioning coaches, nutrition experts and sports science directors came together to learn from each other and from the league's research partners.\nAdvertisement\n'It's not just team doctors or athletic trainers, all these different disciplines really see themselves as part of our health and safety effort,' Dr. Allen Sills, the NFL's chief medical officer, told the AP. 'Clubs see themselves very holistically and nowadays, as coaches start to plan practice schedules and start to plan training camp, they really engage these different disciplines and they do it through the lens of what might be driving injury.\n'Obviously, coaches want to get their teams ready to play, but they also want to make sure they're as healthy as possible. And so that's really where we're looking at these interventions. How can we collectively, whether it's through our medical care or equipment or nutrition or strength and conditioning efforts, what do we do collectively that increases player availability and reliability?'\nInjury prevention was a major focus of the four-day summit that featured members of the Professional Football Athletic Trainers Society, the Professional Football Equipment Managers Society, the Professional Football Performance Coaches Association and the Professional Football Registered Dietitian Society.\nAdvertisement\nThe groups met for a series of workshops, seminars and combined education sessions. They visited with various vendors and heard from guest speakers that included Hall of Fame coach Tony Dungy and former player Andrew Whitworth.\n'There's a certain maturity to the work that's been going on in the sports, medical and innovation space that requires information sharing with all the clubs with greater frequency and more depth than I think we ever have before,' NFL executive Jeff Miller said.\nMiller, the league's executive vice president overseeing player health and safety, emphasized the importance of having the various groups in the same room, giving teams an opportunity to share ideas with each other.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe NFL plans to make this summit an annual event.\n'While everything at the league is competitive, the health and safety of the players really isn't,' Miller said. 'That is a place where we are able to share and the clubs are able to share with one another because everybody has that specific goal as a high priority.'\nAdvertisement\nThe various medical departments have gathered as individual groups at the NFL scouting combine for a long time but the idea to bring them all together started a couple years ago, said Tyler Williams, executive director of player health and performance for the Minnesota Vikings.\n'As the combine continues to get bigger and as disciplines become more subspecialty, how do we increase our level of interdisciplinary collaboration so if an athlete comes in and wants to wear these cleats, when you look at the injury history of the foot and ankle and you look at how they train with the sports medicine and how they fuel from the dietitian, all those components should have a say at the table,' Williams said.\nThe groups sat down together for six hours of educational and breakout sessions on Day 2 of the summit. Tendon health was the theme of the morning session. The afternoon chats featured five workshops led by subject-matter experts in each discipline. Attendees were encouraged to step outside their scope to understand the expertise of performance counterparts and hold conversations among the staffs.\nAdvertisement\n'We're talking about injury and return to play, equipment's role in that to get the athlete back on the field and our approach to another team's approach could be totally different so we are able to take some stuff away from each other to bring back to our own club, which was the point of it all,' said Brendan Burger, the director of equipment for the Los Angeles Rams. 'When it comes to an athlete's health and safety, it isn't a top-secret thing. We're here for our athletes, and the more we can help them, the better.'\nSince 2002, the NFL has made over 50 rules changes intended to eliminate potentially dangerous tactics and reduce the risk of injuries.\nDuring the latest league meetings, team owners unanimously approved a rule that bans players from using a swivel technique to tackle an opponent. Miller said the hip-drop tackle was used 230 times last season and resulted in 15 players missing time with injuries.\nAdvertisement\nThe horse-collar tackle, chop blocks and more were banned years ago. Helmet-to-helmet hits became illegal in 1996. Protecting quarterbacks has been a focal point for many rule changes, including one that prohibits low hits.\nLast week, the NFL and the NFL Players Association approved eight new position-specific helmets for quarterbacks and linemen designed to help reduce impact that can cause concussions.",

            "summary": "Jerry Seinfeld's upcoming Netflix comedy will be featured during this weekend's IndyCar race at Long Beach as rookie Linus Lundqvist will drive a car painted to look like a Pop-Tart in recognition of the movie 'Unfrosted.'\nChip Ganassi Racing's No. 8 will be painted in the texture of an unfrosted Pop-Tart along with images of Seinfeld and some of the movie cast members. The partnership, which is in collaboration with Ganassi sponsor American Legion, is promoting the May 3 film release.\nThe movie marks the directorial debut for the comedian.\nSeinfeld claimed all the way back in 2018 that he had been 'thinking about an invention of the Pop-Tart movie. Imagine the drunk on sugar-power Kellogg's cereal culture of the mid-60s in Battle Creek, (Michigan) That's a vibe I could work with.'\nThe movie, co-written by Seinfeld, stars Seinfeld along with Jim Gaffigan, Melissa McCarthy, Amy Schumer, Hugh Grant, James Marsden, Bill Burr, Fred Armisen, Dan Levy and others. 'Unfrosted' tells the tale of 1963 Michigan, the year before Pop-Tarts hit grocery store shelves.\nAdvertisement\n'Making a movie about Pop-Tarts has led to so many wonderful, unexpected surprises, and as a car guy, I honestly cannot believe our film's logo will be on an IndyCar entry this weekend,' Seinfeld said. 'I am grateful to Chip Ganassi Racing for making this happen, and honored to be affiliated with The American Legion and the work they do to support American Veterans.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe American Legion signed off on the promotion as part of its 'Be the One' mission that aims to save the lives of veterans by raising awareness, destigmatizing mental-health treatment and educating veterans, service members and their loved ones about what to do when a person appears at risk of suicide. Comedy is often used as a way to alleviate the symptoms that can lead to thoughts of suicide.\n'The ability for the American Legion to partner with Jerry Seinfeld, ‘Unfrosted' and Netflix is an incredible opportunity to expose our organization and the work we do for veterans to an entirely new audience within the entertainment community — and — the general public that are fans of Jerry Seinfeld and his comedy,' said Dean Kessel, chief marketing officer of The American Legion.\n'We know that humor can be therapeutic for those battling mental health issues. Partnering with the ‘Unfrosted' project ties nicely into our ‘Be The One' platform and our efforts to destigmatize veterans who are seeking help and our prevention of veteran suicide.'\n___",

            "summary": "It was the T. rex that chased Rebecca Smith over the edge. Her son, age 3, would make the dinosaur roar over and over and over again, a cinematic cry that filled the house and made her head pound.\nOne day, the dinosaur — a gift from an uncle who, incidentally, does not have children — decided to go on a trip. It was never seen (or heard from) again.\n'It was louder than what I would have on my TV, and he would just keep pushing it and pushing it and pushing it and pushing it,' said Smith, 27, who lives in Abilene, Texas. 'I don't want anything to happen to his ears, and I'm thinking, mine are hurting, and I'm way over here. So how is it when he's right there next to it?'\nThe screeching and roaring and wailing of noisy toys is driving parents to desperate measures, and it's about to get worse, as new guidelines go into effect April 20 that allow some toys — push and pull toys, specifically — to turn up the volume. From packing tape to cotton packing to hands-on seminars, parents are finding ways to tone down the toys; a spokesperson for the American Academy of Audiology, when contacted for this story, mentioned that her neighbor actually drove his car over a toy in a final attempt to shut it up.\nAdvertisement\nSomehow, the batteries 'died or disappeared' from an entire shelf of trucks, fire engines and police cars at Laurie Masino's house in Atlantic City, magically silencing the deafening sirens. But there is one toy — the Cocomelon Toy Microphone, which comes with an 'amplify' button — so grating that it has been banished to the basement, she said.\nMasino, a 40-year-old English teacher, said many of the educational toys now come with a volume setting, but her boys, age 5 and 2, automatically set it to loud, and truly, she can't tell the difference. As she spoke, a particularly loud owl behind her continued to talk on and off sporadically.\n'The toys that will come alive in the night, those are the ones that are actually terrifying,' she said.\nMost children are naturally drawn to loud noises as the brain learns to predict cause and response, and that's why they will smash a pan or hit a blaring siren over and over, said Andrew Garner, a pediatrician with a doctorate in neuroscience at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. The sound usually catches someone's attention, and they like that, too, he said.\nAdvertisement\n'From a neuroscience perspective, there's joy for children when they're able to predict what's going to happen next,' he said. 'You can see that when you play peekaboo: If you pretty much do anything repeatedly, and they know what's coming, they get excited — ooh, I know what's coming, I know what's gonna happen!'\nHe added that as kids get older, they may play sounds they specifically know will annoy their parents.\nToys that play sounds have been around since Thomas Edison's Talking Doll in 1887 and gained popularity with 1959's Chatty Cathy, which said 'I love you' when a string was pulled. While it might seem that toys are getting louder, they have been loud for a long time, said Kathy Webb, executive director of the Sight & Hearing Association. The group, which is shutting down this year, started testing toys in the late 1990s.\nAdvertisement\n'We used a handheld noise level meter, but with smartphones now, anyone can download an app and test themselves,' she said in an email.\nThe association put out a 'noisy toy' list until 2021 in an attempt to educate (or warn) parents. Many of the toys are over 85 decibels, including the top contender, Disney Moana Squeeze and Scream HeiHei, which reached 109 decibels close up and 94 decibels from 10 inches away.\nThe group contacted toy companies to work with them on lowering the noise level but never heard back, she said. The Washington Post tried to get in touch with Hasbro, which makes Tickle Me Elmo, variations of which appeared on several of the group's loudest toy lists, as well as JAKKS Pacific, which makes the screaming HeiHei. Neither responded to requests for comment.\nIn general, sound specialists say anything over 85 decibels for a long period of time can be problematic, but that's based on a 1972 Occupational Safety and Health Administration study of adults, said American Academy of Audiology President Bopanna Ballachanda. Ballachanda, who has a doctorate in audiology neuroscience, said he'd be more comfortable with toys around the 70- to 72-decibel mark.\nAdvertisement\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission works with ASTM International, which tests toys for noise levels, but it was unclear how toys that were above the decibel limit landed on shelves, and ASTM officials were not willing to answer questions in an interview.\nIn the meantime, parents are doing what they must to knock the screaming and siren levels down, which is particularly challenging if there is no outside speaker that can be muffled by tape.\nThat's why Steve McLaughlin, owner of Iffy Books in Philadelphia, started offering a 'toy quieting workshop' before and after the holiday season. For McLaughlin, who has a 5-year-old daughter, it was a screaming llama that 'inspired' him to start the workshop.\n'It was a walking llama, and it was fuzzy and had a leash attached, and there had to be a design oversight, because it was so loud it made my ears hurt,' he said. 'This llama was a problem, and it moved to the top of my closet, and I would see it peeking down at me.'\nAdvertisement\nAt his workshop, McLaughlin demonstrates how to open a toy up and add a resistor, which cuts down the noise. Emily Boda, 28, doesn't have children of her own, but as a mechanical engineer, she was curious about the process and offered to help neighbors with problem toys at both last year's and this year's workshop. Last year, she received three noisy toys and managed to quiet them all.\nThis year, Boda received four toys, including a book that made farm noises, an owl that swayed side to side, and a toy video game controller with knobs and switches.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'We only managed to quiet two out of the four,' she said. 'I was surprised at how much more difficult they were to fix — maybe they were just better made, which made them harder to take apart.'",

These are the things that college counselors say to American kids who aren't legacies, whose parents work double shifts and don't even know to send them to SAT prep classes. Where would they come up with the money to pay if they got accepted?\n'I promised my mom I would go to college,' said Daniel Mercado, 17, a soccer player at Wheaton High School in Maryland who wants to study accounting.\nAnd he thought getting in was going to be the difficult part.\nThen, the notice came from Hood College that showed him his hard work had paid off. He got in! And he got a spot as a left back on the Hood Blazers soccer team. But since January, he's been wrestling with the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, whose acronym, FAFSA, has nearly reached curse word status because of the headaches it has caused.\nAdvertisement\n'Me and my mom were sad and a little upset,' Daniel said of the process. For the last four months, he had been receiving an error message when trying to access the status of the aid he needs to keep his promise to his mom.\nDaniel said of the process. For the last four months, he had been receiving an error message when trying to access the status of the aid he needs to keep his promise to his mom.\nThe nationwide catastrophe that's become this year's 'Better FAFSA' process is delaying deadlines and decisions. Ordinarily, the FAFSA applications open in October, giving students plenty of time to know whether their financial aid package will cover their education.\nBut this application cycle, after Congress ordered up a streamlined application process, the forms didn't open until December. And they're as buggy as an August night in the Everglades. Students don't know if they can afford college, and as a result, schools across the nation are having their registration and housing systems gummed up during the time when all of this should be lining up.\nAdvertisement\nThat's frustrating. But what's heartbreaking is that the fiasco is having an outsize impact on students like Daniel.\n'The glitches impact the scholars we serve, first-generation-to-college scholars and scholars from low-income and immigrant households,' said Mecha Inman, the CEO of CollegeTracks, a Montgomery County program that helps students like Mercado navigate the college adventure. 'But it's also that their more affluent peers have already been able to enroll in college.'\nSo while Daniel and thousands of other students keep getting error messages or spend hours on hold trying to get a human to help them file their forms, whose parents know they'll be able to fork over $20,000 (or much, much more) next year are already selecting the best classes, getting the plum housing assignments, meeting their roommates and wearing their college colors in high school.\nAdvertisement\nAnd that inequity is hardest on those who were most skeptical of the college dream.\n'I'm the first one in my family to go,' said Angel Diaz, 20, who is now finishing his sophomore year at the University of Maryland. 'And even in my senior year of high school, I wasn't sure I'd make it.'\nHis mom cleans houses and his dad is in construction. Diaz figured his life would look something like theirs, so he enrolled in a carpentry trade school during his junior year of high school.\n'But it I didn't really like it,' he said. Numbers, he loved numbers. And he began to wonder if there was a way for him to make a living in a world that terrifies so many of us: banking or economics.\nWith the help of the CollegeTracks counselors, Diaz knocked down all the hurdles — financial, emotional, logistical. He was accepted to the University of Maryland and is steering toward a degree in economics. It's been a great ride, until now.\nAdvertisement\n'My mom doesn't have a social security number, so I can't fill out her part of the form and it's putting the whole thing on hold for me,' he said.\nHe's going to keep trying.\nThat's the plan, too, for Angad Bedi, 20, who is also a sophomore at the University of Maryland studying data analytics and in FAFSA limbo because his mom doesn't have a social security number — an omission that makes the new FAFSA form glitch out.\n'It's just an endless circle right now,' said Bedi, whose parents immigrated from India with the dream that their children would attend college.\n'If the financial aid doesn't come through, it becomes a big burden on my family,' Bedi said.\nBoth Diaz and Bedi say they're going to work over the summer, save and hope the FAFSA mess works itself out.\nBut those in the field say that not everyone shares their optimism.\nAdvertisement\n'There is absolutely the fear that students will give up,' said Lee Andes, the interim director of finance policy and innovation and associate director for financial aid at the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAndes is working with colleges and universities to push back some of their deadlines to make room for the students falling through the FAFSA cracks.\nErin McGrath, assistant director of college access and PK12 outreach for the same organization said the likelihood that students in this group will give up is high.\n'Any barrier you put up against a first generation student is taller, it's a larger barrier than it would be for a student that has a family that has already gone through this,' McGrath said.\nIt's making a tough process terrifying, said Rachel Lostumbo, a college success director at CollegeTracks.\nAdvertisement\n'They've all worked so hard and now they're powerless,' she said.\nThen, after we talked about the issues, she reached out to me with some good news.\nDaniel got the message that his financial aid went through. The shifts he's been pulling at Kohl's will give him a cushion. But the rest will be covered.\n'What I got is called a Pell Grant,' he told me. I could see the smile in his voice.

            "summary": "The Smithsonian Institution has canceled events featuring a drag performer and conducted an 'audit' of past drag programming, following a December congressional hearing in which Smithsonian Secretary Lonnie G. Bunch III told representatives that he didn't think it was appropriate to 'expose children to drag shows.'\nProposed collaborations between the Smithsonian and environmentalist and drag artist Pattie Gonia were canceled or postponed three times, in December, January and March, according to Gonia and emails reviewed by The Washington Post. A Smithsonian spokesperson said that this was a result of 'budgetary constraints and other resource issues.'\nThe Smithsonian had three events involving drag in 2023, the institution said, and museums are still developing programming for this year's National Pride Month in June. Drag artists have routinely been involved in the institution's Pride programs since Bunch assumed the role of secretary in 2019.\nAdvertisement\nSkip to end of carousel\nThe Style section\nThe Style section Style is where The Washington Post covers happenings on the front lines of culture and what it all means, including the arts, media, social trends, politics and yes, fashion, all told with personality and deep reporting. For more Style stories, click here\nEnd of carousel\nInternal emails obtained by The Post show some employees concerned over potential censorship, and an institution sometimes drawn into public controversies despite its best efforts to avoid them. Some Smithsonian staff said Bunch's comments, responding to questions from Rep. Stephanie Bice (R-Okla.), left them fearful of future removal of LGBTQ+ voices and programming at the organization, according to the emails and interviews with current employees.\n'I, along with all senior leaders, take seriously the concerns expressed by staff and will continue to do so,' said Bunch in a statement. 'As we have reiterated, LGBTQ+ content is welcome at the Smithsonian.'\nSince Bunch's congressional appearance, two employee groups have emailed him expressing fears about the future of such programming. Bunch said he planned to meet with leaders of one of the groups, the Smithsonian Pride Alliance, in an email to them on Friday.\nAdvertisement\nOn Jan. 2, Bunch told the Pride Alliance leadership team that Bice's line of questioning in the hearing was 'asked in a suggestive way,' and his response was 'to immediately stress that the Smithsonian does not expose children to inappropriate content.' He added that he was 'committed to coming together to find understanding and bring hope through our work.'\nBunch commended the team's 'courageous outreach' and wrote that he has 'always stood as an ally to the LGBTQIA+ communities.'\n'Unfortunately, as you can imagine, a hearing setting does not give you ample time to expand,' Bunch wrote. 'If so, it would have given me the opportunity to speak more broadly about the merits and goals of our programming and content development and how we equip parents to make choices about what content their children experience.'\nAdvertisement\n'Above all, the comments hurt staff,' the four-person team wrote back on Jan. 5. 'It hurt the staff who work hard on these programs and the staff who feel as though our bit of culture is being left out of the American story, despite contributing so very much to it.'\nThe group said that attacks on drag often feel like a 'thinly veiled' attack on the larger LGBTQ+ community.\nThe Smithsonian Institution is staffed by federal employees, has congressional oversight and receives more than $1 billion in federal money annually, but is not a government agency. The nonprofit institution spans 21 museums, research facilities and the National Zoo, and describes itself as the world's largest 'museum, education, and research complex.'\nThe cancellation of drag events after the hearing was first reported by the New Republic. Despite its mission to be bipartisan, the Smithsonian Institution is sometimes pulled into political debate — and occasionally has changed course amid external pressure.\nAdvertisement\nPerhaps most controversially, then–Smithsonian Secretary G. Wayne Clough in 2010 removed a video by artist David Wojnarowicz — which contained a scene of ants crawling over a crucifix — from an art exhibition after Republican politicians threatened to cut the institution's budget. More recently, in March, the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Latino settled a lawsuit from a conservative activist over its internship program.\nLast year, shortly before the Smithsonian's Asian American Literature Festival was unexpectedly canceled, staff had flagged four programs that might be controversial, including two with LGBTQ+ themes (the Smithsonian said the content review was not related to the festival's cancellation).\nNow, the institution has been drawn into a raging partisan debate on drag events.\nAdvertisement\nAt the hearing on Dec. 12, Bice asked Bunch about the institution's events that included performers in drag.\nBice told Bunch that the Smithsonian hosted six drag events over the past three years — citing Pride Month events including a virtual storytelling and a virtual art bingo night as open to children — before asking him, in 'what culture is exposing children to overly sexual material appropriate?'\n'I think it's not appropriate to expose children to drag shows,' Bunch said. 'I'm surprised and I will look into that.'\nShe shifted her focus to a June 2023 event for New York Pride that featured four Indigenous drag artists. Bunch said the event was not geared toward children. 'Even if it's not to children,' she said, 'why are we talking about that issue?'\n'That is a small part of whatever we do, and the reality is that the Smithsonian is trying to make sure that it embraces the totality of who we are as Americans,' Bunch said, 'but this is not a major part of what we do at all.'\nIn 2023, the country saw a wave of legislation targeting LGBTQ+ Americans, including more anti-trans bills introduced in a four-month period than in the past four years combined. The ACLU has tracked 21 bills in the 2024 state legislative session that it says are aimed at drag performance.\nAdvertisement\nGonia was initially invited to be featured in an Orchid Festival at the National Portrait Gallery and a complimentary environmental study day.

A dispute over energy exploration rights in 2020 led to the two countries' warships facing off in the Mediterranean.\nMonday's meeting in the Defense Ministry in Athens was to discuss confidence-building measures, following a similar meeting in Ankara last November. The two countries have engaged in the confidence-building process on and off for years, trying to seek common ground on a series of lower-key issues as a means of improving ties.\nAdvertisement\nThe meeting comes ahead of planned talks in Ankara on May 13 between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.\nTense ties have improved significantly over the past year, with Erdogan visiting Athens in December and signing a raft of trade, energy and education deals.\nBut Mitsotakis' announcement last week that Greece will create two marine parks for the protection of sea mammals and birds — one in the Ionian Sea in western Greece and one in the central Aegean — has angered Turkey.\nOmer Celik, spokesman for Erdogan's ruling party, said last week that Ankara considers the creation of the marine parks 'a step that sabotages the normalization process' in relations, and said Turkey would 'in no way allow actions toward the declaration of marine parks in the Aegean Sea.'\nAdvertisement\nMitsotakis, speaking last week after a meeting of European leaders in Brussels, expressed surprise at what he described as 'Turkey's totally unjustified reaction to an initiative which at the end of the day is of an environmental nature.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe Greek prime minister said the recent improvement in relations between Greece and Turkey was 'undeniable and measurable,' but that this did not mean Turkey had changed its positions on the delineation of maritime zones in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean.\n'These positions remain positions which are deeply problematic for our country,' Mitsotakis said.\n'But this does not prevent us from being able to talk, to create a general good climate and invest more in a positive agenda and less in the issues which divide us and over which we clearly disagree.'",

            "summary": "RICHMOND — Virginia lawmakers and Gov. Glenn Youngkin have reached a deal aimed at averting a nasty confrontation over the state budget, agreeing to set aside the current plan and work toward a new budget document sometime next month, according to two people close to the arrangements.\nYoungkin (R) met with Democratic and Republican leaders of the General Assembly on Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning ahead of a reconvened session of the legislature to find a procedural 'out' from a budget impasse over taxes and spending priorities.\nWith Democrats who control both chambers of the legislature expressing no interest in Youngkin's plan to drastically rewrite the budget they passed March 9, it seemed as though the state was careening toward a showdown in which Youngkin would exercise a first-ever veto of the entire budget.\nAdvertisement\nThat, in turn, would leave Virginia facing a possible — and unprecedented — shutdown of state government if no budget compromise was reached by the end of the current fiscal year on June 30.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nWednesday morning's deal finds both lawmakers and governor united around the idea of avoiding that breakdown in governance, which threatened to shake up Virginia's coveted AAA bond rating and undermine the state's reputation for sound fiscal management.\nAccording to the two people familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private negotiations, Youngkin and a bipartisan group of leaders from both the House of Delegates and state Senate met in the General Assembly Building and agreed to find a way out. That will involve the seemingly drastic step of rejecting all of Youngkin's 233 proposed amendments to the budget and then procedurally killing the underlying document, according to the two people.\nAdvertisement\nBut while that would seem to leave the state in even worse limbo, lawmakers and the governor have agreed to work to fashion a new two-year spending plan based on the General Assembly's budget, but with an acknowledgment of Youngkin's opposition to a proposal to extend the state's sales tax to digital goods and to apply the new tax to businesses as well as consumers.\nThere is no agreement to permanently scrap that plan, the people said, but an understanding that some kind of compromise will have to take place. Youngkin himself originally proposed the tax change, but it was in concert with other tax cuts that the legislature rejected. Youngkin's administration also announced Tuesday that the state is running a surplus of roughly $1 billion, offering a potential funding source for legislative priorities such as teacher raises and higher education.\nYoungkin and General Assembly leaders have agreed to hold a special legislative session, probably in mid-May, to wrap up the budget process well before the June 30 deadline.",

            "summary": "LIMA, Peru — A Peruvian psychologist who suffered from an incurable disease that weakened her muscles and had her confined to her bed for several years, died after being administered euthanasia by her doctor, her lawyer said Monday.\nAna Estrada fought for years in Peruvian courts for the right to die with dignity, and became a celebrity in the conservative country where euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal.\nIn 2022 Estrada was granted an exception by the nation's Supreme Court, which upheld a ruling by a lower court that gave Estrada the right to decide when to end her life, and said that those who helped her would not be punished. Estrada became the first person to obtain the right to die with medical assistance in Peru.\n'Ana's struggle for her right to die with dignity has helped to educate thousands of Peruvians about this right and the importance of defending it,' her lawyer, Josefina Miró Quesada, said in a statement. 'Her struggle transcended our nation's borders.'\nAdvertisement\nEstrada, 47, suffered from polymyositis, a disease that wastes away muscles and has no cure.\nShe began to present the first symptoms as a teenager and started to use a wheelchair at the age of 20 because she had lost the strength to walk.\nDespite these obstacles Estrada obtained a psychology degree and became a therapist. She earned enough money to buy her own apartment and became independent from her parents.\nBy 2017 however, Estrada's condition worsened and she could no longer get up from her bed.\nShe had difficulty breathing and survived pneumonia. And even though she could not type, Estrada used transcription software to produce a blog called 'Ana for a death with dignity,' where she discussed her struggles and her decision to seek euthanasia.\n'I am no longer free,' she said in an interview with the Associated Press in 2018. 'I am not the same person I was before.'\nAdvertisement\nWith the help of Peru's Human Rights Ombudsman, Estrada won a lawsuit that gave her the right to die with euthanasia. From her bed, she participated in court sessions through video conferences.\nEstrada told judges in 2022 that she valued life, and did not want to die immediately, but wanted to have the freedom to decide when to end her life.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'I want to accede to euthanasia when I can no longer sustain suffering in life,' she said. 'And when I decide to bid farewell to my loved ones in peace and with tranquility.'\nOnly a handful of countries have legalized euthanasia, including Canada, Belgium and Spain. Some U.S. states including Maine and Oregon allow physician-assisted suicide, where a doctor provides a terminally ill patient with the means to end life.\nEuthanasia is illegal in most Latin American countries, except for Colombia, which legalized it in 2015 and Ecuador, which decriminalized the practice in February.\n___",

He planned to lead Rainbow PUSH, which advocates for social justice and political activism, from Texas. He has been senior pastor since 1983 at Friendship-West, which has about 13,000 members, according to the church.\nAdvertisement\nHaynes said that even though the formal takeover was in February, he hit the ground running over the summer with duties in the office and hoped he could collaborate with Rainbow PUSH and Jackson in the future.\n'He remains one of my heroes. He remains one of the great leaders of all time,' Haynes said.\nIn his resignation letter, he said he plans to continue his work 'in the fight for liberation and freedom.'\nJackson — who was pivotal in the modern Civil Rights Movement — has faced numerous health issues in recent years and has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.\nStill, the 82-year-old two-time presidential candidate hasn't shied away from the public eye.",

            "excerpt": "Dozens of measures advanced in recent years aim to either restrict which books libraries can offer and threaten librarians for handing out 'obscene' or 'harmful' titles -- or to prohibit such bans or harassment.",
            "summary": "Sam Lee, head of the Connecticut Library Association, heads to work these days torn between hope and fear.\nShe's encouraged because legislators in her state proposed a bill this year making it harder for school boards to ban library books. But she's fearful because Connecticut, like America, is seeing a sustained surge in book challenges — and she wonders if objectors will see the legislation as a reason to file more complaints.\n'I would like to be optimistic,' Lee said. 'But having been in my position for the last few years … I don't know, it really feels like it's been forever. And I am worried the book banners are just going to be emboldened.'\nThe bill in Connecticut, pending before an education committee, is one of a raft of measures advancing nationwide that seek to do things like prohibit book bans or forbid the harassment of school and public librarians — the first such wave in the country, said John Chrastka, director of library advocacy group EveryLibrary. Legislators in 22 mostly blue states have proposed 57 such bills so far this year, and two have become law, according to a Washington Post analysis of state legislative databases and an EveryLibrary legislative tracker.\nAdvertisement\nBut the library-friendly measures are being outpaced by bills in mostly red states that aim to restrict which books libraries can offer and threaten librarians with prison or thousands in fines for handing out 'obscene' or 'harmful' titles. At least 27 states are considering 100 such bills this year, three of which have become law, The Post found. That adds to nearly a dozen similar measures enacted over the last three years across 10 states.\nLawmakers proposing restrictive bills contend they are necessary because school and public libraries contain graphic sexual material that should not be available to children. Some books' 'sole purpose is sexual gratification,' said West Virginia Del. Brandon Steele (R), who introduced a bill that would allow librarians to be prosecuted for giving obscene titles to minors.\n'It is strictly about pornography,' Steele said. 'On that limited basis, this isn't going to have the chilling effect people think it's going to.'\nAdvertisement\nBut other lawmakers say bills like Steele's are ideologically driven censorship dressed up as concern for children. They note that, as book challenges spiked to historic highs over the past two years, the majority of objections targeted books by and about LGBTQ people and people of color.\n'To attack library books, you're attacking the ability to learn, grow, think,' said Missouri state Rep. Anthony Ealy (D), who introduced a bill this year to prohibit book bans in public libraries. It 'has nothing to do with protecting kids.'\nChrastka of EveryLibrary said he fears red and blue parts of America are charting different courses for the future of reading.\n'I see an emerging divide about the right to read, the right to access stories about people like you, the right to be yourself in the library,' he said. 'We do have two Americas settling into place.'\nBanning book bans\nThe protective library laws being pushed around the country run the gamut: From increasing funding to adding school librarians to campuses to forbidding 'discrimination' in choosing which books to stock.\nA bill pending in New Jersey grants librarians the right to sue if they suffer 'emotional distress, defamation, libel, slander [or] damage to reputation' due to harassment from someone displeased with their books. Another, in California, stipulates public libraries cannot remove books 'for partisan or political reasons.'\nAdvertisement\n'We never thought we'd need it in writing,' said Rene Hohls, president of the California School Library Association. 'But we're grateful that our representatives are paying attention to this and putting it out there.'\nMany bills lay out procedures to guide book challenges. Some measures say objectors must prove they have read the book they are challenging. Others mandate book review committees must include members of minority racial groups.\nStill other measures, focused on public libraries, build on state and federal laws that forbid discrimination in public places due to a person's race, sex or gender. These bills assert that removing titles about, say, LGBTQ people, would violate the equal protection clause of the Constitution.\n'If we're not turning people away from the door based on the color of their skin or the fact they're wearing a rainbow pride flag, we should not be taking their books off the shelf,' said Chrastka of EveryLibrary. His organization developed sample language for this sort of law and has worked with lawmakers in roughly half a dozen states to introduce bills this year.\nAdvertisement\nOther protective bills outlaw book removals. Some draw inspiration from an Illinois law enacted last year that prohibits 'the practice of banning specific books or resources.' At the time, Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared his state was 'showing the nation what it really looks like to stand up for liberty.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAcross the country, president of the Vermont School Library Association Rebecca Sofferman was thrilled to see it.\nThis year, Vermont lawmakers have proposed three protective bills. One would prohibit removing library books due to 'school board members' or member of the public's discomfort, personal morality, political views, or religious views.'\nLast week, Sofferman drove to Montpelier to testify in favor of one of these bills, which she called 'heartening.'\n'Even if the laws don't pass,' she said, 'they get people talking.'\nLibrarians face jail time\nSome restrictive library bills give parents more power over book selection, for example requiring schools obtain parental sign-off before providing children sexually explicit content. Another common move is to require that libraries post lists of their books for parental review.\nAdvertisement\nBut the majority of the bills work the same way. They eliminate long-established exemptions from prosecution for librarians — sometimes teachers and museum employees, too — over obscene material. Almost every state adopted such carve-outs decades ago to ensure schools, museums and libraries could offer accurate information about topics such as sex education.\nRemoving the exemption means librarians, teachers and museum staffers could face years of imprisonment or tens of thousands in fines for giving out books deemed sexually explicit, obscene or 'harmful' to minors. For example, an Arkansas measure passed last year says school and public librarians can be imprisoned for up to six years or fined $10,000 if they hand out obscene or harmful titles.\nThe law protects children and doesn't harm librarians unless they're doing something awful, bill sponsor Sen. Dan Sullivan (R) said at the time: 'If they don't knowingly violate [the law], they're free and clear.'\nAdvertisement\nSeventeen states are weighing some version of this measure, The Post found. That comes after at least eight states enacted such laws between 2021 and last year, although two were later vetoed and one was blocked by the courts.\nThe Post could not find an instance in which a librarian has been charged under these laws. But Peter Bromberg of the Utah Library Association pointed out several recent cases in which police were called to schools or launched investigations over books — in Missouri, Texas and South Carolina.\nIt has forged a poisonous atmosphere for librarians, said Megan Tarbett, a county library director in West Virginia and president of her state's library association. West Virginia considered a bill this year ending exemptions from prosecution over 'obscene' material for schools, public libraries and materials, but it failed to pass.\nAdvertisement\nEven so, Tarbett said, she worries legislators will reintroduce the bill, scaring potential librarians away from the profession: 'It's going to be hard where you could go to jail for doing your job.'\nIn some places, librarians have already called it quits.\nTara White was appointed Elkhart Community Schools' director of literacy in 2015. For the first several years, she never fielded a book challenge — until 2021, when community members objected to 60 titles, she said. When she defended the books, a conservative website claimed she was fighting for porn in school.\nThen last year, Indiana passed a law declaring school employees can face criminal prosecution — leading to a possible $10,000 fine or 2½ years of jail time — for handing out sexual material that is 'harmful to minors.'\nWhite resigned.\n'I loved being a librarian and … helping every student find themselves in a book,' White said. But while certain she wasn't actually 'breaking the law, nobody wants to go through that process.'",

            "summary": "Regarding Colbert I. King's April 6 op-ed, 'D.C. has a truancy problem. Solutions must include the home.':\nMr. King has done D.C. a service on this vexing and chronic issue once again. He very correctly points out the shortcomings of the D.C. government's policies in this problem area. Clearly, the deputy mayor for education and the schools need to play a crucial role in dealing with this. But, as Mr. King points out, unless and until the parents are required (and helped) to meet their responsibilities, major improvements are unlikely to happen. Two issues remain unaddressed, however: First, does the deputy mayor have the will and capacity to take the needed actions? And second, to what degree are poverty and, say, single-mother households behind the problem, and if so what problem-solving options do we have?\nRichard Moore , Washington\nRichard Moore, Washington\nFocusing on children's health\nThe April 11 news article 'Ohio GOP governor sells public health by focusing on kids' has an important undertone. Investing in children's health is our most powerful lever to create a healthier society and stronger economy. Gov. Mike DeWine (R) says, 'It's hard to sell stuff on the basis of public health.' I know the feeling. As a pediatric surgeon and CEO of a children's health system, I fight the uphill battle of selling public health every day.\nAdvertisement\nI believe Mr. DeWine has got it right. In this country, we mistakenly equate health with medical care. Medical care is an important but relatively small part of health. The governor's health agenda is built around children, as it should be. It includes safety, good nutrition, freedom from violence, early education and more. All these factors are major determinants of health, and all can be markedly affected by small investments during childhood.\nBeyond improving our population's health, this agenda's economic benefits are enough to appeal to both sides of the aisle. Studies show that spending a dollar now to set a child up for lifelong health yields shockingly high returns to taxpayers and the broader economy for years, decades and even generations to come. Mr. DeWine is correct in saying, 'Everyone wants to see kids do better.' I couldn't agree more. It is time to prioritize public health by investing in our children.\nR. Lawrence Moss , Jacksonville, Fla.\nR. Lawrence Moss, Jacksonville, Fla.\nAdvertisement\nThe writer is president and chief executive of Nemours Children's Health.\nThe writer is president and chief executive of Nemours Children's Health.\nInclude nature in urban planning\nRegarding the April 10 Climate Lab analysis, 'Mapping America's access to nature, neighborhood by neighborhood':\nNatureScore reinforces that urban nature is absolutely critical to the health of cities and their inhabitants. We saw this vividly during the pandemic beginning in 2020, when urban dwellers relied on green spaces as a rare source of beautiful and socially distanced outdoor respite.\nClimate change gives us the clear imperative — and opportunity — to prioritize nature in the urban planning of U.S. cities. What does this look like? A study from the Global Center for Clean Air Research finds that the unique infrastructure of botanical gardens has a measurable cooling effect on city air temperatures. This emphasizes the importance of plants, including trees, in greening our cities. By restoring and conserving a diverse array of plant life, especially in dense urban environments, we create much more livable cities for people, wildlife and future generations.\nAdvertisement\nNo less valuable are the communities that green spaces cultivate. Urban farms and community gardens are a powerful way to plant social connections, while also spreading nature within cities.\nWe urge all city leaders and urban planners to support well-managed urban conservation projects and green spaces. As the percentage of Americans living in cities rises sharply, doing so has the potential to be transformational.\nJennifer Bernstein , New York\nJennifer Bernstein, New York\nThe writer is president and CEO of the New York Botanical Garden.\nThe writer is president and CEO of the New York Botanical Garden.\nNot all experiences are the same\nRegarding Ariel Dorfman's April 11 Thursday Opinion commentary, 'Ecuador takes a page from Pinochet with embassy assault':\nBefore we condemn Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa to purgatory for violating Mexico's sovereignty by storming its embassy in Quito to arrest former vice president Jorge Glas, let's look at what Mr. Dorfman did not say in his piece. Mr. Dorfman compares this action with his own experience of escaping a certain death at the hands of oppressive military dictator Augusto Pinochet by finding refuge in the Argentine Embassy in Santiago, Chile, in 1973.\nAdvertisement\nBut Mr. Dorfman was truly vulnerable, and his refugee status saved his life. Mr. Glas, on the other hand, was convicted twice for corruption, receiving prison sentences of six and eight years. In one case, he was convicted of taking millions of dollars from a Brazilian construction company and, in the other, he was found guilty for his role in a scheme that collected bribes for public procurement.\nTo further question whether Mr. Glas was even worthy of asylum, he was released from prison early in a controversial ruling by Judge Emerson Curipallo. Judge Curipallo is now in custody pending an investigation into his alleged role in a bribery scheme involving favorable rulings for a drug lord and others.\nMr. Dorfman cites the importance of respecting the 20th-century refugee protections that are included in a series of agreements and laws. Are these protections designed for convicted criminals? If so, where then does the search for asylum by bad people end?\nAdvertisement\nMaybe it's time to revisit these agreements and laws to ensure that those most vulnerable are protected in their time of need while not giving protection to convicted criminals such as Mr. Glas.\nCurtis Schaeffer , Falls Church\nCurtis Schaeffer, Falls Church\nThe need for Ukraine aid\nRegarding the April 15 news article 'Iran attacks add urgency to stalled aid efforts for Israel':\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nWithout reservation, I support Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. I agree entirely that Israel is of central political and historical importance to the United States. This said, I take issue with Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) when he states that 'Israel's a much closer ally, is a much more core American national security interest' than Ukraine.\nMr. Vance is dead wrong. When Israel is attacked, we must surely support it with the weapons and materiel needed to secure their self-defense. To my knowledge, however, we are not bound by treaty to place troops in Israel, nor to make war directly against another nation on Israel's behalf. The same cannot be said of Europe.\nAdvertisement\nRussia has made clear that it aspires eventually to reconquer those European countries once comprising the Soviet empire. Ukraine stands in the way of that aspiration. Some countries of the old U.S.S.R. are now our NATO allies, whom we are formally required to defend in the event of attack. Should Ukraine fall, and history be a guide, Russia would gain borders with its former vassal states and then could pick its spots to begin snatching territory from NATO's easternmost members. In this case, more U.S. troops would have to be deployed to Europe at incalculable risk to us and the entire world.\nIn a real sense, the United States is already fighting its war with Russia. Ukrainian citizens, however, are doing the fighting for us; their lives and their blood, not ours, are lost. What do we gain for the money and equipment supplied to NATO or to Ukraine? We gain the privilege of watching a war fought on European ground, at massive cost to its people and not so much to ours — in my view, a pretty good bargain.\nMr. Vance and his some of his Republican colleagues in Congress seem to be advocating for Russia, in effect making arguments for the Russian cause. My response: It is neither fair nor accurate to compare the gravity and enormity of our obligation to NATO (or Ukraine) with our close ties to Israel or, please, to connect any of this with our problems at the border with Mexico.\nAdvertisement\nBill Coe , Washington\nBill Coe, Washington\nThree parties aren't a crowd\nIn the April 9 Prompt 2024 newsletter, 'Why is it so hard to find a winning third-party candidate?,' Alexi McCammond and her colleagues made several meritorious points. However, it is important to note that third-party and independent candidates must contend with various built-in roadblocks from state sore-loser and disaffiliation laws to debate rules controlled by the two-party duopoly and designed to stifle competition.\nAdditionally, in the case of No Labels' recent attempt to recruit a 'unity ticket,' potential candidates were fearful of playing the role of spoiler and tipping the election to Donald Trump. Enactment by each state of a unified, nonpartisan/open primary system in conjunction with ranked-choice voting (RCV) as practiced in Alaska would render moot that major criticism of the No Labels ballot access effort. RCV shuts down the spoiler argument by eliminating the candidate with the least number of votes round by round until a majority of votes is obtained by one candidate. Such a reform offers a long-term solution to reduce polarization in our politics, and serves fairness as opposed to disenfranchisement by allowing independent/unaffiliated voters to participate in state-funded primaries. No Labels and other like-minded groups can work together to advocate such reforms and need not win an election to win the day.\nKenneth F. Cerullo , Mahwah, N.J.\nKenneth F. Cerullo, Mahwah, N.J.",

            "summary": "JERUSALEM — Israel has not provided evidence that significant numbers of workers with the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees are tied to militant groups, but urged the agency to implement more robust vetting of staff members to ensure neutrality and work to reestablish trust with donors, a highly anticipated report said Monday.\nBased on an examination of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency's screening procedures, code of ethics, management structure, staff training and other practices, the independent review group concluded that the agency has 'established and updated a significant number of policies, mechanisms and procedures' to uphold neutrality in recent years but is in need of critical reforms.\n'In the absence of a political solution between Israel and the Palestinians, UNRWA remains pivotal in providing lifesaving humanitarian aid and essential social services, particularly in health and education, to Palestinian refugees in Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank,' the report said.\nAdvertisement\nThe U.N. General Assembly established UNRWA in 1949 to help Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the creation of the state of Israel. More than seven decades later, UNRWA continues to administer government-like services for more than 5 million people across Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.\nThe findings released Monday will largely come as a relief to the embattled agency, which was pitched into an existential crisis in January after Israel alleged that a dozen of its 13,000 employees in Gaza participated in the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks, and that the agency was widely infiltrated by Hamas and other militant groups.\nSixteen major donors, including the United States, suspended funding worth about $450 million, nearly half of UNRWA's budget for the year. UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini immediately fired the staff members in question — a sign, he said, of how seriously the agency took the allegations. But Israel — long opposed to an agency that it sees as perpetuating the Palestinian refugee issue and stoking antisemitism — called for UNRWA to be disbanded.\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said in February, without providing evidence, that Israel had intelligence indicating that an additional 30 UNRWA workers participated in the Oct. 7 assault and that 12 percent of UNRWA's workers in the Gaza Strip were affiliated with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller Islamist group in the Gaza Strip.\nAdvertisement\nUnited Nations Secretary General António Guterres commissioned the independent review group that month 'to assess whether the Agency is doing everything within its power to ensure neutrality and to respond to allegations of serious breaches when they are made.'\nThe body, led by former French foreign minister Catherine Colonna and a trio of Scandinavian research institutions, did not examine the accusations that some UNRWA employees took part in the Oct. 7 attacks; those claims are being probed separately by investigators from the U.N. Office of Internal Oversight Services, which is expected to release its own report later this year.\nIn some ways, this was the higher-stakes investigation: Several major donors, including Germany and the United Kingdom, have said the restoration of their funding to the agency rests on assessments of its neutrality.\nAdvertisement\nThe group spoke with more than 200 people, including senior UNRWA leaders across the region and officials from donor states, host countries, Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Egypt, during its nine-week review.\nIts final report outlined a variety of measures, including staff training and investigation procedures, that the agency has taken to maintain neutrality and discipline employees who violate humanitarian principles. It also said UNRWA has mechanisms in place to prevent its facilities from being misused for political or military purposes, though it called for more regular inspections.\nOn staff vetting, the report said UNRWA shares staff lists annually with host countries and with Israel for East Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank. The United States also receives the lists upon request. These states are then responsible for raising any red flags — but Israel had not done so since 2011, the report said.\nAdvertisement\nThe Israeli foreign ministry informed the group that it had received staff lists without Palestinian identification numbers before March 2024.\n'On the basis of the March 2024 list, which contained Palestinian ID numbers, Israel made public claims that a significant number of UNRWA employees are members of terrorist organizations,' the report said. 'However, Israel has yet to provide supporting evidence of this.'\nUNRWA currently screens all affiliates biannually against the U.N. sanctions list. But the sanctions roster is 'limited to a small number of individuals, and UNRWA lacks the support of intelligence services to undertake efficient and comprehensive vetting.'\nUNRWA has already agreed to provide donors with lists of its employees, including ID card information, every quarter. The report called on host countries and Israel to screen staff and share evidence of any concerning findings.\nAdvertisement\nThe group also examined Israeli allegations that UNRWA-run schools rely on educational materials that deny Israel's right to exist and glorify violence resistance. Colonna's team said UNRWA has taken steps to purge politicized material from Palestinian Authority textbooks, noting that a review last year found a 'small fraction' of textbook pages contain objectionable content.\n'Even if marginal, these issues constitute a grave violation of neutrality,' the report said, urging UNRWA to audit the content of learning materials with Israeli and other authorities.\nAcross the board, lack of funding significantly hampers efforts to uphold the organization's neutrality, the group found.\nUNRWA is unique in the United Nations ecosystem since it provides basic services to a specific population and draws most of its 32,000 employees from the pool of Palestinian refugees it serves. Staff are 'living the occupation,' which creates both valuable expertise and challenges to ensuring neutrality, Adam Bouloukos, UNRWA's West Bank director, said in an interview last month.\nAdvertisement\n'Neutrality breaches by UNRWA personnel often take the form of social media posts, particularly following incidents of violence affecting colleagues or relatives,' the report said, recommending that the agency do more to create space for workers to discuss traumatic events.\nStill, agency policy — as outlined by the review group — requires employees to show neutrality at all times or risk disciplinary measures. UNRWA vehemently rejects accusations it is widely infiltrated by Hamas or is complicit in militant activity. It says Israel has still not provided detailed evidence to back up its allegations.\nThe U.S. intelligence community could not verify the Israeli claims about Oct. 7 with a high degree of confidence, officials told The Post in February.\nA Washington Post analysis found that the face and vehicle of a man who was captured in CCTV footage from Kibbutz Beeri on Oct. 7 dragging the limp body of an Israeli man into a car appeared to match that of Faisal Ali Musalam Naami, 45, an UNRWA social worker identified by Israel as a participant in the attacks. Otherwise, The Post has been unable to independently verify the Israeli allegations.\nAdvertisement\nUNRWA, meanwhile, said this month that Palestinian UNRWA staff in Gaza detained by the IDF had been subjected to mistreatment in Israeli custody and were 'pressured during interrogations to make forced confessions against the Agency.'\n'The IDF acts in accordance with Israeli and international law in order to protect the rights of the detainees held in the detention and questioning facilities,' the IDF said in a statement to The Post.\nOn top of funding challenges, the agency says Israel has restricted its access to northern Gaza and has repeatedly hit its UNRWA facilities in Gaza. Lazzarini told the Security Council last week that 178 UNRWA workers have been killed since the start of the war, and called for an investigation. West Bank staff have faced increased harassment by Israeli soldiers and settlers. In East Jerusalem, Israeli politicians are seeking to evict UNRWA from its headquarters.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's postwar plan for Gaza, unveiled in February, envisions the dismantling of UNRWA.\nAdvertisement\n'UNRWA is Hamas and Hamas is UNRWA,' Gilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, told the U.N. Security Council last week.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'Israel cannot and will not allow UNRWA to continue in Gaza as it did in the past,' he said. 'The time has come to defund UNRWA.'\nDespite the hard-line rhetoric, some officials in Jerusalem quietly acknowledge that doing away with the agency in the near future could undermine Israeli interests, since UNRWA provides aid and services in the West Bank and Gaza that Israel is loath to take on.\nGaza is in the throes of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis, with more than 2 million people at risk of famine, according to the world's top body for assessing food insecurity.\nUNRWA is 'the backbone of the humanitarian operation' in Gaza, Lazzarini told the Security Council last week, making a desperate pitch for member states to support an agency 'under enormous strain.'\nMost major donors have restored funding since January. But U.S. contributions — which at $422 million in 2023 dwarfed those of the next largest donors — are on hold until March 2025, after Republicans in Congress tacked a year-long funding ban onto a government spending package last month.\nEven so, the Biden administration has continued to publicly acknowledge UNRWA's importance to the region: U.S. deputy ambassador to the United Nations Robert Wood told the Security Council on Wednesday that it plays an 'indispensable role' in Gaza.\nGuterres accepted the recommendations and agreed with Lazzarini that UNRWA will 'establish an action plan' to implement them, spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said in a statement Monday.",

But on a recent afternoon, security officers watched as people scanned their school IDs to get in: An unauthorized protest was about to happen.\nInside, a phalanx of students suddenly appeared alongside the school's administration building, marching in black with kaffiyehs covering their faces. Another masked group appeared on the other side, descending the stairs. Soon protesters were massed at the center of campus, holding signs with messages such as 'GLOBALIZE THE INTIFADA.'\nXavier Westergaard, a doctoral candidate in biology, walked through the pro-Palestinian group wearing a yarmulke evoking the bright blue and white of Israel's flag, sat down facing the protesters, and began reading psalms aloud.\nA few tried to drown out the rally with a bullhorn. An Israeli professor kept demanding that university officials monitoring the event explain why it wasn't being shut down. The campus had been warned that students could be disciplined for attending the unauthorized demonstration. Some had just been suspended for a previous event. But protesters kept coming.\n'We will honor all the martyrs!' a tightly masked speaker called out. Protesters spoke of the deadly bombing of a hospital in Gaza, and — using a phrase heard by some as a Palestinian rallying cry and by others as an outright call to annihilate Israel — chanted, 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!'\nAdvertisement\nSix months after the Hamas attack, tensions over the Israel-Gaza war remain raw on college campuses, and administrators continue to face questions over their responses to protests such as this one. At Columbia, a school with a long history of student activism, some are asking whether the school is now censoring and stifling freedom of expression — or has repeatedly failed to protect vulnerable students from hatred.\nOn Wednesday, focus on what's happening on the campus will intensify as Columbia President Minouche Shafik will face questions from lawmakers about whether the university has done enough to combat antisemitism.

Like three other university presidents before her — all women, all relatively new to the role — she has been summoned to testify before a congressional committee.\nAt the previous hearing, the legalistic responses of the presidents of MIT, Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania — including when they declined to say that calls for the genocide of Jews would violate campus policies — outraged many and sharpened distrust of academia, especially on the political right. And it effectively toppled the presidencies of two Ivy League universities: Within weeks, Penn and Harvard's presidents had resigned.\nAt a time of intense polarization, university leaders across the country are trying to strike a delicate balance to protect their academic mission: To allow people to speak their minds without harming others, and to cultivate listening as well as shouting.\nShafik declined a request for an interview. 'Columbia is committed to combating antisemitism,' a university spokesperson said, 'and we welcome the opportunity to discuss our work to protect and support Jewish students and keep our community safe.'\nTensions on campus\nAt Columbia, protests are far less frequent than they were immediately after the war began, and are confined by new rules. But they can still be hostile, pitting student against student. Some say there have been improvements to the campus culture this semester. Others say divisions are hardening, and rhetoric is becoming more extreme. Lawsuits have been filed against the university by both pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian groups.

Issues from all over the world end up on campus, he said. ' But this particular issue has a unique ability to raise the temperature way past the boiling point more than any other.'\n'But this particular issue has a unique ability to raise the temperature way past the boiling point more than any other.'\nThe tensions extend far beyond Columbia. A study of thousands of college students by the University of Chicago found that, in surveys conducted in December and January, 56 percent of Jewish college students, 52 percent of Muslim college students and 16 percent of other college students felt they were in personal danger — suggesting that 2 to 3 million U.S. students have been living in fear.\nAt Yale University, students supporting Palestinians and divestment from weapons companies launched a hunger strike this weekend. Vanderbilt University expelled and suspended students earlier this month after a protest. The Center for Islamic Life at Rutgers University was vandalized.\nAt Columbia in recent years, debate over Israel and Palestine has included divestment campaigns, calls for the university to end partnerships in Tel Aviv, student government votes, and faculty letters and petitions on opposing sides.\nBut the Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the ferocity of Israel's response in Gaza ignited demonstrations that immediately felt all-consuming and very personal for some, further dividing groups of students, faculty and others, multiple people on campus said.\nA lawsuit filed earlier this year against Columbia and Barnard College argues that Columbia enforces policies to avoid protecting Jewish and Israeli students from harassment, and hires professors who support anti-Jewish violence and spread antisemitic propaganda. Barnard is both an independent educational institution and a college of Columbia.\nAdvertisement\nDavid M. Schizer, a professor of law and economics who is helping to lead the antisemitism task force, said Columbia has mostly been exceptionally welcoming to Jewish and Israeli students and all others — but there have been challenges, and those were exacerbated by the war. In one case, Schizer said, a\nlaw student, who wears a yarmulke and is supportive of Israel, was observing a pro-Palestinian protest when someone spit on him, Schizer said. When he began to leave, Schizer said others at the protest began taunting him, saying things such as, 'You bomb hospitals,' 'You kill babies,' and, 'Tell your Israelis we're coming for you.'\nSeveral students said that some student clubs — even for dance and activities unrelated to the conflict in the Middle East — had become unwelcoming for Jewish and Israeli students as broad alliances formed backing Palestinian groups.\nWhat's happening in Gaza is a tragedy, Westergaard said, and people should be able to debate Israeli policies. But using phrases such as 'Death to the Zionist state,' or advocating for the destruction of any country is barbaric, he said.\nJonny Rosen, a junior from Baltimore whose grandmother survived the Holocaust, said he sometimes tries to talk with pro-Palestinian protesters, like when they chant 'intifada,' to ask if they know the history of the word.\nBut most refuse to interact, he said, when they see his yarmulke. 'It really feeds into the polarization on campus,' he said. 'How can anyone grow or learn, if we're not having conversations?'\nAdvertisement\nSome pro-Palestinian students said people on the opposing side are misunderstanding or distorting their views, as when they call them antisemitic for criticizing Israel.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nLayla Saliba, a student from North Carolina studying social work, said she has been accused of being part of Hamas.

So we're at a very dangerous time.'\nLurie is president of the school's chapter of the American Association of University Professors, which has registered alarm at what the organization sees as violations of academic freedom since the war began.\nwhat the organization sees as violations of academic freedom since the war began.\nLast month, the New York Civil Liberties Union and Palestine Legal filed a lawsuit against Columbia, saying the university's decision this fall to suspend two student groups, Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace, was unlawful.\nAdvertisement\n'I was only here for a year prior to this madness,' said Maryam Alwan, an organizer with Columbia's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine and a plaintiff in the case. 'That's been enough time to see the complete erosion of democracy, free speech, even my own sense of belonging and safety as a Palestinian student in the past six months.'\nThere's a lot of external pressure on the university, she said, from donors and from politicians, to discipline pro-Palestinian students and activism.\nIn a note to the campus after the recent protest, Shafik wrote, 'I did not become a university president to punish students.' But she said several students had been suspended as the university investigates an event held in campus housing that the university had barred, with outside speakers known to support terrorism and promote violence.\nseveral students had been suspended as the university investigates an event held in campus housing that the university had barred, with outside speakers known to support terrorism and promote violence.\n'I want to make clear that it is absolutely unacceptable for any member of this community to promote the use of terror or violence,' Shafik said.\nA pro-Palestinian student who said she had received an interim suspension and spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation by the university, said she was told to leave her student housing within 24 hours.

'Because when it comes to anti-Zionist Jews who demonstrate with us, who organize with us, Columbia does not care for their safety and actually enables violence, targeting and repression against them.'\nThe Columbia Task Force on Antisemitism issued its first report last month, suggesting stricter enforcement of existing rules to allow demonstrations in certain central spaces but to keep them from disrupting classrooms or dorms. It also suggested separating competing protests, and stopping them as they occurred, if necessary, rather than imposing discipline later. The recommendations, they wrote, could also help efforts to combat other types of bigotry, including anti-Arab bias and Islamophobia.\nIn February, the university implemented interim rules for demonstrations that included a requirement of two days' notice, prohibition on protests in academic spaces and consequences for violations.\nThe task force is part of a broader university-wide effort to foster more civil, academic debates. It's great to be in a setting where students can learn from people coming from different experiences, Tejasri Vijayakumar, Columbia College student body president, said, 'but it's not always going to feel comfortable, you know?' The war has been so personal and so traumatic for many on campus, she said, that it can be helpful to step back. 'Let's bring this back to the classroom a little bit.'\nWhile students routinely come together without incident, as at a spring music festival earlier this month, fault lines can be thrown suddenly into stark relief. At the recent protest, after speeches punctuated by protesters drumming, blowing horns and banging pots together, pro-Palestinian protesters abruptly began to march away from the school's central Sundial directly past Jewish and Israeli students. Rosen said the move made him nervous; his mind flashed to the idea that they might form a sort of wall around them.\nA few counterprotesters, waving an Israeli and an American flag, kept taunting the crowd. 'Free, free Palestine,' a student chanted sardonically, ' — from Hamas!'\nAs the protest moved toward academic buildings, a university official handed papers to marchers warning that they were violating campus rules. Some fluttered to the ground as people refused to take them, or dropped them in disdain.\nMarchers made a loop around the Morningside campus, chanting and waving signs. They slapped 'ISRAEL BOMBS' stickers onto surfaces as they went, including a bronze sculpture of a lion, Columbia's mascot. Rosen followed, at a distance, listening.\nA Palestinian student approached him. He began by telling Rosen he was sorry if he had lost anyone on Oct. 7.\ntelling Rosen he was sorry if he had lost anyone on Oct. 7.\nRosen said he agrees with much of what has been said about the loss of innocent lives in Gaza. The other student told Rosen he wouldn't chant for intifada because of the history of that word, which Rosen appreciated. As they spoke, there was understanding of the complexities. There was disagreement, especially about Israeli military strategies. The two of them sat down, joined by a few other students. The protest marched on.\n'I was more interested,' Rosen said, 'in having a conversation with him.'\nAdvertisement",

Doing so, I believe, is our best chance to convince those who remain unsure about vaccines of their necessity.\nDeirdre from Maryland was a pediatric nurse during the 1970s. She recalls caring for children devastated by diseases that are now vaccine-preventable. They were 'dependent on tube feedings and having intractable seizures,' she wrote.\nThe dean of her nursing school was wheelchair-bound from contracting polio as a student nurse. She also remembers learning that there were special college scholarships to encourage students to major in audiology because there were so many kids who lost hearing as a lasting consequence of contagious illnesses.\nAdvertisement\n'The ultimate irony of the success of childhood immunizations is people under 60 have no memory of the lifelong disabilities children and adults had as a result of these diseases,' she shared.\nPeg from Massachusetts also urged people to consider the consequences to babies born to women who contract the diseases during pregnancy.\n'As a pediatric audiologist, I have seen hundreds of cases of deafness, blindness and cognitive impairment in children whose mothers contracted rubella during pregnancy,' she wrote. 'These cases came to a near standstill after the widespread use of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.'\nLike Ina Pinkney, whom I had the honor of profiling in my column last week, Susan from Arizona is a polio survivor. She contracted the virus in 1946, nine years before the first polio vaccine was made available.\nAdvertisement\nShe recalls that there were children in hospital wards who eventually stopped crying after repeated pleas to see their parents could not be met.

In her 20s, she developed post-polio syndrome. In total, she has had five surgeries for nerve impingement. Part of her hip was transplanted on her ankle. 'Pain and fatigue have always been a part of my life,' she told me.\nNow retired from her career as a nurse-educator, Susan describes her mother as being 'shamed, blamed and marginalized' because of her daughter's illness. On the day her mother died, she learned that her mother was haunted by the guilt that she was the one who gave her daughter polio.\nAdvertisement\n'Although we shared the lifetime emotional pain of polio, we did not talk directly about this until the evening of her death,' Susan wrote to me. 'Talking openly would have been too painful.'\nRuth from Virginia also shared a moving story about a family member — her little sister, Beth, who was barely a year and a half old when she contracted measles in 1949. Ruth believes her sister was exposed to the virus at a doctor's office.\n'One night when my brother and I were asleep, our parents brought her to the hospital,' she wrote. 'Either that night or the next, she died.'\nRuth recalls being in her parents' bed the next morning crying with her younger brother. 'I have carried that grief around me ever since,' she wrote.

New OC Tim Lester was hired in early February.\nThat meant this spring has been about installing a new offense to replace one that ranked among the worst in Division I the last two seasons.\nIt's been an education, offensive lineman Nick DeJong said.\n'At Iowa, coaching changes don't happen a lot,' DeJong said. 'It's not something we're used to. But they've done a really good job of mixing some of our old terminology with some of the new stuff.'\nIowa went 10-4 last season, winning the Big Ten West Division. But the Hawkeyes ranked last out of 130 teams in total offense and 129th in scoring offense, averaging 15.4 points per game. Three of their losses were shutouts, including the Big Ten championship game against Michigan and the Citrus Bowl against Tennessee.\nAdvertisement\nLester was an analyst with the NFL's Green Bay Packers last season after six seasons as head coach at Western Michigan. He is being counted on to revive the offense, even if it still will have some of the principles that Kirk Ferentz has employed since his first season at Iowa in 1999.\n'It's different terminology, being a new playbook,' wide receiver Kaleb Brown said. 'But it's the same kind of concepts.'\nFerentz has always talked about 'complementary football' with offense, defense and special teams, and he still wants that, even with a new offensive coordinator.\n'Yeah, I think (the offense) is going to look different, but I think philosophically we're in line,' Ferentz said. 'Not that it was a prerequisite, but he's been a head coach, and I think he understands how all three things function together. We played good defense here for pretty much 20-plus years. That was a building block coming in.'\nAdvertisement\nLearning the new language of the offense was something players said was the biggest part of the spring transition.\n'There's obviously differences in the schemes,' DeJong said. 'In terms of fundamentals, it doesn't change a whole lot. But schematically, it changes, the Xs and Os.'\nTight end Addison Ostrenga, who tied for the team lead in receptions with 31 last season, said there is more pre-snap movement with this offense.\n'It's a big difference hearing the play calls, and then going out and running them,' Ostrenga said.\nThe installation of the offense is going to be a process. Cade McNamara, No. 1 on the depth chart at quarterback, is limited in spring workouts as he recovers from a knee injury that sidelined him most of last season, but is expected to be at full strength for summer workouts.\nAdvertisement\nDeacon Hill, who made nine starts last season and averaged just 88.6 passing yards per game while throwing eight interceptions against just five touchdowns, has taken most of the snaps with the No. 1 offense this spring.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'Learning a new offense — I mean, this is my third time doing it,' said Hill, who started his career at Wisconsin. 'But this is by far the hardest I've had to learn. At some point it just clicks — what's going on, why you're doing certain things. Obviously, still, there are going to be mistakes. But it's getting better.'\nHill said Lester is an 'intense' coach.\n'But it's a good intense,' he said. 'He's very positive a lot of the time, but if you mess up, he won't be as positive. He'll yell at you, like any other coach. He knows what he's talking about.'\nLester has made an impact other Hawkeyes have felt.\n'I like the way he thinks, and game plans.' Brown said.\n___",

Like the sequence on a fishing trawler straight out of 'The Guns of Navarone' that opens this liberally fictionalized account of a covert 1942 mission. Dubbed Operation Postmaster, its goal was to take down a German supply ship full of U-boat carbon dioxide filters, which would factor into a crucial turning point in the war.\nTo turbocharge the bro-historic intrigue and get the astronomical body count going in this shoot-'em-up grand theft aquatic, Ritchie must first assemble a ragtag squad of lethal (and lethally photogenic) heroes so rascally you know they'll get the bloody job done. You see, Hitler is marching across Europe, Britain's in a bind, and Winston Churchill (Rory Kinnear, beneath a mountain of prostheses) is desperate enough to clandestinely okay a deniable, off-the-books mission. Luckily, Brigadier Gubbins (Cary Elwes), head of the secret Special Operations Executive (SEO) org, knows just the rakish rule breaker for the job.\nAdvertisement\nEnter Gus March-Phillips (Henry Cavill), leader of a team of ruthless killers willing to play dirty to disrupt Nazi business off the African coast. His squad is Anders Lassen (Alan Ritchson), a Danish hulk with an exaggerated lilt and astounding archery skills; Freddy Alvarez (Henry Golding), a frogman with a talent for explosives; Geoffrey Appleyard (Alex Pettyfer), a master strategist; and cunning young Irish sailor Henry Hayes (Hero Fiennes Tiffin).\nThey're not in it alone. Already in place on the Spanish island of Fernando Po, where the Germans have set up shop in neutral territory, are SOE agent-slash-actress Marjorie Stewart (Eiza González, who holds her own, if not always her British accent), tasked with seducing a sadistic Nazi officer (Til Schweiger), and suave undercover fixer Richard Heron (Babs Olusanmokun), whose popular casino bar serves as such an unsubtle nod to 'Casablanca' that a character drops one of Humphrey Bogart's most iconic quotes while sitting in his cafe.\nOff in their own glam spycraft 'n' subterfuge romp for half the film, they're two of the more interesting figures in an overstuffed ensemble that includes Eton-educated West African prince Kambili Kalu (an excellent Danny Sapani), who lends his resources 'because the Nazis are gauche,' and young wartime secretary Ian Fleming (Freddie Fox), who must have gotten plenty of 007 inspiration from his wartime stint.\nAdvertisement\nShot on location in Turkey and Britain, the film's handsome production design is undone by its dull photographic patina. Costume designer Loulou Bontemps's standout achievement is a stunning replica of Claudette Colbert's 1934 'Cleopatra' cutaway gown that Stewart wields like a weapon. Christopher Benstead's score goes from whistling spaghetti Western motifs to jazzy percussives. Yet the plot breezes on with flimsy banter and bloodshed to go along with scant character development.\nAdapted from Damien Lewis's 2014 book 'Churchill's Secret Warriors: The Explosive True Story of the Special Forces Desperadoes of WWII,' the screenplay by Paul Tamasy, Eric Johnson, Arash Amel and Ritchie is oddly weightless given that its real-life commandos, heralded as precursors to the British Special Air Service (SAS) and modern black ops warfare, died in combat before war's end.\nIf you come, come for Cavill sniping Nazis by the hundreds with manic deadpan abandon, and stay for Ritchson looking like he stepped out of a Gold's Gym to destroy hordes of German hostiles with a bow and arrow. Then dive into the real history of the SOE, whose men and women could fill dozens more fascinating spy films without blunting the edges of history with fizzy bromantic antics.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare",

Like many states, Indiana has long collected data on abortions, but the Department of Health last year decided to keep the individual reports from public record and only release its regular summary data four times a year to make it harder to potentially identify patients.\nAdvertisement\nIndiana law requires physicians to submit 'terminated pregnancy reports' with demographic and medical history information to the health department. The reports do not name patients but can list their zip code and county of residence, and they're rarely released in states that collect them, according to experts.\nIn the days following the overturn of Roe v. Wade, an individual record obtained by the Indianapolis Star through a public records request confirmed an abortion provided to a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio.\nThe topic has gradually become a political football as Indiana's competitive primary for governor approaches in early May.\nIn January, Republican gubernatorial candidate and former Attorney General Curtis Hill called on the health department and Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb to allow the release of individual reports. Republican Lt. Gov. and gubernatorial candidate Suzanne Crouch pledged in a March post to X to make the reports public record if she is elected.\nAdvertisement\nAnd on Thursday, Attorney General Todd Rokita, who is running for reelection, issued an advisory opinion arguing the reports should be public record. The opinion doesn't change any practices but was in response to an inquiry from state Sen. Andy Zay, a congressional candidate, Rokita's office said.\nVoters should ask the field of gubernatorial candidates to take a stance, Rokita said during a Thursday news conference.\nAfter Rokita released his opinion, the health department said the reports are not public record, and pointed to an informal opinion written by an appointed open records official in December.\nRokita argued the reports are not medical records and could show whether an abortion was performed legally. Without the reports, he said, 'there is no effective way' to enforce the state's near-total ban.\nAdvertisement\nThe Legislature should act next year if the department doesn't, Zay said Thursday.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'We can use them as tools to hold those around the periphery of abortion clinics and abortion doctors accountable,' Zay said of the reports.\nThe individual reports ask patients for information including zip code, age, race, ethnicity, educational attainment, marital status, previous pregnancies, the date of their last period and the father's age, according to the most recent quarterly summary. Patients may refuse to answer questions, the department said.\nPhysicians report information on the type of procedure, the reason for the abortion and an estimate of the length of the pregnancy. The individual reports also include the name of the physician, the name of the facility and the date of the abortion.\nIndiana's ban went into effect in August. From October to December, 46 terminated pregnancy reports were filed with the health department compared to 1,724 in the same period in 2022.\nAdvertisement\nIt is not common for states to release individual abortion reports, said Rachel Jones, principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a science-based research group that supports abortion rights.\nJones said seeking individual reports is an effort to intimidate health care providers and patients.\n'There's no public health or even legal purpose for trying to impose this,' Jones said.\nRokita denied that the small number of reports makes it easier to identify patients and said that the health department can redact some information before making reports public.\nThe attorney general has taken up multiple legal battles focused on abortion. He gave a televised interview criticizing an Indianapolis OBGYN who provided an abortion to the 10-year-old from Ohio. The Indiana Supreme Court found last year that some of Rokita's statement violated rules of professional conduct for attorneys.\nRokita is weaponizing the reports, said Rebecca Gibron, CEO of the Planned Parenthood region that includes Indiana.",

            "summary": "COLUMBIA, S.C. — Days after a contentious public hearing with state senators, Treasurer Curtis Loftis nearly put South Carolina's entire financial system at risk of a cyberattack by saying he was going to post reams of account data online, according to a report released Tuesday.\nThe Senate report attempts to explain how $1.8 billion in unspent money ended up in a Treasurer's Office account with no idea where it came from or where it was supposed to go. But either the inability or unwillingness of Loftis to help untangle the mess has left many unanswered questions, Republican Sen. Larry Grooms said.\nLoftis' plan, put in writing earlier this month after senators questioned if he was following transparency laws, was stopped after an emergency meeting with the governor that included a phone call from the state's top law enforcement official, Grooms said.\nAdvertisement\nLoftis' office said the treasurer warned senators about the dangers of posting the report and was talking to officials in the Department of Administration who agreed it was dangerous to do so without heavy redactions.\nThe report included the general fund names, account numbers and software type that would allow hackers to map their way into state accounts.\nGrooms said that in his mind, the damage is done and Loftis, a four-term Republican, needs to resign. But the report doesn't reach that conclusion because Republican Gov. Henry McMaster asked that Loftis be given time to work with a task force that's also investigating the missing money.\n'Why on earth would he threaten the state's finances?' Grooms said 'Either he was off his rocker or he was sending a message that if you try to remove me, I'm going to destroy the state's financial system.'\nAdvertisement\nLoftis' office said in a statement that the Senate report is 'very misleading.'\nHe said he would not read the report or watch the Senate on Tuesday but instead rely on staff to fill him in on any useful information.\nSenators 'can say and do anything they like and there are no consequences,' Loftis said.\n'It should be obvious to everyone that the subcommittee would like to overturn the election of an executive branch official and install a puppet to control the funds of the state,' he added.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe Senate report also said more investigation is needed into whether Loftis pressured the state auditor to take out an item in his draft report saying the state's accounts were out of balance for a short time, as well as whether the his office sold investments at a loss to make up the deficit.\nThe governor created the task force, led by the Department of Administration, that includes Loftis' office, the state auditor and the Comptroller General's Office. The Comptroller General's Office has been under the guidance of an interim director since May 2023 after the elected director resigned over an accounting error that double-counted nearly $4 billion for higher education.\nAdvertisement\nGov. McMaster asked the task force to report by July 1 where the $1.8 billion came from and where it is supposed to go.\nSouth Carolina can't spend the money until officials figure that out. It may belong to the federal government or a trust account, and thus can't be used for things like roads or teacher raises. And the state may even have to pay interest on the funds.\nThe Senate also wants to spend $4 million on a forensic investigation of the Treasurer's Office account.\nMcMaster wants to give Loftis a chance to solve the mess, spokesman Brandon Charochak said in a statement.\n'The governor believes the public's confidence is best maintained when elected officials and agencies work together to solve problems through collaboration, cooperation and communication. In that spirit, the governor suggested to Senator Grooms that this group be given some time to work,' Charochak said.\nAdvertisement\nGrooms said he learned of the account shortly after interim Comptroller General Brian Gaines discovered it last October. He asked for help from Grooms' subcommittee, and it requested information about all accounts under a certain fund number. Pages and pages came back with zeros, except for one account with $1.8 billion.\nGrooms thinks Loftis was trying to cover for elected Comptroller General Richard Eckstrom, who resigned last year, or vice versa. State law requires the two offices keep books as a safeguard.\n'Instead of checking on each other, they were cloaking each other's deficiencies,' Grooms said.\nThe subcommittee's thoughts on Loftis were unanimous. Democratic Sen. Margie Bright Matthews said people should be insulted not just by the incompetence of Loftis, but his insolence, including a six-hour public meeting with senators where he threw a pen on a lectern, told senators many things weren't his problem and threatened to walk out.",

            "excerpt": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has acknowledged that a law he enacted two years ago making it easier for people to challenge books in schools and libraries has caused problems for school districts",
            "summary": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Two years ago, Democrats repeatedly and forcefully warned Republicans and Gov. Ron DeSantis that a new law making it easier to challenge school books was so broadly worded that it would create havoc across the state.\nNow they can say, 'I told you so.'\nDeSantis backtracked on the 2022 law on Tuesday when he signed a bill narrowing its focus. He blamed liberal activists for abusing the law, not the citizens whose objections to certain books account for the majority of book removals from school libraries and classrooms.\n'The idea that someone can use the parents rights and the curriculum transparency to start objecting to every single book to try to make a mockery of this is just wrong,' DeSantis said the day before the bill signing. 'That's performative. That's political.'\nCoincidentally, PEN America, a group that fights book bans, issued a report Tuesday saying Florida is responsible for 72% of the books that have been pulled from the nation's schools in the first half of the current school year.\nAdvertisement\nThe organization said liberal activists are not the ones who should be blamed for abusing the law.\n'The majority of books that we see being removed are books that talk about LBTQ+ identities, that include characters of color, that talk about race and racism, that include depictions of sexual experiences in the most broadest interpretation of that understanding,' said Kasey Meehan, Pen America's Freedom to Read program director.\nThose challenges are being made by conservative individuals and groups such as Moms For Liberty, Meehan said.\nThe original law allowed any person — parent or not, district resident or not — to challenge books as often as they wanted. Once challenged, a book has to be pulled from shelves until the school district resolves the complaint. The new law limits people who don't have students in a school district to one challenge per month.\nAdvertisement\nThe PEN America report says Florida is responsible for 3,135 of the 4,349 school book bans in the United States so far this school year. Just this week in conservative Clay County, one person challenged 40 books, Meehan said.\nBefore dropping out of the Republican presidential primary, DeSantis campaigned heavily on his education platform, including the law giving people more power to challenge books.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'It's just a big mess that DeSantis created and now he's trying to disown it, but I don't know if he'll be able to distance himself from this because he campaigned on it so hard,' said House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell.\nIt's not the only example of the tough-talking governor having to make adjustments to ideology he championed while seeking the White House.\nHe also has made concessions in the settlement of several lawsuits involving the state and Walt Disney World. The dispute between them erupted in 2022 after the company spoke out against a DeSantis-backed law that opponents dubbed 'Don't Say Gay.' The law bans classroom lessons on gender identity and sexual orientation.\nAdvertisement\nThe Associated Press asked DeSantis' office for examples of liberal activists abusing the law and it provided one: Chaz Stevens, a South Florida resident who has often lampooned government. Stevens raised challenges in dozens of school districts over the Bible, dictionaries and thesauruses.\nThe change to the law 'ensures that book challenges are limited for individuals, like Chaz, who do not have children with access to the school district's materials,' DeSantis spokeswoman Julia Friedland said in an email. She didn't reply to follow-up emails requesting more examples.\nStevens, who 11 years ago made national news when he installed a Festivus pole made out of beer cans across from a nativity scene displayed in the Capitol, was delighted DeSantis' office singled him out.\n'When they need to make stupid stupider, they send me up. I'm part comedian, I'm part activist, I'm part artist. I just want a better society,' Stevens said. 'I'm an idiot, but a smart guy at the same time.'\nAdvertisement\nWhile DeSantis' predecessor, current Republican Sen. Rick Scott, allowed what was then called the 'free speech zone' in the Capitol rotunda, the rules changed under DeSantis and new barriers were put in place to use Capitol space for political expression. The League of Women Voters and Stevens are among the applicants who have been denied access under the new rules.\n'I didn't realize that I have the power of millions!' Stevens said. 'I'm just one guy. I'm an agitator. I know my role in this.'\nDriskell pointed out that DeSantis was warned there would be problems when the book ban law passed in 2022.",

            "summary": "VENICE, Italy — A pair of nude feet — dirty, wounded and vulnerable — are painted on the façade of the Venice women's prison chapel, the work of Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan and part of the Vatican's pavilion at the Venice Biennale contemporary art show in an innovative collaboration between inmates and artists.\nThat Cattelan is the lead artist is striking, given that his provocative life-size was figure of Pope John Paul II lying on his side, crushed by a massive meteorite, shocked Catholics when it was displayed at the 2001 Biennale. The new work, titled 'Father,' is considered a thematic counterpoint to a performance piece he produced for the 1999 Biennale titled 'Mother,' during which a religious ascetic was buried under sand, with only his hands clasped in prayer showing.\nThe Vatican's culture minister, Cardinal Jose Tolentino de Mendonca, praised the work, which he noted recalled the naked, dirty feet of Caravaggio's saints, while also being highly symbolic of the journey behind the Holy See's pavilion, showing 'the desire to dirty one's feet, to show that whoever has feet has a carnality.''\nAdvertisement\nTolentino de Mendonca, prefect of the Dicastery for Culture and Education, said the Vatican did not want to shy away from artists or works that might be considered iconoclastic, or critical of institutions like the Catholic church.\n'Pope Francis calls us to dialogue. Dialogue is not just with the people who are mirrors of ourselves,'' he told The Associated Press. 'We did not seek out easy artists. We sought real artists. Cattelan's work is very interesting under a religious point of view, because there is something iconoclastic in his work, but also in the mystic there is something that can be called iconoclastic, in the sense of deconstructing the religious representation.''\nPope Francis, who met with over 200 artists in the Sistine Chapel last year, will see for himself when he visits the pavilion April 28, meeting inmates and artists, and according to the prefect not just the ones participating in the pavilion.\nAdvertisement\nCattelan, who wandered by the work as preview tours continued this week, declined to discuss his contribution but said the feet would be reproduced on a church in Rome in the future.\nCattelan's space-specific artwork can be viewed by anyone who makes the trek to the Giudecca island prison. Those who want to see the other works will be guided through the prison on four daily tours by inmates, leaving bags and mobile phones in lockup. Closed Wednesdays, a maximum 600 people will view the pavilion each week during the Biennale's run from April 20-Nov. 26.\nOn a recent tour, three inmates wearing elegant black and white smocks made by prison seamstresses guided journalists through an installation by Simone Fattal who transformed inmates' poems into small ceramic plaques hung along a brick alleyway.\nAdvertisement\nThe tour continued to a prison coffee bar decorated with posters by onetime Catholic nun Corita Kent and into a gallery where Claire Tabouret has painted images from photographs provided by inmates of themselves and loved ones.\nThe conceptual artistic duo known as Claire Fontaine provided a neon eye with a slash through it for an outdoor corridor, and another neon sign that reads: 'Siamo con voi nella notte,' ('We are with all of you in the night').\nThat sign, in a courtyard where the inmates can gather during the day, provides a reassuring blue glow into the overlooking cells where they sleep.\n'When we read this writing, it gives us encouragement, because there is someone with us day and night,' said one inmate named Manuela, who like the others declined to give their full names. 'At night, we see the blue light, so we know it is there.'\nAdvertisement\nThe tour ended with a 15-minute film by Italian director Marco Perego starring his wife, actor Zoe Soldana, both of whom tagged along. Soldana plays an inmate in her final hours before release, and she took inspiration from the inmates who appeared in the film. To protect their privacy, the film can only be seen within the prison walls.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'What we wanted to provide for them was just a little bit of visibility, and to add a little bit of levity through art, which is exactly what we accomplished,'' Soldana said.\nTheir desire for visibility was expressed in letters that the women gave the couple each night after filming, and through requests to pose with the couple for photos, which Soldana said they printed as keepsakes for the women.\nChiara Parisi, the director of the Centre Pompidou-Metz and one of the curators, said the project created a unique synergy between artists and inmates that opened lines of empathy. After the pavilion closes at the end of the Biennale, she said a coat of paint would likely cover Cattelan's work, while the other pieces will find other venues; she said she hoped its larger legacy would be other similar initiatives.",

            "excerpt": "Was the activism, the hashtag and the global spotlight worth nothing?",
            "summary": "There is something about kidnapping and rescue missions, particularly of children, that should stir the spirit.\nTen years ago this week, in the middle of the night in northeastern Nigeria, militants of the Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram raided a boarding school in Chibok and kidnapped some 276 girls.\nIt would take about two weeks for the news of the kidnapping to penetrate international media, and only then did local Nigerian outlets take the story seriously. Boko Haram had been ravaging the northern part of Nigeria since at least 2009, kidnapping children, burning churches and villages. Boko Haram is estimated to have killed tens of thousands of people while taking control of entire swaths of northeast Nigeria.\nThe kidnapping led to #BringBackOurGirls, arguably the largest Africa-centered, grass-roots social media campaign ever. A decade later, it's worth revisiting why #BringBackOurGirls was such a watershed moment, in Nigeria and for West Africa-watchers in the United States. In a world where military power is too often confused for strength, hostage situations reveal the true nature of governments. Any government that ignores the will of its citizens as they call for peace and safety is auto-programming its eventual system crash.\nAdvertisement\nThat's how Nigeria's elite sleepwalked to disaster. For years, while Boko Haram was ravaging lesser developed northern regions, the elite in Lagos and Abuja were complacent. Oby Ezekwesili, for one, recalled being furious and perplexed at the government's inaction. Ezekwesili, a former Nigerian education minister and a former vice president of the World Bank's Africa division, recalled in an interview that the kidnapping was the last straw. 'I was expecting the government to say that a tragedy occurred, and this is what we're doing,' she told me. 'But [instead], silence.' On the platform formerly known as Twitter, she saw video of 'parents trying to run into some forest to look for their children. I was furious about this.'\nI was furious about this.'\nAt a book event with famed Nigerian writer Wole Soyinka, Ezekwesili and other women used the platform to call attention to the missing girls. 'We said, ‘Bring Back our Daughters,' and someone at the event tweeted that I said 'Bring Back Our Girls.' The slight misquote, converted to a hashtag, 'caught fire,' Ezekwesili said.\nEzekwesili's status as part of the elite no doubt helped raise the issue and prepared her for the next step: turning the viral hashtag into a real-world force. She and other Nigerian women began to organize daily gatherings and protests urging the government to act and bring back the kidnapped school girls. But, Ezekwesili told me, then-President Goodluck Jonathan's administration was feckless as well as silent. Nigeria's ill-equipped army in the north was outgunned and outmaneuvered by Boko Haram. 'It was humiliating to see our soldiers running away from Boko Haram.'\nFollow this author Karen Attiah 's opinions\nFollow this author\nKaren Attiah\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nAdvertisement\nThe humiliation of Jonathan's administration was global. In the United States, celebrities and politicians — led by first lady Michelle Obama — circulated the hashtag. The viral campaign in turn put pressure on the White House to send more military assistance to Nigeria, even though U.S. officials had restricted arms transfers because of the army's abuses against civilians.\nThe simultaneous rise of ISIS and other Islamist insurgencies in the Middle East further heightened the pressure. The brutal kidnapping of the Chibok girls stoked fears of Islamist forces taking over the Middle East, Africa and Europe. I traveled to northeastern Nigeria in 2015 and talked with Nigerian military officers who were frustrated with America for being slow to give material support. 'The Chinese come here and build roads; the Americans come here and give lectures.' I remember one of them telling me.\nInevitably, perhaps, the world's attention moved on from Chibok, though the activism continued. Ezekwesili and other women showed up daily at the Unity Fountain in the capital, Abuja, for nearly seven years, until covid forced people inside in 2020.\nAdvertisement\nAt last count, Boko Haram has killed more than 350,000 people. And 90 of these kidnapped girls, who are now women, are still in captivity. 'Kidnappings are now more commonplace in Nigeria,' Ezekwesili told me. So was the activism, the hashtag and the global spotlight worth nothing?\nI'm not ready to say that. It is remarkable to contemplate the power that social media — especially Twitter at its best — had to generate international empathy. At least for a number of months, the world cared about poor Nigerian girls neglected, and even forgotten, by their own government.\nEzekwesili believes that the past 10 years have shown that there's only one way things will truly change for the better. 'We need a completely new political class, to replace what we have,' she said. 'We need a politics of care.'",

            "excerpt": "Alex Popken was a trust and safety executive at Twitter, leaving in 2023 after a decade at the social media company focusing on content moderation",
            "summary": "Alex Popken was a longtime trust and safety executive at Twitter focusing on content moderation before leaving in 2023. She was the first employee there dedicated to moderating Twitter's advertising business when she started in 2013.\nNow, she's vice president of trust and safety at WebPurify, a content moderation service provider that works with businesses to help ensure the content people post on their sites follows the rules.\nSocial media platforms are not the only ones that need policing. Any consumer-facing company — from retailers to dating apps to news sites — needs someone to weed out unwanted content, whether that's hate speech, harassment or anything illegal. Companies are increasingly using artificial intelligence in their efforts, but Popken notes that humans remain essential to the process.\nAdvertisement\nPopken spoke recently with The Associated Press. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\nQUESTION: How did you see content moderation change in that decade you were at Twitter?\nANSWER: When I joined Twitter, content moderation was in its nascent stages. I think even trust and safety was this concept that people were just starting to understand and grapple with. The need for content moderation escalated as we, as platforms saw them be weaponized in new ways. I can sort of recall some key milestones of my tenure at Twitter. For example, Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, where we realized for the first time, realized in a meaningful way, that without content moderation we can have bad actors undermining democracy. The necessity for investing in this area became ever more important.\nAdvertisement\nQ: A lot of companies, the bigger social media companies are leaning on AI for content moderation. Do you think that AI is in a place yet where it's possible to rely on it?\nA: Effective content moderation is a combination of humans and machines. AI, which has been used in moderation for years, solves for scale. And so you have machine learning models that are trained on different policies and can detect content. But ultimately, let's say you have a machine learning model that is detecting the word ‘Nazi.' There are a lot of posts that might be criticizing Nazis or providing educational material about Nazis versus like, white supremacy. And so it cannot solve for nuance and context. And that's really where a human layer comes in.\nI do think that we're starting to see really important advancements that are going to make a human's job easier. And I think generative AI is a great example of that, where, unlike traditional. AI models, it can understand context and nuance much more so than its predecessor. But even still, we have entirely new use cases for our human moderators now around moderating generative AI outputs. And so the need for human moderation will remain for the foreseeable future, in my opinion.\nAdvertisement\nQ: Can you talk a little bit about the non-social media companies that you work with and what kind of content moderation they use?\nA: I mean, everything from like retail product customization, you know, imagine that you are allowing people to customize T-shirts, right? Obviously, you want to avoid use cases in which people abuse that and put harmful, hateful things on the T-shirt.\nReally, anything that has user-generated content, all the way to online dating — there, you're looking for things like catfishing and scams and ensuring that people are who they say they are and preventing people from uploading inappropriate photos for example. It does span multiple industries.\nQ: What about the issues that you're moderating, does that change?\nA: Content moderation is an ever-evolving landscape. And it's influenced by what's happening in the world. It's influenced by new and evolving technologies. It's influenced by bad actors who will attempt to get on these platforms in new and innovative ways. And so as a content moderation team, you're trying to stay one step ahead and anticipate new risks.\nAdvertisement\nI think that there's a little bit of catastrophic thinking in this role where you think about like, what are the worst case scenarios that can happen here. And certainly they evolve. I think misinformation is a great example where there's so many facets to misinformation and it's such a hard thing to moderate. It's like boiling the ocean. I mean, you cannot fact check every single thing that someone says, right? And so typically platforms need to focus on misinformation not to cause the most real world harm. And that's also always evolving.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nQ: In terms of generative AI there's some doomsday thinking that it will ruin the internet, that it will just be, you know, fake AI stuff on it. Do you feel like that might be happening?\nA: I have concerns around AI-generated misinformation, especially during what is an extremely important election season globally. You know, we actively are seeing more deepfakes and harmful synthetic and manipulated media online, which is concerning because I think the average person probably has a hard time. discerning accurate versus not.\nAdvertisement",

            "excerpt": "Fashanu's journey to the NFL draft has been unconventional and guided by his family's emphasis on character and education.",
            "summary": "As he raised his children in Nigeria, Chief Adewale Fashanu often repeated a lesson. 'It's better to have a good name than all the money in the world,' he told them. Adewale fought for Nigerian independence and served as the political secretary of the country's first president. His access to power offered him many chances to enrich himself through corruption, and at every opportunity he refused.\n'When he died, he died with a good name,' his son Anthony Fashanu said recently. 'If I go back to Nigeria, I introduce myself to a lot of people. They say, ‘Oh, you are the son of Adewale.' They always respect that name. So it's something I try to instill in my kids, too: Having a good name is better than having all the money in the world.'\nA few decades after he moved to the United States and settled in Waldorf, Md., Anthony will hear his family name announced to a broad American audience. His son, Adewale's grandson, will be selected early in the NFL draft Thursday night, perhaps among the first 10 picks and the first offensive lineman chosen.\nAdvertisement\nOlu Fashanu did not try on football pads until he arrived as a freshman at Gonzaga College High in the District, and he played a year longer at Penn State than most anybody outside his family expected. Over eight years, Fashanu turned himself from a burgeoning basketball prospect into a team captain at a college football powerhouse. He was named an all-American, became a finalist for the academic version of the Heisman Trophy and graduated from business school a semester early.\n'He did everything right,' Penn State offensive line coach Phil Trautwein said. 'He's not a kid who the money is going to change his work ethic or change who he is.'\nAnthony Fashanu moved to the United States in the early 1990s, living with his uncle on Long Island. Shortly after he moved to Maryland, he met his wife, Paige, settled in Waldorf and had two children. Their son, Olumuyiwa, had the athletic genes that had helped Anthony play semiprofessional soccer. He sprouted above his peers and gravitated toward basketball. Fashanu's parents spent between $50,000 and $60,000 so he could travel around the country to camps and with AAU and Elite Youth Basketball League teams. 'Was he going to get a basketball offer? I don't know,' Anthony said. 'But I know that he was very good.'\nAdvertisement\nDuring those basketball trips, football coaches often approached Anthony in the stands and pleaded for Fashanu to play their sport, for their team. Anthony declined every overture without telling his son. He was a college football fan, but he worried about football's physical toll and the threat of brain injury. He had twice signed up Fashanu for Charles County youth leagues, but both times he changed his mind and wouldn't let him play.\nFashanu enrolled at Gonzaga intent on playing basketball. He had grown to nearly 6-foot-6 by eighth grade. At a summer welcome picnic for incoming students, Eagles football coach Randy Trivers spotted Fashanu walking around, towering above his future classmates. 'Of course, Olu looks a little different than the other freshmen coming in,' Trivers said. 'You could see: ‘Whoa, man, this is a good frame. This young man may possibly be interested in football.' You'll welcome anybody into the program. But that one raised your eyebrow a little bit.'\nIn Anthony's recollection, Trivers called him every day for a month. He ignored every call. On the first day of school, Trivers found Fashanu in class, handed him football equipment and instructed him to report to practice after school. Fashanu relented, seeing a means to keep in shape and add toughness for the winter.\n'At that point in my life, I was a basketball player,' Fashanu said. 'The thought process was, try out football, see if I like it, but at the end of the day, at the very least, I'd be conditioning myself for the basketball season.'\nAdvertisement\n'I was worried,' Anthony said. 'His mother was worried. But we prayed about it. We said, ‘Okay, we'll just take it as it goes.' '\nFashanu started with the freshman team, 'learning what the heck's a stance and how to get lined up,' Trivers said. He quickly came to love football. His basketball background gave him advanced, agile footwork. Fashanu had almost always been the biggest kid on the court, and using that advantage often came with punishment. In football, physicality became an asset. He loved how grueling practices and extensive preparation built intense camaraderie.\n'I knew 110 percent he was going to put all his effort into that sport,' Paige said. 'Because that's what he does.'\nAt lunch, Fashanu would eat quickly and retreat to Gonzaga's film room to study NFL offensive linemen he modeled his game after. During the offseason, he set his alarm for 5 a.m. so he could drive to the District in time for early-morning practices. He stayed after school in the weight room until 6:30 some evenings. He would remain at Gonzaga for 12 hours, not counting about an hour commute on both ends.\nAdvertisement\n'It takes a real mature, committed, tough human being to do that consistently,' Trivers said. 'He could roll up the sleeves with the best of them. It wasn't easy. He may have made it look easy.'\n'I'm not going to lie to you and tell you I was super excited waking up at 5 a.m. every day in the offseason,' Fashanu said. 'I knew in order to get where I wanted to go, that was the stuff that was required. A large part of that comes with my parents teaching me discipline from a very young age.'\nSelf-motivation permeated Fashanu's upbringing. His father constantly told him and his sister, 'Whatever you do, always be the best in it.' Trivers sensed it didn't matter what task was in front of Fashanu — a practice drill, math class, community work. He wanted to excel and focused himself to do so.\n'In most West African households, the relationship between the family is definitely built upon respect, discipline and love,' Fashanu said. 'That was something that was really emphasized in our household: treating everyone with respect, showing appreciation for those who helped you get to where you are in your life and discipline, just taking care of business.'\nBy Fashanu's sophomore season, even though he had not become a full-time starter, Trivers believed the lineman was on track to play at a Power Five school. College programs started to notice his ideal size and athleticism at camps. He received his first major scholarship offer from Rutgers before his junior year.\nAdvertisement\n'We were shocked,' Anthony said. 'I mean, I can't describe how we felt.'\nFashanu arrived at Penn State a 'raw' player, said Trautwein, Penn State's offensive line coach. Trautwein constantly saw him in the film room, taking detailed notes on opponents he would face. He improved his flexibility. He focused on where to place his hands on a defender. He refined his pass-blocking technique.\n'He just worked,' Trautwein said. 'He worked, and he made sure his weaknesses became his strengths.'\nFashanu made his first start as a sophomore in the Outback Bowl and dominated. He started the first eight games of the 2022 season, becoming one of the Big Ten's best linemen and attracting notice from NFL evaluators before an injury ended his season. After only nine collegiate starts, Fashanu had become a prized prospect. He learned he would be taken in the first round, possibly among the first 10 picks, if he left school early.\nAdvertisement\nThe outside world expected Fashanu to enter the draft. Who passes up a year of NFL money, risks injury and delays a lucrative second professional contract by a year?\nThose who knew Fashanu best, though, believed he might stay. He had gone to Penn State armed with one certainty: He would leave with his degree. Paige's mother, whom Fashanu and his sister called Nana Fawehinmi, was an educator. When she visited in the summer, from the time Fashanu and his sister were in kindergarten, they had to finish a school activity before a trip to the zoo. His parents would remind him he was a student-athlete and student came first.\nFashanu majored in supply chain management and information systems, an atypically challenging course load for a football star. 'I definitely had my hard days,' he said. 'I just did what I was supposed to do.' He envisioned working in the pharmaceutical division of a huge corporation and maybe starting his own company one day.\nAdvertisement\nFashanu also felt a pull to finish a season healthy and to lead Penn State to a championship. He wanted to play another season with teammates he called 'my brothers.' So he called a meeting with Penn State's coaches and began by telling them: 'I'm coming back. I came here to get a degree.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'That meant more to him than the money,' Trautwein said. 'In the world we live in right now, it's crazy that he stayed. It told me what kind of person he is. He wanted the chance to win a national championship. It's all about the team. We need more guys like that. I don't know how many kids in the next 10 years are going to do that.'\nIn 2023, Fashanu didn't allow a sack, and as a returning starter, he made it his mission to be a more vocal leader.\n'Being transparent, I'm a really introverted person,' Fashanu said. 'I try to stay in my own lane. That was a really big emphasis of mine to improve on, just being that type of guy that guys can look to, be a guy that other people can rely on at times when stuff might be hectic. I wanted to be the guy where I could step up, talk to the team, let everyone know everything is going to be all right.'\nAdvertisement\nPenn State lost to Michigan and Ohio State, but Fashanu got everything else he had wanted out of his final season. He graduated a semester early. Fashanu and his family have never regretted the choice. 'It was a no-brainer,' Paige said. 'I knew he was going to finish his education. I really think he wasn't ready mentally.'\n'Now he's ready,' Anthony said. 'He's more mature. And he's ready for the NFL.'\nNFL.'",

            "summary": "MIAMI — A few weeks after fleeing Port-au-Prince, Wildor Pierre stood before the congregation at Miami's Notre Dame d'Haiti Catholic Church and asked for vigilance against the 'snakes' rocking Haiti.\nThe parishioners closed their eyes, bowed their heads and lifted their hands in prayer. In Haiti, their families have told them, water is being sanitized with bleach and food is scarce. Violence haunts their daily lives.\n'What I want everyone here to know, no matter how long you've been here [in the U.S.] ... you are a native Haitian,' Pierre told them in Creole. 'What's happening at home, it concerns you.'\nAdvertisement\nFrom Miami up to Brooklyn, members of the Haitian diaspora in the United States, more than 1 million people, say they've grown increasingly terrified for friends and family members affected by the gang violence that has turned the streets of Port-au-Prince — the capital of the world's first free Black republic — into a war zone. In recent weeks, dozens of people have been killed and at least 17,000 have been forced from their homes as gangs continue to raid the city's neighborhoods. The U.S. State Department has begun chartering helicopters to get U.S. citizens out of Haiti to safety in the neighboring Dominican Republic.\nBut many Haitians in the United States appear divided about what should happen next.\nSome worry that Haiti's crisis is not receiving the same level of attention from U.S. officials as the Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza. 'As a taxpayer, my money is going to Ukraine,' said Wildeen Tirone, 33, a special-education coordinator. 'And I'm fine with that. All I'm saying is Haiti needs help too. But as the first free Black country in the world, Haiti has never gotten what it deserves.'\nOthers are wary of more foreign intervention, tracing the island's problems back to its very founding as a self-governing country in 1804 after a long and bloody war of independence from France.\n'Haiti should be able to fly by itself,' said Tony Jean Thenor, a 65-year-old Miami social worker who emigrated in 1980. 'We need folks that can tell the American government, ‘Look, this medication you've been prescribing us for the last 50 years is not working.''\nHaitian parishioners from Notre Dame Haiti Catholic Church in Miami express frustration and hope as violence continues to unravel in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. (Video: Reshma Kirpalani/The Washington Post)\nThe instability comes as some Haitian Americans ponder November's U.S. elections.\nJoel Tirone, Wildeen Tirone's husband, credits President Biden with launching the Humanitarian Parole Program for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans looking to escape violence at home. About 30,000 migrants a month can enter the United States under the program, which also allows them to work as long as they have a financial sponsor and can pass background checks.\nJoel Tirone, who says he left Haiti in 2016 because of government corruption and settled in the United States, hopes to use that program to bring his mother to the United States.\nYet he also fears that a second Biden term will mean more American interference in Haiti's affairs and wonders whether returning Donald Trump to the White House could be better for his homeland.\n'I think Trump would be better for Haiti because Trump doesn't want to help other countries,' said Joel Tirone, 36, a therapist and social worker.\nAdvertisement\nHaiti has been devastated by natural disasters, including the 7.0-magnitude earthquake that killed more than 220,000 people in 2010, and political violence that culminated in the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. After the assassination, the Biden administration backed Ariel Henry, who was then the acting prime minister, to succeed Moïse. Last month, Henry announced he was stepping down as violence continued to cripple the country. Last year, there were 5,000 homicides in Haiti, which was more than double the number in 2022, according to a recent United Nations report.\nThe chaos has some worried that the United States is on the verge of yet another migrant crisis. Since early last year, the number of encounters between U.S. Border Patrol and Haitian migrants has been steadily on the rise. The agency has encountered 123,554 Haitian citizens attempting to enter the country during the past six months, compared with 52,233 during the same period a year earlier.\nIn March, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said he was sending more than 250 additional officers and National and Florida State Guard troops to the Florida Keys and southern waters of the state 'in anticipation of a potential influx' of immigrants from Haiti entering the United States illegally.\nBut so far there hasn't been a significant spike in the number of migrants from Haiti trying to reach the United States on boats, according to John William Beal, a Coast Guard spokesperson. The Coast Guard reported sending back 65 Haitian migrants found on a distressed sailboat near the Bahamas in March.\nNonetheless, migrant advocates warn that if the Biden administration doesn't open up more legal paths for entry into the country, more Haitians will resort to dangerous sea crossings out of desperation.\nPeople fleeing other countries have been embraced in America in a way that Haitian migrants typically aren't, said Taisha Saintil, senior policy analyst at UndocuBlack Network, an immigrant advocacy organization led by Black immigrants. 'We are asking the administration to completely stop any plan that seeks to ... detain Haitian immigrants' attempting to enter the country, she said.\nPeterson Demmat, 27, has been safe from Haiti's violence since August, when he came to North Miami Beach as part of the humanitarian parole program. But he hasn't escaped the crisis emotionally.\nhumanitarian parole program.

They usually talk two or three times a week, he said, but when he calls and can't reach her, he worries something terrible has happened. 'All of me — all my spirit — all of it stays in Haiti,' he said. 'When I hear there's sad news going on in Haiti ... it feels like inside of me, my heart is broken.'\nIn 2023, Peterson Demmat moved to Miami from Haiti to fulfill his dreams. Now, amid turmoil, he fears for his mother still living in Port-au-Prince.

Newly arrived migrants in New York can access food, jobs, school and housing at the church, while congregants also pool their money to send to charities they set up on the island.\n'People are always talking about what immigrants take, but here we make sure nobody who comes through here ends up on food stamps or welfare,' said Wildeen Tirone. 'We set them up to be people who make this country better.'\nAdvertisement\nA group of Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to the Biden administration in March requesting that it extend access to a program known as temporary protected status to Haitian migrants, which allows Haitian nationals currently in the United States to remain and obtain work permits for as long as the island remains unsafe. As of December, almost 165,000 Haitian nationals held TPS status. The program is set to expire in August.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe Department of Homeland Security is monitoring the situation in Haiti, an agency spokesperson, Naree Ketudat, said. But there are no plans to extend the program, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas recently told the Miami Herald. 'Let me be clear that, when we interdict individuals from Haiti at sea, we return them to Haiti as quickly as possible,' he said.\nA spokesperson for the National Security Council said the United States hasn't seen signs of a migrant crisis, so far. The administration is working to find ways to help Haitians stabilize their country, according to the spokesperson, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly.\n'It is not up to the United States to solve this crisis,' the official said. 'This has to be a Haitian-led, Haitian-driven resolution to the crisis, and that's what we have been focused on.'\nJudith Dorlean, 36, came to the United States 30 years ago with her parents and four siblings. While her family still sends food and money to relatives in Port-au-Prince and a smaller community called Thomazeau, their gifts can't stop the influx of fear that has struck the country. Sometimes, 'they can't sleep or stay in their home because the gangs have taken over some parts,' she said. Other family members have been kidnapped for ransom in recent months, she's been told by relatives.\nAdvertisement\nIt's hard to say exactly how, or even if, the U.S. government should intervene because Haiti needs to be able to govern itself, Dorlean said. But she has been watching local elected officials to make sure they keep campaign promises to expand programs that would make it easier for Haitian Americans to bring their family members to the United States to live and work.\n'The resources that the U.S. would need to provide has to be at the best interest of the Haitian people' rather than serving American interests, Dorlean said.\nWeiselande 'Yanui' Cesar, a 54-year-old artist and instructor living in Miami Shores, vividly remembers the day she and her two sisters were brought to the United States. When their American Airlines flight arrived at LaGuardia Airport in March 1981, they were greeted by their dad, stepmom and uncles, who were holding coats for them to face their first New York winter.\nCesar said she doesn't recall the exact reason she was 'sent for' at age 11, but she imagines it was for the same reason many other Haitian families immigrated to New York at the time: the search for a better life and a good education. The plan was for her to stay just a short time, maybe for high school and college, and then go back home to Haiti.\nBut with Haiti's continuing political turmoil, that plan never materialized. Cesar moved with her parents to North Miami after she graduated from high school. Later, she married and had kids in Florida. She had to cancel her last trip back to Haiti, just before the covid-19 pandemic, she said, because the island had once again become too politically volatile.\n'For me right now to see Haiti the way it is, it hurts. But it's also, ‘What can I do?'' said Cesar, who runs Tradisyon Lakou Lakay Inc., roughly translated as 'Hometown Traditions,' an arts and culture nonprofit that offers Haitian folkloric dance classes.\n'We have that power to take Haiti back,' Cesar said. 'Why can't we do it again?'",

            "excerpt": "Paris Saint-Germain forward Tabitha Chawinga faced challenges as a young soccer player growing up in Malawi",
            "summary": "Tabitha Chawinga wasn't always a prolific scorer. The Paris Saint-Germain star played goalkeeper in rural Malawi as a young girl.\nA collision with a defender changed all that. Her mouth was bloodied.\n'After that I stopped playing the goal, because I was afraid as well (of) my mom,' Chawinga says.\nHer mother frowned on her playing soccer and would slap Chawinga to get her to stop, she says. It's one of the many obstacles she's faced during her rise to stardom. As a teenager, she was considered so good that one time she was forced to remove her clothes on the field to prove to the other team that she's female.\nThe 27-year-old Chawinga's confidence and positive attitude have helped her excel on three continents. She left Malawi for the lower divisions of Sweden at age 17 and later played in China before joining Inter Milan for a season, and now PSG.\nAdvertisement\nShe's filled up the scoresheet at each stop and this season has helped PSG reach the semifinals of the Women's Champions League, facing French rival Lyon on Saturday.\n'My dream is one by one. I was dreaming to play in Champions League, now I'm in Champions League. I have a dream to win Champions League, who knows ... maybe we can win Champions League this year. I have a dream to become (a) player who can win Ballon d'Or, maybe the first woman in Africa. Anything can happen, only God knows,' Chawinga tells The Associated Press in an interview from Paris ahead of the first-leg semifinal in Lyon.\nChawinga — whose younger sister Temwa is an emerging star for the NWSL's Kansas City Current — recalled playing soccer with the boys in her village and using balls made of plastic and paper.\n'I was happy if I got to play football. But every time I come back my mom beat me, slap me. They wanted me to stop football. But this is the career from God, so I think God have very big future for me.'\nAdvertisement\nHer parents wanted her to focus on education. Instead of obeying them, Chawinga pressed on.\n'I watch Marta many times, so I was like, ‘One day I will be like this player,'' she says of the Brazil great. 'Let me just encourage myself even if my mom and my dad they don't allow me. It was a very big challenge ... until I leave my parents' house to go to the city to start playing football with the girls.'\nChawinga moved to the capital Lilongwe as a teenager to link up with girls' team DD Sunshine.\nShe had no trouble racking up goals — in fact, few of the boys at her old school would dare cover her for fear of being passed and then teased by classmates — and one senior player from an opposing team forced her to undress 'in front of everyone' to prove she's female.\n'It was a very big shame,' Chawinga says. 'After the end of the game she came to apologize to me.'\nAdvertisement\nChawinga has spoken out about the need for Malawi soccer authorities to better protect female players, and says progress has been made.\n'I don't want some other people to find the same challenge, like what I (experienced). If people love football, let them play football how they are.'\nSpeedy and smart on the field, Chawinga has scored in each of her last nine matches — 12 goals in that stretch including the Champions League, French league and French Cup.\nShe leads the French league in scoring a season after she topped the charts in Italy for Inter Milan. Both seasons have been on loan because she remains under contract to Wuhan Jianghan University in the Chinese professional league until December. She transferred from Kvarnsvedens in Sweden to Chinese club Jiangsu Suning in 2018 when Chinese teams were spending heavily to import talent.\nAdvertisement\nAmid Chawinga's scoring spree, PSG coach Jocelyn Prêcheur suggests there's plenty more to come.\n'She's expressing herself more and more on the pitch, she's pretty much fully settled in, you can feel she's enjoying it, and that has an impact on her performances,' says Prêcheur, who also coached Chawinga in China.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nChawinga has secured several firsts for her country including the first Malawian to play in the Women's Champions League and first Malawian to score in any UEFA competition.\nMalawi President Lazarus Chakwera feted Chawinga last summer in the presidential palace in honor of her Italian exploits.\nChawinga credits coaches and teammates for her success — she easily names teammates who provided assists on her goals and in which games.\nShe's also a big fan of her sister Temwa. They played one season together in China.\n'Most of the time I say she's a superstar more than me,' Tabitha says. She smiles when asked if they'll play on the same team again someday. 'Anything can happen.'\nChawinga describes her relationship with her parents as 'real good.'\n'I'm the person to take care of them now.'",

Police said their investigation would include why he targeted women and avoided men during his attack.\nThose killed were five women and one man. Twelve people were wounded, and police said they mostly were female.\nHere's some information on those killed.\nASHLEE GOOD\nFriends and family of 38-year-old osteopath Ashlee Good remembered her as a 'beautiful mother, daughter, sister, partner, friend' and an 'all-round outstanding human.'\nGood's 9-month-old daughter was wounded and was in serious but stable condition in a hospital Monday.\nAdvertisement\nGood reportedly passed her baby to two strangers nearby before she lost consciousness. 'To the two men who held and cared for our baby when Ashlee could not — words cannot express our gratitude,' the family's statement read.\nGood's father, Kerry Good, is a former Australian Rules football player and a current board member of the North Melbourne AFL club. In honor of Ashlee, the club wore black armbands in its match on Sunday.\nDAWN SINGLETON\nDawn Singleton was the 25-year-old daughter of well-known businessman John Singleton.\nShe worked as an e-commerce assistant for a women's fashion outlet in Sydney, which said in a social media post they had 'not only lost an employee but someone special to us who felt like a family member.'\n'Dawn was a sweet, kind hearted person who had her whole life ahead of her. She was really amazing,' White Fox Boutique said in an Instagram post.\nAdvertisement\n'We send our love and deepest condolences to her partner, the Singleton family and her friends.'\nSingleton's LinkedIn profile says she was a communications graduate from the University of Technology, Sydney and had worked at the trendy fashion line since 2020.\nShe was soon to be married to her police officer partner.\nFARAZ TAHIR\nThe only male killed was Faraz Tahir, a 30-year-old Pakistani refugee who worked at the mall as a security guard.\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community of Australia said Faraz had been in Australia for less than a year and was a 'cherished member of our community' and was a dedicated security guard who tragically lost his life while serving the public during this attack.\n'He quickly became an integral part of our community, known for his unwavering dedication and kindness,' the organization said in a statement.\nAdvertisement\nIt also said Faraz contributed to charitable endeavors supporting Muslim youth in Sydney.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nFaraz was credited with trying to stop the attack.\n'We are devastated by Faraz's passing and recognise our team member's bravery and role as a first responder,' Elliott Rusanow, CEO of the mall owner Scentre Group, said in a statement to Nine News. 'Another member of our security team was injured and remains in hospital.'\nJADE YOUNG\nJade Young, 47, was a mother of two who had been an architect for more than two decades.\nYoung lived in Bellevue Hill, an eastern Sydney suburb near the shopping mall, and was a volunteer member of the Bronte Surf Life Saving Club.\n'I sadly have to report that a Bronte SLSC member, Jade Young, lost her life during the tragic events in Bondi Junction yesterday,' the club said in a statement to Nine News.\nAdvertisement\n'Some of you might have known Jade as she and her family have been active in youth education.'\nPIKRIA DARCHIA\nPikria Darchia, 55, was named as the fifth victim late Sunday.\nAccording to Darchia's profile on professional networking site LinkedIn, she was an artist and had worked as a designer for 10 years in Tbilisi, Georgia.\nPrior to that she had finished a masters degree in performance art at the Tbilisi State Academy of Art.\nIn Australia, she studied business administration. Darchia's profile said she spoke English, Russian and Georgian.\nFurther details about her have not been released, and her family has requested privacy.\nYIXUAN CHENG\nYixuan Cheng, a Chinese graduate student, was the final victim to be identified Monday.\nChinese news service Sydney Today reported the 27-year-old was studying for a master's degree in economics at the University of Sydney.\nAdvertisement\nThe report said she had called her fiance in China, who has only been identified as Wang, just minutes before the attack.\n'She happily talked to me on the phone at around 3 p.m. She even tried on clothes for me to see,' Wang said.\nAfter the attack, Wang said he had tried to call Cheng 'day and night, but there was no contact at all.'\nThe family spent the next 24 hours watching news of the attack in hope of an update, before receiving the heartbreaking news of her death.",

            "summary": "Earlier this week, I was asked a question for which I didn't know the answer: What could President Biden do to firm up his support among younger voters?\nRecent polling has shown that Biden is performing more poorly than expected with Americans under 30, though, as I've written, that varies depending on the poll and whether it screens for the likelihood that the respondents will vote.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nConsider, for example, new polling from the Harvard Institute of Politics that considers only the views of adults 18-29. Overall, Biden leads former president Donald Trump by eight points, 45 percent to 37 percent. Among registered voters, though, he's up 13 points — 50 percent to 37 percent. And among those who say they're most likely to vote, he's up 19 points. Biden has 56 percent of support and Trump, again, 37 percent.\nThat Trump doesn't gain ground as the pool of respondents is narrowed is important. It suggests that indifference to the candidates and voter apathy are linked — and that there's potentially an opportunity for Biden if his campaign can compel more young Americans to vote.\nAdvertisement\nThis comes back to the initial question: What's the pitch?\nRecent YouGov polling conducted for the Economist included a battery of issues on which respondents were asked to offer their opinions. This allows us to see where Americans stand on the election and also how younger (those under 30) voters differ from older ones.\nWhat we find is that there are only a handful of issues to which younger voters ascribe more importance than older ones, whether we're considering issues respondents identify as the most important (red, below), very important (purple) or at least somewhat important (orange). Younger Americans are more likely to point to jobs and abortion as the most important issue to them, but the gap between younger voters and voters overall is wider when describing climate change or civil rights as very important issues.\nThe issue that scored the highest in importance to younger Americans? Inflation, same as everyone else.\nThat holds in the Harvard Youth Poll as well. Its methodology was different, presenting respondents with two options from a lengthy list and asking them to identify which was more important. The issue that was most commonly selected as most important relative to alternatives was, once again, inflation.\nBy virtue of focusing on younger respondents, the Harvard poll allows a breakdown by gender. You can see that, on several issues, there's a substantial difference in the views of young men and women, like reproductive rights. The three issues on which there's the widest difference by gender are three of the most commonly associated with liberal politics: reproductive rights, climate change and gun violence. Young women were at least 10 points more likely to identify those issues as important than were young men.\nA key finding in the Harvard poll centers on the divide by gender. Support for Biden is higher among likely voters than among young people overall — but among young men who are likely to vote his advantage is only six points compared with a 33-point advantage with young women who are likely to vote.\nSince 2020, the Harvard Youth Poll has seen the partisan advantage for Democrats evaporate among young men. In 2020, men and women were about 20 points more likely to identify as Democrats than as Republicans. Now, women are 26 points more likely to, while among men, there's virtually no difference.\n(It's worth noting that Gallup polling of partisan identity shows a rightward shift among young voters that comports with the data above.)\nAdvertisement\nOn the issue importance question, the views of young women correlate strongly to the views of young Democrats. The views of young men correlate slightly less strongly to the views of young Republicans.\nThe question of how Biden appeals to these voters, though, remains unanswered. He's put a big focus on student loan relief, as you're probably aware, and it's the issue on which Harvard found the highest level of approval for Biden from younger Americans. It is also the issue that was least likely to be identified as important in Harvard's battery. On inflation and gun violence, issues seen as more important, his approval rating was around 25 percent. On the issue of Israel — which was also surprisingly low on the importance list — his approval was under 20 percent.\nYouGov found that younger Americans were more critical of Biden across the board than Americans overall, including on education and civil rights, issues that they were more likely to identify as important.\nThe situation, then, is that the issues important to young people and those important to Americans overall don't differ that much as Biden's party has lost ground with young men. (A plurality of young men in the poll identified as independent.) Analysis from Pew Research Center found that voters under 30 backed Biden by a 26-point margin in 2020, down from the 30-point margin Hillary Clinton enjoyed four years before. If the margin had instead matched that seen in this poll — 19 points — it would have meant a shift of more than 4 million votes from Biden to Trump.",

            "summary": "ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast — Dame Touré rushed to quickly gather what she could as bulldozers rolled into her neighborhood in Ivory Coast's fast-growing economic hub of Abidjan. Her three children joined her, stuffing plastic bags with clothes and whatever other items they could grab, before their home was reduced to rubble as armed security forces looked on.\nThe Touré home was among hundreds crushed in a February wave of demolitions targeting Abidjan's underdeveloped areas.\nThe government says it's because of public health concerns as the poor areas — built along a lagoon in this port city of 6.3 million on West Africa's southern coast — suffer deadly floods during the rainy season. More than 300 people have been killed since 2005 and officials say the deluges become breeding grounds for water-borne and other diseases.\nAdvertisement\n'My children and I now sleep under the sun,' said Touré, 50. 'We don't know where to go.'\nDemolitions in low-income neighborhoods are nothing new in Abidjan, where rapid urbanization has led to a population boom and housing shortages, with nearly one in five Ivorians residing in the city. It's a challenge in many parts of Africa where economic woes pushed more people into cities in search of better opportunities, straining an already overstretched infrastructure.\nHowever, the latest Abidjan demolition — mainly in impoverished suburbs in the Gesco and Sebroko districts — is one of the largest in years, with an estimated hundreds of thousands of residents affected since it began in late January. Evicted families and rights groups say that this time, it's being done without prior notice or compensation.\nAdvertisement\nAnalysts say many African governments struggle to manage population explosions in cities and meet growing infrastructure needs. Chimezie Anajama, a policy researcher and founder of Blooming Social Pen development nonprofit, says few administrations have managed to solve the developmental problem.\n'There must be a strong commitment by different African governments to come up with creative solutions to address the infrastructure gaps in African cities,' Anajama said.\nLocal authorities have defended the demolitions, and say relocations of families left homeless to safer areas has started.\nSome 35% of Ivorians are poor. Water shortages are a daily curse, with many forced to fetch water from streams for their daily needs. The country has also had to contend with other challenges, such as jihadi attacks that have spread to coastal states in West Africa, including Ivory Coast.\nAdvertisement\n'The aim is to provide a decent ... living environment for these people,' the Ivory Coast's communications minister, Amadou Coulibaly, has said of the demolition campaigns. He claimed in February that some of those evicted in neighborhoods like Boribana are being resettled in at least 1,000 houses built by the government.\nMany families, however, remain homeless, stranded in several parts of the city.\nThe demolitions are being carried out in 'a brutal manner ... causing disastrous consequences for many families already vulnerable,' the Ivorian League for Human Rights said in a statement. It urged authorities to halt the campaign.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAmong those affected by the demolitions were nearly 2,000 schoolchildren of Cha Hélène College in the Yopougon neighborhood, which was reduced to rubble in February.\nThe school was not informed it would be demolished — neither by the Ivory Coast's ministry of construction nor the national education ministry, said Sévérin Okpo Abe, the school's founder. The children were eventually enrolled in other nearby schools.\nAdvertisement\nMost of the evicted residents who are not sleeping out in the open have either relocated to other parts of Ivory Coast or are squatting with residents elsewhere.\n'We have been made homeless in our own country,' said Aimée Ouédraogo, a spokesperson for women affected by the forced evictions.\nThe evictions broke up families and the homeless were scattered across the city, she added. 'We no longer have a home, we no longer have our family, we no longer have our children next to us.'\nAmid the outrage and protest from the evicted, Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara has asked Abidjan's local authorities to 'show solidarity … to preserve cohesion and social peace.'\nHowever, city's officials say the demolitions are part of a broader project to reconstruct and provide basic amenities in the areas. Plots of land would be leased to those evicted for up to 25 years, for about $16 a month, they say.\nAdvertisement\nOn April 8, the government announced it's started to compensate affected households and that each would get about $405 to support the relocation. In a country where the minimum wage is about $121 a month, some believe it's not enough to afford the growing cost of housing.\n'All displaced people will receive the necessary support for their relocation,' said Belmonde Dogo, the minister in charge of efforts to alleviate poverty.\nThe Yopougon municipality, mostly of working-class residents, also announced plans to help those affected.\nBut many like Touré say they were overwhelmed by helplessness watching bulldozers rampage through their neighborhoods.\n'I don't have anyone in Abidjan and I don't have money to buy a house,' said the mother of three, not knowing how she would go on. 'I can't do it.'\n___\nAssociated Press writer Chinedu Asadu in Abuja, Nigeria, contributed to this report.",

            "summary": "RICHMOND, Va. — Gambling regulations, school construction and the state budget were on the agenda for Virginia lawmakers returning to Richmond on Wednesday to consider Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's proposed amendments to legislation and his record number of vetoes.\nDemocrats who control the General Assembly don't have the numbers to override Youngkin's vetoes without GOP support, but their leaders have signaled that they plan to reject many of his proposed changes, including most of those he made to the two-year budget bill. Youngkin's rewrite of the spending plan — he's submitted more than 200 amendments — was so extensive, it exceeded the governor's authority, legislative leaders say.\n'If you think of the governor as a surgeon, the Constitution authorizes nips and tucks, but not organ transplants. And his 233 amendments are trying to give the budget a new heart, lungs and kidneys,' said Senate Democratic Majority Leader Scott Surovell, who predicted lawmakers would reject the vast majority of Youngkin's proposed changes to that bill.\nAdvertisement\nPrior to Wednesday's so-called reconvened session, Democratic lawmakers spent weeks publicly at odds with the governor over the budget that they sent him in a bipartisan vote on the final day of their regular session.\nYoungkin embarked on a series of public events during which he blasted what he called the 'backward budget,' criticizing lawmakers for including a sales tax expansion to digital products that he initially proposed at the start of the process in December but had paired with an income tax cut that Democrats rejected. The governor has said unequivocally that he won't sign a budget that increases taxes.\nDemocrats criticized Youngkin for his tour but then launched one of their own to defend their budget plan, which would increase K-12 education spending and pay for teachers and other public workers.\nAdvertisement\nWith his budget amendments, the governor has proposed sticking with the tax policy status quo, which required him to also suggest spending cuts and other accounting maneuvers to account for the revenue that would be lost by eliminating the new digital sales tax.\nDemocratic Del. Luke Torian, who chairs the House of Delegates' budget-writing committee, signaled in an interview Tuesday that his caucus has no intention of going along with that proposal from the governor.\n'The new digital economy (tax), as we call it, is something that's important to us,' he said.\nLawmakers' objections to Youngkin's budget changes could very well result in a version that he ends up vetoing, something longtime government observers say would be unprecedented.\n'My thinking is, we're just at the beginning of the battle,' said Bob Holsworth, a veteran political analyst and commentator.\nAdvertisement\nThe governor has said he hopes to avoid that option, however. He struck an optimistic tone in a statement Tuesday, saying he was encouraged by extensive discussions with legislators from both chambers and both parties.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'Tomorrow is another step towards our destination, which is to pass and sign a common ground budget,' Youngkin said.\nLawmakers will also be working through dozens of other bills Youngkin returned to them with suggested changes, including a heavily lobbied measure dealing with so-called skill games, gambling machines that proliferated in convenience stores and other small businesses around the state before lawmakers passed a ban in 2020.\nThis year's legislation would legalize, regulate and tax the machines, though the changes Youngkin suggested would implement far stricter limits and a higher tax rate than the version the Assembly sent him. Convenience stores around the state staged demonstrations this week, briefly halting lottery ticket sales Monday and closing for an hour on Tuesday, in an effort to draw attention to the issue and urge lawmakers to reject the governor's amendments.\nAdvertisement\nSurovell said he saw the skill-games bill as one of two that could potentially face a veto override, the other being a measure that would have allowed all localities to hold a referendum on raising sales taxes to help fund school construction. The bill passed with strong bipartisan support and has been supported by school officials in red-leaning rural areas.\nIn remarks Tuesday with reporters, House Speaker Don Scott said he's gotten calls from school superintendents in southwest Virginia who questioned the veto. Scott also criticized the governor for a proposed amendment that would ban state funding for abortions in cases of severe fetal abnormalities.\nBetween Youngkin's proposed amendments and his record number of vetoes — more this year alone than in any of the complete four-year terms of the state's past seven governors, according to the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project — the governor showed he's no moderate, Scott said.\nAdvertisement\n'He went after the most vulnerable citizens again,' Scott said. 'And so we're just saying that he's not a middle-ground, bipartisan governor. He has been an extreme — I call him MAGA-in-disguise — governor,' Scott said, referring to the 'Make America Great Again' slogan of former president and presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.",

            "summary": "For months, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has boasted of a plan to spread artificial intelligence across its services, allowing billions of people to use chatbots in everything from Facebook to its VR-powered goggles.\nThat vision is becoming a reality. Zuckerberg announced Thursday the company will integrate its conversational chatbot, Meta AI, across its social media apps, allowing the tool to generate images and answer questions from its users.\nThe company also introduced the latest iteration of its large language model, Llama 3, a move that puts Meta's AI tools squarely in competition with the leading AI chatbots, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Microsoft's Copilot and Anthropic's Claude. Zuckerberg touted the revamped Meta AI product as the 'the most intelligent AI assistant' that's free to use.\nAdvertisement\nBut experts warn that the broad use of the AI chatbot may amplify problems that have long plagued Meta's social networks, including harmful misinformation, hate speech and extremist content. The company's image generator is also likely to spark debates about how it chooses to depict race and gender when drumming up imaginary scenarios.\n'There was a general fear about how LLMs would interact with social and exacerbate misinformation, hate speech, etc.,' said Anika Collier Navaroli, a senior fellow at Columbia's Tow Center for Digital Journalism and a former senior Twitter policy official. 'And it feels like they just keep making it easier for the bad predictions to come true.'\nMeta spokesman Kevin McAlister said in a statement that the 'new technology and it may not always return the response we intend, which is the same for all generative AI systems.'\nAdvertisement\n'Since we launched, we've constantly released updates and improvements to our models and we're continuing to work on making them better,' he added.\nWhile Meta AI will be available on a new stand-alone website, it will also populate search boxes on WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger. Meta has also experimented with putting the AI assistant into groups on Facebook, where it automatically chimes in to answer questions in groups if no one has responded in an hour.\non a new stand-alone website, it will also populate search boxes on WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger. Meta has also experimented with putting the AI assistant into groups on Facebook, where it automatically chimes in to answer questions in groups if no one has responded in an hour.\nMeta has long faced scrutiny from activists and regulators about how it handles dicey content about politics, social issues and current events. AI-powered chatbots, which are known to 'hallucinate' and give responses that are false or not grounded in reality, could deepen these controversies.\nIncluding the chatbots is 'inviting these tools to opine on topics from education to health, housing to local politics — all domains where developers of AI technology should be treading carefully,' said Miranda Bogen, the director of the AI Governance Lab at the think tank Center for Democracy & Technology and a former AI policy manager at Meta. 'If developers fail to think through the contexts in which AI tools will be deployed, these tools will not only be ill-suited for their intended tasks but also risk causing confusion, disruption and harm.'\nAdvertisement\nOn Wednesday, Princeton computer science and public affairs professor Aleksandra Korolova posted screenshots on X of Meta AI speaking up in a Facebook group for thousands of New York City parents. Responding to a question about gifted and talented programs, Meta AI claimed to be a parent with experience in the city's school system, and it went on to recommend a specific school.\nMcAlister said the product is evolving and some people may start to see 'some responses from Meta AI are replaced with a new response that says ‘This answer wasn't useful and was removed. We'll continue to improve Meta AI.''\nMeta AI claims to have a child in a NYC public school and share their child's experience with the teachers! The reply is in response to a question looking for personal feedback in a private Facebook group for parents. Also, Meta's algorithm ranks it as the top comment! @AIatMeta pic.twitter.com/wdwqFObWxt\n— Aleksandra Korolova (@korolova) April 17, 2024\nThis week, an entrepreneur experimenting with Meta AI in WhatsApp found that it made up a blog post accusing him of plagiarism — even offering a formal citation for the post, which does not exist.\nAdvertisement\nImage generators like Meta's have also come with their own problems. Earlier this month, a Verge reporter struggled to get Meta AI to generate images of an Asian person with a white person in a couple or as friends, despite giving the service repeated and specific prompts. In February, Google blocked the ability to generate images of people on its artificial intelligence tool Gemini after some users accused it of anti-White bias.\nNow, Navaroli said she worries that biases baked into AI tools 'will be fed back into social timelines,' potentially reinforcing those biases in a 'feedback loop to hell.'\nKorolova, the Princeton professor, said Meta AI's potentially false claims in Facebook groups are likely 'only a tip of the iceberg of harms Meta didn't anticipate.'",

            "summary": "TALLADEGA, Ala. — Suddenly, Michael Jordan's new life seems just as satisfying as his old one. This felt a whole lot like M.J. knocking down a buzzer-beater, winning the big game, celebrating like a champion.\nOf course, his title-hoarding days in the NBA are long behind him.\nBut Jordan's current passion is filling that competitive void.\nFor the first time since he became a NASCAR Cup team owner, Jordan was at the track to savor in person a victory by one of his drivers.\nAnd what a win it was!\nWhen Michael McDowell crashed with the finish line in sight at Talladega Superspeedway, losing control in a desperate effort to block another driver from passing him, Tyler Reddick sped right on by to steal the checkered flag Sunday.\nNot unlike all those times Jordan sank an improbable shot to win the game for the Chicago Bulls.\nAdvertisement\n'To me, this is like an NBA playoff game,' said Jordan, who co-owns the 23XI team with Denny Hamlin. 'And for us to win a big race like this, it means so much to me. I'm all in. I love it.'\nThe winning driver didn't even realize Jordan was at the track — he's always rather low-key and apparently didn't want to put any extra pressure on his drivers, Reddick and Bubba Wallace — but it sure made the occasion even more special.\nWhen Reddick got to Victory Lane, he was greeted by his boss, who had scooped up Reddick's 4-year-old son, Beau, on pit road.\n'In the moment it means a lot, but as he gets older and everything too, looking back on that, that's going to be really, really cool moment,' said Reddick, who was hired by 23XI in a surprising move before this season.\nBeau knows who his daddy's boss is, but more for the sneakers he made so famous. Reddick plans to rectify that in the years ahead.\nAdvertisement\n'I've got to probably play some highlights, some Finals matchups, and educate Beau a little bit better,' Reddick said. 'Play some old-school games for him so he can get a real good feel of how dominant (Jordan) was in his prime.'\nIt was undoubtedly a big moment for NASCAR, which has endured some dips in popularity but seems on the upswing again.\nJudging by the reaction on social media at seeing His Airness celebrating wildly in the pits, like he once did on the court, Reddick's victory is sure to move the needle even more. For good measure, the No. 45 Toyota was adorned with the Basketball Hall of Famer's iconic 'Jumpman' logo.\n'Yeah, 23XI is very important to this sport, absolutely,' Hamlin said. 'It's good for everything you can imagine. You're talking sponsorship, your manufacturers, your team morale. It's just so good, and it is in so many different ways.'\nAdvertisement\nAlways one to deliver a well-timed verbal jab, Jordan couldn't resist taking a poke at his co-owner, who drives for Joe Gibbs Racing and was knocked out by a crash with 33 laps remaining that also took out Wallace.\n'Actually, he did a good job of wrecking, so we could get up front,' Jordan said of Hamlin. 'That was actually pretty good.'\nMcDowell started from the pole, dominated the later laps and was in position to give Ford its much-needed first victory of the year. But his desperate efforts to block Brad Keselowski, another Ford driver, wound up costing them both.\nMcDowell swerved to thwart Keselowski on the high side of the track, only to lose control when he attempted an even bolder block to cut off his challenger darting to the inside. McDowell went into a spin, Keselowski had to check up and Reddick sped by to claim his sixth career Cup victory by 0.208 seconds while a bunch of other cars crashed behind them.\nAdvertisement\nCorey LaJoie slid across the finish line with his No. 7 machine on its side, pinned by another car against the wall in front of the grandstands.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nHaving Jordan witness the improbable finish with his own eyes only added to Reddick's jubilation.\n'He's come to a few races, and unfortunately, even as good as the days have looked, they've not ended in Victory Lane,' Reddick said. 'So for us to win a race like that, be up front as much as we were at the end and it looked like it was slipping away, and then we get it back, man, it's an unreal feeling.'\nFor Jordan, the wild finish sparked memories of his former life, the one where he won six NBA championships and was always at his best with the game on the line.\nYet make no mistake: the 61-year-old Jordan is fully committed these days to stock car racing.\nAdvertisement\n'It replaces a lot of the competitiveness that I had in basketball,' he said, before quickly adding a caveat. 'But this is even worse, because I have no control. If I was playing basketball, I'd have total control. But I have no control, so I live vicariously through the drivers, crew chiefs and everybody.'\nOn a wild Sunday in east Alabama, that was more than enough for M.J.\n___",

            "summary": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — A leader like Bob Graham would be a unicorn in the hyper-partisan politics of today.\nThe former Florida governor and U.S. senator wasn't a slick, slogan-spouting politician. He didn't have an us-against-them mentality. Sometimes, he even came across as more of a kind-hearted professor just trying to make the world a better place.\nHe connected with people on a very real level during his nearly five decades in politics, and he had immense respect for the nation's political process and institutions. Graham died Tuesday at the age of 87.\nIn a state long politically divided and now dominated by Republicans, he earned support among Republicans and Democrats alike with a folksy charm that belied the fact that he was a millionaire Harvard-educated lawyer. He fit in just as easily in conservative, rural north Florida as he did in bustling Miami.\nAdvertisement\nGraham was known for his workdays, when he would try a new job for a day. They began when he was a state senator and became a regular feature in his campaigns and time in office. It was his way to meet and connect with every day folks. His 408th and final workday was wrapping Christmas presents for a Florida Keys charity.\n'I've been Santa Claus, I've been an elf and, on a number of occasions as today, I've been a Santa Claus helper,' Graham said that day, wearing a red shirt instead of a red suit.\nThe workdays were similar to the 1,003-mile walk that former U.S. Sen. and Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles used to launch his foray into national politics.\n'I don't know why there hasn't been other efforts, either to emulate a walk or workdays or some other way to establish a special relationship with the people,' Graham said.\nAdvertisement\nAfter he retired from politics, Graham made it his goal to encourage people — all people — to get involved in civic affairs, from the local level on up. He established the Bob Graham Center for Public Service at the University of Florida, which list its mission as 'three central principles: civic engagement, public leadership and public service.'\nIn his book 'America: The Owners Manual,' Graham wrote, 'Since my retirement from the U.S. Senate in 2005, I have become increasingly involved in the effort to transform civics from a spectator sport into a participatory sport — one in which citizens directly engage in democracy and shape local, state and federal policies to the betterment of their families and communities.'\nPresident Joe Biden, who served in the Senate with Graham, described him as a person of principle.\nAdvertisement\n'Bob loved people, and he knew that politics at its core is about learning from and serving others. That's why he spent more than 400 ‘workdays' on the job with constituents, doing everything from picking tomatoes, to handling baggage, to patrolling the streets with police. He knew it matters to walk a mile in other folks' shoes,' Biden said in a statement.\nGraham briefly ran for president in 2004, emphasizing his opposition to the invasion of Iraq. When Al Gore lost Florida, and thus the presidency, by 537-votes to George W. Bush in 2000, many speculated that Gore would have won if he had picked Graham instead of Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman as his running mate.\nDemocrats and Republicans remember him fondly.\n'Florida and our country has lost a great public servant. Bob Graham served Floridians with a servants heart, with integrity and with civility. Columba and I are praying for the Graham family,' former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush said in an email.\nAdvertisement\nCharlie Crist, who served as a Republican governor before switching parties and serving as Democratic U.S. representative, said Graham was an influence on him.\n'I always felt that when he was governor, that he was trying to govern for the people of Florida — not in any way political or partisan — and I took that to heart and tried to, in some small way, emulate it,' Crist said in a phone interview.\nGraham's daughter, former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham, tried following in her father's footsteps, running for governor in 2018 in much the same spirit he did, continuing his workdays and promising to put people over politics. She narrowly lost the Democratic primary and Republican Ron DeSantis went on to win the general election.\n'I've certainly learned from him, but I would never expect anyone to support me simply because I am Dad's daughter,' Graham told The Associated Press before announcing her candidacy. 'I will be a governor that does focus on what he focused on, which is making the right decisions for Florida again.'\nAdvertisement\nAt her announcement, Bob Graham was present, and spoke of how he relished the job. 'In a life of public service, I don't think there is a more exciting but demanding job than being governor,' he said.\nChris Hand, a former speechwriter for Graham who co-wrote 'America: The Owners Manual' with him, said his love of people was genuine, whether it was during workdays or meeting well-wishers after his retirement.\n'He was never anything but sincerely interested in the stories they would share and he would usually conclude by getting their contact information so he could stay in touch,' Hand said. 'I think that's one of his defining features as a leader. He truly loved the people that he represented, saw them as the best source of his ideas and truly enjoyed hearing their stories and learning from them.'\n___",

            "summary": "Remind me again why Americans think Donald Trump would be so much better on inflation and the economy?\nTrump's policy team is reportedly scheming to devalue the U.S. dollar. This might well be Trump's most inflationary and economically destructive idea yet. That's quite an achievement, considering everything else he and his advisers have cooked up (universal tariff hikes, deficit-financed tax cuts, huge reductions in the labor force, etc.).\nTrump's objective, Politico reports, is to boost U.S. exports and reduce imports. Basically, if a dollar buys, say, fewer euros or Japanese yen than it currently does, that makes U.S.-made products look a little cheaper and potentially more attractive to European and Japanese customers (among others). So, hey, maybe this could help some U.S. companies trying to sell products abroad.\nAdvertisement\nThat is, until you consider everything else that might happen if we deliberately tried to weaken our currency, which would open up a Pandora's shipping container of disastrous consequences.\nelse that might happen if we deliberately tried to weaken our currency, which would open up a Pandora's shipping container of disastrous consequences.\nFollow this author Catherine Rampell 's opinions\nFollow this author\nCatherine Rampell\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nIt's true the dollar is unusually strong right now, although probably not for reasons Trump is happy about. Exchange rates typically reflect a country's macroeconomic conditions (among other factors, such as interest rates). Thanks to a variety of factors — including our relatively limited exposure to the war in Ukraine — we're doing better than most of our peer countries. In the words of Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor and former International Monetary Fund chief economist, 'The U.S. economy has been on a tear.'\nThe relative strength of the dollar does make U.S.-made goods less attractive, though with so many other countries in or edging toward recession, our potential global customers might not be feeling terribly flush anyway. I suppose if Trump tanked the U.S. economy, whether on purpose or otherwise, that might achieve his objective of swiftly weakening the dollar and shrinking trade deficits.\nAdvertisement\nIf not via recession, how would Team Trump weaken our currency? That's not totally clear. He might try to force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. This is something Trump already wants to do for other reasons. (For instance, he owes a lot of debt, so lower rates would help his own finances.) Or maybe he would bully lots of other countries into raising their interest rates, which seems unlikely to happen. But if it did, it might result in a global recession.\nOr perhaps he would tax foreign financial flows into the United States, as some senators have proposed. This, too, would likely tank the economy, according to Peterson Institute for International Economics fellow Maurice Obstfeld.\n(Noticing any themes here?)\nWhatever the mechanism, a weaker dollar would likely lead to higher prices for American consumers , and not just during their summer vacations to Italy. Americans buy a lot of imported goods, from fruit to toys to cars to home furnishings. Those would all get more expensive as the purchasing power of the dollar fell.\nhigher prices for American consumers, and not just during their summer vacations to Italy. Americans buy a lot of imported goods, from fruit to toys to cars to home furnishings. Those would all get more expensive as the purchasing power of the dollar fell.\nAdvertisement\nSo much for Trump's pledge to vanquish inflation. And that's not the only problem with his plan.\nPerhaps some U.S. exports would get more competitive, as Trump hopes. Ironically, though, some U.S. industries that stand to benefit most from a weaker dollar are not exactly Republican darlings. They include Big Tech, Hollywood and higher education, sectors that enjoy some combination of being quite competitive at exporting things and/or having large offshore profits, which would become more valuable.\nThere's also a risk that other countries won't want to go along with Trump's scheme. Our trading partners might engage in a series of countermeasures to keep their currencies from appreciating against the dollar, which we might meet with counter-countermeasures, and so on. In other words, we might see a sequel to the trade wars Trump initiated before.\nAdvertisement\nGlobal trade or currency wars would, again, likely be bad for pretty much everyone, including U.S. businesses and consumers.\nDeliberately weakening the dollar, or even attempting to, also threatens its role as the world's 'reserve currency.' We have a stable government that has reliably paid its bills and doesn't do dodgy things to deliberately manipulate the value of its fiat currency. As a result, the dollar is widely used in international trade and dollar-denominated U.S. government debt is in high demand.\nThe fact that U.S. dollars are considered a virtually risk-free store of value gives the United States some huge privileges. It enables us to keep spending more than we collect in taxes, since it's cheap and easy for our government to borrow to finance ever-growing deficits. Eroding the dollar's global use might make it more expensive for the U.S. government to keep borrowing so much (which means taxes might need to rise, or spending decline, to cover budget shortfalls).\nAdvertisement\nWe might also weaken our ability to impose sanctions upon countries, businesses or individuals whose actions we disapprove of, since dollars are used so often in international transactions and we have some ability to restrict those transactions.",

            "summary": "NEW YORK — More than a year after he was criminally charged in his former home city, Donald Trump came face-to-face Monday with some of the New Yorkers who could decide his fate.\nTo protect their anonymity, however, the 96 prospective jurors brought into a 15th-floor courtroom at the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse on Monday were referred to only by their court identification numbers. They were not shown on the closed-circuit feed in the media overflow room.\nManhattan prosecutors and Trump's defense team received a list of names, but New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan strictly forbade them from making it public.\nTrump, present in the courtroom for nearly six hours of proceedings, craned his neck to get a glimpse as the jury pool entered. He stood and looked their way when Merchan introduced him as the defendant.\nAdvertisement\nAnd he listened impassively as the credentials of the first 10 prospective jurors came into view: Longtime New Yorkers, and some relative newcomers, who mostly read the New York Times, listen to NPR and watch CNN. A few said they tune into Fox News and read the conservative-leaning New York Post.\nMost of those 10 prospective jurors who answered a questionnaire in court Monday were not voracious consumers of social media — with the exception of a marketing director at FanDuel, a sports betting app — and none had read Trump's books or attended his political rallies, or participated actively in anti-Trump rallies.\nFor the most part, they identified themselves as having no strong views of the defendant that could prevent them from being impartial — a seeming rarity in a nation sharply polarized, particularly on the question of Trump's presidency and, in some quarters, his guilt or innocence.\nAdvertisement\nThere were only hints about how they might feel about the case in which Trump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up payments to an adult-film actress ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump has pleaded not guilty and called the prosecution politically motivated.\n'I feel nobody is above the law — whether a sitting president, a former president or a janitor,' said one man, a bookseller from the Upper West Side who is married with two children, one entering college and one finishing. He copped to listening to a good amount of talk radio — when his morning alarm rings, in the shower and while commuting.\n'It's NPR on all three occasions,' the man said.\nAll told, a jury of 12 New Yorkers, with six alternates, will be selected to decide Trump's fate.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBefore hearing from individual prospective jurors, Merchan had asked any of the pool of 96 to raise their hands if they could not be impartial — or if they could not serve for any other reason. Several hands went up, and the judge dismissed them from the jury pool.\nAdvertisement\nThen, one by one, they entered the jury box and read off the answers to the questions. New York is the city that made Trump famous, as a Queens-born real estate magnate who owns Trump Tower in Midtown, and whose residents first got to know him as a gossip-pages tabloid fixture during his rise in the 1980s.\nBut the opening day of jury selection sounded more like the prospective jurors were reciting their dating app profiles than sounding off about their partisan views of Trump.\nThe first man was a venture capitalist with a master's degree in business administration who likes to frequent city restaurants and listens to the New York Times' podcast 'The Daily,' a breakdown of the day's biggest news stories.\nThe next man was a creative director who has worked for Lands' End and Kenneth Cole who enjoys hiking, cooking and playing with his dog. One woman works in marketing for a city government agency and enjoys going to public parks and theater shows.\nAdvertisement\nWere these folks Democrats or Republicans? MAGA or part of Resistance Twitter? It was difficult, if impossible, to say. Hints, based on education, news consumption or jobs, about where they fall on the political spectrum would have to be sussed out when the prosecutors and defense attorneys directly question the jury pool in the coming days.\nThere were humorous moments, and human ones: 'My wife works at a bank but I have no idea what she does,' confessed one man, a public prosecutor in Bronx County who told Merchan that, despite his profession, he could judge Trump impartially.\nFor Trump, who is required to be in the courtroom each day for a trial that the judge has said could last six to eight weeks, an up-close view of the jury appears to be a key component of his legal strategy. His lawyers told Merchan that the former president, who once held summits with global leaders, wants to be present for private sidebar questioning of potential jurors in a small conference room.\nAdvertisement\nMerchan responded that such a scenario, which would require a Secret Service agent to be present, could prove intimidating to the potential jurors — instead, he said, the sidebars would take place in the courtroom, with the rest of the jury pool removed.\nBy day's end, there was but a single moment that appeared to reflect the nation's great political polarization. One woman, who had not raised her hand to be dismissed, said 'yes' to a question about whether she had strong feelings about Trump that could preclude her from being impartial.\nThe judge asked lawyers from both parties to approach the bench, then dismissed the woman, a Harlem resident who works at Bloomingdale's and likes to shop and go clubbing.",

            "summary": "It's 4 p.m., and the corner of 14th and Irving streets NW in D.C. brims with activity. Vendors fervently tout their offerings — 'mango, mango, mango fresco' and 'tenemos tacos' — against a din of hip-hop, the occasional siren and a preacher's voice booming through a loudspeaker.\nNearby, some 20 moped drivers sit parked in a line, wedged behind a bike lane and stalls selling coconuts and Ethiopian barbecue. Some sip Chick-fil-A milkshakes or listen to music as they wait for their phones to ping: the welcome sound of a hungry customer ordering delivery.\nThe drivers have become a fixture on this corner in Columbia Heights, part of a new wave of Venezuelan immigrants who have entered the capital's food delivery industry and filled the city's streets with mopeds. Many are among the nearly 8 million people who have fled Venezuela since 2014, as the country faces a political, economic and humanitarian crisis. While most have set down roots across Latin America, the number of migrants trekking north to the United States has soared in recent years. They've also brought a food delivery system that's helped them survive in other countries.\nAdvertisement\nThe Washington Post spoke with more than 15 Venezuelan moped drivers about their growing, not-so-underground economy. Delivering food for companies like DoorDash and Uber has become a lifeline for many of D.C.'s Venezuelans, some of whom were among the more than 13,000 migrants Republican governors have bused to the city since 2022. As they pursue the months-long process of claiming asylum and applying for work permits, many immigrants have leaned on food delivery to stay afloat financially.\ntheir growing, not-so-underground economy. Delivering food for companies like DoorDash and Uber has become a lifeline for many of D.C.'s Venezuelans, some of whom were among the more than 13,000 migrants Republican governors have bused to the city since 2022. As they pursue the months-long process of claiming asylum and applying for work permits, many immigrants have leaned on food delivery to stay afloat financially.\nFor most, food delivery offers far more autonomy over their schedules and pay than other industries. But they acknowledged numerous hurdles — for instance, the lack of access to health insurance, which heightens the financial risks of any accident. Expenses such as 'renting' food-delivery accounts and financing mopeds add to their burdens. And while some drivers say that their ability to deliver food quickly has been praised by customers and restaurants, some D.C. residents have publicly expressed frustration at what they say is erratic and unsafe behavior on the mopeds.\nYonatan Colmenarez, a 31-year-old Venezuelan immigrant, has made a living as a moped delivery driver since February. Today, he's been up since sunrise, but the day has been slow. Around 4:10 p.m., he gets a notification from his Uber Eats account.\nIt takes Colmenarez a little over three minutes to hop on his moped and grab the order at Lou's City Bar about a block away. By 4:21 p.m., he's carefully placed the food in front of a resident's door. Colmenarez has made $3 on the trip, adding to the $90 he has gathered by riding all over Washington. But he'll be out on the street until midnight — or, at least, until he makes his daily goal of $200.\n'I'm working really hard to contribute to this country that opened its doors to us,' Colmenarez said in Spanish. 'At the end of the day, it's a job many Americans don't want to do, but I do it gladly because I want to show that I appreciate being here and that most of us are good people. After all it took to arrive, being in the United States is truly a blessing from God.'\nAdvertisement\nThe dangerous journey\nThough their paths in the United States differ, many of the Venezuelans' stories begin the same way: Desperation and a hope for a brighter future that propels them to embark on a perilous journey north — one often marked by death.\nColmenarez was once a member of the Venezuelan army. Over time, he became disenchanted by the country's authoritarian government and how years of mismanagement had resulted in families barely scraping by and struggling to feed their children. In 2016, he defected to Colombia. For seven years, he dabbled in taxi driving, food delivery and document processing — a skill he acquired while working at Venezuela's civil registry agency. In 2023, Colombia's low salaries, inflation and lack of jobs pushed him to venture to the United States.\nHe left last April with $228 in his pocket, a small backpack and one big prayer: 'I said, ‘Lord, if it's your will, someday you'll let me arrive. And if I do, I just ask that you help me save enough to buy a house in my country — whatever else you give me ahead will be blessings.''\nwith $228 in his pocket, a small backpack and one big prayer: 'I said, ‘Lord, if it's your will, someday you'll let me arrive. And if I do, I just ask that you help me save enough to buy a house in my country — whatever else you give me ahead will be blessings.''\nColmenarez said he nearly died after crossing a treacherous swath of jungle between Colombia and Panama, known as the Darién Gap. He ran out of money and resorted to drinking from puddles and rivers, which gave him a severe infection.\nBy May 1, Colmenarez had crossed — mostly by foot — through Panama, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico, where he turned himself in to U.S. officials in Ciudad Juárez. After he was processed and released on parole some 13 days later, a friend helped him pay for a flight to D.C. He spent his first night on the street, perched on a park bench and shivering from the cold.\nA new economy\nYonatan Colmenarez, a 31-year-old Venezuelan immigrant, makes a food delivery in Washington, D.C. (Video: María Luisa Paúl/The Washington Post)\nThe moped deliveries in D.C. began about two years ago, according to the drivers, with three Venezuelan immigrants and one Colombian. Since then, the trade has evolved into a cottage industry fostered by word-of-mouth recommendations and mutual trust. The drivers share advice, from navigating the labyrinth of popular eateries to establishing online bank accounts with minimal verification. Many buy their mopeds from Facebook Marketplace, local stores or from one man who sells them out of a white van near a Panda Express in Columbia Heights.\ninto a cottage industry fostered by word-of-mouth recommendations and mutual trust. The drivers share advice, from navigating the labyrinth of popular eateries to establishing online bank accounts with minimal verification. Many buy their mopeds from Facebook Marketplace, local stores or from one man who sells them out of a white van near a Panda Express in Columbia Heights.\nAfter arriving in D.C., Colmenarez found himself a home in one of the city's shelters and eventually gained work authorization. He decided to take up moped deliveries after hearing about them from a friend, figuring that would be a better option than juggling work at a construction company in Virginia during the day and a midnight shift at McDonald's.\nMcDonald's.\nIn February, he gathered $300 to pay the first weekly installment for a $1,500 moped from a Colombian man who had imported the vehicles from New York City, where immigrants are similarly working as delivery drivers. He opened an Uber Eats account and set up a schedule: delivering from 7 a.m. to about 3 p.m., resting at 4 p.m., a slow period the drivers call 'la hora muerta,' and heading back out from 5 p.m. to midnight, six days a week.\nan Uber Eats account and set up a schedule: delivering from 7 a.m. to about 3 p.m., resting at 4 p.m., a slow period the drivers call 'la hora muerta,' and heading back out from 5 p.m. to midnight, six days a week.\nNow, Colmenarez makes about $4,000 each month — $700 of which he sends to his wife and three children, who live in a home he bought for them in Venezuela with his earnings, 'just like I asked God for.'\nOthers in the business said they earn about the same amount as Colmenarez, though much depends on the time they put in and the tips they receive. The earnings have allowed many to afford rent in neighborhoods across the region, especially in Maryland, where most of the drivers said they live. Some have also bought cars or higher-quality mopeds. Others help their families and take English lessons at night.\nThe job comes with challenges: The migrants work rain or shine and in snow, ice and wind. Their mopeds have occasionally been stolen — but some said that, instead of reporting it to police, they try to gather enough money to buy another bike. And car drivers who aren't used to mopeds on the streets seemingly 'just throw themselves at us,' said Raibi González, 32.\nMany migrants without work permits 'rent' Uber Eats or DoorDash accounts from relatives or friends, often for a weekly fee of $100 to $150. Spokespeople for Uber and DoorDash said they have safeguards in place to try to ensure that everyone using their platforms is who they say they are. Both said anyone using an account fraudulently will be removed from the app.\nYonatan Colmenarez, a Venezuelan immigrant, drives through D.C. to make food deliveries. (Video: María Luisa Paúl/The Washington Post)\nSeveral drivers said D.C. police have mostly left them alone, but they fear that any misstep could cause police to crack down on unregistered mopeds, like they've done in New York City.\nCity officials from the Office of Migrant Services and the Highway Safety Office have been meeting with the drivers and their vendors to educate them about local traffic rules.\n'Fortunately, we have seen no uptick in crashes involving these devices and we want it to stay that way,' Deputy Mayor for Operations and Infrastructure Keith Anderson said in a statement.\nTo avoid confrontations with other residents or police, some drivers are seeking to formalize their work with the city. They've proposed having a delimited area where they can park without disturbing traffic; organizing more courses on traffic rules; wearing uniforms that highlight them as delivery drivers; and getting help registering their mopeds — a process that requires identification documents, such as a passport, that are hard to come by in Venezuela and that many migrants don't have.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nD.C. law requires drivers to register mopeds with more than 55 cubic centimeters of motor power. That means many of the delivery workers' vehicles should be registered, said council member Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1), who represents Columbia Heights and chairs the committee overseeing regulation of for-hire vehicles. Registrations of motor-driven cycles, a category that includes mopeds, more than doubled last year, from 54 in 2022 to 143 in 2023, according to the D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles.\nNadaeu said she supports clarifying the registration rules and educating recent immigrants about the requirements. She added that she arranged for a traffic-control officer at 14th and Irving streets NW to designate an area where the mopeds can park without blocking traffic.\n'As we continue to redesign our streets, we need to be thinking about how to incorporate these vehicles and their uses,' Nadeau said.\nAdvertisement\nThe more the city supports the drivers, the better, said Abel Nuñez, executive director of the local immigration advocacy group CARECEN. More organization, he said, could help new immigrants safely make a living without relying on government subsidies.\n'It's a little messy right now, but it has incredible potential to be a win-win for everyone,' Nuñez said.\nAndy Brown, owner of popular local chain Andy's Pizza, mostly sees the messiness. He said he has asked delivery apps not to send moped drivers to his restaurants and directs his staff to turn drivers away if they arrive on the bikes anyway.\nMany customers have complained about pizzas being cold after arriving via moped, with air rushing into the box during transit, he said. While Brown appreciates that food delivery enables recent immigrants to work, he's concerned about the impact on his business.\n'There's pros and cons,' he said. 'There just are.'\n‘Be an eagle'\nEvery morning, Colmenarez repeats the same mantra: 'Be an eagle.' It's a phrase he borrowed from an interview with a taxi driver he saw online, which, in essence, means going the extra mile for the job.\nFor Colmenarez, that means meticulously choosing his outfit, spraying cologne before leaving and constantly communicating with his customers — something that, he said, has enabled him to achieve Uber's highest status tier for drivers, Diamond. But it's not always easy: There's usually a language barrier. And he grieves the distance from his family.\n'I've had to cry alone because there are moments when one gets depressed,' he said. 'But then, you say, ‘Let's go, you can find a way' — that is, instead of doing bad things, always trying to find a way to make a difference.'\nColmenarez returns to the silver linings: The city he gets to explore. The beauty of the sun as it sets over historic monuments. His children's smiles when they FaceTime. The people he feeds every time his phone pings — whether they're in the Russell Senate Office Building, the White House, a police station or a random apartment building.\n'I've made it this far in the American Dream,' Colmenarez said.\nFor some, that dream means grinding as delivery drivers for as long as there's appetite in the city. Others hope to land better jobs or make enough money to have their families join them in the United States.",

            "summary": "Nicholas F. Jacobs is an assistant professor of government at Colby College, where Daniel M. Shea is a professor of government. They are the authors of ' The Rural Voter .' This op-ed was adapted from an article in UnHerd .\nNicholas F. Jacobs is an assistant professor of government at Colby College, where Daniel M. Shea is a professor of government. They are the authors of 'The Rural Voter.' This op-ed was adapted from an article in UnHerd.\nA good American progressive is meant to disapprove of disparaging political stereotypes. But that hasn't stopped them gleefully embracing the caricature of the enraged rural American. You know the tropes; they're the last ones you can utter in respectable conversation: 'white trash,' 'redneck,' 'hillbilly,' all them ignorant belligerents in stark raving anger ready to storm the Capitol.\nAcademic Thomas Schaller, co-author of 'White Rural Rage: The Threat to American Democracy,' recently stoked this prejudice on MSNBC: Rural voters 'are the most racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-gay geo-demographic group in the country. … They are the most likely to excuse or justify violence as an acceptable alternative to peaceful public discourse.' The book was soon trending on X.\nAdvertisement\nAs two scholars of rural politics, who have spent the past three years poring over thousands of survey interviews with rural Americans, this caricature of the rural rabble-rouser is deeply puzzling. Instead of threats to democracy, or rebellious politics, or reflexive anger, we keep finding something different: pride in rural living, a sense of communal belonging, a shared fate that intertwines the economic well-being of rich and poor in rural communities. Yes, there are resentments, especially toward government officials and experts. But resentment is not a stereotype. It's a motivation, a story.\nStill, rageful stereotypes sell better than complex backstories. And they're easier for our political and media ecosystems to make sense of. Reference some data point about QAnon conspiracies in the heartlands, and you'll raise more money from nervous liberals in the city (who just so happen to live next to three times as many QAnon conspiracy believers). Lash out against the xenophobia in small towns, and you'll mobilize your city voters to the polls. Rage draws clicks. It makes a splash. Yes, racism and hostility toward these groups exists in the countryside, as it does throughout the United States. And we are deeply troubled by the enduring role it plays in U.S. politics. But it is a national problem, not one to which White rural Americans uniquely contribute.\nWhat we do see in rural America are a unique set of resentments or grievances that arise from real and perceived slights against rural communities. These include economic policies that have devastated local industries, a lack of investment in rural infrastructure and education, and a sense of cultural dismissal from urban-centric media and politics.\nAdvertisement\nSuch failures help to explain the deep-rooted skepticism in many rural areas toward government policy solutions. Just consider the aftermath of the North American Free Trade Agreement, implemented in 1994. NAFTA's champions, including both Democrats and Republicans, promised that the deal would bring prosperity to small farmers, but between 1998 and 2018, 1 out of every 10 small U.S. farms disappeared. Not long after the trade barriers were removed, Canadian cattle ranchers flooded the U.S. market with beef and prices plummeted, forcing small farms out of business. Meanwhile, large-scale agribusinesses capitalized on the open borders. If government neglect drove your grandpa off his farm back then, why would you trust it now?\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIf one is interested in building political coalitions that include rural voters, and which may lead to more inclusive and equitable policymaking, it is these resentments that must be understood. The stereotype of the raging rural American misrepresents the complexities of the rural experience. It is why Hollywood fell for Sen. J.D. Vance's (R-Ohio) story of Appalachian poverty, while failing to recognize that he was running a political campaign that spoke to the resilience, values and pride of rural residents. And it is why most progressives don't have much empathy left for rural voters — despite feeling deeply for nearly every other marginalized group in American society.\nIn some circles, this lack of empathy stems from the fact that these so-called deplorables are blamed for having brought Donald Trump to power. As Paul Waldman, the second co-author of 'White Rural Rage,' said: 'If Donald Trump gets back to the Oval Office, it will be because — once again — rural Whites put him there.'\nAdvertisement\nBut rural America is not responsible for Trump. If simply voting for Trump makes you 'enraged,' then the residents of cities and suburbs, from which Trump derived 80 percent of his total votes in 2020, are downright furious. Pinning Trump's gains on decades of rural America's losses is just another form of confirmation bias — reinforcing existing beliefs without critical examination. Rarely do you hear mentions of figures such as Bill Clinton, who championed NAFTA, or Hillary Clinton, who seemed to openly celebrate the fact that she lost the places that were economically suffering the most.\nWith stereotypes of rage come stereotypes of irrationality. But rural folk have good reason to partly blame Democrats, experts and college professors for their misfortunes. They know full well that federal agriculture and trade policies pushed by both Democrats and Republicans did destroy rural economies. And that liberal elites stood by as rural students became one of the least likely groups to attend college, and one of the most likely to drop out. Surely, the drive for diversity and inclusion should include rural kids, too?\ndid destroy rural economies. And that liberal elites stood by as rural students became one of the least likely groups to attend college, and one of the most likely to drop out. Surely, the drive for diversity and inclusion should include rural kids, too?\nWe've also noticed that city dwellers tend use stereotypes as a crutch to disguise the fact that they know very little about how different people live their lives. Both rural and urban people see the 'other' as having different values. Many of these differences are overblown, but some of them are, undoubtedly, true. We see it in our own lives: As college professors who choose to live in the countryside, we hear colleagues playfully say we've 'gone native,' and our neighbors think we're squirrelly. We love both worlds and the people within them, even when they value different things. But stereotypes, generalizations, tropes and unchecked hyperbole foreclose the possibility of closing this divide.\nAdvertisement",

But no matter how it was said, the point came across. It could have been a mistake to call the 2023-24 season the first year of Washington's rebuild under new management. Year Zero might have been more appropriate.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Winger was brought in May 24, he had a general manager to hire, Bradley Beal's leg iron of a contract to deal with and all the customs and quirks of a new organization to feel out. Now, as he heads into his first full offseason, Winger has much of the prep work out of the way and can focus on making big strides that don't have to do with wins and losses.\n'We have more time, we have certainly more education, we have more wisdom about who our people are. … For the better part of the last calendar year, we've been so roster focused, transactionally focused, that despite some of the gains that we made in the environment, we didn't really get to spend a lot of time on the environment,' Winger said during an end-of-season news conference Wednesday. 'This offseason, we do. I guess that's one of the rewards for having that time in April and May and June.'\nWinger speaks of environment both literally and figuratively. He noted that the team just redid some of the space in its practice facility — and, oh yeah, thanks to a $515 million deal with the District, the Wizards get to start dreaming about what renovations to Capital One Arena might look like.\nAdvertisement\nThis summer will be the first when Winger and Dawkins have more oversight over players' offseason programs. Even though many players work with individual coaches over the summer, the plan is for the team to be together more often, be that at summer league in Las Vegas or in players' hometowns.\n'A lot of our guys plan on being in D.C. this summer,' Dawkins said. '… I think you'll see more bonding outside of D.C., but you will see a lot more bodies in the gym in D.C. from May all the way through August.'\nBut the most significant move Winger and Dawkins will make this offseason, and the most important element in establishing the type of culture they want moving forward, is selecting a head coach.\nThat search officially began Wednesday, Winger said, out of fairness to interim coach Brian Keefe, who took over when Wes Unseld Jr. was reassigned in late January. Winger said he intentionally does not have a process in place or a list of names at the ready, though Dawkins laid out some logical parameters.\nAdvertisement\nHe and Winger probably won't be trying to coax veteran coaches to Washington or entering a rat race should well-established coaches end up becoming available. Remember where the Wizards are: The land has just been tilled.\n'We'll look around, and we'll definitely be inclusive,' Dawkins said. 'At the end of the day, I think we're going to find the right person who has the right core characteristics … and will be able to lead us and move us forward in this current phase that we're in as a basketball club.'\nThe players were more concrete with what they're looking for. During their exit interviews Monday, the team's core players listed similar characteristics when asked what kind of coach the organization needs. The ability to hold players accountable, relatability, high-level communication skills and competitiveness were common answers.\nAdvertisement\n'We need a connector. We need somebody who runs to, or isn't afraid of, conflict, runs to difficult things and is a master communicator and connector, I guess,' forward Corey Kispert said. 'The NBA is all about managing 15 egos and making sure everybody feels connected and incorporated for the betterment of the team. It's a really difficult thing to be able to do that while also building a great, high-quality team and raising the level of our play.'\nTurnover happens in every organization every summer, and the new front office is still working with a largely inherited staff, including scouts, assistant coaches, medical team members and other behind-the-scenes employees. Winger said nothing Wednesday about any particular group, but he said 'adding to the staff' was another item on his offseason to-do list.\nIt was more evidence that this offseason, not the last, could be viewed as the true starting point of Washington's rebuild.\nAdvertisement\nWinger said he underestimated, in the beginning, how much more difficult rebuilding the Wizards would be compared with his previous stops. Every team he previously had a hand in building had a natural reset: Oklahoma City was a recently relocated franchise when he and Dawkins were with the Thunder. When he was hired by the Clippers in 2017, Los Angeles was coming off the Lob City era, had made the playoffs each of the previous six seasons and was looking for a refresh.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBut the Wizards drifted from 'bad and stuck' to 'bad but working on it,' which, despite the promise of hope, is still a hard sell.\n'It doesn't feel yet like the reset of a cycle,' Winger said. '… And I sense now just the fan difficulty. They've been extremely supportive, they show up to every game, they're there. … But [fans] have been starving for longer than the other places I've been, and I am now appreciating how that can feel. And, of course, we have to own that. It's not like we can just ignore it.'",

            "summary": "Michelle Minor drove more than 600 miles last summer to drop off her 12-year-old son at NASA space camp, his first overnight summer camp. Once he was settled in, Minor didn't drive back home. She and her partner drove about two hours away to Nashville, where they stayed for the week.\n'I wanted to be close. That's really it. I did not feel like I could have him far away,' Minor said, who lives in Evanston, Ill., multiple states away from her son's camp in Alabama. 'I think he kind of also felt comforted by the fact that I was close by, that I wasn't states and states away.'\nIt was an added bonus that for the first time in a long time, Minor and her partner got to enjoy a couples vacation. They're planning a similar trip this August, when Minor's son goes back to overnight camp.\n'We could get to know each other as just adults again, doing things that we like, that aren't necessarily related to us being parents, like art museums or live music. ... We could actually go see live music that starts at 9 p.m., and we don't have to get up and make scrambled eggs at 7:30,' she joked.\nAdvertisement\nEvery summer, more than 26 million kids and adults attend camps, with overnight camps increasing their enrollment, according to the American Camp Association. As some parents sort out their children's summer plans and make camp packing lists, they're also planning nearby trips of their own. Here's how to start thinking about one.\nWhat to consider\nJody LeVos, chief learning officer at the children's education company Begin, said staying close by while kids go to camp can be comforting for parents, but still allows children to build friendships and independence.\n'It's not going to impact the child's experience. They're away from their parents, whether the parent is half an hour away or six hours away, so it's more about the parent and what makes them comfortable,' LeVos said.\nShe says each child develops independence at their own pace, but when they're emotionally and mentally prepared, overnight camp can be a great opportunity for kids to enhance their skills. The transition, however, can be nerve-racking for parents who are seeing their child's growing independence.\nAdvertisement\n'Parents may be asking the what-ifs, you know, what happens if my child needs me or gets hurt? And so there is some anxiety around, what will the child do when I'm not there to protect them or respond to their every need?' LeVos said.\nShe recommends practicing overnight camp routines with children who are going away for the first time, like having them sleep in their sleeping bag at home first and practicing other routines that may typically get done with help from parents.\nMelanie Gast is planning her first summer vacation spent without her older kids. After years of attending camps near their home in West Palm Beach, Fla., her 13-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son will attend their first overnight camps during the same week; an outdoors summer camp for the eldest, and a nearby overnight science camp for her son.\nAdvertisement\n'I look at this as an amazing vacation for my husband and I,' Gast said. She and her husband will bring their 2-year-old daughter along on the trip to Memphis, but they're planning to take turns entertaining her at the hotel while the other parent visits Graceland, the National Civil Rights Museum and other sights.\n'We'll still have a baby, but that's really different than having a teenager and a 10-year-old,' Gast said. 'So for me this is the best it can get.'\nMost parents find a camp first then find a nearby city to explore, but it's possible to reverse engineer that part of the process. The most important thing to do is make sure the chosen camp will be one that keeps your child engaged from start to finish. Once your kid is enrolled, you can start planning your own nearby getaway, but know that unforeseen hiccups at camp could cut a parent's vacation short, such as illness.\nAdvertisement\nGast chose Memphis as the city she wanted to visit for vacation, then found summer camps for her children that were within a driving range that made her comfortable. Both Gast and Minor said a city that's about a three-hour drive or less from camp is best.\nLeVos says parents who are nervous about how well their child is adapting to their new environment should make time for movement to relieve stress.\n'Going for a walk at night, looking up at the stars, knowing that your child is looking at the same stars can be really helpful and remind families that they may be a little bit apart, but they're still together,' she said.\nLeVos also recommends journaling, for both children at camp and their parents, to explore what emotions come up when the family is apart. Once reunited, family members can use their notes as an entry point for understanding how the time went for everyone.\nAdvertisement\nA win for both parents and kids\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAt the end of camp, LeVos says children will likely return home feeling proud of the way they cared for themselves and developed new skills for managing their emotions.\nThat's what Minor experienced when her son returned from camp last year. He did better than she expected. 'I was like, ‘Oh, okay, you did bring all the clothes home? You actually wore all of them versus wearing the same thing? Oh, you did good.' Those are important life skills,' she said.\nShe's more comfortable sending her son back for another overnight camp this year, but she'll still be vacationing nearby, just in case.\n'This is an opportunity to not only still be the best parent – because as a parent, you get a lot of credibility when you send your kid to space camp, but then you also get to enjoy some of the benefits in a rewarding way,' Minor said. 'Everybody wins here.'",

            "excerpt": "Rep. Summer Lee's criticism of Israel's response to the Oct. 7 attacks initially set her apart. But the Israel-Gaza war has shifted U.S. public opinion.",
            "summary": "PITTSBURGH — Rep. Summer Lee, a freshman Democrat who faces a primary challenge Tuesday from an opponent who has characterized her as extreme on foreign policy, was one of the first members of Congress to criticize Israel's military response to the Oct. 7 attacks in which Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages.\nLee, a member of the 'Squad' of lefty Democrats, called for a cease-fire a little over a week after the attack and suggested Israel was guilty of 'blatant human rights violations.'\nThat reaction initially set Lee apart from many in her party. But as Israel has continued its retaliatory assault on Hamas-run Gaza, U.S. public opinion has shifted. Approval of Israel's military actions among Democrats nationwide dropped from 36 percent in November to 18 percent in March, according to a recent Gallup poll.\nAdvertisement\nSome in this community, which is home to the Tree of Life synagogue, the site of the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history, have come around to their congresswoman's position.\nLee made 'some missteps with the Jewish community' in the early days after Oct. 7, making statements that some people here viewed as sympathetic only to Palestinians, Annie Weidman said as she shopped for Passover groceries this weekend.\nIn the months that followed, Lee 'calmed down her rhetoric,' said Weidman, 63. 'And I do understand her position of being very much for the Palestinian people because it's really, really awful, and I totally get it.'\n'Everybody has sort of moved to her position rather than the other way around,' Weidman, who voted early for Lee, added later.\nSince October, some 34,000 Palestinians, including 13,000 children, have been killed in Gaza, according to local health authorities. And although the House of Representatives approved a new tranche of aid for Israel on Saturday over the objections of 58 members, including Lee, top Democratic leaders, including President Biden and Sen. Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), have sharpened their criticism of the Israeli government in recent weeks.\nAdvertisement\n'What we're seeing slowly but surely is not voters catching up to the Squad — it is other Democratic politicians catching up to where voters have been for months,' said Usamah Andrabi, the communications director for Justice Democrats, which works to elect liberals to Congress and has supported Lee's reelection campaign.\nBoth Lee and her opponent, Edgewood Borough council member Bhavini Patel, dispute the idea that Tuesday's election is primarily about the war. But voters here volunteer their thoughts on the topic without prompting. In Squirrel Hill, home to Patel's campaign office, lawn signs bearing her name appear frequently next to ones reading 'we stand with Israel.'\nPatel has continued to criticize Lee's position on the conflict.\n'She's clearly picked a side in this situation and completely disregards her entire district,' Patel said in an interview Saturday. 'I think it's important that any call for a cease-fire should acknowledge that hostages are still being held,' she added.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Lee first ran for this seat two years ago, pro-Israel outside groups, including Democratic Majority for Israel and a PAC associated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) spent heavily in an attempt to defeat her, holding her to a 1,000-vote victory in the primary.\nBut neither the AIPAC-affiliated group nor Democratic Majority for Israel have intervened in this year's primary, according to the most recent federal campaign finance filing data. Asked about the race, an AIPAC representative said the group is 'already involved in several races, and we will be engaged in additional campaigns where we can have the greatest impact.' A representative for DMFI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nInstead, the Moderate PAC, a group backed by Republican megadonor Jeffrey Yass, has intervened in the race, airing television ads attacking Lee for 'opposing Biden' as images of pro-abortion-rights protests and the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection played on-screen.\nAdvertisement\nPatel has denounced Yass and said that she considers herself 'a principled progressive Democrat,' but Lee and her allies have worked to make the billionaire's involvement in the race a liability for Patel. At a Sunday rally with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), supporters of Lee waved black-and-yellow signs reading 'Move, Yass! Get out of the way' and 'Stop Republican billionaires.'\nOcasio-Cortez characterized the Moderate PAC's involvement as 'an attempt to purchase and buy the seat back.' Attendees booed as she mentioned Yass and AIPAC. She stressed the importance of showing the world and 'the people in that big White House' that Lee 'is not alone,' and reminded voters that Tuesday's primary is the first of several challenges to members of the Squad, including Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri.\nVoters here frequently bring up their faith when describing their vote, and religious leaders have expressed strong opinions about the candidates. Last fall, 40 Pittsburgh rabbis and cantors wrote an open letter denouncing Lee for being one of only nine Democrats to vote against a resolution avowing support for Israel and condemning Hamas. In a follow-up letter in March, many of the same rabbis and cantors accused her of using 'divisive language, which, at times, we have perceived as openly antisemitic.'\nAdvertisement\nIn Squirrel Hill, home to a politically active and sizable Jewish community, the 14th Ward Independent Democratic Club, a local group that's not formally affiliated with the party, endorsed Patel this year after backing Lee two years ago.\n'Some people are not interested in combating antisemitism, and they're not interested in hearing and talking with and representing the Jewish community in the same way they necessarily are other communities,' said Jeremy Kazzaz, a member of the club's board and the president of the Beacon Coalition, a recently launched organization that aims to provide 'voter education on issues of concern to the Jewish American community' and that has endorsed Patel.\nBut the city's religious communities are far from united behind either candidate.\n'This has been a very, very painful couple of years for the Pittsburgh Jewish community,' said Jared Magnani, 55. He is supporting Lee, noting he was 'proud of her for the rapidity of her response calling for a cease-fire' because 'just because we're American Jews, it doesn't mean that Israel merits an exemption from allegations of significant human rights abuses and crimes against humanity.'\nWeidman's husband, Larry, 71, said he seriously considered supporting Patel before deciding to vote for Lee. 'But it was never because of comments that Summer Lee made right after Oct. 7,' he said. 'Some of the comments that she made, they're not so out of the mainstream now.'",

            "excerpt": "Chicago is one of several big American cities grappling with a surge of migrants",
            "summary": "CHICAGO — The closure of Wadsworth Elementary School in 2013 was a blow to residents of the majority-Black neighborhood it served, symbolizing a city indifferent to their interests.\nSo when the city reopened Wadsworth last year to shelter hundreds of migrants, without seeking community input, it added insult to injury. Across Chicago, Black residents are frustrated that long-standing needs are not being met while the city's newly arrived are cared for with a sense of urgency, and with their tax dollars.\n'Our voices are not valued nor heard,' says Genesis Young, a lifelong Chicagoan who lives near Wadsworth.\nChicago is one of several big American cities grappling with a surge of migrants. The Republican governor of Texas has been sending them by the busload to highlight his grievances with the Biden administration's immigration policy.\nAdvertisement\nTo manage the influx, Chicago has already spent more than $300 million of city, state and federal funds to provide housing, health care, education and more to over 38,000 mostly South American migrants desperate for help. The speed with which these funds were marshaled has stirred widespread resentment among Black Chicagoans. But community leaders are trying to ease racial tensions and channel the public's frustrations into agitating for the greater good.\nThe outcry over migrants in Chicago and other large Democrat-led cities is having wider implications in an election year: The Biden administration is now advocating a more restrictive approach to immigration in its negotiations with Republicans in Congress.\nSince the Wadsworth building reopened as a shelter, Young has felt 'extreme anxiety' because of the noise, loitering and around-the-clock police presence that came with it. More than anything, she and other neighbors say it is a reminder of problems that have been left unsolved for years, including high rates of crime, unemployment and homelessness.\nAdvertisement\n'I definitely don't want to seem insensitive to them and them wanting a better life. However, if you can all of a sudden come up with all these millions of dollars to address their housing, why didn't you address the homeless issue here,' said Charlotte Jackson, the owner of a bakery and restaurant in the South Loop neighborhood.\n'For so long we accepted that this is how things had to be in our communities,' said Chris Jackson, who co-founded the bakery with his wife. 'This migrant crisis has made many people go: ‘Wait a minute, no it doesn't.''\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson declined to comment for this story.\nThe city received more than $200 million from the state and federal government to help care for migrants after Johnson appealed to Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and President Joe Biden. The president will be in Chicago in August to make his reelection pitch at the 2024 Democratic National Convention.\nAdvertisement\nSome Black Chicagoans are protesting the placement of shelters in their neighborhoods, but others aim to turn the adversity into an opportunity.\n'Chicago is a microcosm to the rest of the nation,' said the Rev. Janette C. Wilson, national executive director of the civil rights group PUSH for Excellence. Black communities have faced discrimination and underinvestment for decades and are justifiably frustrated, Wilson said. The attention the migrants are receiving is deserved, she added, but it's also a chance for cities to reflect on their responsibility to all underserved communities.\n'There is a moral imperative to take care of everybody,' Wilson said.\nAfter nearly two years of acrimony, the city has begun to curb some accommodations for migrants – which has caused its own backlash. The city last month started evicting migrants who overstayed a 60-day limit at shelters, prompting condemnation from immigrant rights groups and from residents worried about public safety.\nAdvertisement\nMarlita Ingram, a school guidance counselor who lives in the South Shore neighborhood, said she is concerned about the resources being shared 'equitably' between migrants and longtime residents. But she also believes 'it doesn't have to be a competition' and sympathizes with the nearly 6,000 migrant children now enrolled in Chicago's public schools.\nAs the potential for racial strife rises, some activists are pointing to history as a cautionary tale.\nHundreds of thousands of Black southerners moved to Chicago in the early 20th century in search of greater freedoms and economic opportunities. White Chicagoans at the time accused them of receiving disproportionate resources from the city, and in 1919 tensions boiled over.\nIn a surge of racist attacks in cities across the U.S. that came to be known as 'Red Summer,' white residents burned large swaths of Chicago's Black neighborhoods and killed 38 Black people, including by lynching.\nAdvertisement\n'Those white folks were, like, ‘Hell no, they're coming here, they're taking our jobs,''' said Richard Wallace, founder of Equity and Transformation, a majority-Black community group that co-hosted in a forum in March to improve dialogue between Black and Latino residents.\nHe hears echoes of that past bigotry — intentional or not — when Black Chicagoans complain about the help being given to migrants. 'How did we become like the white folks who were resisting our people coming to the city of the Chicago?' he said.\nLabor and immigrant rights organizers have worked for years to tamp down divisions between working class communities. But the migrant crisis has created tensions between the city's large Mexican American community and recently arrived migrants, many of whom hail from Venezuela.\n'If left unchecked, we all panic, we're all scared, we're going to retreat to our corners,' said Leone Jose Bicchieri, executive director of Working Family Solidarity, a majority-Hispanic labor rights group. 'The truth is that this city wouldn't work without Black and Latino people.'\nAdvertisement\nBlack Americans' views on immigration and diversity are expansive. The Civil Rights Movement was instrumental in pushing the U.S. to adopt a more inclusive immigration policy.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAbout half of Black Americans say the United States' diverse population makes the country strong, including 30% who say it makes the U.S. 'much stronger,' according to a March poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\nMany leaders in Black neighborhoods in and around Chicago are trying to strike a balance between acknowledging the tensions without exacerbating them.\n'Our church is divided on the migrant crisis,' said the Rev. Chauncey Brown, pastor of Second Baptist Church in Maywood, Illinois, a majority-Black suburb of Chicago where some migrants are living in shelters.\nThere has been a noticeable uptick of non-English speakers in the pews, many of whom have said they are migrants in need of food and other services, Brown said. Some church members cautioned him against speaking out in support of migrants or allotting more church resources to them. But he said the Bible's teachings are clear on this issue.\nAdvertisement\n'When a stranger enters your land, you are to care for them as if they are one of your own,' he said.\n____\nMatt Brown is a member of the AP's Race and Ethnicity team.

            "summary": "NEW DELHI — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government are increasingly wielding strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents and critics of the ruling Hindu-nationalist party.\nA decade into power, and on the cusp of securing five more years, the Modi government is reversing India's decadeslong commitment to multiparty democracy and secularism.\nThe ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has brought corruption charges against many officials from its main rival, the Congress Party, but few convictions. Dozens of politicians from other opposition parties are under investigation or in jail. And just last month, Modi's government froze the Congress party's bank accounts for what it said was non-payment of taxes.\nThe Modi administration says the country's investigating agencies are independent and that its democratic institutions are robust, pointing to high voter turnout in recent elections that have delivered Modi's party a clear mandate.\nAdvertisement\nYet civil liberties are under attack. Peaceful protests have been crushed with force. A once free and diverse press is threatened. Violence is on the rise against the Muslim minority. And the country's judiciary increasingly aligns with the executive branch.\nTo better understand how Modi is reshaping India and what is at stake in an election that begins April 19 and runs through June 1, the AP spoke with a lawyer, a journalist, and an opposition politician.\nHere are their stories:\nDEFENDING MODI'S CRITICS\nMihir Desai has fought for the civil liberties and human rights of India's most disadvantaged communities, such as the poor and Muslims, for nearly four decades.\nThe 65-year-old lawyer from India's financial capital Mumbai is now working on one of his – and the country's – most high-profile cases: defending a dozen political activists, journalists and lawyers jailed in 2018 on accusations of plotting to overthrow the Modi government. The accusations, he says, are baseless – just one of the government's all-too-frequent and audacious efforts to silence critics.\nAdvertisement\nOne of the defendants in the case, a Jesuit priest and longtime civil rights activist, died at age 84 after about nine months in custody. The other defendants remain in jail, charged under anti-terror laws that rarely result in convictions.\n'First authorities came up with a theory that they planned to kill Modi. Now they are being accused of being terrorist sympathizers,' he said.\nThe point of it all, Desai believes, is to send a message to any would-be critics.\nAccording to digital forensics experts at U.S.-based Arsenal Consulting, the Indian government hacked into the computers of some of the accused and planted files that were later used as evidence against them.\nTo Desai, this is proof that the Modi government has 'weaponized' the country's once-independent investigative agencies.\nHe sees threats to Indian democracy all around him. Last year, the government removed the country's chief justice as one of three people who appoint commissioners overseeing elections; Modi and the opposition leader in parliament are the others. Now, one of Modi's cabinet ministers has a vote in the process, giving the ruling party a 2-1 majority.\nAdvertisement\n'It's a death knell to free and fair elections,' Desai said.\nA POLITICIAN'S PLIGHT IN KASHMIR\nWaheed-Ur-Rehman Para, 35, was long seen as an ally in the Indian government's interests in Kashmir. He worked with young people in the majority-Muslim, semi-autonomous region and preached to them about the benefits of embracing India and its democratic institutions – versus seeking independence, or a merger with Pakistan.\nBeginning in 2018, though, Para was viewed with suspicion by the Modi government for alleged connections to anti-India separatists. Since then, he has been jailed twice: in 2019 on suspicion that he and other political opponents could stoke unrest; and in 2020 on charges of supporting militant groups -- charges he denies.\nThe accusations stunned Para, whose People's Democratic Party once ruled Kashmir in an alliance with Modi's party.\nAdvertisement\nBut he believes the motivation was clear: 'I was arrested to forcibly endorse the government's 2019 decision,' he said, referring to a clampdown on the resistance in Kashmir after the elimination of the region's semi-autonomous status.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nModi's administration argues the move was necessary to fully integrate the disputed region with India and foster economic development there.\nAfter his 2020 arrest, Para remained in jail for nearly two years, often in solitary confinement, and was subjected to 'abusive interrogations,'' according to U.N. experts.\n'My crime was that I wanted the integration of Kashmir, not through the barrel of the gun,' said Para, who is seeking to represent Kashmir's main city in the upcoming election.\nPara sees his own plight within the larger context of the Modi government's effort to silence perceived opponents, especially those with ties to Muslims, who make up 14% of India's population.\nAdvertisement\n'It is a huge ethical question … that the largest democracy in the world is not able to assimilate, or offer dignity to, the smallest pocket of its people,' he said.\nThe campaign to turn once-secular India into a Hindu republic may help Modi win elections in the short term, Para said, but something much bigger will be lost.\n'It risks the whole idea of this country's diversity,' he said.\nA JOURNALIST FIGHTS CHARGES\nIn October 2020, independent journalist Sidheeq Kappan was arrested while trying to report on a government clampdown in the northern Uttar Pradesh state ruled by Modi's party.\nFor days, authorities had been struggling to contain protests and outcry over a gruesome rape case. Those accused of the crime were four upper caste Hindu men, while the victim belonged to the Dalit community, the lowest rung of India's caste hierarchy.\nAdvertisement\nKappan, a 44-year-old Muslim, was detained and jailed before he even reached the crime site, accused of intending to incite violence. After two years in jail, his case reached India's top court in 2022. While he was quickly granted bail, the case against him is ongoing.\nKappan's case is not unique, and he says it highlights how India is becoming increasingly unsafe for journalists. Under intense pressure from the state, many Indian news organizations have become more pliant and supportive of government policies,\n'Those who have tried to be independent have come under relentless attack by the government,' he said.\nForeign journalists are banned from reporting in Kashmir, for example. Same goes for India's northeast Manipur state, which has been embroiled in ethnic violence for almost a year.\nTelevision news is increasingly dominated by stations touting the government's Hindu nationalist agenda, such as a new citizenship law that excludes Muslim migrants. Independent TV stations have been temporarily shut down, and newspapers that run articles critical of Modi's agenda find that any advertising from the government – an important source of revenue – quickly dries up.\nAdvertisement\nLast year, the India offices of the BBC were raided on tax irregularities just days after it aired a documentary critical of Modi.\nThe advocacy group Reporters Without Borders ranks India 161st on a worldwide list of countries' press freedoms.\nKappan said he has barely been able to report news since his arrest. The trial keeps him busy, requiring him to travel to a court hundreds of miles away every other week. The time and money required for his trial have made it difficult for him to support his wife and three children, Kappan said.\n'It is affecting their education, their mental health,' he said.\n___",

            "excerpt": "After the arrests of more than 100 pro-Palestinian protesters on campus, students on both sides of the debate remain uneasy.",
            "summary": "NEW YORK — Tali Kobrin, a Barnard College student, was deeply uneasy Thursday as she listened to pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia yelling, 'We don't want no Zionists here!'\na Barnard College student, was deeply uneasy Thursday as she listened to pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia yelling, 'We don't want no Zionists here!' 'That means you don't want me, as a Jew, on campus,' said Kobrin, a freshman. 'That was really hard to hear.'\nWhile she thought some people might think of anti-Zionism as opposition to Israeli policies, the chants 'sounded meaner than that,' she said. She left for her parents' home in the Bronx shortly before a wave of NYPD officers swept through campus, arresting more than 100 people who refused to leave a pro-Palestinian protest encampment — a rare move by the university to call in external forces to quell a demonstration.\nSoph Askanase, 21, said she was one of the first students arrested and is now suspended. The Barnard junior, who has asthma and did not have her inhaler, tried to keep calm by using breathing techniques. 'I don't know if they'll let me finish my semester,' she said Friday afternoon while picking up a backpack and a tote bag that had been seized, with red marks still on her wrists from police cuffs.\nAdvertisement\nThis week at Columbia and Barnard — the affiliated school with its own administration across the street — has been a frightening climax to a tense and uneasy year for many students. After six months of searing protests over the Israel-Gaza war, events at the end of the school year rapidly escalated fears and pressure, drawing sharp dividing lines on campuses that seek to be welcoming communities.\nSome pro-Palestinian students saw the administration as increasingly punitive amid scrutiny from federal lawmakers and described a broad chilling effect brought about by doxing, arrests and suspensions. Many students said they spoke candidly only during adhan, the five-times-a-day Muslim call to prayer.\nSome Jewish students said the rhetoric at protests has become more extreme, describing demonstrators ordering them away from an encampment and, in one case, brandishing a Hamas logo at them. Several were also upset that despite the police intervention, hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters remained at the center of campus Friday, where they had slept overnight with sleeping bags, improvised mattresses and picnic blankets.\nAdvertisement\nSome faculty, too, were angered by the arrests and what they saw as an attack on freedom of speech. They also bristled at hostile questions from the House Committee on Education and the Workforce to Columbia officials Wednesday amid a broader investigation into antisemitism at multiple universities.\n'It's the most appalling thing I've ever seen,' said Nadia Abu El-Haj, an anthropology professor who was on the school's lawn when the police entered. 'The students were extraordinary. Chanting. Crying. It felt like a total violation of everything an academic institution is supposed to be.' She said the arrests were political theater aimed at appeasing Congress without concern that students were collateral damage.\n'Palestine was always going to be the issue that broke this university,' said Ry Spada, 24, a history major who is Jewish and was part of the pro-Palestinian protest Thursday night. 'This year and this topic.'\nAdvertisement\nJames Applegate, an astronomy professor who is part of the executive committee of the Columbia University Senate, said he is more concerned about what happened on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, the ongoing loss of academic freedom and the culture on campus than he is about police making peaceful arrests of student protesters.\nAt Columbia, issues such as conflict in the Middle East used to be handled well, he said. 'We used to deal with these extremely emotional, very, very hard, contentious issues with peaceful protest, reasoned debate and outside speakers. … Unfortunately, American universities — Columbia is not the only one — have lost the ability to respectfully disagree.'\nThe unrest at Columbia is emblematic of growing tensions nationwide as thousands of students at colleges — public and private, large and small, — are protesting the Israel-Gaza war in ways that are upending campus life.\nAdvertisement\nOn several campuses, students have occupied large lawns or student facilities, launched hunger strikes or interrupted school events. Already on Friday morning, some students, including at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, had set up tents and protests in solidarity with their pro-Palestinian peers at Columbia.\nMany of the demonstrators, organized by pro-Palestinian groups, call for their institutions to divest from certain businesses that support or operate in Israel. They demand their administrations to sever academic programs with Israeli institutions. Some chant for their schools to stop funding genocide, and some wear kaffiyehs, face masks and glasses to make it harder for them to be identified. Some have been arrested or suspended as academic leaders try to strike a balance of support for protest and free speech with safety concerns.\n'This is a challenging moment and these are steps that I deeply regret having to take,' Columbia's president, Minouche Shafik, wrote in a letter to students Thursday. Protesters were given multiple warnings before police intervened.\nAdvertisement\nOther presidents have issued similar statements, noting that they support the right to protest generally but not when it rises to harassment or impedes on others' rights. Some universities have responded to the demonstrations by rewriting policies outlining punishments for disruptive behavior.\nIn California, the University of Southern California canceled the graduation speech of a pro-Palestinian valedictorian, citing fears of threats. At Pomona College, police arrested 19 people who had occupied the office of the school's president — at least seven were temporarily suspended before a large majority of faculty demanded the charges be dropped.\n'This is part of an escalating series of incidents on our campus,' Pomona President G. Gabrielle Starr wrote to students early this month.\nYale students began a hunger strike last week, calling for the university to divest from weapons manufacturing companies involved in the Israel-Gaza war. The university declined. 'We know Yale is agitated,' the group of students wrote in an Instagram post Thursday. 'We know the tides are turning on the timescale of the long struggle for justice.'\nAt the University of Michigan, the American Civil Liberties Union is calling for a reconsideration of a draft policy that would bring harsher punishments for students participating in 'disruptive demonstrations.' The organization argues that it would violate students' First Amendment rights. 'If adopted in its current form,' the ACLU of Michigan wrote to university officials, 'the policy risks chilling a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech and expression on campus.'\nAt Columbia on Friday, there was a visible police presence near campus, with dozens of NYPD officers in riot gear outside the university gates, which are closed to people without a school ID. People gathered outside holding Palestinian flags and signs and handed food through the gates to students inside, where protesters were chanting, 'Long live the intifada' and an expletive aimed at the 'settler Zionist state.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAdvertisement\nColumbia announced that personal belongings that were swept up when the protest encampment was shut down Thursday could be collected Friday, with a table jammed with backpacks, charging cords and phones.\nA petition reiterating protesters' demands and calling for amnesty for protesters garnered nearly 10,000 online signatures.\n'While the encampment has been dismantled, our community has had protest activity on campus since October, and we expect that activity to continue,' a Columbia spokesperson said. The university will continue to enforce rules about the time, place and manner of protests, remains in regular contact with student groups, and is committed to ensuring the core functions of the university continue, she said.",

            "summary": "We're less than a week away from the opening night of the NFL draft, and it's still anyone's guess how the first five picks will unfold. Four quarterbacks are almost certain to make up picks 1-4, but good luck finding NFL executives who agree in what order those four will go — or who even want to venture an educated guess about it.\n'Never seen anything like it,' said a high-ranking official with one team that will be selecting a quarterback in the first round. 'If anybody tells you they know how this is going to play out, they are full of s---.'\nAfter Caleb Williams goes to the Chicago Bears with the first pick, it seems anything is on the table. Usually by now, there is at least some consensus within NFL front offices about the first 10 picks; this year, not so much. The teams making said picks have done a great job of keeping their intentions quiet. In some order, LSU's Jayden Daniels, Michigan's J.J. McCarthy and North Carolina's Drake Maye will come off the board next, with at least one via trade. (Of the half-dozen decision-makers I spoke with in recent days, all believe the Arizona Cardinals are trading out of the fourth spot.)\nAdvertisement\n'Drake Maye is the biggest wild card in all of this,' said the general manager of a team that has done significant work on quarterbacks. 'Some guys love him and think he could end up the best QB in this class, and some legitimately think he's a mid-round pick.'\nTwo general managers told me that they believe if the Washington Commanders let the analytics guide them, McCarthy is their guess for the No. 2 pick. If the team's coaches hold significant sway and offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury's voice resonates, then Daniels would be the selection. Both general managers also believe Daniels would love to be a Raider.\nMeanwhile, the closer we get to the draft, the more people I speak to expect the New England Patriots to keep the third overall pick and use it on a passer — and McCarthy is held in very high regard in New England, from what I gather.\nAdvertisement\nIt remains to be seen which team moves up into Arizona's slot to land the fourth quarterback; the New York Giants, Minnesota Vikings and Las Vegas Raiders, rival executives believe, are the teams most motivated to do so. Executives have also suggested that the quarterback-needy Denver Broncos are exploring options to trade down from the No. 12 pick; whether that's in hopes that Oregon's Bo Nix is available later in the draft, or because the Broncos could be punting on passers entirely is open to interpretation. (I have a pet theory about Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders ending up a Bronco at the top of the 2025 draft.) The proximity of the Giants' selection (sixth overall) to Arizona's fourth pick has many giving New York the edge in completing that trade.\n'They aren't playing with Daniel Jones, I can tell you that much,' a second GM said of the Giants' incumbent. 'I hear it's McCarthy or Maye' for New York.\nNo matter the order, I'm convinced that quarterbacks and offensive linemen will dominate the first round, and particularly the first half of it.\nAdvertisement\n'When you do your mock draft, I'd put six [quarterbacks] in the first 16 [picks],' the first executive said. 'They are going to fly off the board, and the offensive linemen, too.'\nIf the Vikings don't move up, after already executing one trade, and are stuck at 11, then some figure they will take either Nix or Washington's Michael Penix Jr. with that pick. The first general manager agreed with that assessment.\n'They have to get a quarterback, and they can't get too cute about it,' he said of the Vikings.\nI reported weeks ago that the Raiders were as intent as any team to land a franchise quarterback in this draft, and that hasn't changed.\nKeep on eye on veteran receivers\nThe trade chatter surrounding disgruntled wide receivers was always going to intensify once offseason programs begin, and now it has. (I would also add Baltimore's Rashod Bateman to the list of recent first-round pass catchers who could be dealt by the end of the draft.) And the team that rival execs think might be most motivated of all to land Brandon Aiyuk, Courtland Sutton or one of their peers is a team that has already had an unusually active offseason.\nAdvertisement\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers revamped their quarterback room and been more active in free agency than in the past, and it wouldn't be a surprise to see them land another pass catcher, within reason, allowing them to focus on this deep offensive line class in the first round. Meanwhile, teams being linked most to first-round receivers, according to the personnel executives I spoke with, include the Cardinals, Bears, Indianapolis Colts, Buffalo Bills, San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs.\nAfter trading Stefon Diggs, it's considered a fait accompli that Buffalo will select one, with Texas wide receiver Adonai Mitchell the name I hear most often connected to the Bills. Indianapolis has done a ton of work on receivers, even after extending Michael Pittman Jr. It would be fairly shocking if a half-dozen or so receivers did not go in the first round.\nSome other names to remember\nWhile the top quarterbacks' destinations remain in doubt, there are some players who are being connected by personnel officials to specific teams with growing regularity as the draft approaches.\nAdvertisement\nMany mock drafts have the Los Angeles Chargers taking the first receiver in this draft with the fifth pick, but personnel people I spoke with anticipate them selecting Notre Dame offensive tackle Joe Alt if they keep the selection. Chargers Coach Jim Harbaugh is calling the shots, and he believes in building teams from the inside out. His handpicked general manager, Joe Hortiz, had a strong affinity for Notre Dame products while running the Baltimore Ravens' college scouting department and did pretty well drafting left tackle Ronnie Stanley and safety Kyle Hamilton from that program.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'That's Harbaugh's guy,' the first exec said of Alt.\nIf the Cardinals were to swap picks with the Giants and trade down to sixth, the name I've heard most often connected to them in that spot is Ohio State wideout Marvin Harrison Jr., which could trigger a run on pass catchers. The Titans (who own the No. 7 pick) are deeply invested in the receiver and offensive line classes, and if Alt and Harrison are already gone, they could draft a wide receiver as well: either Rome Odunze of Washington or Malik Nabers of LSU.\nAdvertisement\nThe Atlanta Falcons are expected to have their pick of any defensive player at eighth overall, and while some think they would lean into the strength of cornerbacks in this draft, both general managers I spoke with said they would project Alabama pass rusher Dallas Turner to the Falcons, who have been seeking a difference-making edge rusher for a long time. The Bears also hold the ninth pick and 'they grab whichever of the [top three] receivers is still there,' the second general manager predicted.\nThe New York Jets, with quarterback/de facto GM Aaron Rodgers wielding considerable influence, are fairly infatuated with hulking Georgia tight end Brock Bowers, and if he's available with the 10th selection then that's a match. Tight end is an obvious position of need for the Jets, they could use another target with size and they are under intense pressure to win now.",

            "summary": "NEW HOPE, Pa. — Mark Houck makes a potent appeal to conservative Republicans in this corner of eastern Pennsylvania when he describes his arrest and subsequent acquittal on federal charges that he pushed a Planned Parenthood volunteer outside a Philadelphia abortion clinic.\nThe account has become a staple of Houck's first-time bid for the U.S. House in suburban Philadelphia, a central battleground of the 2024 election, from the presidency on down.\n'I'm telling you this because this is how I became a target of the federal government — the weaponization of the government,' he said at a meeting last week of the New Hope Solebury Republican Club.\nHouck's campaign to unseat fourth-term Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick in Tuesday's primary could offer hints about swing-district Republican sentiment in one of the most volatile White House races in years.\nAdvertisement\nWith few truly competitive House seats in play, the 1st Congressional District that Fitzpatrick represents is one of 16 districts nationwide that Democrat Joe Biden carried in the 2020 presidential election where voters also sent Republicans to Washington. By comparison, five seats won that year by Donald Trump, then the incumbent and now his party's presumptive 2024 nominee, are now held occupied by a Democrat.\nThe Republicans' House majority is so slim that Democrats need to flip just four seats in November to retake control. That makes the 'Biden 16' a significant group of competitive seats and they could go a long way in determining whether the next president has a friendly or hostile House next year.\nFifteen of those seats are in states that Biden won in 2020. The exception is Nebraska's 2nd District, represented by GOP Rep. Don Bacon. There are five seats in California, four in New York, two in Arizona and one apiece in New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia.\nAdvertisement\nSeveral of the 'Biden 16' are like Fitzgerald, winning year after year by tightrope-walking between challengers in primaries and general elections. Nine of them won a first term in in 2022, when Republicans took control of the House for the first time in four years.\nIn the fall, many will face the same Democrat they beat last time, sometimes narrowly.\nThe Fitzpatrick-Houck winner will face Democrat Ashley Ehasz, a former Army helicopter pilot who is uncontested in her primary. Fitzpatrick, a former FBI supervisory agent who beat Ehasz by 10 percentage points in 2022, is outraising Houck and Ehasz by millions of dollars, combined.\nBefore November, several others among the 'Biden 16' must beat back primary challenges from the conservative wing of the GOP.\nIn Nebraska, Bacon is facing perhaps his strongest primary test yet. If he wins, he will take on the same Democratic opponent, state Sen. Tony Vargas, whom he defeated two years ago by fewer than 3 percentage points.\nAdvertisement\nBacon has been a vocal supporter of sending more military aid to Ukraine, something opposed by his primary opponent, second-time congressional candidate Dan Frei.\nFrei, who contends the GOP base is fed up with Bacon, accuses the incumbent of flouting campaign promises by voting to increase spending and for bills that do nothing to stem the flow of immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.\nNearly all of the 16 races are considered toss-ups.\nRepublicans intend to hammer home a message about lax border security and high inflation under Biden. Democrats are warning that Republicans will pursue a national abortion ban as Democrats invoke an issue that has consistently worked in their favor at the ballot box since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022.\nAdvertisement\nNorth Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson, chair of the House Republicans' campaign arm, said the 'Biden 16' have formed strong identities in their districts and are emphasizing local issues.\nHudson said Biden's unpopularity and presidential turnout models are increasingly giving an edge to Republicans, with the GOP attracting more working-class voters who more likely to vote in presidential elections and help flip these districts to Trump.\n'The presidential turnout dynamics actually favor Republicans,' Hudson said in an interview. 'And then if you look, state by state, where our battlegrounds are, the presidential turnout is going to help us.'\nWashington Rep. Suzan DelBene, who leads the House Democrats' campaign arm, said Democrats will highlight what they say is the chaos at the highest levels of government when Republicans are charge of the House and Trump is in the White House. They will say Trump is a threat to democracy and Republicans are extremists and hypocrites who voted against major spending bills under Biden and then tried to take credit for the projects that landed in their districts.\nAdvertisement\nVoters 'want folks who are there to govern,' DelBene said in an interview. 'They're not looking for extremism. And so all we have to do is make sure that voters are aware of what they're doing. ... Holding them accountable for their actual votes, even though their rhetoric sometimes tries to be more moderate.'\nIn Pennsylvania, Houck's bid to unseat Fitzpatrick, who is backed by some labor unions and business groups, has a visceral feel that some Republicans say resonates with them.\nAt the Solebury Republicans' meeting on the grounds of a luxury hotel and wedding venue, Houck unwound the story of his arrest, describing federal agents with guns drawn as they descended on his Bucks County home in 2022.\nThey arrested him, in connection with the incident outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Philadelphia. Houck defended his actions, saying he acted to protect his 12-year-old son from abusive comments made by the clinic volunteer. The trial ended in an acquittal in 2023, and Houck, who runs a Catholic ministry group, said he began fielding requests to run for office.\nAdvertisement\nHouck's story struck a chord with Rose Cipriano, who came to hear him speak. Her husband picked up a Houck yard sign and Cipriano, who had previously supported Fitzpatrick, said Houck has changed her mind in the approaching primary.\n'I'm looking for fresh ideas, and I'm willing to take a chance and vote for him on Tuesday,' Cipriano said 'I've known his story since it happened, and I support him.'\nHouck's campaign echoes Trump's own defense against the criminal cases against him. It centers on the slogan 'Faith Family Freedom' while Houck talks about defunding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the federal departments of Agriculture, Education and Justice, calling them all unconstitutional.\nHouck has raised more campaign cash than any previous Fitzpatrick primary challenger. But he is well behind Fitzpatrick's fundraising and name recognition in a county where his brother previously held the congressional seat.\nAdvertisement\nFitzpatrick has the support of the county party and the backing of police and fire unions, whose large campaign signs endorsing him crop up every two years.\nBob Brooks, president of the Pennsylvania Professional Firefighters Association, said Fitzpatrick represents blue-collar workers like his union members.\n'And, if there was more blue-collar legislators, I think they would find more support from firefighters,' Brooks said in an interview. 'We support those who support us, and Brian has supported us on many levels.'\nRepublicans at the Solebury meeting encouraged Houck to stay involved in party politics.\nHouck said he will back Fitzpatrick in the general election if Fitzpatrick wins the primary but won't campaign for him, put off by what he said was Fitzpatrick failure to check on Houck's family after his arrest. Fitzpatrick didn't respond to interview requests.\nCipriano said she is disappointed in Fitzpatrick but said the stakes are too high for the party to be divided in November. She pledged to support Fitzpatrick should he win the primary.\n'I am behind the Republican Party 100%,' she said. 'So whoever's running, from the top down, gets my support.'\n___",

            "excerpt": "Larry Hogan has transformed Maryland's sleepy Senate race into a top-tier contest in the fight for the Senate majority",
            "summary": "STEVENSVILLE, Md. — Andy DePaola welcomed Larry Hogan to his family's restaurant with a big smile and a handshake. The warning came a few minutes later.\nDePaola, the 64-year-old namesake of DePaola's Bagel and Brunch here in Maryland's conservative Eastern Shore, whispered to a reporter that Hogan better avoid disparaging former President Donald Trump.\n'I'm a Trumper,' DePaola said as Hogan posed for pictures and made small talk with the excited breakfast crowd on a recent Friday morning. 'I think Larry would be better off if he kept how he felt about Trump under his breath.'\nThe brief exchange during a weeks-long bus tour illustrates a stark political reality for the popular Republican former governor, who has single-handedly transformed Maryland's sleepy Senate race into a top-tier contest in the national fight for the Senate majority. Hogan, who was perhaps the most outspoken anti-Trump Republican governor in the nation, can ill afford to lose any pieces of his delicate and diverse political coalition.\nAdvertisement\nHe's hoping to become the first Republican in more than 40 years to win a Senate seat in this deep-blue state, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1 statewide, with much of the Democratic support in Baltimore and the suburbs of Washington. Over the next six months, Hogan will have to fend off political threats from all sides.\nAs Trump loyalists eye the 67-year-old businessman with skepticism, Democrats are counting on abortion rights to make Hogan's historic challenge even harder. But the R after his name may ultimately prove the most serious liability for Hogan in a state Trump lost by 33 points four years ago.\nIf Hogan wins Maryland's open Senate seat, Republicans would almost certainly claim the majority in the U.S. Senate — and with it, the power to control the agenda and judicial nominations for the next two years, at least.\nAdvertisement\nIn an interview, Hogan confirmed that he would caucus with Republicans in Washington, despite his concerns about Trump's grip on the party. He also vowed not to leave the GOP after the election, even if Trump returns to the White House.\n'I'm a real Republican,' Hogan told The Associated Press, noting that he does not identify with Trump's 'Make America Great Again' movement.\nWhen pressed to explain his concerns about MAGA, and whether he views Trump as a threat to U.S. democracy, Hogan parsed his words carefully.\n'I think certainly there has been some threats,' Hogan said. 'But you know, I think that's not what this campaign is really all about.'\nMeanwhile, Hogan's opponents on the left are only just beginning to organize as Democrats wade through their own nomination process. While Hogan faces token opposition in the GOP, Democrats will pick Hogan's general election opponent next month.\nAdvertisement\nOn Tuesday, a coalition of labor, immigration and progressive groups gathered in the state capital to criticize the former governor for using his veto powers to block legislation to increase abortion access while undermining other Democratic priorities, including health care, environmental protection and education funding.\nThe anti-Hogan event was a reminder that voters in his gubernatorial elections may have been more willing to overlook party affiliation than they will be in a Senate contest that could tilt the balance of power in Washington toward Republicans.\n'Despite him claiming to be a moderate, we know his actions show that he's a staunch Republican,' said 1199 SEIU political director Ricarra Jones, who slammed Hogan's veto of legislation to increase the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour.\nAdvertisement\n'The Senate race in November is bigger than just Maryland,' she continued. 'A Republican-dominated Senate would pursue a drastically different agenda, one that could unwind years of progressive achievements and reshape Maryland's policy landscape in ways that could take generations to reverse.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nMeanwhile, Hogan is trying to avoid divisive political disputes as he reintroduces himself to Maryland voters during a low-profile 'Back to Work' bus tour across the state.\nPerhaps the nation's most vocal anti-Trump Republican governor while in office, Hogan barely mentions Trump's name unless asked about him. He's just as eager to ignore abortion, even though Maryland is among the states that will vote on an abortion referendum this fall — a winning issue for Democrats in red and blue states alike where ballot questions have appeared since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022.\nAdvertisement\nDemocrats suggest he would support a federal abortion ban, but Hogan insisted in an interview that he would not.\nHe also said he strongly supports in-vitro fertilization and would introduce legislation to protect the practice, an apparent attempt to clarify his position after he declined to say in an Axios interview last month whether he would support such federal protections.\nHe also said he 'would consider voting for' a Maryland ballot measure this fall that would preserve abortion rights, although he argues that it's unnecessary.\nHogan said abortion doesn't comes up much on the campaign trail. He predicted it wouldn't be 'a deciding issue' in the election.\nAsked about the issues that matter most to him, Hogan said he's most focused on ending the divisiveness in Washington, followed by the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, crime and the economy.\nAdvertisement\nBut Hogan largely avoided talking politics at all on his weekend bus tour, preferring to connect with voters on a personal level. He was eager to jump behind restaurant counters to chat with the kitchen staff or pose for pictures welcoming small business owners. And voters, regardless of their party affiliation, embraced him enthusiastically at nearly every stop.\nLanda Mitchell, a 46-year-old old African American woman from Hanover, Maryland, flagged down the governor as he toured small business booths at a weekend boat show. She had met him years ago at a fundraiser for the homeless.\nMitchell said she's not a Republican, but she'd likely vote for Hogan.\n'He's not far right wing. He's over there, but he's not far far over there,' Mitchell said with a laugh, adding that she's not sure whether she'll support President Joe Biden this fall because of the state of the economy. 'I'm far from a Trump supporter, but I go into the grocery store today and I cry.'\nAdvertisement\nCaroline County Sheriff Donald Baker, who welcomed Hogan on a tour through his office, said he also appreciates the former governor's strong support for law enforcement, noting that the sheriff's office didn't get a single applicant for a recent job posting.\n'It's gonna be a tough road for him to navigate,' Baker said of Hogan's political challenge. 'If anybody can do it, I believe Larry Hogan can do it. Why? Because he is a middle-of-the-road kind of guy. He knows how to work with people.'\nAnd as Democrats fight to link him to Trump's Republican Party, Hogan will take pains to distance himself from Trump — but not too far.\n'We don't want to alienate Trump voters,' Hogan told the AP. 'We need Trump voters. And we need a lot of Biden voters. Maryland is tough.'\nBut he doesn't expect Trump or any other MAGA celebrities to campaign in Maryland on his behalf in the coming months. He said he's not sure if he'll even attend this summer's Republican National Convention, where Trump will formally become the GOP presidential nominee; Hogan skipped Trump's last two nominating conventions as well.\n'I don't think Trump would help me at all. I ran 46 points ahead of him,' Hogan said, noting that Trump lost Maryland in 2020 by a bigger margin than any other state in the nation. 'I don't think he needs to campaign in Maryland.'\n___",

            "excerpt": "Democratic Senate hopefuls Angela D. Alsobrooks and Rep. David Trone lay out why they should be the one to take on Maryland's former GOP governor Larry Hogan.",
            "summary": "In their first televised primary debate, Rep. David Trone and Prince George's County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks each sought to position themselves as the Democratic Party's best chance of defeating the state's popular, two-term former Republican governor in November.\nWith similar stances on key issues such as education and reproductive rights, the leading Democrats in the race for U.S. Senate emphasized contrasting experience in making their pitch to primary voters — all while agreeing on the stakes. The race is one of a handful of contests across the country with the power to determine control of the chamber in November, which Democrats currently hold by a razor-thin margin.\nTrone, a multimillionaire founder of Total Wine & More, highlighted his record in Congress, his business experience and a challenging upbringing over the course of an hour-long live program on Fox45 and WJLA7. Alsobrooks, who was previously Prince George's state's attorney, pointed to her own experiences as a woman and mother, her criminal justice background and her record leading the state's second-most populous county.\nAdvertisement\nTrone swiftly declared victory in a news release after the debate. Alsobrooks hailed her 'standout performance.' Each claimed momentum heading into the next phase of the contest.\nAs May 14 approaches, attention is building on what had largely been seen as a sleepy contest for a reliably blue seat until Hogan launched a surprise bid two months ago. Endorsements are flying, yards signs are popping up and airwaves are thrumming with campaign messaging — and money.\nThis week alone saw the liberal super PAC Fight Corporate Monopolies launch the cycle's first negative ad, swiping at Trone's business practices and comparing him to former Republican president Donald Trump. On Wednesday, Hogan deployed a nearly $1 million television ad buy half bankrolled by national Republicans eager to flip the open Senate seat red.\nAdvertisement\nNational dollars are flowing into a contest that had been largely shaped by Trone's deep pockets. He has loaned his campaign at least $41.7 million since the start of the primary race, campaign finance records show.\nAlsobrooks, an underdog in the race, according to recent polls, repeatedly focused attention on Trone's fortunes and interrogated his argument that self-funding helps insulate him from special interests — repeating a line of attack she and her surrogates have raised about him 'buying' the seat.\nDuring the debate, she took aim at contributions Trone has made in a personal capacity and through his company, Total Wine & More, to conservative leaders such as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) who have worked to quash abortion access.\nThat fact, she said, contrasts with a record of giving that Trone has touted. He helped establish an abortion clinic in Western Maryland near the border with West Virginia after that state effectively shut down the procedure.\nAdvertisement\n'He cannot claim credit for the good his company does and distance himself from the bad that it does,' Alsobrooks said.\nTrone, in turn, swatted at her accusations by insinuating her interests would lie with companies that have supported her campaign, referencing by name Exxon, Pfizer and Cigna.\n'When you take the money … then they must expect something [of politicians],' Trone said. 'They're not charities.'\nAlsobrooks has brought in more individual contributions than any other candidate so far, and filings show she has just under $3.2 million on hand. Still, Alsobrooks's performance Friday carried extra weight in a race with lopsided resources at a time when she is seeking to boost name recognition.\nPolls released over the past six weeks show Trone consistently leading her, and Hogan, who left office last year with high favorability ratings, leading them both.\nHogan has maintained that he is an underdog in a state where registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans 2 to 1. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll conducted in March found that while Hogan is better known than Trone and Alsobrooks, he faces a crosscurrent Democrats hope to exploit: Maryland voters said by a 20-point margin that they prefer Democratic control of the U.S. Senate.\nHogan was out front in a poll released this week by FOX45 News, the Baltimore Sun and the University of Baltimore and conducted by OpinionWorks. The results show Trone leading Alsobrooks, 49 percent to 28 percent.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Trone on Friday detailed a bipartisan spirit he said helped him compete with Hogan, Alsobrooks took the opportunity to question a record of political giving to the man he hopes to beat. In 2014, eight of Trone's businesses gave $30,000 to Hogan in an effort to help him get rid of campaign debt, The Post reported.\n'What we don't need is a Larry Hogan donor trying to take on Larry Hogan in the fall,' Alsobrooks said.\nAmong the sharpest jabs Friday was an exchange on endorsements, with Trone noting he had secured the support of prominent politicians from the county Alsobrooks represents.\nOn Thursday, he received an endorsement from Aisha Braveboy (D), the Prince George's County state's attorney who holds Alsobrooks's former position. Democratic Prince George's County Council members Krystal Oriadha and Edward Burroughs III — both of whom have endorsed Trone and been critical of Alsobrooks in the past — were in the studio Friday, at times huddling around Trone during commercial breaks.\nAdvertisement\n'The folks that really matter the most are those that know you the best,' Trone said. 'Prince George's County supports us. The list goes on and on and on.'\nAlsobrooks has picked up Democratic heavyweights from the local to the federal level. Among her supporters are Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Rep. Jamie Raskin and former Prince George's county executive Rushern Baker IV.\nThe pair didn't spar over topics such as the Israel-Hamas war, on which they both agree that Hamas should be defeated, a cease-fire is needed and that hostages must be released. They also said cities should have access to federal data currently withheld from the public to enhance law enforcement's ability to trace guns and quell crime.\nand that hostages must be released. They also said cities should have access to federal data currently withheld from the public to enhance law enforcement's ability to trace guns and quell crime.\nBoth contenders have made protecting abortion rights a centerpiece of their campaign, tapping into an issue that has galvanized voters since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the constitutional right to abortion.\nprotecting abortion rights a centerpiece of their campaign, tapping into an issue that has galvanized voters since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the constitutional right to abortion.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAdvertisement\nThey have sought to paint Hogan, who would not say in an interview whether he would codify abortion protections in federal law, as an enemy of reproductive rights. Hogan said he would not vote for a national abortion ban, but he also said he would not take a position on hypothetical legislation that would codify Roe v. Wade .\nRoe v. Wade.\nCracks in their positions appeared when asked about repealing the death penalty.\nAlsobrooks supported the death sentence of a man convicted of killing four people including two children when she was Prince George's state's attorney, a panelist noted. But as the federal government reconsiders the death penalty, Alsobrooks noted that she, too, has evolved on the issue.\nMarylanders have decided that the death penalty is no longer the law of the land in Maryland, 'and I agree with Maryland voters,' Alsobrooks said. I can tell you that I would also not support the death penalty on the federal level. … Having said that, what I believe is that anyone who harms a child or who murders a child in particular deserves the stiffest penalty available to that person. And right now in Maryland, that penalty is life without parole.\nIn his rebuttal, Trone emphasized his steadfast opposition to it. 'It's clearly cruel and unusual punishment, and it's clearly racist,' he said.\nEarly voting in Maryland's Democratic and Republican primaries begins May 2.",

But on a warm afternoon last week, it looked especially like a scene from ADW because several members of the cast were there to reflect on the legacy of the beloved series.\nespecially like a scene from ADW because several members of the cast were there to reflect on the legacy of the beloved series.\nKadeem Hardison and Jasmine Guy, eternally shipped as Dwayne Wayne and Whitley Gilbert-Wayne? Present. So, too, were Darryl M. Bell, who starred as Dwayne's BFF Ron Johnson, Cree Summer, known for playing the bohemian-chic Freddie Brooks, and Charnele Brown, who starred as aspiring lawyer Kim Reese.\nHoward's campus in Northwest D.C. marked the second stop of a multi-city tour that has reunited the colleagues turned family at the center of the NBC sitcom about life at a fictional historically Black college. Under the direction of HU graduate Debbie Allen, the 'Cosby Show' spinoff, which aired from 1987-1993, became a funny, poignant and groundbreaking sitcom in its own right.\nAdvertisement\nSkip to end of carousel\nThe Style section\nThe Style section Style is where The Washington Post covers happenings on the front lines of culture and what it all means, including the arts, media, social trends, politics and yes, fashion, all told with personality and deep reporting. For more Style stories, click here\nEnd of carousel\nThirty-five years after it premiered, 'A Different World' occupies a hallowed place in the Black TV canon and is one of several groundbreaking series belatedly getting its due in the era of streaming and social media. The cast was at Howard to celebrate that, but also to talk about the show's impact — enrollment at historically Black colleges and universities notably increased during the show's run.\nThe inspiration for Hillman, ADW's fictional college, has long been a topic of friendly debate among HBCU students. So it was unsurprising when the cast gathered to answer questions from reporters and a student journalist kicked things off by surmising that the beloved series was based on the Mecca (as Howard is known to its nearest and dearest), right? Right?\nRight?\nGlynn Turman, who played Colonel Bradford Taylor on the show, explained that it was actually an amalgam of several prominent HBCUs, including Howard (a no-brainer given Allen's affiliation), the other HU (Virginia's Hampton University) and Spelman, the Atlanta college that provided exterior shots for Hillman's campus. Dawnn Lewis, whose character Jaleesa was in her mid-20s when she enrolled at Hillman, added that 'the germ of the show' came from creator Bill Cosby, who was passionate about higher education and HBCUs in particular.\nAdvertisement\nYes, Cosby — whose name came up respectfully but sparingly as the cast discussed the show's legacy — was the creator of 'A Different World,' but it was Allen who made it into the show we all remember. The forgettable first season revolved around Denise Huxtable (Lisa Bonet) and her white roommate, Maggie (Marisa Tomei); Tomei left the show entirely after Season 1, while Bonet appeared only as a special guest.\nHired to reboot the series in its second season, Allen leaned into the show's HBCU setting, requiring the show's writers to spend time on HBCU campuses, and shifting the focus to Dwayne, Whitley and their inner circle.\nSome of the Hillman Day discourse — which unfolded during a well-attended panel discussion that followed the cast's chat with reporters — revolved around the ways in which it truly is a different world 35 years after the show's premiere. Earlier that day, the cast visited the White House, where at least one Howard alum (that would be Vice President Harris) has an office. TheGrio reporter April Ryan shared a video of the cast singing the show's memorable theme song in the White House press room, enthusiastically led by press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.\nAdvertisement\nThough ADW's legacy looms large three decades on, it didn't always feel that way for the cast. ' In all honesty, when we were doing the show we were just so happy to be employed,' explained Summer, looking every bit the flower child in a flowy denim ensemble and vintage top hat. 'Yes, we were the number two show on TV, but as people of color, we didn't feel that. We felt the love from our people but not necessarily from the industry at large.'\n'In all honesty, when we were doing the show we were just so happy to be employed,' explained Summer, looking every bit the flower child in a flowy denim ensemble and vintage top hat.

We felt the love from our people but not necessarily from the industry at large.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'It really is a retroactive love, and I have to say that's kind of the best kind of love because now we're all old enough to really appreciate it,' she added.\nThe multigenerational appeal of 'A Different World' was especially apparent at the panel, where student body president Nia Naylor recalled watching Dwayne and Whitley as a toddler in 'a polka-dot onesie.' The university's president, Ben Vinson III, remembered watching the show as a teenager, hurrying to finish his homework in time to tune in.\nAdvertisement\nThe discussion was full of surprises: it was moderated by 'Living Single's' resident quirk, Kim Coles, and featured appearances by Karen Malina White, who played fast-talking Charmaine Brown on later seasons of ADW, and Tempestt Bledsoe, who played Huxtable daughter Vanessa on 'The Cosby Show' (and, once, on 'A Different World'). Comedian Sinbad, a.k.a. Coach Oakes — who several cast members credited with elevating their own comedic chops across the show's six seasons — appeared via video to thank fans for the love.\nAllen steered the show in a more socially conscious direction, with episodes devoted to topics including HIV/AIDS (at a time when it was controversial to even mention condoms on television), consent and apartheid. 'I felt the show needed to be upgraded to a more mature level of talking and thinking,' Allen told the AP in 1989. 'Teenage pregnancy, student uprisings, voting and other issues.'\nShe wasn't there in person, but Allen did appear in an indelible ADW clip that featured her character, Dr. Langhorne — in a mushroom bob and comically large glasses — counseling a frazzled Whitley to 'relax, relate, release.' (Allen's sister, 'Cosby Show' actress Phylicia Rashad, was in the audience as the outgoing dean of Howard's Chadwick A. Boseman College of Fine Arts). Coles invited the audience to repeat the mantra in an effort to conjure an appearance by Allen, who signed on via video during a break from directing 'Grey's Anatomy.'\nThe moment was a reminder that the industry has also evolved, thanks to the efforts of famous HBCU alums including producer Will Packer, who graduated from Florida A&M University, and Taraji P. Henson, who studied drama at Howard. Lena Waithe, the actress-writer-producer behind Showtime's 'The Chi' and BET's 'Twenties,' made ADW's fictional university the namesake of her production company, Hillman Grad.\nAdvertisement\nMorehouse alum Spike Lee famously brought the HBCU experience to the big screen in his 1988 film, 'School Daze,' which marked early roles for Guy, Hardison and Bell. But apart from that film and a handful of others, including Gina Prince-Bythewood's Lee-produced debut 'Love and Basketball,' it's not common to see HBCUs on screen.\ncommon to see HBCUs on screen.\nWhen NPR host Ayesha Rascoe was editing 'HBCU Made,' a collection of essays from graduates of historically Black colleges and universities, she found it striking by how many HBCU alums — from varying generations — mentioned 'A Different World.'\n'When people talk about their views of going to an HBCU or why they went, ‘A Different World' really played such a big role,' Rascoe, also an graduate of Howard, said in a phone interview. 'I think it just shows the importance of media and the importance of telling these stories because they have such a wide impact on people and the decisions that they make, even just something as important as the school that they go to.'\nAdvertisement\nAs the panel ended, Hardison gave away a pair of his character's trademark flip-up aviators — finally capitalizing on the memorable accessory — and the cast gamely interacted with students, some of whom — as Summer noted at one point — hadn't even been born when 'A Different World' premiered.",

            "summary": "The teenager on the other end of the video call could have asked Mandy and Matt Hill any questions before deciding whether to leave a group home for refugee children to come live with them in Virginia. He had only three:\nWould he be able to use his phone?\nWould he be able to use his phone? Would he be allowed to go outside?\nWould he be allowed to go outside?\nCould he have friends?\nCould he have friends?\nThat teenager, Noorulhadi Noorani, who goes by Noor, recalled that initial conversation as he sat at the Hills' dining room table on a recent evening. Nearby, three of his brothers worked on a painting and another sipped a cup of chai. They listened as Noor spoke with me in English, a language that he didn't know a few years ago and that his brothers, who more recently arrived in the country, are trying to learn.\nHow the five brothers, who range in age from 8 to 21, all ended up living in Loudoun County is a story that starts with them getting separated at an airport in Afghanistan. Their family was one of the many that crowded the grounds around the international airport in Kabul in 2021 in hopes of evacuating as the United States withdrew its troops.\nAdvertisement\nAs Noor tells it, his father worked for UNICEF and his older brother served in the Afghan army, positions that made them targets of the Taliban. His family received three threatening letters and his brother was beaten repeatedly, once in front of their mother. The family went together to the airport and made it as far as the gates. There, Noor said, the Taliban stopped them and told them that they couldn't go any further.\nNoor was 16, and in that moment, he made a decision that would shift the trajectory of his life and, although he didn't know it yet, his brothers' lives. He saw a fountain inside the gates and asked if he could get some water. He was granted permission, but instead of getting a drink and returning to his family, he hurried toward the airport.\n'They were calling me back, and I wouldn't look,' Noor recalled of the Taliban. 'I just kept going. I never stopped.'\nAdvertisement\nNoor had no identification when he boarded a plane that took him to Qatar. Later, after it was determined he had no relatives to take care of him, he was brought to the United States where he stayed in a shelter, then a group home, before coming to live with the Hills in 2022.\n'This family, I didn't know them, and they didn't know me, and they chose to help,' said Noor, who is now 19 and a senior in high school. 'I will never forget that help. It changed my life 100 percent.'\nLutheran Social Services of the National Capital Area placed Noor with the family. The organization helps find foster families in D.C., Maryland and Virginia for refugee minors who enter the country unaccompanied and migrant children who end up in the country alone.\n'These are the most vulnerable of the vulnerable kids,' the group's chief executive, Kristyn Peck, told me. Many of those children have been displaced by conflict or orphaned by it. Others have been trafficked or neglected. All have found themselves without a parent or guardian to take care of them, either temporarily or permanently, in a country they don't know.\nAdvertisement\nI ended up speaking with Peck on a recent afternoon about those children because the organization is facing a need right now. There are young people waiting for homes and not enough foster families. The organization places children in long- and short-term foster homes.\nThe organization, which receives funding from the Office of Refugee Resettlement, can accept 70 children but would need to add 20 foster families to meet that capacity, Peck said. The organization also plans to open centers soon in Virginia and Maryland that will provide schooling and other services to unaccompanied minors who are placed in short-term foster homes. She said they need families to sign up to take in those children as well.\n'Unfortunately, given the state of our world and all of the conflicts happening around the world right now, I don't anticipate the need going down,' Peck said. Children who are not placed in foster homes, she said, may have to remain in refugee camps, shelters or group homes. She said the organization welcomes all types of families, including single parents and LGBTQ+ couples, to apply to foster. 'If they have the capacity and the interest in doing so, we want them at the table.'\nAdvertisement\nMy grandfather came to the United States as an unaccompanied minor at the age of 9. I have no idea who took care of him as a child. He died when I was still a kid, before I could interview him or appreciate what it must have taken for him to build his family in the same way he built my grandmother a house — from the ground up, without a foundation already in place.\nAfter hearing about the need for foster families in this region, I asked Lutheran Social Services of the National Capital Area if I could see what an arrangement looked like. That's how I ended up at the Hills' house on a warm evening.\nMandy Hill said her husband served in Afghanistan with the Navy and his translator took good care of him. The couple hoped to help the translator's sisters come to the United States and were devastated when they realized they couldn't. They decided they could try to help another family and were waiting to take one in when they received a call they didn't expect. They were told a teenage boy needed a home.\nAdvertisement\nThe couple had a daughter in college, another daughter who was about to finish 12th grade and a teenage son in high school when Noor came to live with them. He and their son will now graduate together.\nNoor not only now has foster siblings — he also has biological siblings living nearby.\nAt the end of last year, his parents brought his brothers, ages 21, 17, 10 and 8, to Loudoun and rented a home. Then two weeks ago, his parents returned to Afghanistan for what Noor describes as family obligations. His brothers couldn't go back without fear, Noor said. He recalled seeing people maimed by explosions on his way to school and hearing bullets pass by his head as he and his brothers slept on the roof of his grandparents' house. He was so used to avoiding crowded spaces that for a while whenever he stepped into the cafeteria at his school in Loudoun, he had to remind himself that he was safe.\nAdvertisement\nHe didn't want that life for his brothers, and they didn't want it. They decided to stay, and the 21-year-old is now taking care of them. Since his family moved, Noor spends time with them every week, including some overnights. But he stays with the Hills to allow him to focus on his goals. (I was asked not to identify the brothers by name out of safety concerns for their family. Noor changed his name).\n'There's a lot in my life that I don't want to remember,' Noor's older brother told me through him. He said he wants his younger brothers to get the chance to do well in school and eventually 'help people in this country the way that people have helped them.'\nNoor's older brother told me through him. He said he wants his younger brothers to get the chance to do well in school and eventually 'help people in this country the way that people have helped them.'\nThe boys are alone, but also not really.

They have provided jobs and English lessons.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'It makes me really happy to see my brothers here,' Noor said. 'They're happy here.

What are your dreams? What are your concerns or fears?\nTwo years later, his answers have stayed consistent, she said. He didn't have many fears. His dreams were to get an education and start his own business. And his needs he expressed with his own questions.",

We call upon the governments to strengthen health-care capacity, preparing the health-care systems to act as pillars of sustainability in the face of climate change. The time to prepare is now.\nShreenik Kundu and Ayla Gerk , Montreal\nShreenik Kundu and Ayla Gerk, Montreal\nThe writers are PhD students at McGill University with fellowship studies at the Program in Global Surgery and Social Change at Harvard Medical School.\nThe writers are PhD students at McGill University with fellowship studies at the Program in Global Surgery and Social Change at Harvard Medical School.\nAt the most fundamental level, the world's struggle to make progress combating climate change is a product of humankind's most tragic flaw: We are incapable of protecting ourselves from ourselves. In the same vein, we might be unable to exhibit the required understanding, cooperativeness and selflessness needed to overcome the effects of climate change.\nSince the discovery of climate change a half-century ago, the world's reaction has been appalling. The response from those in the best position to do something about it, such as world political leaders and the barons of industry, has ranged from inadequate to nonexistent. For far too long, it seems the prospect of the end of humanity has paled in significance when compared with the continuation of the status quo, with its profits and comforts. The urgency of the situation is finally taking hold, but is it happening too late? Precious time has been wasted.\nAdvertisement\nPerhaps the world's best hope for survival would be the use of cutting-edge science and technology to, for example, remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. The nature of the process would be analogous to the extraction of salt from the ocean, but immensely more complex. A major advantage of such a solution is that it would be less affected by the proclivities of human behavior. Even in an advanced country such as the United States, a significant number of people still believe the whole thing is a 'hoax,' and business as usual still reigns. It really does feel like, once again, we can't help ourselves — but this time, the consequences could be fatal for the entire human species.\nHarry Flickinger , Gaithersburg\nHarry Flickinger, Gaithersburg\nRegarding the April 10 article 'U.N. climate chief presses for faster action, says humans have 2 years left ‘to save the world'':\nAdvertisement\nWhile the thought of 'two years left' seems depressingly pessimistic to me as a college student, it's important that we don't lose faith and focus on solutions. Although this article is more concerned with carbon emissions on a global scale, it is crucial that we look inward at our own domestic responsibility in reducing our emissions. The United States has yet to pass legislation for large-scale emissions reductions, such as a carbon fee to encourage polluters to turn to more renewable energy and a dividend distributed to every citizen to cushion the result of the fee.\nWhile Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University, worries this two-year warning will be ignored, it is my hope that it can be a call to action. While issues of climate change seem overwhelming to many citizens, our nation is based on the power of the ballot to prioritize the greatest threats to our future. November is coming.\nCourtney Hand , Williamsburg, Va.\nCourtney Hand, Williamsburg, Va.\nWhat Donald Trump doesn't understand about Jewish voters\nRegarding Philip Bump's April 10 analysis, 'Browbeating Jewish voters hasn't yet worked for Trump':\nAdvertisement\nDonald Trump's statement that Jews who don't vote Republican don't love Israel is a waste of breath. I am a Jew, and I love Israel. It's Benjamin Netanyahu whom I don't like or trust. There is mounting evidence that the Israeli prime minister is holding on to power for the same reason Mr. Trump wants to return to power: to keep out of the courtroom. The last time I voted for a Republican was in November 1990. But if you're wondering, I'm not voting for any current Republican, and I still love Israel.\nRobert Bronstein , New York\nRobert Bronstein, New York\nDonald Trump might be surprised to learn that Jewish voters, even those of us who are strong supporters of Israel, have strong feelings about other priorities as well. We care about education, the economy, women's health care, gun safety, foreign affairs, the environment, crime and, yes, even immigration. We are very aware that if Mr. Trump wins and the Republicans take the House and Senate, we will likely lose any progress we have made on these issues.\nAdvertisement\nHow do we know this? Mr. Trump has developed a track record since his surprising win in 2016. His overriding concern, as he seeks the presidency for the third time, seems to be avoiding convictions in his many criminal cases and, if he wins, destroying his enemies. We have a long history of democracy and freedom in this country. When countries lose that, it never works well for the Jewish people. There's a track record for that, too.\nElliott Miller , Bala Cynwyd, Pa.\nElliott Miller, Bala Cynwyd, Pa.\nThe problem with an immediate cease-fire\nRegarding the April 9 op-ed by Jordanian King Abdullah II, French President Emmanuel Macron and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, 'Three nations, one message: A permanent Gaza cease-fire now':\nBefore Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel sought a two-state solution. Under the Oslo accords, Israel wanted a two-state solution. Former U.S. ambassador Dennis Ross recounted in his book 'The Missing Peace: The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace' the proposed solution in 2000 that would have given the Palestinian Authority 95 percent of what they wanted. Then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak agreed, but Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestinian Authority, walked away. The current leader of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, does not want to live in peace with Israel, and Hamas wants to destroy Israel.\nAdvertisement\nThe proposed cease-fire will not be permanent until both sides respect each other's right to exist. Israel is threatened with hostile neighbors and acts accordingly. Are the authors of this op-ed willing to commit troops and resources to ensure that Israel is secure? With a secure Israel, a rational prime minister could be elected to build a two-state solution. What commitments will the authors and the United Nations make to provide effective, peace-loving government(s) for the Palestinians?\nRobert Finkelstein , Reston, Va.\nRobert Finkelstein, Reston, Va.\nJordanian King Abdullah II, French President Emmanuel Macron and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi have observed that 'Protecting civilians is a fundamental legal obligation for all parties and 'the cornerstone' of international humanitarian law. Violating this obligation is absolutely prohibited.' With all due respect, this statement is both inaccurate and misleading.\nAdvertisement\nYes, the protection of 'noncombatants' is a fundamental principle of the Law of Armed Conflict. However, it is not the cornerstone. Historically, the LOAC has recognized that civilian deaths and the destruction of civilian property will often occur in the course of armed conflict. The principal purpose of the LOAC has thus been to mitigate, not eliminate, this loss of civilian life and property by regulating the means and methods by which conflict might be lawfully conducted. Accordingly, a commander must refrain from an attack in which the anticipated incidental civilian harm would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected to be gained.\nThus, while the protection of civilians is indeed a fundamental consideration in conducting a military operation, this factor does not take priority over mission accomplishment. A warfighter, in developing an operation plan, cannot do so on the basis that, legally, his primary concern must not be the military necessity of accomplishing his mission, but rather the protection of the enemy's civilian population. To contend that this is the case would be to turn the LOAC on its head.\nDavid E. Graham , Charlottesville\nDavid E. Graham, Charlottesville\nAdvertisement\nThe leaders of Egypt, France and Jordan all support an immediate cease-fire, which is counterintuitive to the universally supported right of Israel to defend itself. Hamas publicly claims its members will repeat the Oct. 7 attack until Israel no longer exists.\nThe call for releasing hostages is laudable. However, bear in mind that Hamas wishes to exchange the people they kidnapped for criminals and murderers held in Israel's prisons. Will released prisoners carry out another Oct. 7?",

            "summary": "Regarding the April 14 news article 'Their son wanted an octopus. They ended up with 50 more.':\nThe story of the Oklahoma family that yielded and finally conceded to their child's irrational need to own a pet octopus only to learn later 'he' was a 'she' and also pregnant with 50 eggs triggered me in so many ways. Removing and selling octopuses for profit is an irresponsible act rather than a lifelong lesson taught.\nInstead, why not embrace and encourage their son's passion for marine science in a more sustainable manner? I realize they live in a landlocked state — and I'm not sure where the closest aquarium is — but maybe do some research and visit one as frequently as feasible? See whether they have a volunteer program and enroll your child? I'm sure there's an app where you can raise and nurture your own digital octopod.\nAdvertisement\nThere were so many lessons that could have been taught here instead of capitulating to your kid and worrying that you'd be 'the worst father' if you didn't indulge him. Teaching that it's cruel and inhumane to trap a wild animal (or any living being for that matter) in a tank for your enjoyment could have been a lesson to respect the world around you.\nOr flip the script on him with something along the lines of 'How would you like being in a glass tank if a space alien came down to earth and scooped you up and stuck you in a tank to be their pet?'\nMaybe if such lessons were taught early in life, we'd live in a much different world.\nRobert Pousman , Healdsburg, Calif.\nRobert Pousman, Healdsburg, Calif.\nIt was distressing to read the uncritical account of a boy's whimsy leading one of the ocean's most fascinating sentient creatures to be trapped in a tank in his bedroom, giving birth to two dozen surviving octopuses that were then relegated to individual plastic containers before being held captive in their own communal tank. Anyone who has seen the amazing Oscar-winning documentary 'My Octopus Teacher' would wonder why indulging the child's enthusiasm would be worth so abusing a magnificent wild creature. Surely this boy, like the Monterey Bay Aquarium official who was quoted, could better learn about octopus life by watching videos.\nAdvertisement\nAnd what a contrast to an article on the same day — 'A silent killer stalks sea turtles. A small town is trying to stop it.' — about a Venezuelan community's valiant effort to save endangered turtles in their native habitat.\nLaura Ingersoll , Washington\nLaura Ingersoll, Washington\nPerhaps smart(phone) advice\nI could not agree more with George F. Will's April 7 op-ed 'Want smart kids? Ban smartphones in schools.' The contrast between today's experience of childhood and adolescence and mine in the 1970s is striking.\nLike all reminiscences, mine is surely somewhat predisposed to positive experiences, but I do clearly remember playing outdoors as much as I was allowed, which included near-constant, in-person interaction with peers and some adults. This necessitated developing some basic social skills, sometimes the hard way, as well as engaging in copious amounts of physical activity, from which one occasionally hurt themselves. We were not 'bubble-wrapped.' From these experiences, one learned to handle oneself.\nAdvertisement\nWhen I walk around my neighborhood, the streets are deserted of children and adults, with dog-walkers the lone exception. Though I rarely go inside schools now, I often see schoolchildren waiting at bus stops in the morning. Every one of them is studying their phones while ignoring their nearby counterparts. I know that at the bus stops of my youth, we talked with one another. Did we discuss issues of great import? Probably never. But we were developing our ability to converse live with individuals with different personalities and from different backgrounds.\nMr. Will and author Jonathan Haidt are correct when they suggest that the ubiquity of smartphones and limitless access to the internet have curtailed the development of adolescents mentally, and I would go them one further and suggest that there has also been a corresponding impact on physical fitness, as evidenced by the pervasiveness of childhood obesity.\nDaniel W. Keiper , Falls Church\nDaniel W. Keiper, Falls Church\nA dangerous D.C. decision\nRegarding the April 13 Metro article 'District hits brakes on divisive bike route':\nAdvertisement\nThe decision by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) and the D.C. Council to cancel the proposed bike lanes on Connecticut Avenue NW is disheartening and dangerous.\nFew drivers obey the 25-mph speed limit north of the bridge over Rock Creek. For their own safety, riders of bikes and scooters use the sidewalks, many of which are narrow.\nFor a frequent pedestrian from the bridge north through Woodley Park, Cleveland Park and near Chevy Chase Circle, this decision is terrifying. Pedestrians cannot hear bikes or scooters, and their riders weave among older residents and families on their way to the National Zoo and perhaps to some of the businesses that influenced this shortsighted choice.\nFor safety's sake, I hope the council will restore plans for the bike lanes we were promised.\nJody Beck , Washington\nJody Beck, Washington\n‘The capability to uplift people'\nRegarding Reginald Dwayne Betts's April 16 op-ed, 'I was a teen in Virginia prison. Books were my lifeline.'\nAdvertisement\nThough I commend Mr. Betts's portrayal of the transformative power of literature amid incarceration, it's vital to address the systemic issues within the prison system. He rightly emphasizes the resilience literature can instill, yet we must confront the broader issues of limited access to education and rehabilitation programs, disproportionately harsh sentencing and inadequate support for reintegration into society.\nWhile literature offers peace, many individuals in prison lack access to reading materials, exacerbating feelings of isolation.\nAs an avid reader, I found the author's narrative to be powerful and thoughtful. While I have not experienced the challenges of being imprisoned, I feel like I can connect to the belief that literature holds the capability to uplift people, regardless of their situation. We live in a world where access to knowledge is taken advantage of, more people are seen with a phone in their hand than a book. Reading is not just a source of intellectual enrichment but also a means of self-discovery.\nAdvertisement\nMr. Betts's narrative underscores the importance of diverse perspectives in the discourse on criminal justice reform.\nIsabella Heilbronn , Boston\nIsabella Heilbronn, Boston\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nHere's the pitch\nI hope every Nationals pitcher quoted in The Post's April 13 Sports article 'Seeing the game through pitchers' eyes,' which was about where pitchers focus their gaze before throwing specific pitches, is outright lying. Please tell me this is a clever disinformation campaign. Otherwise, they might as well announce their pitches to the batter. I understand that two requirements for landing a spot in Major League Baseball are (1) excellent vision and (2) the ability to remember an incredible amount of detail, especially about pitchers. Any sharp-eyed batter who has had the benefit of reading this article is going to be one huge step closer to 'guessing' what's coming.\nAdvertisement\nThomas M. Sneeringer , Washington\nThomas M. Sneeringer, Washington\nTroubled bridges over water\nRegarding the April 11 Metro article, 'Inside the massive three-step cleanup of Baltimore's Key Bridge':\nThe eyes of the world have been focused on the collapse of the Key Bridge, sealing off Baltimore's harbor. Among those eyes are people who bear the United States ill will and who could find the disaster a cost-effective way to harm our economy. Worse, one of our strategic military triad lies vulnerable.\nMost of our East Coast harbors have entrances from the Atlantic Ocean spanned by huge bridges. For instance, New York's harbor has the Verrazzano and the Bayonne bridges rising over the front and back entrances. More ominous for our security is Submarine Base New London on the Thames River in Groton, Conn. There, twin truss bridges and the Amtrak lift bridge, if dropped, would seal those subs in port at the 22-slip base just as are the eight unlucky freighters now trapped in Baltimore. The United States has only about 70 submarines worldwide, so a few out of service would present a significant loss.\nAdvertisement\nAt a cost only a tiny fraction of the loss in productivity and security, excavation should begin immediately to deepen the shipping channels under all such bridges by an additional 50 feet or more. The Baltimore entrapment results from what is probably 10 to 20 feet of rubble raising the channel clearance from 50 to perhaps 30 feet. With the additional 50-foot depth, the ruins of a fallen bridge would lie below the 48-foot draft of supermax container ships and our submarines. Bridge abutments could be strengthened as needed by the deepening. The bridge wreckage could then be removed piece-by-piece between vessel transits.\nLet us hope this unlikely concern does not remind us of our Sept. 10, 2001, conviction that planes would always stay away from tall buildings.",

Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has upended that.\nRep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has upended that.\nAt Tuesday morning's closed-door Republican conference meeting, Massie announced that he had signed on to Greene's motion to vacate Johnson as House speaker after Johnson proposed funding aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan with no border-security provisions.\nThat turned heads for multiple reasons.\nMassie moved the needle\nRepublicans are now taking Greene's effort seriously.\nOn the one hand, Massie's support moves Greene one vote closer to being able to vacate Johnson. She now only needs one more vote in their narrow two-seat majority unless Democrats come to his rescue. (They have said they will if Johnson puts a bill similar to the Senate-passed bill with funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan on the floor for a vote.)\nAdvertisement\nBut Massie's support is significant in another way, too.\nRepublicans mostly dismissed the motion to vacate because Trump, who is worried about GOP chaos six months before the election, stood with Johnson at Mar-a-Lago last week and said he supports the speaker.\nRepublicans were skeptical that Greene would cross Trump — and Republicans frustrated with Johnson didn't want to cross Trump, either.\nMassie is, in some ways, immune to pressure from Trump. He's not particularly close with him. He cares little about what Trump thinks and the former president doesn't influence his actions or his votes. So a call from Trump would probably do little to dissuade him from voting to oust Johnson.\nFull circle\nAs recently as last Congress, both Massie and Greene were outsiders looking in.\nMassie, a libertarian who opposes nearly all government spending bills , is one of only a handful of Republicans who joined no conference or faction.

            "summary": "The timing of the transition to a new home is never simple.\nIn every real estate market, repeat buyers need to decide how to transition from one home the next. Ideally, the closing for the sale and the closing for the purchase are aligned, with just enough time to transfer funds and schedule the move. But that's not always possible, particularly in a highly competitive housing market like the D.C. region's.\n'It's an individual decision whether to sell first or buy first that depends on people's finances and their own risk profile,' said Christine Fischer, an agent with McEnearney Associates in Arlington, Va. 'The least risky decision is to sell your property first, so you know for certain what the proceeds are, then move into a rental property while you look for something to buy.'\nAdvertisement\nOf course, that decision means buyers spend more money on the rental and on moving twice, Fischer said.\n'Right now, with inventory so low, almost everyone is looking to buy first to make sure they can find something they want instead of being forced to buy something in a hurry,' she said.\nChristopher Suranna, an agent with RLAH Properties in D.C. and president of the Greater Capital Area Association of Realtors, said some clients have enough cash or accessible home equity to buy first.\nSELL FIRST: You won't have to pay two mortgages. (Video: Laurel Molly for The Washington Post, Photo: Laurel Molly for the Washington Post/Laurel Molly for The Washington Post)\n'A couple of clients I worked with recently had plenty of equity, so they had the luxury to shop for their new home, move in and then concentrate on getting their former home ready to sell,' Suranna said. 'In a perfect world, you'd have funds for your down payment and a preapproval for a mortgage, prep your house for sale and premarket it as ‘Coming Soon.' Then, as soon as you got the house you want under contract, you'd put your current home on the market, and it would sell in a week.'\nAlternatively, if you think your home might take longer to sell, you could list it for sale with a contingency that you find and buy the home of your choice before closing, Suranna said.\nStill, the decision to buy or sell first is almost never simple.\nBUY FIRST: You won't miss out in a tight market. (Video: Laurel Molly, Photo: Laurel Molly for The Washington Post/Laurel Molly)\n'It's important to find out what buyers want and whether it's available in their price range,' Fischer said. 'Then we can look at their property to talk about getting it ready to sell. We can recommend vendors who can estimate the cost to fix it up.'\nArmed with information about the cost and availability of homes, along with an estimate of the value of their own home and how long it might take to sell, homeowners can start to investigate options for financing the move.\nThe bridge loan solution\nSELL FIRST: You will know how much money you have. (Video: Laurel Molly for The Washington Post, Photo: Laurel Molly for The Washington Post/Laurel Molly for The Washington Post)\nWhen you want to sell one home and buy another, it's time to bring in professionals to help you understand your choices, industry experts said.\n'Even if you're not sure what steps you're ready to take, it's important to get educated about your options by a lender, get preapproved for a loan and get a Realtor to talk to you about market conditions,' said Christopher Davis, assistant vice president of business development in real estate lending for Navy Federal Credit Union, which is headquartered in Vienna, Va. 'Lenders have some flexibility at the preapproval stage, so you can find out how much you can borrow if you plan to sell first, and how much you can borrow if you plan to close on the next home before selling your current home.'\nSome borrowers will have to sell the home they own — and eliminate the mortgage payment from their monthly cash flow — before they buy another home with another home loan. But some have options that depend on how much home equity is available, said Gregg Busch, vice president of First Savings Mortgage in McLean, Va.\nAdvertisement\n'A traditional bridge loan is a loan based on the equity in your home and the anticipated equity in the next home,' Busch said. 'Borrowers have to qualify based on their credit and their debt-to-income ratio to pay for their existing mortgage payment, their new mortgage payment and the bridge loan payment. The debt-to-income ratio must be no higher than 43 percent.'\nYour debt-to-income ratio compares the minimum payment on all recurring debt with your gross monthly income. For example, if your gross monthly income is $15,000 and your minimum debt payments amount to $6,000, your debt-to-income ratio is 40 percent.\nCurrent homeowners looking for a new home have to decide which to do first, sell the old home or buy the new one. The decision can be complicated. (Video: Laurel Molly for The Washington Post, Photo: Laurel Molly/Laurel Molly for The Washington Post)\nBridge loans are short-term loans, typically for six months to a year, which are meant to 'bridge' the transition from one home with a mortgage into another home with a mortgage. Borrowers use the proceeds from the loan for the down payment on their new home. Bridge loans typically have higher interest rates than a conventional mortgage, but often the payments are interest-only. You can contact various lenders to compare fees.\nBorrowers usually repay the balance of the bridge loan with proceeds from the sale of their home, but in this current sellers' market, when houses sell fast, many people never make a payment on their bridge loan, Busch said.\n'For borrowers who don't qualify for a traditional bridge loan, we also offer what we call our ‘acquisition bridge loan,' which can be structured more like a line of credit and allows up to a 100 percent debt-to-income ratio,' Busch said. 'With these loans, we're more concerned with the equity being available to pay off the loan when it's due. The interest rate is higher than other loans, but at least 30 to 40 percent of the time no one has to make a payment at all because their house sells.'\nThe main benefit of bridge loans is that home buyers don't have to move twice (first to a short-term rental, then to the new home), which has both financial and emotional costs, Busch said.\nThe low-down-payment option\nBUY FIRST: You won't have to move twice. (Video: Laurel Molly for The Washington Post, Photo: Laurel Molly/Laurel Molly for The Washington Post)\nBuyers who can qualify for both their current mortgage payment and a new mortgage payment may be able to make the transition to their next home with the help of a low-down-payment loan.\n'If we know someone is selling, we can be a little more flexible on the debt-to-income ratio,' Davis said. 'We also have up to 100 percent financing, including our Homebuyer's Choice and Military Choice programs that don't require mortgage insurance. They both have a slightly higher interest rate than the going rate, but that way they don't have to worry about making a big down payment before they sell their house.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nNavy Federal, like some other lenders, offers a special program that they call a No Refi Rate Drop.\n'After six months of payments, if interest rates on the Choice loan programs have dropped, the borrowers can pay just $250, and we will drop their interest rate,' Davis said.\nAdvertisement\nWhile some buyers intend to refinance when mortgage rates decline, another available option may be to 'recast' the loan on your new home after the other home sells. Refinancing converts your loan into a completely new mortgage with a different term, balance and interest rate, but recasting simply recalculates your payments based on a new balance.\nIf you take out a mortgage to buy a new home and then sell your old home at a profit, you can recast the new loan by using that profit to pay down the balance. The rate and term stay the same.\n'You need to notify the lender that you want to recast your loan and write a separate check, then they can calculate the new payment,' Busch said. 'You have to make sure your lender offers recasting if you intend to do this.'\nTypically, the lender will charge a fee of about $500 to recast a loan, he said.\nOther ways to buy before you sell\nSELL FIRST: You can wait for a good deal. (Video: Laurel Molly for The Washington Post, Photo: Laurel Molly for The Washington Post/Laurel Molly for The Washington Post)\nHomeowners who have a home equity line of credit (HELOC) in place can borrow against that credit for a down payment and closing costs if they buy a new home before selling the old one, Fischer said. She recommends getting one at least a few months before you plan to sell.\n'HELOCs and home equity loans are meant to be long-term loans and often have penalty fees if you pay them off too early,' Busch said. 'If you're planning to sell, you may not qualify for one.'\nMove-up buyers — looking to purchase a more expensive home — may want to borrow from their 401(k) for the down payment and then repay it as soon as they sell their current home, Fischer suggested.\nSome move-up buyers can borrow from their parents or take out a 'margin loan' against their stock portfolio for their down payment, Busch said. They can repay the amount owed as soon as the old home sells, he said.\n'Either way, you still have to qualify for both your current mortgage and the new loan,' Busch said.\nHomeowners with plenty of equity will find it easier to qualify for a special program, like a bridge loan, Suranna said.",

            "summary": "RICHMOND — Democratic leaders and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) remain at loggerheads as Virginia lawmakers return to the state Capitol on Wednesday to take action on the budget and other bills the governor has proposed changing, barreling toward a June 30 deadline to adopt a two-year spending plan or begin shutting down the state government.\nDemocrats have said repeatedly in recent days that they are in no mood to compromise with Youngkin, who welcomed the legislature's budget in March by calling it 'backward' and going on a tour around the state proclaiming how misguided it was. Since the governor unveiled a package of 233 proposed amendments on April 8 that essentially rewrote the spending plan the General Assembly passed with bipartisan support, Democrats who control both chambers of the legislature have reacted angrily.\n'We passed [an] on-time, structurally sound, balanced budget, which is required of us by the constitution,' House Speaker Don L. Scott Jr. (D-Portsmouth) said Tuesday in remarks to a small group of reporters. 'The governor immediately then began to run a campaign against the budget, a full-fledged campaign. … He's not a middle-ground, bipartisan governor. He has been an extreme — I call him MAGA-in-disguise — governor.'\nAdvertisement\nOn Tuesday, Scott debuted a sharp message of his own with an ad on social media, touting elements of the General Assembly's budget and urging residents not to 'let Pretending Glenn shut down the government.' Scott said his message was different from Youngkin's because it was aimed at setting the record straight about what the legislature's budget would deliver for the state.\na sharp message of his own with an ad on social media, touting elements of the General Assembly's budget and urging residents not to 'let Pretending Glenn shut down the government.' Scott said his message was different from Youngkin's because it was aimed at setting the record straight about what the legislature's budget would deliver for the state.\nA spokesman for Youngkin declined to comment on the ad or Scott's remarks.\nThe most likely outcome Wednesday, according to interviews with several lawmakers on both sides of the aisle: Democrats reject all of Youngkin's major proposals and send their budget back to him. He then could become the first governor in modern Virginia history to veto an entire budget. Youngkin would probably call a special legislative session so lawmakers could start all over, racing to get a budget plan finished before the new fiscal year starts July 1. If they failed to find common ground, the government could face a federal-style shutdown.\nIf they failed to find common ground, the government could face a federal-style shutdown.\nAdvertisement\n'It's a position we've never been in before,' state Sen. William M. Stanley Jr. (R-Franklin) said, referring not just to a potential budget veto but the high number of vetoes and amendments the legislature must take up in Wednesday's annual 'reconvened' session. 'This is new territory for us all, and it should be interesting. This place never fails to surprise.'\nIn addition to his proposed budget changes, Youngkin issued a record 153 vetoes — more in one year than the 120 the next most veto-heavy governor, Democrat Terry McAuliffe, issued in his entire four-year term. Democrats said over the past few days that they probably don't have enough Republican support to muster the two-thirds majorities needed to override those vetoes, which included legislation to create a legal market for recreational marijuana, raise the minimum wage, and prevent other states where abortion is illegal from extraditing someone who has or performs the procedure legally in Virginia.\n120 the next most veto-heavy governor, Democrat Terry McAuliffe, issued in his entire four-year term.

He proposed eliminating the Assembly's plan to expand the sales tax to digital downloads — an idea that Youngkin initially proposed — and in return offered to retreat from his own insistence on tax cuts, which were dead anyway because lawmakers left them out of the budget.\nAdvertisement\nHe also said he would accept the legislature's plan to increase spending in several key areas, including providing 3 percent pay raises in each of the next two years for public school teachers and state employees, increasing funding for higher education and boosting the state's contribution to the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority, though at a lower level than the General Assembly approved. Youngkin argued that Virginia can afford those expenditures without raising taxes.\nAs if to underscore that point, the administration released a monthly revenue estimate Tuesday evening that showed tax collections up and the state surging toward a surplus of funds. As of March, state coffers are on track for a surplus of more than $1 billion for the year, Youngkin's office said.\nevening that showed tax collections up and the state surging toward a surplus of funds.

His plan for Metro, for instance, boosts the state's contribution by tapping into federal dollars that had been set aside for localities in Northern Virginia — an approach several Democrats said was not acceptable.\nDemocratic leaders who accuse Youngkin of divisive rhetoric and aggressive treatment of their bills see him as punishing them for rejecting his plan to build a $2 billion, publicly financed arena in Alexandria for the Washington Wizards and Capitals. They say they are offended by his attempt to cast wholesale revisions as compromise.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'Nothing says ‘I love you and let's work together' like 153 vetoes, 233 budget amendments and a three-week campaign about how the budget we passed was backwards,' Senate Majority Leader Scott A. Surovell (D-Fairfax) told The Washington Post on Monday.\nAdvertisement\nSurovell characterized Youngkin's amendments as not just aggressive but also as a misreading of his role in government. 'The governor seems to approach governor's amendments as if he's an actual member of the legislature,' he said, noting that Youngkin had essentially rewritten the budget and introduced new concepts to some bills after it was too late to vet them through the 'committee process and take broad input into whether it's good policy or not.'\nOne example: complex legislation to allow slot machine-like 'skill games' in convenience stores that Youngkin drastically rewrote, suggesting amendments that effectively ban the games in many metropolitan areas.\nSome Democrats have fanned the rhetorical flames. In addition to Scott's digital ad, Senate Finance and Appropriations Chairwoman L. Louise Lucas (D-Portsmouth), who often mocks Youngkin on X, last week posted cartoon images of the governor giving up on the arena, which she dubbed the 'Glenn Dome,' and 'tax cuts for the rich.' Lucas is portrayed in boxing gloves, ready to sock it to him.\narena, which she dubbed the 'Glenn Dome,' and 'tax cuts for the rich.' Lucas is portrayed in boxing gloves, ready to sock it to him.\nAdvertisement\n'Buckle Up Glenn- I am coming back to Richmond on Wednesday to deal with your nonsense,' she says.\nFor all the bluster, the legislature is unlikely to muster the supermajorities necessary to override Youngkin's vetoes. Amendments to bills are a bit more complicated.\nIf a simple majority of both chambers approves all amendments on a bill, it becomes law as amended with no further action. If legislators approve some or none of the amendments, the bill goes back to Youngkin with only the amendments they have accepted for him to sign or veto. The governor gets the last word, since the General Assembly does not get another chance to override him.\nBut the legislature can head off a potential veto by taking a second vote on a bill after rejecting some or all of the governor's amendments. A legislator would have to make a motion to enroll the bill as law 'notwithstanding the governor's [anticipated] veto.' If that motion wins a two-thirds vote in both houses, the measure becomes law.\nAdvertisement\nTwo bills that could be ripe for a challenge, according to several legislators: the skill-games bill that the governor rewrote, and a measure that would allow localities to impose a 1 percent local sales tax to fund school construction, a bipartisan bill that Youngkin vetoed.\nBut reconciling the positions staked out by both sides on the budget is going to take more time than is available in Wednesday's session, even if it extends for more than one day, said Stanley, the Republican senator. 'How do you find middle ground? I don't think you find it in the veto session,' he said. 'After the dust settles, we have to have a budget by July 1. I have full confidence that the governor, speaker and Senator Lucas can work it out.'\nWednesday's session, even if it extends for more than one day, said Stanley, the Republican senator.

McDougle (R-Hanover) said he expects that some of Youngkin's budget amendments will pass. 'There are a number of actions the governor took that I think everybody thinks are reasonable and they'll be supported,' he said.\nAdvertisement\nSen. R. Creigh Deeds (D-Charlottesville), a senior member of the Finance and Appropriations Committee, agreed that the legislature will probably accept some of Youngkin's technical amendments to the budget, but he predicted it will reject the substantive ones.

'He'll have to make a choice at that point,' he said.\nIf Youngkin opts to veto the budget, Deeds said, he expects the legislature would quickly go into a special session to pass another budget — probably similar to the one that it just sent to Youngkin. He predicted one change: The new budget might find ways to spend about $100 million freed up by Youngkin's vetoes.\n'It's not going to get any better,' Deeds said of the next spending plan. 'It could get worse from his perspective.'\nThe Virginia Constitution gives the legislature 10 days to take up the governor's vetoes and amendments, but it is rare for the reconvened session to extend beyond one day. Reconvened sessions have been extended to a second day just four times since 1994, according to Senate Clerk Susan Clarke Schaar.

            "summary": "MS. RAMPELL: Hello, and welcome to Washington Post Live. I'm Catherine Rampell, an opinion columnist here at The Washington Post, and I am delighted to welcome two Post contributing columnists today. We have Natasha Sarin, who is a professor at Yale Law School and recently launched The Budget Lab at Yale Law. Most importantly, she is a fellow Broadway theater nerd and often accompanies me to musicals. And then we also have Larry Summers, a former Treasury Secretary and National Economic Council director under a couple of different Democratic administrations. Thank you, Larry and Natasha, for joining me today.\nDR. SUMMERS: Happy to be with you.\nDR. SARIN: Thanks so much for having us.\nMS. RAMPELL: So let's jump right in. Today is the day after Tax Day. I hope everyone out there filed in time or got an extension, as it may be, and we're here to talk a little bit about the future of tax policy and its role in the U.S. economy and U.S. politics.\nAdvertisement\nNatasha, I thought I would start with you. You recently launched The Budget Lab at Yale. I'm wondering if you could tell us a little bit about what that project is and what hole it is trying to fill, what problem you're trying to solve with it.\nDR. SARIN: Yeah. Thanks, Catherine, and thanks to all of you for listening.\nPart of what I got to do when I was in government was be part of some pretty exciting legislative debates about what ultimately became the CHIPS Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Build Back Better, which then became the Inflation Reduction Act. And in the context of all of those debates, what ended up being like a very important element that often drove what policies made it into the legislation and what policies didn't was the score that scorekeepers assigned a particular policy change, and the score is essentially like a cost estimate. It's like over 10 years, either how much revenue is a particular tax change going to generate for the government or how much cost is a particular spending program going to cost.\nAdvertisement\nBut it struck us, me and my co-founders, Danny Yagan, who's an economist at Berkeley, the former chief economist of the OMB, and Martha Gimbel, who was a senior staffer at the CEA in both the Biden administration and in the Obama administration--it struck us that for a lot of policies that we would like to see ultimately legislated, things like a more generous child tax credit, the right way to evaluate them wasn't a 10-year cost estimate, because when you invest in kids, it takes a long time for those investments to pay off.\nAnd so part of what we're trying to do with The Budget Lab is develop the infrastructure to create a more holistic analysis of both the costs and benefits of different types of policy changes.\nMS. RAMPELL: Larry, when you were in government, did you see the need for something like this? How did the existing scoring process that Natasha just laid out affect or constrain the kinds of policies you would recommend or that were feasible?\nAdvertisement\nDR. SUMMERS: Look, if you're a business, you don't get to make an investment project without bringing to your board the costs and benefits of the project, what it's going to cost, what subsequent cash flows are going to be, what its impact on your strategy is going to be in a comprehensive way.\nWe've been making progress in the economics profession at bringing that kind of thinking to the public sector, but we've got a long way to go. People on the right side of the political spectrum, the conservative side of the political spectrum, have been working to incorporate ideas like that if you cut taxes, maybe, possibly, there will be more entrepreneurship into scoring for a long time. But we've never had any ways of recognizing that if you educate kids, you're less likely to need to imprison them, that if you give people preventive healthcare, you're less likely to have to give them heart transplants down the road, that if you invest money in the IRS, the IRS will collect money--collect more money and you won't have to raise taxes.\nSo there's been a big gap, and it's always the case. If you go back to the whole idea of GDP figures, academics in universities were doing them, and then once the concept was proved out, the government started doing it as a routine thing.\nAdvertisement\nAnd that's why what Natasha's doing here is so hugely important. It's both going to inform current debate, and it's going to establish procedures and practices that will ultimately come to be incorporated in the standard work of government. So this is social science's version of laboratory science, where the abstract science of today becomes the drug treatments of tomorrow.\nMS. RAMPELL: So, Natasha, there are, to be fair, a few of these alternative scoring outfits, some of them politically aligned with certain groups, some of them also trying to be neutral arbiters akin to the CBO, but obviously separate from the CBO. I'm wondering what you make of that. I mean, my fear is that there's a risk of sort of undermining the CBO as--the Congressional Budget Office, for those listening--as a neutral arbiter, you know, that there is the risk of sort of emboldening those who want to fight with the rap, which does happen, right? Like, when there is an inconvenience score for a health care bill showing that it will cause a lot of people to lose health insurance, or when there's an inconvenience score for a bill that costs a lot of money, how do you maintain the usefulness of the Congressional Budget Office as a neutral arbiter while still doing this sort of supplemental or alternative kind of analysis that you are working on?\nDR. SARIN: Yeah. And I want to say sort of explicitly that CBO and the Joint Tax Committee and also their sort of counterparts within the executive branch, the Office of Tax Analysis at Treasury, and the Office of Management and Budget folks within the White House, they do kind of like yeoman's work trying to produce these cost estimates. And it's not easy to do. It's in time-constrained ways.\nAdvertisement\nUltimately, the reason that they're not doing this sort of cost-benefit analysis that Larry laid out that maybe corporate executives do is because that's not their remit. They've been tasked with something very particular, and I've been really interested, sort of, of recent in kind of the origins of scorekeeping and how it arose over the course of the last several decades. And it was in response to concerns about short-term deficits and budget rules and the rules that govern processes like reconciliation, which require them to derive these, like, very precise short-run cost estimates.\nI think sort of what Danny and Martha and I bring to the table with respect to this particular sense of, like--I would think about it more as supplemental than as alternative types of analysis--is we're trying to do a translation exercise that I think is pretty important.\nIn the economics profession--and Danny and I are both economists who spend time in our sort of academic lives working on exactly these questions. In the economics profession, there's been a ton of interest in applied work that is able to trace out over the long run, over the medium term, what particular policy interventions are delivering in terms of benefits. If you invest in health care, if you invest in emissions reduction, what are you actually seeing over time?\nAdvertisement\nThe challenge is that there hasn't been much of a translation effort to make that type of information particularly useful or particularly well suited for policy analysis by policymakers, and I think that that kind of translation is a very useful role to play. But it has to be, Catherine, as you described in sort of a central focus of our work, is that it's scientific in its concerns. And it's very much focused on sort of being on the level with respect to not putting a thumb on the scale with particular choices or particular assumptions that we're making, and in fact, we're elucidating all of our choices and our assumptions and all of our models. They're open source. This is about democratizing and innovating on the budget process, and that means allowing people to make their own choices with respect to what they think some of these elasticities are or what the evidence tells us.\nMS. RAMPELL: So--\nDR. SUMMERS: Catherine, Natasha was--\nAdvertisement\nMS. RAMPELL: Oh. Yeah, go on, Larry.\nDR. SUMMERS: Natasha was my student. So I'm going to brag on her a bit by saying three things. First, there wasn't always a Congressional Budget Office. The reason we have one was that Alice Rivlin started doing work estimating the long-term costs of programs at the Brookings Institution, and then it took hold in government. Natasha is taking that work and is today's Alice Rivlin, carrying this kind of thing to a next level and the next approach by building in all the feedback effects.\nAnd second, I understand the argument you made. It's the argument that the NFL referees made when video replay got invented, but ultimately, people decided that with video replay, refs got better. And there got to be more confidence, not less confidence, in the integrity of football.\nAdvertisement\nAnd the last thing I'd say is I was in on some of the planning meetings for all of this. I've got the honor of being one of the advisors to this project, and something Natasha absolutely insisted on was that this project could only happen if there were people who had served prominently in both Democratic and Republican administrations who would have roles as advisors and fiduciaries of the project.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBut so you're right to worry about what you're worried about, frankly, Natasha has been all over it.\nMS. RAMPELL: Okay, fair enough, Larry.\nAnd actually, the reason why I'm delving into--why we are all delving into these nuts and bolts of how you evaluate policies and what criteria you use to determine their cost, for example, is that we are going to have a major overhaul of the U.S. Tax Code next year. As I'm sure viewers out there know, a large portion of the Trump era tax cuts are expiring, and there's going to be a bit of a free-for-all, I guess I would say, for what replaces it, what gets extended, what new tax breaks go in or come out. And I'm curious, Larry. What is your best prediction of how much of that set of tax cut extensions is likely to happen, A, and be paid for, B?\nDR. SUMMERS: Depends on what happens in the election. The Trump tax cuts will do very differently if Donald Trump is president of the United States, God forbid, than if he isn't.\nBut I can tell you some things I'm pretty sure of. I'm pretty sure that it was a dumb idea to cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent when the Business Roundtable's idea was that it should only be cut to 25 percent. I'm pretty sure that some of the tax cuts that took the form of subsidies to companies that are making huge money, but somehow never show any reported U.S. profits--I'm pretty sure that those tax cuts are mistakes. So my guess is that there will be some of it that is extended. I hope that a lot of that will be paid for.\nLook, on net, we need to be raising taxes in the United States of America. Nobody wants to say it. Nobody who's looking to be in office will say it. But what does the government do? It takes care of old people. There are going to be vastly more old people in the future than in the past. It buys services like health care and education. They go up much more rapidly than the prices of television sets or shirts. It keeps our national--it keeps our nation secure. Defense spending is going up fast. So we need to be raising taxes, not just to cover for any new tax cuts, but also to hold off the huge accumulation of debt that we are suffering.\nIf your viewers take only one thing away from this show, I hope it's this idea.\nMS. RAMPELL: So, Nastha--\nDR. SUMMERS: Borrowing money and running a budget deficit is not an alternative to raising taxes or cutting spending. It's a way of deferring doing those things and making them harder.\nMS. RAMPELL: So, Natasha, Larry just sort of picked on some Republican proposals, cutting the corporate tax, other kinds of measures that limit our ability to raise revenue. To be fair, President Biden has also pledged not to raise taxes on the bottom 90 percent of Americans, those making $400,000 or less, which does also limit our ability to both levy new kinds of taxes but also raise revenue in general. Do you think in retrospect that pledge was a mistake?\nDR. SARIN: I guess what I'd say, Catherine, is that I've heard versions of this comparison between Republicans--44 sitting Republican senators and over 200 members of Congress have signed a pledge that says no new taxes ever. And Democrats, where you see coming out of the Biden administration, $5 trillion of revenue raisers from this most recent Green Book.\nAnd, like, I take the point very deeply that the universe that we're talking about with respect to these tax increases, it's much of what Larry described on the corporate side and also making sure that we are aligned with respect to our commitment to minimum tax rate on multinationals, no matter where they profit and no matter where they decide to book income.\nAnd on the individual side, it's very focused on things like raising the capital gains tax rate for the highest earners, things like--and hopefully, we'll get a chance to talk about it--making sure we're able to invest in the IRS to be able to collect taxes from those at the very top of the distribution. And so it strikes me as like a totally reasonable premise to have the view that as you start to deliver the tax increases that Larry is totally accurate in describing that we desperately need, given our fiscal situation, the place to start is with wealthy corporations and those at the very top of the distribution who have the greatest ability to pay. And so, in that sense, I have a lot of sort of deep empathy for various versions of what's come out of the Biden administration over the course of the last several months, and I would hope to see much of it legislated.\nI will also say that something that I'm worried about that Larry started to describe is that the contours of the 2025 debate are going to be set by what is expiring. So, like, the debate's going to be like how much of the expiring provisions do we actually let expire versus how many of them do we decide to keep, and depending on where you are in the political spectrum, you have different views on the answer to that question.\nI worry that we're not going to embrace the importance of using this as a real moment to think seriously about deficit reduction because we are in a fiscal situation where, to Larry's point, we're no longer--we're currently no longer sustainable, but our unsustainability is only going to grow over time because of demographic pressures and other pressures on greater spending needs that the country's going to face over the years to come.\nMS. RAMPELL: Larry, what do you think of the kinds of revenue-raising tax proposals that have come out of this administration? So I'm thinking things like some significant changes to the capital gains tax or a billionaire minimum tax. What do you make of those kinds of ideas, and could you talk through what some of them are for our audience?\nDR. SUMMERS: The spirit and general direction is right. Many of the specifics are right. It's nuts that people who made more than $10 million a year don't even get noticed when they don't file a tax return because of insufficiency with the IRS. It's nuts how easy it is for an entrepreneur to earn huge sums, start a company that's worth $20 billion, borrow money against that company to buy that--against that stock to buy a yacht, bequeath that stock to his kids, and nobody ever pays any taxes anywhere along the road. And the Biden administration's doing the right thing by trying to close that. It's crazy how easy it still is for companies to put their money in the Cayman Islands, and the Biden administration's on the right side of that.\nBut even great, dedicated, thoughtful people sometimes go to places they probably shouldn't venture, and I think the ideas that are in the Biden budget under the label \"billionaires tax\" about taxing people whose stocks have gone up in value but who actually haven't gotten any money because they haven't sold the stock and they haven't borrowed against the stock, I think that's a plan that may destroy too many family businesses, it doesn't correspond to most people's idea of fairness. And I actually think that's--sorry to say it--a place where academic thinking wasn't stopped by adults. So I don't support that particular line of thought. But the general direction and general impulse, I think is very much a right and proper one.\nMS. RAMPELL: We actually have a question from an audience member. Suzanne Bartholomae from Iowa asks, how can tax policy be used to reduce wealth inequality? Which I think is related to all of the things we're talking about. It's not just some of the objectives of tax policy or not only about raising revenue. There are equity concerns presumably. Natasha, do you want to try to tackle that? How can tax policy be used to reduce wealth inequality?\nDR. SARIN: Yeah. It's kind of a big question and it has like several answers, I would say, and one of the precepts driving some of the reform proposals that Larry and I have made in the past and that Kim Clausing and I made in a piece that we wrote ahead of the 2025 debate were exactly oriented around, like, how do you get more equity in the tax code?\nAnd I think there are several levers, but I'll just say three. One is that currently in this country, we have like a two-tiered tax system, because if you're a wage earner who, you know, has W-2 income, your tax liabilities are automatically withheld. So your tax compliance yesterday on Tax Day was 100 percent mechanically.\nIf you're someone who earns income in opaque ways, which is disproportionately people at the very top of the distribution, you have the option kind of to decide whether or not you want to fulfill your civic duty.\nAnd so from an equity perspective, from a revenue-raising perspective, there's a ton of money there because it turns out that 3 percent of GDP on an annualized basis, that's about $700 billion a year that's owed to the IRS is uncollected. But from an equity perspective, making sure that the same set of rules apply no matter how you earn your income or no matter where you are in the wealth distribution strikes us as like super first order.\nI also think that much of what Larry is describing with respect to sort of the general ethos of not living in a society where if you happen to be handed assets from your family or happen to be handed shares of a profitable business that your family has started and you are using, ultimately deploying those assets in your own lifetime, but there's no taxes that are ever assessed because of the nature of how we have a step up in basis upon the transfer of those particular assets, that's like fundamentally unfair. And it creates sort of inequities that persist across generations, because it's not just inequities that are in society today. It actually allows people to build up dynastic wealth in ways that ultimately no tax revenue is ever borne from. So that also has to be first order, not just from a revenue-raising perspective, but also from the perspective of equity.\nAnd last thing I'll say is that, currently, if you have--the current nature of our tax system is such that if you're a large multinational that has at your disposal, the tools and the tax planners that can help you figure out where you want to locate profits in order to minimize your tax liability, that's sort of available to you in a way it's not available to companies that are domiciled in the United States exclusively or small companies. And that's another layer of inequity. It's different types of tax treatment depending on what type of corporation you are or how you organize yourself.\nThe same thing is true with respect to partnerships. They get to organize themselves in ways that the rest of us aren't able to and are able to take advantage of tax opportunity or lowering their tax liabilities and tax loopholes that allow them access to preferential treatment.\nAll of these rules need to be changed, not just because we're going to raise a lot of money to meet our pressing revenue needs, but also because we're going to create a more equal society.\nMS. RAMPELL: So that's a great segue into another big topic that I wanted to make sure we got to, which is the enormous investment in the Internal Revenue Service that came as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act that passed a couple of years ago. Larry, I know you have been on record as supporting the $80 billion invested in the IRS. So has Natasha. So have I, frankly. How do you think that money has been spent--or how well do you think it's been spent to date? What in your view has the agency done well? What gives you pause, if anything?\nDR. SUMMERS: I'd give the IRS so far on its expenditure of that money an incomplete. There are some very promising plans, and they've done some good things, but I don't think we really yet know just how effective it is going to be. There is enormous potential in this area.\nMy hope would be that the IRS can stay focused. Natasha and I are generally in agreement, but a place where I don't agree with Natasha and don't agree with the IRS is this idea that they should be working hard to develop a system to help fill out the tax returns of middle-income people and lower-income people. Let TurboTax do that. They already do it and largely give it away free or at very low cost, and until the IRS has figured out how to audit the rich people who are paying in returns, tax the people who are using abusive tax shelters, answer the phone consistently, I think they need to avoid mission creep.\nAnd I think the Biden administration has not been good about avoiding mission creep, which is an important part of keeping the IRS focused on collecting the taxes that are owed and providing decent, reasonable, legitimate service to taxpayers with questions or taxpayers who want to file.\nBut overall, the main problem with the $80 billion is that it's not $120 billion because there's enormous potential to absorb resources in collecting more.\nMS. RAMPELL: Natasha, I want to make sure--we only have a couple minutes left--that I wanted to make sure that you got a chance to respond to that. What role do you think the IRS should be playing in terms of facilitating Americans' ability to file their taxes?\nDR. SARIN: You know--and Larry is right. This is an area in which we disagree. The average American spends 12 hours and $200 filing their taxes. In countries like Australia and Sweden, you fulfill your tax obligations by saying yes to a text message that you receive, and so I think it is sort of first order for the IRS as they think about enforcement efforts, think about high-end enforcement efforts. Larry and I, like, are very much aligned that that needs to be a focus.\nBut thinking about how to better serve the American people through investments in programs like Direct File, which again, this was a pilot program, it sort of started late in filing season. It started in March, but 100,000 taxpayers were able to fulfill their tax obligations directly with the IRS, able to get assistance with respect to tax questions directly from the agency.\nWork that I did and we put out in The Budget Lab last week suggests that the IRS today has the information that it needs to pre-fill 40 percent of American taxpayers' tax returns. That type of decrease in tax burden would be huge and meaningful for the American people, and it's within reach.\nThe thing that I'm worried about--Larry's worried it's 80, not 120. I'm worried that the 80 has actually become 60. And as you go forth in this political process where ultimately the IRS is subject to a whole host of criticisms that are deeply unfair and sort of standard fare, I guess, in our political discourse, you're going to see these investments decrease, not increase. And I think it really needs to be first order for policymakers to realize that when they make those choices to defund the agency, they're making choices to decrease the equity of our Tax Code, but they're also making choices to hurt their constituents with respect to the types of services they're able to receive.\nMS. RAMPELL: Well, on that note, I think we can all look forward to the IRS or maybe AI doing our taxes for us at some point in the future. But unfortunately for today, we are out of time. So we will have to leave it there. Thank you so much for joining us, Natasha Sarin and Larry Summers. Appreciate it.\nDR. SARIN: Thanks, Catherine.\nMS.

Lots of customers, streaming into his marijuana retail storefront like shoppers on Black Friday.\nBut this year, Newsome is keeping it low-key at MetroLeaf, his shop in the Petworth area of Northwest D.C., saving the money that would typically go to festivities for a more practical use: licensing.\nNow, after years of illegal weed on D.C. streets during the War on Drugs and growing pains with a limited medical marijuana market, for Newsome it was finally within grasp: a fully legitimate dispensary licensed by the D.C. government — not a licensed clothing store that also gifts people marijuana, as his shop operates now.\nfor Newsome it was finally within grasp: a fully legitimate dispensary licensed by the D.C. government — not a licensed clothing store that also gifts people marijuana, as his shop operates now.\nMetroLeaf is one of the dozens of 'gifting' shops that has applied to become a licensed medical marijuana dispensary since last fall. The transition, playing out quietly in shops across D.C., marks the beginning of a seismic shift in D.C.'s marijuana landscape, which has for years been handicapped by restrictions passed in Congress that prohibit a true commercial market for recreational pot. That prohibition led to the proliferation of the 'gifting' market, in which businesses sell posters, T-shirts or knickknacks — and give customers marijuana as a gift.\nAdvertisement\n'We're like right at the finish line for the license,' Newsome said on a slow Thursday evening, just after a welder he hired to help with renovations left, in preparation for a D.C. inspector's visit. Newsome couldn't wait to do away with those 'gifts' — tired of placing orders for T-shirts and socks he had no interest in selling. 'If you talk to any of my employees, they'll tell you: I hate this, what we're doing now,' he said.\nfor a D.C. inspector's visit. Newsome couldn't wait to do away with those 'gifts' — tired of placing orders for T-shirts and socks he had no interest in selling. 'If you talk to any of my employees, they'll tell you: I hate this, what we're doing now,' he said.\nThe new law, enacted last spring with a long ramp-up period, aims to eliminate the gifting market and bring all marijuana shops into the much more regulated medical cannabis framework. It also reserves 50 percent of all new medical cannabis business licenses for 'social equity applicants,' including the disproportionately Black D.C. residents who were formerly incarcerated or impacted by the War on Drugs. That includes Newsome, who was arrested on a marijuana charge in 1999, losing his job.\nOf D.C.'s more than 200 I-71 gifting shops — named after the initiative that legalized marijuana in D.C. — 76 have applied for a medical marijuana license from the Alcoholic Beverage and Cannabis Administration since last November, according to ABCA. Others are seeking to transition into other sectors of the industry, such as cultivation. Starting this month, after the D.C. Council passed an additional enforcement law, ABCA began ramping up its inspections, searching for marijuana businesses that failed to comply with the new rules and threatening to shut them down if they do not intend to apply as a medical cannabis business.\n— named after the initiative that legalized marijuana in D.C. — 76 have applied for a medical marijuana license from the Alcoholic Beverage and Cannabis Administration since last November, according to ABCA.

Some parents have protested cannabis shops who have applied for a license near charter schools. Others have fears about how the dense, 68-square-mile District will handle cultivating enough marijuana to service dozens more shops, compared with just seven medical marijuana dispensaries that were licensed in D.C. before the transition.\nBut, broadly, those in the marijuana gray market have welcomed the new regulations, even the enforcement.\n'People who are trying to do it right, we have to have some survival,' said Terrence White, who runs Monko — a high-end shop resembling a luxury boutique in Mount Vernon Triangle — and chairs the I-71 Committee, which advocates for D.C.'s marijuana entrepreneurs.\nThe District's marijuana 'gifting' market was borne almost entirely out of the congressional handcuffs Republicans slapped on D.C. following the vote to legalize the drug in 2014. That gray market for years rankled lawmakers, who at times sought to crack down harder on it, drawing outcry from the entrepreneurs, including White. 'These stores are considered safe for a lot of people versus going on the streets and getting robbed,' he said.\nfollowing the vote to legalize the drug in 2014.

'These stores are considered safe for a lot of people versus going on the streets and getting robbed,' he said.\nAdvertisement\nBut the new law created a new workaround: expanding medical marijuana access, which is exempt from the congressional prohibition. Under the law, people interested in purchasing medical cannabis only need to self-certify they need it for health reasons, which they can do at the shop. Meanwhile, the gifting shops would have to transition to and comply with all the regulations of the medical cannabis world, which lawmakers argued makes it safer as well.\nWhite said he advocated particularly hard for the social-equity aspect of the licensing process. 'The War on Drugs affected my community more than any other community,' said White, a social-equity applicant who served time for mail fraud. 'If given the opportunity, the recidivism rate drops.'\nBut White said the advocacy was far from over. After Maryland legalized recreational marijuana, White said business at Monko dropped 11 percent, cranking up the competition while Congress still creates barriers for D.C. 'Just because you get a license and your social equity, you still have an uphill battle,' he said.\nWhite said business at Monko dropped 11 percent, cranking up the competition while Congress still creates barriers for D.C. 'Just because you get a license and your social equity, you still have an uphill battle,' he said.\nA spokeswoman for ABCA said the agency is still in the process of reviewing all of the applications from unlicensed operators and could not provide a count on how many had been approved and rejected, or how many were social-equity applicants, since those applications are ongoing. So far, ABCA has issued 18 warnings to unlicensed cannabis businesses that did not apply for a license.\nAdvertisement\nOne of the businesses that received one was flowerz on Capitol Hill, which befuddled its owners, Chad Frey and Kaitlin Murphy: They say they only sell hemp-derived products and have nothing to do with the marijuana 'gifting' shop model. Federal legislation in 2018 legalized interstate sales of hemp. Last week, they said, ABCA inspectors and D.C. police surprised them with an inspection, closing down the shop and seizing products for testing. 'They're looping us in with these unlicensed shops,' Murphy said, adding that while they intend to comply with ABCA's directives, they are now lobbying for an exemption for hemp shops under D.C. law.\nJohn McGowan and Meredith Kinner, attorneys representing many D.C. cannabis businesses, said flowerz's predicament illustrates some of the challenges of the drastic and rapid expansion in the regulated marijuana industry. They said ABCA has been 'pleasant to work with,' and has a committed director, Fred Moosally, who wants the new medical cannabis program to succeed. 'But they're largely building the plane as they fly it,' Kinner said. 'I don't fault ABCA — they were given a pretty big pile of dog doo to figure out.'\nmany D.C. cannabis businesses, said flowerz's predicament illustrates some of the challenges of the drastic and rapid expansion in the regulated marijuana industry.

'I don't fault ABCA — they were given a pretty big pile of dog doo to figure out.'\nMedical marijuana sales have been up and running in D.C. since 2013 — but have 'never been expanded to this capacity,' McGowan said. 'It's crazy. You go from under 10 licensed retailers to 76 on the ABCA list that applied — that's crazy expansion for this market.'\nAdvertisement\nSome of the hurdles for shops that want a medical marijuana license include that they can't be within 400 feet of each other, requiring a number of them to move, and can't be within 300 feet of a school — unless the school is in a commercially or industrially zoned area. The school proximity rules — the most lax in the nation — have caused some friction. One of the attorneys' clients, the owner of DC Smoke, decided to relocate his H Street shop because it was too close to another weed shop. The new proposed location is in Penn Quarter — less than 300 feet from BASIS DC charter school. Parents recently protested the proposed license at a six-hour Advisory Neighborhood Commission meeting, and now DC Smoke is awaiting its fate.\nDC charter school. Parents recently protested the proposed license at a six-hour Advisory Neighborhood Commission meeting, and now DC Smoke is awaiting its fate.\nEarlier this month, Green Theory — run by married couple Caroline and Jonathan Crandall, and partner Ian Tsang — said they became the first D.C. gifting shop to complete the transition to legal medical retail sales. But it was not without a fight from parents whose kids attend nearby schools.\nIn the exclusive Palisades neighborhood of Northwest Washington — more known for million-dollar views of the Potomac River than weed shops — the cannabis retailer is nestled on a modest retail strip below a consignment shop and above a Taiwanese restaurant. Here, after being admitted to a small lobby by a security guard and having identification scanned, D.C. residents 21 years and older can self-certify that they are using cannabis products for medical purposes — then immediately buy some.\n'The fact that we are bringing cannabis into a regulated market makes it harder for any children or anybody that doesn't meet the requirements to actually get their hands on cannabis,' Jonathan Crandall said. 'We are trying to make things safer and less accessible.'\nAdvertisement\nStill, some residents of the Palisades have pushed back.\nThough the Advisory Neighborhood Commission voted to approve Green Theory's application 6-1, the shop came into the crosshairs of 1000 Feet — a 'coalition of educational, child health and parent groups across Washington D.C. fighting to keep schools and day-care centers a safe distance away from the sale of marijuana,' according to its website. A petition circulated by the group that garnered about 600 signatures noted that Green Theory is near three schools.\nJackie Puente of 1000 Feet said her children attend Our Lady of Victory — a pre-K through eighth grade school 319 feet from Green Theory. Though supportive of the cannabis industry in general, Puente criticized D.C.'s licensing process, saying it deliberately excludes the community.\nAdvertisement\n'There's zero regard for those who say, ‘Not next to our children's school,'' Puente said, adding: 'This is happening all over the city.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nCaroline Crandall said she respected the concerns of a 'vocal minority.' However, Green Theory wasn't going anywhere. 'This is a retail-zoned location,' she said. 'We do have the right to be here.'\nNewsome, the chief operating officer at MetroLeaf, said that since he and his business partners relocated their shop to 14th Street late last year, they've sought to create an image as a valued neighbor. Newsome enforces a strict no-loitering policy, even for employees on a break. And no smoking outside the shop, 'not even a cigarette,' he said.\nWith the official medical marijuana license hopefully on its way, he said he wants the shop to feel like a wellness hub. It's the whole reason he said he was drawn to marijuana to begin with, having previously served as general manager at Takoma Wellness Center, one of the few licensed medical cannabis shops. Now, he said, it felt like he was finally on the brink of arriving where he wanted to be.",

            "summary": "What does it mean to be a modern prince?\nIf you follow the British royal family, it means a heir and a spare, locked in a spiral of history, melodrama and betrayal. If you watch Hallmark movies, princes are invariably handsome but restive kings-in-waiting who find true love with scrappy American commoners.\nAnd then there's Denmark's Prince Joachim, who moved to Washington D.C. last summer. The prince, 54, is the son of Queen Margrethe II and the younger brother of King Frederik X, who was crowned in January when their mother abdicated after 52 years on the throne. Joachim is a working royal, a military defense expert, a husband, father, and a racecar aficionado. His job, and it is a job, is to represent Europe's oldest monarchy and carry it into the future.\nis a job, is to represent Europe's oldest monarchy and carry it into the future.\n'You reach back in time — in the Danish case, more than a thousand years,' he said last month. 'And you are — it may sound odd to say — the living legacy of that national identity.'\nAdvertisement\nSkip to end of carousel\nThe Style section\nThe Style section Style is where The Washington Post covers happenings on the front lines of culture and what it all means, including the arts, media, social trends, politics and yes, fashion, all told with personality and deep reporting.

The nation's capital plays hosts to royals from all over the world — usually when they are students — thanks to a huge international community and the anonymity it affords those born into these dynasties, This is his best shot at a drama-free life away from royal reporters who obsess over the comings and goings of even minor European nobles.\nAnd yes, the Danish royals have had their share of family drama. The queen made international headlines two years ago when she stripped Joachim's four children of their royal titles — a surprise, seemingly random move that is still a touchy subject. Then she shocked the country this past New Year's Eve when she announced she would abdicate; in a low-key ceremony, Frederik became king just two weeks later, leaving the two brothers to navigate a new, more formal relationship.\nSo it's a good time for a fresh start, a chance for Prince Joachim (pronounced Yo-ahh-cheem ) and his family to have some fun away from the spotlight. He's come to the United States to serve as defense attaché for the Danish embassy — working with the Pentagon and other NATO allies — and, in a broader sense, teach Americans about Denmark. (Was Hamlet a real prince of Denmark? Sorry, no.)\nYo-ahh-cheem) and his family to have some fun away from the spotlight. He's come to the United States to serve as defense attaché for the Danish embassy — working with the Pentagon and other NATO allies — and, in a broader sense, teach Americans about Denmark. (Was Hamlet a real prince of Denmark? Sorry, no.)\nAnd so the prince and his wife, Princess Marie, have agreed to sit for a rare interview at the Danish ambassador's residence. He's tall and lanky with almost perfect English; his wife, a French native, is petite and elegant and also fluent in English, thanks to a stint in New York years two decades ago. He's in a suit; she's in a pink blazer. No pomp, no circumstance, no flash.\nHis brother, just a year older, was destined to be king. But the role of a second royal son is always a balancing act: It comes with a title, expectations and an income but no real job description. It's the ultimate choose your own adventure. By the time he was eight years old, Joachim thought he would be a gentleman farmer, a profession he studied and pursued with mixed success: He was, he joked, very good at 'the gentleman part.'\nAdvertisement\nInstead, he found his calling in the Danish military. After completing his education (he speaks Danish, French, English and German), he enrolled in the reserves while also a working royal. Five years ago, he was invited to enroll in the elite École Militaire in Paris — a year-long program for officers and defense experts — then he was named a Danish brigadier general and a military attaché at the embassy in France. Last year, the palace announced he would be moving to Washington, where he would also focus on defense.\n'It's about defense industrial cooperation,' he explained. 'My main task here to pave the way — boost, help, inspire — for Danish defense industries, large and small, to enter the U.S.: Either provide or sub-supply, get into that big chain of regenerating and resupplying our armed forces.' In short: One of the thousands of diplomats in this town (who happens to be a member of the royal family).\nRufus Gifford, who became a celebrity in Denmark during his years as the American ambassador, got to know the royal family well. 'Joachim has been such a force for good in that he has always understood his role.' Here's a prince, he said, developing the relationship between the United States and Denmark as a NATO ally, taking on a serious and sensitive responsibility instead of coasting on his title. 'For him to keep his head down and do this work and be a fantastic representative of the country is something I think is extremely admirable.'\nAdvertisement\nAside from crown princes and princesses — whose career path was decided at birth — other royals have to find a role beyond the occasional state appearances. Most opt for nonpolitical jobs: Norway's Princess Märtha Louise stopped using her title professionally after criticism she was exploiting it for business purposes; Prince Philippos of Greece works in New York finance; Willem-Alexander, king of the Netherlands, flew as a KLM pilot for years.\nJoachim had the freedom to choose a profession, and that was doubly true in his personal life. The Danes are pretty open-mined when it comes to the royals, who are allowed to marry for love instead of bloodlines. King Frederik famously met his Australian wife, now Queen Mary, at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and married her four years later. In 1995, Joachim married a Hong-Kong marketing executive and had two sons, Nikolai, 24, and Felix, 21. The couple divorced ten years later. In 2008, he married Marie Cavallier, a French marketing and advertising executive; they have two children: Henrik, 14, and Athena, 12.\nAs Kate and Meghan know all too well, marrying into royalty isn't the fairy tale one might assume, even though you can become an actual princess. You fall in a love with a person; you marry a country.\n'I had high expectations,' said Princess Marie. 'I wanted to speak Danish perfectly. I wanted people to be proud of me. I wanted to fit in. So I think I put a lot of pressure on myself. But Denmark is actually an easy country to live in. Why? Because people respect each other a lot. I don't feel it's there's a lot of conflicts. Things work well.'\nThe Danes seem to enjoy their monarchy, which goes back to the 10th-century Vikings. They love the former queen and love her family.\nAdvertisement\n'The Danish monarchy very much is leading the way as it relates to what it means to be a modern royal family,' said Gifford. Their agenda includes climate change, trade, technology, what he calls 'next generation issues.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe Danish are also very good at be royal without being snobs. 'Denmark is the least hierarchical society that I've ever lived in, for sure,' he explained. 'And yet the royal family is the definition of a hierarchy.' The pomp and circumstance is balanced by the things that connect them to average, ordinary people: road races, biking, sitting in the cold or rain (it rains a lot ) without complaining.\nlot) without complaining.\n'Danes like having a king or queen,' said Paol Pederson, a member of the Danish Club of Washington. 'It lends a calmness and stability to the view of Denmark.' Pederson was raised there — he remembers going to the Copenhagen as a child to see the royals in person — and has met the queen three times. Danish politicians actually run the country, Pedersen pointed out, and it is the royals who preserve the traditions and history. 'But they are expected to work for a living.'\nAdvertisement\nThe elephant in the throne room is the question of money. In most constitutional monarchies, the royal families are supported by taxpayers who are increasingly vocal about what they're getting. The British royals, already personally very rich, receive more than $100 million in public funds per year. To counter criticism, many of the smaller monarchies in Europe have downsized over the past few years, limiting the amount and number of people who receive anything from the public dole.\nIn 2016, the queen reduced the number of working royals who receive an annuity from the government to just her household, the crown prince (now king), her sister Princess Benedikte, and her younger son. She also stipulated that Frederik's oldest son, Christian, would be the only grandchild to receive an annuity as an adult; the other royal grandchildren are expected to work in paying jobs as adults.\nThe royal budget is public information: The 2023 financial report lists a total of $13 million in public funds; as a full-time working royal; Prince Joachim receives about $575,000 a year.\nAdvertisement\n'There are some who say that if you look at it in a tribal way, everybody has to contribute, right?' said the prince. 'And what you contribute is what you will be measured by. That means thanked for or blamed for.'\nMoney is one thing; titles are another. In 2022, the royal family found itself in a rare and public drama after the queen announced Joachim's four children would no longer be called royal highnesses and downsized them to 'excellencies' although they retain their respective places in the line of succession. They were prince and princess when they were born; they would now be know as the counts and countess of Monpezat (their grandfather's family title). The queen explained that she felt this was necessary for the future of the monarchy and the children would be better able to shape their lives without the formal affiliation to the Royal House. (King Frederik's four young children are still princes and princesses.) The queen's decision echoed Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf, who in 2019 demoted five grandchildren who were not in direct line for the throne.\n'I always feel great love for my entire family,' the queen said in her December 2022 New Year's Eve address to the nation. 'Difficulties and misunderstandings may arise in any family, also in mine. The whole country has witnessed that. That the relationship with Prince Joachim and Princess Marie has run into difficulties makes me sad. We have now had a quieter period and time for reflection, and I am sure that our family can embark on the new year together with confidence, understanding and new courage.'\nAdvertisement\nTitles are a clearly a sensitive subject for the Danish royals. Then-Princess Margrethe married French native Henri Marie Jean André de Laborde de Monpezat in 1967; throughout their long marriage, Henrik was publicly unhappy that she never upgraded him from Prince Consort to King Consort. So unhappy in fact, that when he died in 2018, he refused to be buried in the tomb reserved for the couple. Instead, he was cremated and his ashes split between a palace garden and the sea.\nFast forward to 2022: Prince Joachim and both wives — former and current — were united in their displeasure about the way the young princes and princess were downsized, saying they were blindsided and disappointed.\n'We weren't happy about the way it happened,' said Princess Marie. 'But it's a family thing. It's complicated.' What some people might see as frivolous is something more, she said: 'It's also their name. It's their identity since they were born. So it's more than just what people see as a title.'\nBut what's done is done: The queen always gets the last word in any argument. 'We've moved on,' Joachim said. (He was all smiles at his brother's coronation.)\nIn the smaller world of European royalty, it matters — but only to a certain extent. They all know each other — many are related — and the difference between being a prince or a count may not be a game changer in the larger scheme of their lives.\nAdvertisement\nJoachim's older sons are launched (Nikolai is a fashion model; Felix is in business school) and his younger children are thriving in an international school here in Washington.\n'We've lived here for seven months now, and very few people know who we are, Danes apart,' said the prince. The prince and princess can fly under the radar or use their titles to leverage attention for causes they care about. He's a patron to 60 organizations; she's been working on the issue of hunger and food waste for years, and since arriving in Washington has partnered with Veteran Coalition International, a Danish American nonprofit that focuses on long term care for international/NATO veterans and their families.\nBut you also might spot the Danish royals at a Formula One race. The prince calls historical cars and motor racing 'my passion.' He has his own racing car, and won 'five or six' Danish championships. The princess is also a fan; the family expects to attend races in the United States.",

We'll be publishing accounts from these writers at key moments leading up to Election Day. Dave Barry: We Floridians are hopeful (for a meteor strike)\nGreetings from the Sunshine State! The mood down here, as we anticipate the 2024 presidential election, is one of hopefulness. Specifically, we're hoping that a large, previously undetected meteor will strike the planet before November. Granted, this would mean the end of human civilization, but at least we wouldn't have to go through with the election.\nHa ha! I'm kidding, of course. No, wait, I'm not. Floridians are wildly unexcited about this election. I know this because I have personally spoken to nearly six of the state's 23 million residents — in professional journalism, we call this 'assessing the public mood' — and in every single case, when the election came up, these residents assumed the facial expression of a person who has just opened the door to a port-a-potty on the last day of a midsummer chili festival.\nThis is not to say Floridians don't care about the issues. For example, we're deeply concerned about the border. I don't mean the border with Mexico; I mean the border with Georgia. That's how the New Yorkers are getting in. Tens of thousands of them move to Florida every year, lured by our abundant sunshine, our low taxes, our relaxed standards regarding the storage of highly classified government documents and our policy of permitting people to continue to legally drive long past the point where they have essentially the same neural reaction time as a zucchini.\nAdvertisement\nThe problem is, the New Yorkers are buying property down here, and they're very aggressive. If you go to a party and have too much to drink, you could very well wake up the next morning to discover you sold your house to a New Yorker. I myself have done this a half-dozen times, and it has to stop.\nAnother issue we have in Florida is bears on crack. I am not making this issue up. The Florida legislature recently passed a bill that would relax the penalties for killing bears, and one of the sponsors, Rep. Jason Shoaf (R), made the following statement (Google it if you don't believe me): 'We're talking about the ones that are on crack, and they break your door down, and they're standing in your living room growling and tearing your house apart. When you run into one of these crack bears, you should be able to shoot it, period.'\nPeriod!\nOf course, these are not the only issues we Floridians care about. We don't live in a bubble down here. We're well aware that the nation faces critical challenges, both at home and abroad, and as the presidential election approaches, we share the same concern felt by all Americans in these uncertain times, namely: What happens if some New Yorkers buy a house occupied by crack bears? In that scenario, my money would be 100 percent on the New Yorkers. But I think we can agree, as a nation, that it would be fun to find out.\nDave Barry is a novelist and a former humor columnist for the Miami Herald.\nDave Barry is a novelist and a former humor columnist for the Miami Herald.\nAngela Garbes: This election is as exciting as Washington's dreary weather\nIn much of Washington state, winter consists of approximately six months of interminable gray and drizzle. Survival means endurance — living in perpetual dampness and managing your expectations. When the sun makes its brief, brilliant appearance in March, you mustn't get your hopes up; it will be months before you can reliably count on sunshine and blue skies.\nIt seems a little basic to turn the weather of the Pacific Northwest into a metaphor for this year's presidential election, but if the cloud cover fits …\nAny buzz surrounding the state primaries, which were settled weeks ago, has mostly faded. Both President Biden and Donald Trump won handily. The prevailing sentiment of Washingtonians runs along the lines of 'Meh, what does it matter, they don't even campaign here.' Indeed, neither candidate visited Washington state ahead of its primary elections, and it's unlikely they will spend much time campaigning here for the general.\nThough Biden garnered 84 percent of the Democratic vote, 10 percent of party voters marked 'uncommitted delegates' as a way of officially registering their discontent with the president's financial and military support of the Israeli genocide of Palestinians. It was another tactic in the regular series of nonviolent protests in the past five months that have shut down Seattle's Space Needle; clogged Interstate 5, the highway that runs through Seattle's city center; disrupted city council meetings in Spokane; and seen high school and university students walk out of classrooms across the state.\nAdvertisement\nTrump won the Republican primary easily with 76 percent, though Nikki Haley — who dropped out of the race a week before the primary — still garnered nearly 20 percent of party votes. The familiar liberal-conservative divide found across the United States corresponds to urban-rural areas of Washington. In small towns across Washington, where properties are bigger, Trump flags and banners also tend to be large. But if you look closely, many are weathered and dirty, having endured four years of elements and hanging outside. They flap in the wind, passive, with the same sort of resignation found in voters.\nBiden will almost certainly win Washington in the general, but there's no sense of pride, excitement or energy around this fact. 'We've been reading for months how the election will come down to 10,000 votes in like six states,' a father at an elementary school pickup said. Washingtonians, like so many Americans, understand this as a rematch between two old men no one seems to particularly like. The election will come down to the same battleground states far from our corner of the country, and we'll sit back and watch. Summer will come and go, warming our skin and spirits. But by November, we'll have settled back into the familiar gloom.\nAngela Garbes is a nonfiction author based in Seattle.\nAngela Garbes is a nonfiction author based in Seattle.\nMelissa Fay Greene: Look to Atlanta's ever-changing suburbs\nAriel Baverman, an agent for Coldwell Banker Realty, sells homes north of Atlanta to a diverse array of clients in neighborhoods that once epitomized White flight. Her territory includes counties her Jewish parents once felt uncomfortable driving through. It includes long-ago 'sundown towns,' so named because Black people would find themselves in extreme peril if still in the vicinity after dark.\nReal estate promotions now describe these towns — with their boutiques, coffee shops, breweries and alfresco dining — as 'cute.' 'You know, they'll have the cute railroad tracks that go through downtown,' Baverman says. 'You can have brunch and walk around and shop. The bookstores host children's authors. There's live music.'\nBig houses with front porches and deep backyards are more affordable out here than their equivalents near most big cities. With nearly 328,000 transplants in 2022, Georgia ranks fifth-highest in the number of residents who lived in a different state the previous year. Thousands are unpacking in precincts that voted for Donald Trump in a landslide in 2016 and in 2020 delivered Georgia to Joe Biden. 'Republicans like breweries and walkable neighborhoods, too,' says Bernard Fraga, associate professor of political science at Emory University. 'But young people move more and highly educated young people move even more — they're the ones who have the money to move around — and those cohorts are, on average, more liberal. Outsiders still see these counties as conservative strongholds, like in the 1980s. As they turn purple, some observers mistakenly conclude: ‘Older white voters must be rejecting Trump and favoring Democrats again.' That's not the case.'\nAdvertisement\nThey're turning purple because older White voters are being swamped by newcomers. 'Georgia is purple at the federal level,' Fraga continues, 'and still very red at the state level, but people from East Coast and West Coast cities see Atlanta now as one of these cool destinations where they'll be okay. Atlanta is a beacon.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBaverman recently helped a Seattle couple buy a spacious house in Acworth, northwest of Atlanta. They worked remotely and couldn't afford Seattle. 'They literally told me that once all the other priorities checked out, they wanted a state where their votes would matter.\n'I drove around Lawrenceville with an Atlanta family looking for more space and less traffic,' she continues. '‘Don't Tread on Me' and ‘Let's Go Brandon!' signs and banners were everywhere that day. The couple found the perfect house, but the wife said, ‘I don't feel safe here.'' They ended up buying in a neighborhood where yards signs are not permitted, even though the surrounding area — Cherokee County — was super conservative. 'However those people were voting,' Baverman tells me, 'they kept it to themselves.'\nTogether, we look at BestNeighborhood.org, a site frequented by real estate agents. It offers detailed maps of political diversity, county by county, with the commentary: 'Southern states are considered quite Republican, but the map below shows that variation exists everywhere.'\nCherokee County was so red, it looked burgundy, with a sprinkling of tiny blue dots.

The banner featured just two words: a giant obscenity, the action verb of choice for the profane, followed by the name of the president of this country of ours. ' Blank Biden.' In your face for all to see — the children on their school buses rumbling by; the young moms pushing strollers; the elderly who take this route to the bank or supermarket. And me, of course.\nBlank Biden.' In your face for all to see — the children on their school buses rumbling by; the young moms pushing strollers; the elderly who take this route to the bank or supermarket. And me, of course.\nI am a walker, and my loop takes me past this house. ' Blank Biden.' Really, neighbor? Is this what it has come to? A big 'F you' to not only the president of the United States but to every member of our community? I am not easily offended, but this offended me. And it made me angry and sad. And, quite honestly, made me want to shout back, 'Yeah, and blank you, too, buddy.'\nBlank Biden.' Really, neighbor? Is this what it has come to? A big 'F you' to not only the president of the United States but to every member of our community? I am not easily offended, but this offended me. And it made me angry and sad. And, quite honestly, made me want to shout back, 'Yeah, and blank you, too, buddy.'\nMy community wasn't always like this.\nI live in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley, a bucolic patchwork of farm fields and forests anchored by the postindustrial steel cities of Allentown and Bethlehem. We locals like to brag that we live in the purplest region of one of the purplest states. The valley is home to a diverse blend of union workers and college students; hunters and gun enthusiasts; townies and tech workers; farmers and back-to-the-earth hippies. Our Pennsylvania Dutch roots run deep, but so do our vibrant Hispanic, Middle Eastern and African communities.\nAdvertisement\nI've lived here for a quarter of a century and always considered my adopted home to be a place of moderate, mild-mannered folks who all got along pretty well. Conversations tended to focus on family and our tomato harvests. Then came 2016 and the ascension of Donald Trump as divider in chief and normalizer of egregious behavior. I have watched dinner parties devolve into shouting matches, friendships end and neighbors stop talking. It's a new age of hostility and incivility. From my observation, most of the vitriol is coming from the die-hard defenders of Trump and is aimed at anyone who dares disagree. As yet another yard sign in my town put it: ' Blank your feelings.'\nBlank your feelings.'\nFor months, on my walks, I considered knocking on my neighbor's door and having a respectful conversation. 'Knock yourself out with your Trump signs,' I wanted to say, 'but could you please cool it with the angry obscenities? Could you show a little respect?' But, of course, like all the mild-mannered among us, I avoided what I knew would be an uncomfortable confrontation.\nAnd then one day, I walked by, and the weathered banner was gone. Could it be? Could my neighbor have finally realized there are more constructive ways to voice a political point? The answer, I regret to report, is no. Within days, a new banner was up in its place. This one proclaimed: 'Biden Sucks.' Which I will take as a small victory in the decency wars. At least these words I can repeat in a family newspaper.\nJohn Grogan is a nonfiction author and former columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer.\nJohn Grogan is a nonfiction author and former columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer.\nCharles Yu: In Orange County, the 2024 campaign goes on spring break\nSeven months out, the election is everywhere, but it comes to me largely through my phone. As the survivors of California's jungle primaries look toward November, the waves of emails and texts — bolded and capped and full of exclamation points — have subsided. For now.\nTraveling from Orange County to Los Angeles International Airport to D.C. not long ago, I did not see a single MAGA hat. No bumper stickers, either, for President Biden or Donald Trump. I did not overhear one conversation about the election in the security line, the boarding line, on the plane, in the hotel, in the hotel gym, in a restaurant. In the airport shuttle, the driver was listening to show tunes.\nFriends, wanting to stay friends, have learned the lessons of 2016 and 2020. We talk about it behind closed doors, with spouses and children. Or we just talk less about it because we already discussed it. And what good did it do? Did anything any of us said actually change anyone's mind? It's hard to continue a conversation when the starting point is: 'I just don't really like either of them.' Eight years ago, I was looking to argue. Four years ago, I was watching the news at home. This year, I'm staying mostly quiet. Because what do I know? About anything? Am I so sure I'm right?\nEveryone's shouting online and on television. As Irvine (and the rest of this formerly solid red county) continues its shift from purple to blue, the talk is of local races, not national, and the chatter is about Shohei Ohtani, or college admissions, or the rain.\nAt the National Archives, my family and I shuffled through security, climbed the stairs to the rotunda, waited in line to see the founding documents. It was the longest line we encountered. The atmosphere was electric. The crowd was comprised almost entirely of student groups and families. Museum staff directed us: You all are forming lines. Why?\nThere is no line. Just human nature. It's funny and true, but I can't figure out which way it cuts. Are we sheep? Or just self-organizing? Don't be shy, they tell us. Get in there, get a good look and move on so the next person can see.\nWhen it was our turn, we found ourselves being crowded out by an eager family. The dad kept pushing through, taking and retaking photos. For his personal collection? For posterity? His daughter recited portions of the text from memory. Others waited patiently while these folks got what they needed from this experience. And I was momentarily irritated by their lack of awareness until I realized: This is what exclamation points look like in real life. These people are just really excited about the Constitution.",

A mahogany-colored beast, he could kick his hind legs so dynamically that his hoofs reached 10 or 12 feet in the air. Newsweek magazine dubbed him 'the Michael Jordan of bulls.' For five years, Bushwacker was all but unrideable. He owned the longest streak of consecutive buck-offs in PBR history, with 42, until one summer night in Tulsa in 2013 when Mauney caught a ride on him that friend and PBR publicist Andrew Giangola likened to 'bodysurfing a tornado.' Mauney scored 95.25 points out of a possible 100. Bushwacker would not be ridden again, by anyone.\nJ.B. Mauney ends Bushwacker's streak of 42 consecutive buck-offs during the championship round of the Tulsa Built Ford Tough series PBR. (PBR)\nArctic Assassin was no Bushwacker. But by last September, Mauney was not his younger self, either. He had so much metal in him from being torn up by bulls that if you gave him a full body X-ray, his bones would look like silverware. There were a screw with 13 anchors in his left shoulder, a plate and screws in his left hand, and a plate in his pelvis. He had broken his jaw on both sides, fractured an eye socket, taken five staples in his head above his left ear.\nArctic Assassin came out of the chute and wrenched right, then left. Mauney was okay for the first couple of bucks. But then he sat down hard and lurched sharply forward. The bull's rising hips caught him and propelled him into the air. Mauney's boots and spurs went up over his hat. He was halfway into a somersault when he slammed to the ground.\nMauney landed in the sand of the arena floor and flopped over on his belly. He tried to raise his head, and pain ran through his neck as though he had been stabbed with a hot knife. Somehow, he got half upright. He began walking insensibly on his knees across the arena in the dirt. It was an old instinct, drilled into him as a boy by a mentor named Jerome Davis, the 1995 Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association world champion bull rider.\n'Unless you got a broke leg or you're knocked out,' Davis told a young Mauney, 'you better get up and walk out.'\nDavis spoke those things from a wheelchair, having been paralyzed from the chest down by a bull in 1998.\nGet up and walk out, Mauney told himself. He rose and staggered. Watching from the fence, three of his best friends and top riders realized he was hurt way beyond the ordinary. One of them, Shane Proctor, leaped down and got an arm around him and guided him to safety behind the chute gate. 'You all right?' Proctor asked.\n'I just broke my neck,' Mauney said.\nMauney's fateful fall from Arctic Assassin seemed unlikely. (August Frank/Lewiston Tribune)\nMauney limped away, clutching an arm stiffly to his side to keep his head from lolling, and headed straight toward the paramedic station.\nAnother rider asked Mauney's friend Stetson Wright, 'You really think he broke his neck?'\n'I don't know, but something's wrong because I ain't never seen him walk straight to any paramedics,' Wright said.\nMauney was infamous for resisting hospitals.\nAt the paramedic station, a medic said to him, 'What's going on?'\n'I just broke my f---ing neck,' Mauney said.\n'Well, we should probably get a collar on you,' the medic said.\n'That'd probably be a good idea,' Mauney said.\nMauney sat down at a picnic table. As he waited for the ambulance, he casually lit a cigarette. 'I figured where I was headed, I couldn't smoke,' he says.\nThe break was bad. It required the insertion of a rod, a plate and screws in his neck. He also had lost a disk. The next day, a doctor talked to him about the risk of resuming bull riding.\nIf he landed on his head again, Mauney was told, he more than likely would break his neck a second time, either above or below the reinforcing rod and plate. Snap the neck below, and he would be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Snap it above, and he would be dead.\nThe doctors kept using the word 'if.' Mauney knew better. 'There was no ‘if' about it,' he says.\nMauney looked the doctor in the eye and said, 'It's about a 100 percent chance I'll land on my head.'\nOn Sept. 12, Mauney announced his retirement. He would never ride a bull again.\nLoading...\nLoading...\nAbout two weeks later, he was at home in Stephenville convalescing in a neck brace, with little to do but think. He picked up the phone and called his good friend Matt Scharping. A top stock contractor who breeds champion bucking bulls out of Minnesota, Scharping was the co-owner of Arctic Assassin.\nMauney asked him, 'Hey, what are you going to do with the black bull?'\n'I'm going to retire him,' Scharping said.\n'Well, I want him,' Mauney said.\nThere was an incredulous pause on the line.\n'For what ?' Scharping asked.\nwhat?' Scharping asked.\nRetired professional bull rider Mauney on his ranch Feb. 7 in Stephenville, Tex. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\nFOR WHAT? THERE'S A QUESTION. For what reason does anyone mess with, much less provoke, a 1,700-pound bos taurus , a creature that is all chest, haunches and horns and that exerts a ground force reaction of 12 times its body weight when it stomps you with its back legs? That in its prime has such a fighting instinct that if you merely float a piece of paper into a pasture, it will try to gore it?\nFOR WHAT? THERE'S A QUESTION. For what reason does anyone mess with, much less provoke, a 1,700-pound bos taurus, a creature that is all chest, haunches and horns and that exerts a ground force reaction of 12 times its body weight when it stomps you with its back legs? That in its prime has such a fighting instinct that if you merely float a piece of paper into a pasture, it will try to gore it?\nEvery other activity at a rodeo has some passing relationship to ranching skills. Breaking wild horses and roping steers are necessary for managing rough stock. But bull riding is just a dare. It has no other reason for being.\nTo animal rights activists, it's a barbaric relic of the Visigoths. PETA claims 'countless animals have paid with their lives to satisfy humans' desire to play cowboy.' PBR counters that a 2020 study showed there were just two bull injuries in more than 5,000 'outs,' meaning the times its bulls left the chute, and that the animals receive first-rate nutrition and sports medicine. It's a legitimate question whether animals should be used for entertainment. But it's also an ugly truth that the career option for a bull is the meatpacking industry. Most cattle have an average life span of just 18 months before slaughter, the same as for chickens.\nChampion bucking bulls, however, tend to live for 10 to 15 years and retire to pastures, valuable as sires. Bushwacker's sperm goes for $5,000 a vial.\nStill, life is cruel for all range animals, given that the American range no longer exists.\nSince he retired from professional bull riding, Mauney has turned his ranch into a practice site for bull riders and young bulls. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\n'He goes to work and gets outside, and he feels so much better,' Sam said of her husband. 'He feels better if he's moving around.' (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\nMauney herds bulls into pens as young riders pull on their gear. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\nIf rodeos are part nostalgia, they also reflect a modern anxiety. The enthusiasts of the sport — five PBR events on CBS in 2023 commanded more than 1 million viewers — see a desperately needed antidote to creeping cultural neurasthenia. In Mauney particularly, they saw a last American vestige of stoicism, self-reliance and 'cowboying up,' so much so that he still commands more than 1 million followers on Instagram and retains all of his sponsors, from Wrangler to Monster Energy to the American Hat Company. As Mauney sat atop a bull that twisted and stamped, all kinds of things swirled around him. Fear. Character. Power. And make no mistake, ethic.\nMan's fascination with the epic form of a bull — and his attempt to bestride it — is older than any American rodeo. In an exquisite Minoan fresco at the Knossos palace in Crete dated to 1450 BC, a man is depicted vaulting off the flank of a bull. The most striking thing about the fresco is the profound mismatch between the slight human figure and the mass of charging, rearing bull. The contest is not about strength — and never could be.\n'You're not going to overpower them,' Mauney says. 'It's a dance partner. They make a move, you got to follow.\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nBull riders are not in charge. And that is a part of the draw — that feeling that they have hooked into an intense and massive primal force and are in something like cooperation with it. They put the lie to the notion of human sovereignty over nature.\nIn every other dangerous form of competition, 'You're still the one with your foot on the accelerator or the brake,' says former champion Ty Murray, now a commentator. 'Even if we're talking about mountain climbing, you're still the one that's deciding what level things are going to. But in bull riding, the bull is the one with the accelerator.'\nThere have been attempts to scientifically measure the forces that a rider experiences on an erratically bucking bull. One study using NASA-provided accelerometers showed that a bull weighing 1,700 or more pounds rearing explosively can exert a pull of 26 G-forces on a man. For context, an IndyCar wreck at 200 mph creates about 50 Gs. That's just acceleration. Now mix in violence. The hind hoofs of a large bull generate a force of 106.3 kilonewtons. An Olympic boxer delivering a straight punch, just 3.4.\nMauney is not a big man. He is 5-foot-10 and a blade-thin 140 pounds. On a 1,700-pound bull, 'He's outmatched on a scale that you just can't imagine,' says Tandy Freeman, who has treated bull riders for more than 30 years as part of PBR's sports medicine program. Most of the injuries Freeman sees are head injuries. According to a paper titled 'Rodeo Trauma: Outcome Data from 10 years of Injuries,' rodeo athletes suffer serious head injuries at a rate 15 per 1,000 rides, far outstripping any other sport. They're 10 times more likely to suffer major injury than football players.\nMauney always has felt most comfortable working outside. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\nWhat really makes bulls buck is genetics: They are bred to it. They're animals of prey, programmed by evolution and DNA to rear, shake, stamp and horn-hook the things that land on their backs, and breeders enhance their athleticism through bloodlines. Bushwacker's owner, Julio Moreno, once observed that the first time he threw a flake of hay into the pen, the bull tried to kick it.\nIn world-class bull riding, the bull is regarded as every bit as much of an athlete as the rider — to the point that the bull's performance counts for half of a cowboy's score. PBR even names bulls as world champions along with riders. Bucking bulls in their prime are worth at least $10,000, and if they come from proven sire lines, their value skyrockets to $500,000 or more.\nThe people who climb on these creatures are, of course, addicts. They have a dependency that requires regular doses of centrifugal and vertical speed as well as sluices of dopamine and epinephrine and a sense of conquering the well-nigh unconquerable. When a bull reared and stamped, Mauney could feel all those G-forces and kilo-newtons in his fingertips .\nfingertips.\n'I would rope and make a good run and, yeah, I felt good about it. But it wasn't the same,' Mauney says. 'I made a good bull ride, and I was 10 foot tall and bulletproof.'\nMauney's fearless approach made him a fan favorite. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\nThe sensation leaves a man wanting more — craving it, even, to a degree that trumps any pain. Jerome Davis craved it. He had been rocked to sleep on horseback as a baby at his parents' ranch in Archdale, N.C., but no other motion did for him what a bull's did. When he was taken to rodeos as a boy, he couldn't take his eyes off the bulls. 'I was just glued,' he says. 'I would just sit in my seat and wouldn't talk, just stared. … After you get into it, you just get eat up with it. It just takes you over to where you become infected with it.'\nIn 1992, Davis was one of 20 men who met in a hotel room in Scottsdale, Ariz., and founded the Professional Bull Riders circuit with $1,000 stakes each, breaking away from the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association to start a tour of elite stand-alone bull events.\nBy 1998, Davis was making $500,000 per year, ranked No. 1 and leading the PBR standings when he got on a bull in Fort Worth named Knock 'Em Out John. The bull lived up to his name. He whipsawed forward, then rocked back and hit Davis's forehead. Knocked cold, Davis was thrown off like a heavy sack and came down on the side of his neck. The fall crushed two vertebrae.\nLater at the hospital, his fiancée, Tiffany, a horsewoman whose family staged rodeos, was at Davis's side when a doctor told him he would never walk again. He was 25.\n'The first thing Jerome said was, ‘I can't ride bulls again?' ' Tiffany remembers. 'He didn't even think about the not walking part. That's how much they love it.'\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nWithin a year, Davis got back in a horse saddle, with the help of Velcro, a back brace and a gentle animal. He and Tiffany began raising bucking bulls and hosting rodeo events on weekends. Just being around the pens, gates and chutes gave Jerome back some of the 'bull mojo,' as he called it.\nThe Davises threw a lot of junior rodeos, with prizes for the local kids that ranged from belt buckles to Bibles. One day, a guy named Tim Mauney, a longtime acquaintance from the Carolina rodeo world, showed up with his black-haired 6-year-old in tow and entered him in a junior calf-riding event. That's when the Davises met James Burton Mauney.\n'That's the first time I remember him, sticking in my head,' Tiffany says, 'because I thought, ‘Ohhhh, rascal's got some grit to him.' '\nSince retiring from professional bull riding, Mauney spends his time running his ranch and caring for the young bulls he's breeding and training. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\nON THE MAUNEYS' FAMILY FARM in Mooresville, N.C., J.B. was always getting caught climbing the fence boards to try to mount something bigger than him. 'My grandpa would raise hell at me because I'd be riding his beef cows and stuff,' Mauney says.\nON THE MAUNEYS' FAMILY FARM in Mooresville, N.C., J.B. was always getting caught climbing the fence boards to try to mount something bigger than him. 'My grandpa would raise hell at me because I'd be riding his beef cows and stuff,' Mauney says.\nThe Mauneys came from Alsace-Lorraine settlers who established a large farm in Iredell County in the 1820s. At one time it was pure cow country, with more than 300 cattle ranches and dairies, scores of rich brown cows lolling in the grass. But by the 1930s, large textile mills came in and the farms dwindled. Most of the people Mauney grew up with worked as laborers, ranching just a sidelight. His grandfather did 27 years in the Templon Spinning Mill. His father, Tim, worked night shifts in a lumber mill, while his mother, Lynne, worked for the local school system. But they still found time to keep cows, and every weekend they went off to a rodeo.\nTim Mauney was an amateur steer wrestler and such an enthusiast that he would volunteer at local shows. When a rodeo was short of riders to fill out the program, Tim would make two or three extra runs. 'He'd put on a different cowboy hat so the crowd wouldn't know it was the same guy,' remembers Tiffany Davis, whose father staged some of the shows.\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nMost of the rodeos offered 'mutton busting' events for the smallest children; 5- and 6-year-olds were placed on the back of sheep and rode until they fell off. But J.B. Mauney wanted no part of that. 'Boy, he felt it was stupid,' recalls Michael Laws, a family friend who was J.B.'s first bull instructor. 'He wasn't riding no sheep. He was going to ride bulls.'\nBy age 9, J.B. was riding the family steers and winning youth events in the Junior Southern Rodeo Association. He was just 13 when he got on his first small bull. His father and Laws used white medical tape to mark an X on the bull's shoulders; Laws told him don't take your eyes off it. Don't look down; don't look at your dad. It taught him focus.\nBull riding wasn't about 'manhandling' an animal, explained Laws, who made stained glass for a living during the week and rodeoed on weekends. 'That's not how you ride bulls. You have to ride them with grace, finesse — just flow with them.'\nTo do that, the boy had to develop a gymnast's core strength. Laws took a two-by-four and shaved it edgewise down to about an inch and a half wide. He mounted the plank in the air like a tightrope and told J.B. to get on it and practice walking on that edge, with one hand up in the air, as if he was on a bull.\nTo improve his core strength and balance for bull riding, Mauney used to stand on a ball while rewatching old rides. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\nMauney got to where he was so strong that he could tiptoe on the plank edge in his cowboy boots. 'Imagine a bull rider taking ballet,' Laws said. 'I seen him get on a board fence, which wasn't but three-quarters of an inch wide, and walk halfway around the arena. … That's balance.'\nMauney was long in the legs but featherweight light, weighing just 120 pounds as a freshman in high school, thin and bendable as a willow switch. But it was a serious mistake to take him for weak. On his first day aboard the high school bus, he got teased by a senior, who pinched his ear and called him skinny. Mauney leaped out of his seat and punched the guy in the mouth. 'Broke my hand,' he recalled.\nMauney preferred outdoor work to anything. He would cut his agriculture classes to work at a cattle sale barn, herding and loading bulls, only to get caught when the class took a field trip there.\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nHe spent weekends and most of his summers over at the Davis ranch, along with a gang of other aspiring young cowboys. J.B. would help set up the arena for rodeos and pick up trash. He ended up staying there for long stretches, crashed on the living room sofa or in an old bunk room.\nBeing around Jerome and his wheelchair 'made you open your eyes pretty good,' Mauney says. 'You realize a lot earlier than most guys that if you're going to do it, you better mean it, because one day it's here and next it's gone.'\nJerome didn't talk much about his accident. He just taught J.B. with the way he went about his rehab and built his life back. He would say: 'Don't cry on my shoulder. You'll rust my spurs.'\nMost important of all, Jerome taught that when you got hurt, 'No reason to complain; you picked it,' J.B. says.\nAfter a life being thrown from bulls, Mauney feels the toll every day. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\nBy 15, Mauney was the closest thing to a prodigy in rodeo. He won the Southern Rodeo Association junior all-around title in 2002 and the adult title just two years later. He turned pro on his 18th birthday Jan. 9, 2005, and won the very first event he entered for a $10,000 prize.\nThen he got stomped — bad. At a rodeo in Raleigh, N.C., a bull came down on his midsection with two hoofs. Mauney knew his ribs were broken, but he figured all a doctor did was tape you up. He wrapped himself in an elastic bandage and drove home. The next morning, his side was badly distended, as if a football had been shoved under the skin. He took himself to an emergency room. 'That's your liver,' a doctor told him. He was rushed into surgery, and afterward the surgeon said she didn't understand why he hadn't keeled over dead. He was ordered not to ride for eight months — if he got gored by a bull while his organs were healing, it could kill him.\nTo make money as he recovered, he went to work at a local ball-bearing plant, sweltering through shifts covered in grease. He quit after four months and went back to riding. At his first competition, someone asked who cleared him to ride again.\n'Dr. Mauney,' he shot back.\nYoung bull riders prepare to ride on Mauney's ranch.

At 20, he was making $400,000 a year and thought he would never be broke again. It wasn't just the winning; it was his devil-may-care attitude that attracted fans. With a cigarette perpetually dangling from his lip, he radiated uncompromisingness. When a chewing tobacco company offered him a $250,000 endorsement deal, he turned it down because it said he couldn't smoke. When the company redid the language to say he couldn't smoke at public appearances, he said, 'Okay, for 250, I can hide it.'\nBY 2006, MAUNEY WAS ON HIS WAY to becoming the fastest bull rider to collect $1 million.

He stalked over and said, 'What are you doing tomorrow night?' She answered, 'Having dinner with my family.' He said, 'Can I come?'\n'I'd rather get dragged to death than starve to death any day,' he would say in his riding days. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\nHer name was Samantha Lyne, and she turned out to be the daughter of one of the greatest all-around rodeo athletes ever, Phil Lyne, who was being inducted to the PBR's Ring of Honor that weekend. Phil Lyne had dominated the early 1970s before he retired to a ranch in Cotulla, Tex. A superbly athletic rider and roper who was the subject of the 1973 Academy Award-winning documentary 'The Great American Cowboy,' Lyne had been featured in a famous Chevrolet trucks ad which boasted, 'A great way to get to work.'\nSam's parents tolerated Mauney at dinner, but they were appalled when she went down to North Carolina to stay in his camper. They had sent her off to TCU for a degree and wanted her to go into business, but she kept going back to the horses and cowboys.\nThis cowboy and cowgirl were a little too wild to hang together for long. Sam was chasing her own career as a decorated barrel racer — she would qualify for the national finals in 2014 — while Mauney was approaching his height as a competitor, and a carouser. While other cowboys lifted weights and trained in gyms, he bragged that the only time he had been on a treadmill was for a bet — which he won. He drank four cups of black coffee in the morning, his nutrition consisted of Corn Pops and Uncrustables, and he stayed up till closing time drinking beers and Jägermeister.\n'The most exercise he got was lifting a can,' Laws laughs.\nMauney rode with no regrets, except for the money he lost or threw away or people filched from him. 'I could've took care of business a little bit, not been at the bar all night,' he says. 'But you live and learn.'\nIt was part of his heedlessness. He rode with a looseness others envied, the fringe on his chaps flying around. In 2012, he broke his left (riding) hand and simply switched to his right — and still managed to place among the top five in the world. His epic conquering of Bushwacker in 2013 propelled him to his first world championship and a $1 million bonus.\nMauney's ride of Bushwacker remains the stuff of legend among rodeo fans. (Andy Watson/PBR/Bull Stock Media)\nIt wasn't as jaunty as he made it look, of course. Between the big rides, there were terrible wrecks. A bull named Jawbreaker horned him in the chest and collapsed his lung. There were personal wrecks, too. A brief encounter left him with a baby daughter, Bella, an adored black-haired child who looked just like him. A marriage to a young woman he met through rodeo colleagues collapsed after just two years. He became estranged from his family in a business dispute that left him feeling more used than loved.\nThe injuries began to mount. Mauney's problem wasn't so much what happened on the bull; it was that he was terrible at getting off. When it came time to dismount, he just couldn't seem to release his hand and land neatly. 'Everything I've got, since the age of 14, I made all of it tying that thing in there to where it wouldn't come out,' he says, showing his gnarled hand. He cracked both shoulder blades and his tailbone. He lost the ACLs in both knees and had a perpetually untreated ulnar collateral ligament tear in his elbow. And the pinkie on left hand was permanently curled from his poor dismounts.\n'I was not worth a s--- at it,' he says. 'I'd land up underneath them, my hand would hang in my rope and jerk me under them, and I'd get stomped. Well, my entire life I practiced how to stay on them, not jump off them. … I tied my hand in there to mean for it to be there.'\nmean for it to be there.'\nNevertheless, he still chose the 'rankest' bulls whenever he could. Most famously, in 2015 Mauney already had clinched his second title when he called for a bull named Bruiser at the PBR World Finals in Las Vegas. He was a two-toned creature who would be named world champion bull for three consecutive years. Bruiser lashed him around so violently, the bull's tail was flapping against his hat. He stayed on for a score of 92.75.\nIn 2015, Mauney rode Bruiser at the PBR World Finals in Las Vegas. (PBR)\nBy then, Mauney was back with Sam, her family had fully come around to him, and what no one knew about that championship was that each morning in their hotel room, she had to help him out of bed. 'I was, like, lifting him,' she says. Both had matured, and along with the original attraction they had something deeper: understanding. She was ranch-reared, capable in brittle situations and had a no-quit attitude as he did. 'We're a lot alike,' she says. That's why she also understood that beneath Mauney's exterior lurked sensitivity.\n'I just knew he was not the person that he wants people to think he is: tough guy,' she says. 'Which he is , right? But he's really kind.'\nis, right? But he's really kind.'\nShe knew how to deal with the fact that J.B. wouldn't go to the doctor unless it was an emergency. Once, he developed abscesses in some shattered teeth from a broken jaw after taking a hoof to the face. Instead of going to a dentist, he shot himself up with cattle antibiotics. The only problem was the cow needle was as big as something you would knit with. When he jabbed himself with it, he shuddered in pain for a full two minutes, his bare backside hanging out, before he could squeeze the plunger and pull his pants up.\nSam would employ vet medicine on him, with salves and therapeutics for his joints such as an equine laser. 'She doctored me like a horse,' he says.\nThe habit of choosing the baddest bull certainly cost him another title. Mauney mounted Bushwacker 13 times, almost twice as much as any other rider, and was bumped off 12 of those. In 2016, he had a clear shot at another championship gold buckle, but he chose Air Time, 1,650 pounds of dappled heavyweight. Ten riders had tried Air Time, and all of them were thrown. So was Mauney, who lasted about three seconds before Air Time threw him into the metal fence, subluxing his bad shoulder and tanking his chances.\nThere was something 'honorable' in the way Mauney always chose the hardest ride, Murray observes, even though he didn't need to.\n'He's always going to be remembered as a guy that slayed every dragon there is at some point,' Murray says. 'Even the guys who did it that way at times, they didn't do it that way all the time. J.B. basically did it that way all the time.'\nall the time.'\nJ.B. and Sam were married Jan. 3, 2017, and she moved into a log cabin in North Carolina with him and his collection of junk food. 'He eats like a 5-year-old,' she says. All of their friends thought they were a perfect match. According to the Davises, Sam is the only person J.B. toes the line for. 'They're tit for tat,' Jerome says. Tiffany says, 'Samantha's woman enough to call him out.'\nThey eventually found their way to Stephenville, where they bought some acreage a few miles outside of town. It had nothing on it but a single-wide trailer with a tin roof. They decided to live there while they looked for a house and ended up staying in it for two years.\nAs they put away their things in the single-wide, J.B. told her, 'I knew I'd white trash you up.'\nHis father says he doesn't care, but Jagger certainly appears destined for the cowboy life.

At the July 2017 Calgary Stampede, J.B. got his hand caught in the rope as he tried to dismount after scoring over 90 points on a bull named Cowabunga. The bull stepped on his shoulder at the armpit, just about ripping his arm off. It was the worst injury he had ever suffered: Three rotator cuff tendons were torn off the humerus, and the ball of the shoulder was fractured. A screw and 13 anchors reattached his shoulder, and he turned the mandated six-month recovery period into four months.\nMeanwhile, Sam was told that because of a medical condition in her youth, she had only a 1 percent chance of getting pregnant. The couple considered in vitro fertilization treatment and visited a clinic. They listened to a lecture on the difficult decisions they would have to make, such as whether to choose the sex of a child and what they would do with unused embryos. On the ride home afterward, both were quiet. Then Mauney burst out: 'Sam, I'm not real religious, but I'll be damned if I want to choose. I just don't feel right about that.' Sam said: 'I know. I don't feel right, either.'\n'Well, look,' he said. 'How about we just go along for a while and see what happens?'\nA few months later, they were sitting out front of their camper as usual with a circle of their friends, opening beers. Sam said, 'I don't really feel like drinking.' Mauney whipped his head around. Sam could usually drink his friends under the table. She said, 'I just feel funny; I'm going to lay down.' He followed her to the back of the camper and said, 'You're pregnant.'

After that, the collision between Mauney and Arctic Assassin became increasingly inevitable.\nJust a few weeks after his son's birth, Mauney rode a bull named Big Black to tie the record for PBR event victories. But when it was over, he had to ask for a hand up from the sand, unable to stand.\nThat year, he rode through a fractured tibia, a torn medial collateral ligament, a torn rotator cuff, a rib separation and fracture, a sprained wrist, a sprained ankle and a groin strain.\n'He doesn't bitch about anything. He never complains,' Samantha says. 'But I mean, I could see it all over his face.'\nMauney talks with other competitors during the American Rodeo in Arlington, Tex., in March. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\nSam managed to watch outwardly impassive from ringside, with the little boy in her lap. She was more nervous than she appeared. 'Lots of times,' she admits. 'Especially if I got a bad feeling, and then it was like, you can't say you have this weird bad feeling, right? Because if something happens, then you feel like it's your fault.'\nShe had one of those feelings in August 2021 in Kennewick, Wash. He got a hoof in the head and was out for five minutes. When she arrived backstage, he was still unconscious with blood coming out of his mouth and medics were yelling at him, 'J.B.! J.B.!' trying to make him come to.\nAt the end of 2021, he was tied for first place after the opening round of the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas. The next bull was named Johnny Thunder. Mauney's head collided with a horn, rendering him unconscious while he was still atop the bull. He sagged off sideways and was dragged like a sack of potatoes as the bull kicked him repeatedly. His hand came free at last. Somehow, the motionless heap started crawling. He left the arena under his own power. 'Things got a little western,' he joked afterward.\nAt some point in those years, an interviewer who saw where it was all headed asked him how he wanted to be remembered. Mauney answered: 'That's pretty easy. That's real easy. … I don't really give a s--- what anybody thinks about me, whether I'm the greatest or not. … All I want to be remembered as is, that son of a bitch put it all out there every single time he nodded his head.'\nreal easy. … I don't really give a s--- what anybody thinks about me, whether I'm the greatest or not. … All I want to be remembered as is, that son of a bitch put it all out there every single time he nodded his head.'\nIt's fair to say Mauney proved his point. And once a bull rider has proved everything to himself, that's where the most danger comes in. Ty Murray explains, 'The only thing that's left out there is for you to get hurt.'\nJagger touches his dad's scar after they ate lunch at a local country store. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\nOn the day Mauney and Arctic Assassin met in Lewiston, Idaho, Samantha wasn't there to see it. They had driven the camper to Ellensburg, Wash., which was their next stop up the road, so Jagger could settle for a few days and Sam could go to a barrel race. 'Just stay,' J.B. told her. He would ride to Lewiston in a truck with a couple of other riders and then double back to join them.\nThe cell reception in her camper was so bad she couldn't stream his ride. 'And it was a good thing it wasn't on, to be honest,' she says. Instead, she got a call later that night from Shane Proctor's wife, Haley. 'J.B's okay. He got up and walked out, but he said he broke his neck,' she reported. Sam spent the night packing up the trailer and then drove it over a mountainous route to the hospital.\nIt was a three-day trip from Lewiston back to Stephenville, and when they got home, he spent exactly two days in bed. The hospital had given him all sorts of do's and don'ts, such as, 'Don't lift anything heavier than a gallon of milk.' But Mauney got up and started putting his clothes on.\n'What are you doing?' Sam said,\n'I'm going to the barns,' he said.\nPretty soon, he was working the gears in a tractor in his neck brace, shoving dirt around.\nMauney feeds bulls on his ranch in Stephensonville, Tex. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\nAbout two weeks after he got home, Mauney picked up the phone and made the call to Matt Scharping, to tell him he wanted to buy Arctic Assassin.\nWhen Scharping asked, 'What do you want him for?' Mauney might've replied that he wanted to make a belt out of him. Instead, what he said was this:\n'I want to say I was the last guy who ever rode him.'\nOne afternoon, Mauney was working around the barns when one of his friends said to him, 'I just hate that you didn't get to end on your own terms.'\n'It was always going to end this way,' Mauney said. 'I wasn't ever going to be able to tell myself I couldn't do it.'\nMauney chats on the phone with longtime friend and Arctic Assassin's previous owner Matt Scharping. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\nTHERE WAS the 'for what.' J.B. Mauney chose to live with the bull that ended his career because Arctic Assassin delivered the message that he was never going to tell himself: It was time to quit.\nTHERE WAS the 'for what.' J.B. Mauney chose to live with the bull that ended his career because Arctic Assassin delivered the message that he was never going to tell himself: It was time to quit.\n'That was the best thing that could've happened,' Mauney says. 'I'm still upright.'\nIt had been a little more than 16 weeks since the catastrophic injury. Mauney no longer wears a neck brace, and his curling black hair hides any sign of scarring on his neck. When he wakes in the morning he is achingly stiff, but he's found that over the course of a day, working with the animals in open air eases it. 'He goes to work and gets outside, and he feels so much better,' Sam observes. 'He feels better if he's moving around.' As a result, he has pivoted to training the next great bull riders, as Jerome Davis once trained him. In February, Mauney announced he will serve as head coach of the Oklahoma Wildcatters, part of the PBR's team competition.\nMauney now trains young bull riders on his ranch in Stephenville. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\nYoung bull riders practice at Mauney's ranch. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\nMauney flips over the fence as a bull runs loose in the arena on his ranch. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\nMauney's ranch has become a practice site for bull riders — newly minted 23-year-old PRCA champion Ky Hamilton is there almost weekly. On horseback, Mauney herds bulls into the pens while young riders pull on their gear. Jagger arrives with Sam from preschool to watch. He has miniature versions of his own riding gear: chaps, boots and a glove.\nJagger swirls through the legs of the men, imitating their every move. Someone hands him a bull rope. Jagger stomps in a circle, imitating a stamping, twisting bull. Then he falls to the ground and clutches his throat.\n'Daddy, my neck is broke!' he cries.\nThere is silence.\n'Daddy, my neck is broke! My neck is broke!'\nMauney is up on a welded metal fence, bent over the chute, dealing with a bull.\n'Well, quit talking then,' he says mildly without looking around.\nJagger seizes a roll of adhesive tape, which the cowboys use for their ankles and wrists, and bandages his neck. After a while, he tries to rip it off his tender skin. An expression of shock crosses his face, and he begins to wail. Sam picks him up, and J.B. stops what he's doing and climbs down from the fence. She hands him over, and the boy buries his face in his father's shoulder.\nPain is the price of living rampant. Jagger will figure that out, just as his parents did. They won't spare their child this education. 'He can play the piano for all I give a s---, as long as he does it 110 percent,' Mauney says, and you can tell he means it.\nMauney and Jagger are kindred spirits. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\nLate in the day, after the cowboys have left, it is evening feeding time. Mauney heads to the upper pasture to tend to the black bull on the horizon, the inevitability he always knew he one day would have to surrender to, given all the things he jumped off of and ran into, the things hazarded rather than held back. Arctic Assassin was loaded on a trailer and delivered to Stephenville in late January. Mauney gave him his own broad, quiet paddock on the hillside, well away from the bucking ring, which Arctic Assassin will never see. As Mauney likes to say, 'He retired me, so now he gets to retire.'\nAs Mauney steps into his pasture, the black bull wanders over and noses him. The bull bends his head, conciliatory, as Mauney gently strokes his back with a peculiar half-smile on his face. What happened between the two of them, after all, was only life.\n'Of all the mean son of guns I got on in my career, and this dog-gentle one is the one that ended it,' he says.\nAs the cowboy strokes the tough hide, he's at peace with his fortunes, while out across the American savanna, more riders await their bulls.\nAmerican savanna, more riders await their bulls.\nMauney said of Arctic Assassin, 'I want to say I was the last guy who ever rode him.' He got his wish. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)",
