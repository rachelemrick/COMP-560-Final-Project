Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Jury selection began yesterday in New York City, where Donald Trump faces charges that he falsified business records to cover up a sex scandal while serving as president. It is the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president, and the first of four indictments that Trump faces in the coming months.\nThe initial pool of prospective jurors dwindled rapidly. More than half of the first group of 96 were dismissed in short order after indicating that they did not believe they could be impartial. As Trump's lawyers and prosecutors hashed out pretrial motions, the former U.S. president seemed alternately irritated and exhausted. He smirked and scoffed, and also seemed to nod off a few times before jolting back awake.\nLast month, the judge imposed a gag order on Trump, barring him from attacking witnesses in the case. But over the weekend, Trump assailed a key witness \u2014 his former fixer, Michael Cohen \u2014 on social media. The judge said he would hold a hearing later this month to discuss potential violations of the gag order, which also bars Trump from attacking the judge's family.\nWhat's next: Jury selection could take two weeks or more, and the trial may spill into June.\nWhat's next: Jury selection could take two weeks or more, and the trial may spill into June. Background: In 2016, Cohen paid $130,000 to the porn star Stormy Daniels, to buy her silence about a story of having had sex with Trump a decade earlier. Trump has denied the encounter.\nBackground: In 2016, Cohen paid $130,000 to the porn star Stormy Daniels, to buy her silence about a story of having had sex with Trump a decade earlier.

Blackouts are common, and internet access is sporadic. But 34 responded.\nThey were among Gaza's most ambitious students.\nThe dentistry program at Al-Azhar University was very selective, and very demanding, and they had big plans. 'We dream a lot \u2014 more than a brain can imagine,' one said.\nBut instead of starting new jobs, they found themselves plunged into endless days of burying the dead and fearing for the living.\nThe students had hired a videographer to capture their celebrations on the final day of exams, about a year before they finished their internships, in 2022. 'The most wonderful day in our lives,' one said. That was before the Israeli assault in the Gaza Strip began.\nWe reached members of the class of 117 students through Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. They wrote or talked to us from tents and balconies. Some even climbed on water tanks or walked long distances to grab a phone signal.\nAll told us they had lost loved ones. Two of their classmates were dead. And many feared they would be next.\nMost of their homes lay in ruins. Many described being hungry, and losing drastic amounts of weight.\nThe survivors described how their loved ones were killed. The New York Times was not able to verify every attack or the circumstances of every death.\nThis is not the first time war has come to Gaza. Israel and the Hamas militants who made the territory their stronghold have fought repeatedly over the years, but Gaza has never seen this degree of destruction and death. Israel says that it is doing what is needed to defeat Hamas, and that it takes great efforts to protect civilians, but even its allies have begun to characterize the bombing as indiscriminate.\nThe graduates spoke with anger, desperation and bewilderment about how much Israel's bombardment, now in its seventh month, has taken from them.\n'We had a lot of wars before, but this one is just different,' one said. 'Usually it would affect people, but not people that you know. This war took everyone.'\nLoss came early for Madeha Alshayyah . She had fled her home in Gaza City, but her grandmother, uncles and cousins stayed behind, despite the bombs. 'They all died and are still under the rubble,' Madeha said. Now, her sister is missing. She went to the market one day and never came back, she said. Salem Shurrab had known his best friend, Mouayad Alrayyes, since they were children. They used to meet every night at a cafe at the same table. Mouayad's home was bombed while he was out, and his family was killed. He wrote to Salem that he wished he had died, too, 'so I don't feel the pain.' 'Your pain is mine,' Salem replied. Hours later, Salem said, Mouayad was killed by a rocket when he went to retrieve the bodies. Mirna Ismail 's home was destroyed, but that did not even come up in her WhatsApp groups. Now, they discuss 'only the urgent things, only who has been killed,' she said. 'If someone lost his house, it is not an urgent thing now.' Mirna lost two friends and a cousin. 'We all know someone who has been killed,' she said. 'And we can't understand why they are killing them.'\nLoss came early for Madeha Alshayyah .

'We all know someone who has been killed,' she said. 'And we can't understand why they are killing them.'\nThe class WhatsApp group was how most of the graduates learned that two of their classmates were dead.\nOn Dec. 2, Aseel Taya was at home with her family, including her father, Sofyan Taya, a prominent researcher in physics and applied mathematics, when Israeli warplanes struck, the Palestinian Ministry of Higher Education said. They were all killed.\nMessages have been translated.\n'Why Aseel? What did she do to deserve that?' Mirna recalled feeling. 'At that time it's not easy to cry,' she said. 'You only think that this is a lie and I will see her again.'\nAseel Taya (via Rasha H. Zendah)\nIn February came word of another classmate's death.\nMessages have been translated.\nNoor Yaghi was sheltering with her family in central Gaza when Israeli airstrikes hit their home. She was 'like a flower,' said Asmaa Dwaima, who described her 'laughing and making fun of herself and us in the labs.' The Feb. 22 strikes killed at least 40 people, according to local media.\nNoor's remains were never found, said her cousin Asil Yaghi. 'Her body seems to have become small pieces,' she said. 'My heart is squeezing and my tears don't stop.'\nNoor Yaghi (left) and her twin sister, Aya (via Asil Yaghi)\nFor many of the students, the talk is of bodies and body parts.\nMuhammad Abdel Jawad was visiting an injured cousin at the hospital when he heard that the residential tower where he lived with his family had been hit. He returned home to find his sisters with 'burns all over their bodies,' he said.\nHis father was missing.\nTwo days later, Muhammad went back to the remains of his home. 'I found my father's body in front of me,' he said. 'I tried everything I could to get him out.' His 16-year-old sister was also killed, he said.\nOla Salama said her uncle's body was found with no head and no feet after his house was bombed. 'The scenes I saw were more horrific than horror movies,' she said. 'But they are all real.' 'The missile cut her body into pieces,' Alaa Jihad Hussain said of her 22-year-old cousin, who was killed alongside her husband and daughter. With communications often down, some of the graduates feared their loved ones might be dead without their knowing. Only by chance did some learn about a relative's death. When Mahmoud Naser ran into an acquaintance at a shelter in Rafah, he learned his uncle had been shot, apparently by an Israeli sniper. 'I am afraid of dying these days, and that my friends won't find my name among the names of martyrs because there are too many,' said Asmaa Dwaima , who, already, can count three friends and four cousins among the dead. 'I'm also afraid they won't find an internet connection to log in and publish a silly story to commemorate me.' Mohammed Al-Baradei (right) grew up with Ahmad Al-Hourani, attending university and spending afternoons in the gym together. But when the house next door was bombed, a wall fell on Ahmad as he slept, Mohammed said. 'All my life was with him,' he said. 'All of it ended in a moment.' Alaa AlAbadla (right) last saw his friend Basel Farwana in the seaside area where they were sheltering. Basel was killed when he went home to get a nylon sheet and some blankets for his family's tent, Alaa said. But Alaa has little time to mourn. He is busy looking for clean water to survive. 'We don't have time to be sad,' he said. When Israeli forces invaded Gaza from the north, most of the graduates fled south. Mazen Alwahidi was one of the few exceptions. Food shortages are most severe in the north, and Mazen said he had lost 46 pounds and has resorted to eating donkey feed. 'It was like garbage,' he said. 'But we have no other choices.' He said his aunt, a cancer patient, died without access to treatment. They buried her on a street, near a destroyed graveyard. Noor Shehada also remains in the north. Her family was relying on wild herbs to survive, she said. 'We are starving. We are living in the 18th century.' Before the war, her uncle traveled to Israel for chemotherapy. Without access to treatment, he died, she said. Najat Shurrab said her cousin's 2-year-old twins, Muhammad and Hamada, had been killed. 'They were defenseless civilians,' she said. Ms. Shurrab has a 7-month-old daughter, Masa, and they have been living in a tent in Rafah. Every day is a struggle to find diapers and food for her baby, she said, and she fears what the future holds for the child. Areej al-Astal was pregnant when she evacuated first to a tent in Rafah and then to an overcrowded house with her husband's family. She slept on the floor for two months. With food scarce, she said, she gained no weight during her whole pregnancy. Eventually, she escaped to Egypt and gave birth to a son. 'The word \u2018dreams' has ended,' she said. 'It no longer exists in our imagination at all.' More than 100 members of Areej's extended family have been killed in the Israeli assault, according to a Gazan health ministry spokesman. 'I can't count them,' Areej said. After being displaced five times, Rabeha Nabeel and her family decided to return home, though it was missing walls. 'Even if it's destroyed, it's our house,' she said. Rabeha said 27 members of her extended family were killed in the first week of the war. 'I lost five of my close friends, my house, my job, my university, my happy memories and my city,' said Mohammed Zebdah . Mohammed was supposed to pick up his certificate on Oct. 8, but then the bombs started falling. Many of the graduates told The Times they had just gotten jobs at clinics that are now in ruins. One said he had recently begun working as a volunteer in Khan Younis, treating as many as 60 refugees a day. A few others managed to leave the country. Months after the joyous celebrations of the graduates, the buildings of Al-Azhar University where they had their dentistry classes bear the scars of war.

Chu, the director of 'Crazy Rich Asians,' and Billie Jean King were set to be among the featured guests.","summary":"The University of Southern California, reeling after a controversy over its valedictorian selection, announced Friday that its main commencement program would eliminate outside speakers and honorees, including the director of 'Crazy Rich Asians,' Jon M. Chu, and the tennis star Billie Jean King.\nThe private university in Los Angeles broke with tradition this week by announcing that its valedictorian, Asna Tabassum, a first-generation Muslim student, would not deliver a commencement address, a decision that came after campus Jewish organizations objected to her selection.\nThe student groups, including Trojans for Israel, cited a pro-Palestinian social media link by Ms. Tabassum, who is of South Asian ancestry. After the groups announced their opposition, the university said it received a barrage of communications indicating that the commencement would be disrupted.\nWhile the university cited security concerns for canceling the speech, Ms. Tabassum, a biomedical engineering major, said in a statement that she was 'shocked' and 'profoundly disappointed' by the decision. And she questioned the school's motivation.\n'There remain serious doubts about whether U.S.C.'s decision to revoke my invitation to speak is made solely on the basis of safety,' she said.\nAfter the decision to cancel her speech, the administration has faced several of days of protests calling for Ms. Tabassum's reinstatement as a speaker.\nThe U.S.C. announcement on Friday followed inquiries by The New York Times as to whether Mr. Chu, an alumnus, might withdraw as the graduation speaker because of the controversy. By the end of the day, the university had removed his name and photo from its commencement website. And it announced that he and other speakers were 'being released.'\n'Given the highly publicized circumstances surrounding our main stage commencement program, university leadership has decided it is best to release our outside speakers and honorees from attending this year's ceremony.'\nMr. Chu and Ms. King could not be reached for comment.\nEarlier this week, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California said it was looking into the possibility of representing Ms. Tabassum in a lawsuit against the university, citing a California statute known as the Leonard Law, which applies First Amendment free speech protections to private and public colleges in the state.\nAn A.C.L.U. lawyer in Los Angeles, Mohammad Tajsar, said that U.S.C. has a formidable private security apparatus that should be able to handle such an event, even with security concerns.\n'If the university can accommodate speeches by Ben Shapiro and Milo Yiannopoulos and host President Obama and the King of Jordan at its graduations, surely it can bear whatever burden comes with celebrating Asna Tabassum as its valedictorian,' Mr. Tajsar said.","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Stephanie Saul","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/19/multimedia/19nat-usc-01-vqfk/19nat-usc-01-vqfk-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":4.222965,"_id":"c5a86f9e302a652a9d30379554b6970a"},{"title":"Israeli civilians kill two Palestinians in the West Bank, officials say.","author":"Aaron Boxerman","published_date":"2024-04-15 23:17:57","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/15/world/middleeast/palestinian-men-killed-israel-west-bank.html","clean_url":"nytimes.com","excerpt":"Israeli civilians fatally shot two Palestinians in the West Bank on Monday, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials, as tensions continued to spike in the Israeli-occupied territory.The\u2026","summary":"Israeli civilians fatally shot two Palestinians in the West Bank on Monday, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials, as tensions continued to spike in the Israeli-occupied territory.\nThe Palestinian Authority Health Ministry identified the two men as Abdelrahman Bani Fadel, 30, and Mohammad Bani Jama, 21. The circumstances of their deaths near the town of Aqraba remained unclear.\nThe Israeli military said the two men had been killed during a 'violent exchange' between Israeli civilians and Palestinians that followed a report of an Israeli shepherd being attacked by a Palestinian. An initial probe indicated that the gunfire 'did not originate' from Israeli soldiers, the military said.\nThe two Palestinians appeared to have been shot by Israeli civilians on the scene, said an Israeli security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was still underway.\nThe killings fed fears that the West Bank could become another front for a country already in its seventh month of war in the Gaza Strip.\nAbout 500,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank live alongside roughly 2.7 million Palestinians under Israeli military occupation. Since the war began on Oct. 7, more than 400 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces there and in East Jerusalem, according to the United Nations.\nJihad Abu Aliya, 25, was killed in a mob attack, according to the village mayor. Credit... Nasser Nasser/Associated Press Over the past few days, a renewed wave of violence has swept through the West Bank.\nOn Friday, a 14-year-old Israeli teenager went missing, prompting Israeli settlers to riot inside a Palestinian village, Al Mughayir. Jihad Abu Aliya, a 25-year-old resident, was fatally shot during a mob attack, according to the village mayor, Amin Abu Aliya.\nThe teenager, Binyamin Achimair, was found dead on Saturday after an intensive search; Israeli officials said he had been murdered in an act of terrorism and vowed to track down the perpetrators. In response, Israeli settlers, some of them armed, conducted a series of mob assaults in Palestinian towns, torching homes and cars, according to Palestinian witnesses.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on Israelis to allow security forces to search for Mr. Achimair's killers, but he did not denounce the mob attacks against Palestinians. Human rights groups have long charged that Israel turns a blind eye to settler violence and rarely brings perpetrators to justice.\nIn footage distributed on Sunday by Yesh Din, an Israeli rights group that tracks Jewish extremist violence in the West Bank, hooded figures can be seen setting a car ablaze while Israeli soldiers watch nearby without intervening.\nMatthew Miller, the State Department spokesman, condemned Mr. Achimair's killing in a statement on Monday. But he also said Washington was 'increasingly concerned by the violence against Palestinian civilians and their property that ensued in the West Bank after Achimair's disappearance.'\n'We strongly condemn these murders, and our thoughts are with their loved ones,' Mr. Miller said.

Politicians in both parties call the app a threat to national security. But its reach is felt most acutely in our culture. Since it first arrived in the United States in 2018 (after merging with another app), its 15-second gulps of entertainment have become a fixture in the lives of tens of millions of Americans \u2014 including those who've never opened the app.\nThe engine that powers this juggernaut is TikTok's recommendation algorithm, which figures out what users like and populates a customized feed of addictive videos. It's called the For You Page, or FYP. It was not built to connect people with friends, the way Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat were. It was built to entertain.\nAs the app fights the most serious threat yet to its autonomy, my colleagues and I explored the ways that its innovation has reshaped American lives. In today's newsletter, I'll spotlight a few of them.\nHollywood. The film industry at first ignored and feared TikTok. But it eventually embraced the platform as a marketing tool for a new generation of moviegoers. The Sony romantic comedy 'Anyone But You' drew a weak $8 million in ticket sales over Christmas weekend, my colleague Brooks Barnes, who covers Hollywood companies, writes. But 'the movie turned into a full-fledged hit ($219 million) after TikTok users (at the urging of Sony) began making videos of themselves re-enacting the credit sequence.' The app is virtually a 'ticket-selling machine,' he writes.\nHollywood. The film industry at first ignored and feared TikTok.

These clips constitute 'a TikTok genre, dating back at least five years, in which students use school bathrooms as film sets for dance routines, lip-syncing clips or critiques of unclean lavatories,' my colleague Natasha Singer, who covers tech use in schools, writes. School bathrooms have also become 'arenas to stage, film and post videos of bullying, physical assaults on schoolmates and acts of vandalism.'\nSchools.

For 14 percent of American adults, TikTok is a regular news source, up from 3 percent in 2020. People who don't have traditional backgrounds in journalism, akin to bloggers for the TikTok era, aggregate and share information in snappy videos. Traditional news outlets are scrambling to catch up \u2014 and fretting about accuracy and context. Organizations including The New York Times are also making short-form videos in which reporters talk to the camera about their stories, the TikTok way.\nCooking. Recipes got a makeover on TikTok, as creators depart from static images and step-by-step instructions. My colleague Becky Hughes, NYT Cooking's social media editor, writes that traditional recipes have given way to looser concepts. That has helped create trends like eggs fried in a puddle of pesto, sandwich fillings chopped into a homogenous mixture and mini pancakes served like cereal, she says. 'The most shareable recipes are the ones that you can watch once, then turn around and make \u2014 no measurements, bake times or reading needed,' she writes.
