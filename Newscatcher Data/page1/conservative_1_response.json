            "summary": "Jen Hubbell ​b​ecame a real estate agent ​in Greenville, S.C., because she ​b​elieved a good life started with a good home, and now her phone​ buzzed regularly w​ith ​calls from out-of-state clients who believed they could find ​b​oth things in ​her city.\n​M​any were staunch conservatives ​f​rom deeply blue states like New York, Washington and California, fed up with the​ politics there.​ Could Ms. Hubbell, a conservative herself, help them​ find neighborhoods of like-minded people?\nHer response was always emphatic: 'You are going to love it here.'\nMs. Hubbell is the lead agent in South Carolina for Conservative Move, a Texas-based company that helps conservatives migrate to solidly red places. ('When your community no longer reflects morals and values, it might be time to move,' its website says.) And ​with South Carolina surpassing Florida last year as the fastest-growing state in the country, she is keeping very busy.\nThe in-migration has fueled a yearslong real estate boom across South Carolina, where Republicans have controlled the governor's mansion and legislature for more than two decades. Real estate agents like Ms. Hubbell say many of their clients are religious conservatives whose reasons for moving include opposition to policies like abortion access, support for transgender rights and vaccine mandates during the pandemic.\nPaul Chabot, the founder and president of Conservative Move, which works with about 500 agents across the country, said that when he started his company in 2017, there were not a lot of people asking to go to South Carolina.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Not every workplace features a guillotine. At a book conservation lab tucked beneath the first floor of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the office guillotine might as well be a water cooler or a file cabinet for all that it fazes the staff. 'We have a lot of violent equipment,' said Mindell Dubansky, who heads the Sherman Fairchild Center for Book Conservation.\na file cabinet for all that it fazes the staff. 'We have a lot of violent equipment,' said Mindell Dubansky, who heads the Sherman Fairchild Center for Book Conservation. Fearsome machines are part of daily life at the lab, which serves as a hospital where ailing books from every department of the museum are restored to health. The lab's six employees process an astonishing 2,500 books each year.\nThose books arrive daily and are assessed for treatment by the conservation staff. As with any object made of organic materials, books degrade over time. Bindings break, pages tear and crumble, adhesive materials cease to adhere. Decay can be hastened by pests, mold, moisture, heat, cold and plain old use, among countless other factors. Some of the books are rare and valuable. Others are ordinary — say, a book from European Paintings that was dropped on the floor and suffered a broken spine.\n'Unlike the rest of the art in this building, our work is being handled,' Dubansky said. 'We have to intervene as little as possible while maintaining the function of a book — and making it look like we were never there.'\nImage The office guillotine comes in handy not for beheading colleagues but for slicing large stacks of paper. 'It makes a terrifying noise,' said Andrijana Sajic, an assistant librarian for book conservation. Although the Met has performed book maintenance in-house for nearly a century, it wasn't until 2011 that the current facility, designed in close collaboration with conservation staff, opened its doors. With its antique tools, modern touches and intriguing rotation of patients, the renovated lab exudes a certain mad-scientist magic.\n'For people who love books, entering the lab is like getting hit with Cupid's arrow,' Dubansky said. 'People walk through this door with a dazed expression on their face, wanting to dedicate their entire lives to making sure the books are OK.'\nDubansky has advice for readers who wish to keep their own books — rare or not — in superb condition. Light, dust and extreme fluctuations in temperature should be avoided. ('Basements and attics are not your friends.') Don't allow books to lean like the Tower of Pisa. Instead, store them in a vertical or horizontal position. Consider applying a Mylar dust jacket cover to books that warrant special protection. And as satisfying as it might be to 'crack open' a book, do not actually crack open a book unless you're aiming to cause spinal injury.\nVideo A cast-iron press comes in handy for reinforcing the relationship between the hinge and joint of a book. After placing a book between brass-edged boards, a staff member will crank the wheel tightly and allow the book to remain sandwiched for as long as necessary—anywhere from a minute to several hours. Credit Credit... Of course, books are meant to be read and not just revered. When it comes to bookmarks, Dubansky recommended steering clear of Post-it notes and paper clips, both of which compromise the integrity of the underlying page. Leather bookmarks, while temptingly elegant, are too acidic for the job. When asked about the practice of dog-earing, Dubansky's brows shot skyward: 'Talk about flagrant abuse!'\nThe safest bookmark happens to be the easiest: a thin slip of regular old paper.",

But that didn't stop the government there, at the time led by the populist Law and Justice Party, from choosing him to represent the country at the Venice Biennale.\n'Of course, I was happy,' Czwartos, 57, recalled recently.\nBut just weeks after he got the news, Czwartos's opportunity vanished.\nAfter liberal, centrist and moderately conservative political parties formed a new government in Poland, they quickly dropped Czwartos as the country's Venice representative. Instead, the new culture minister announced that he would send Open Group, a Ukrainian collective, to the Biennale instead.\nCzwartos was furious. The decision, made with little explanation, 'was an act of political censorship,' Czwartos said, adding that the Polish government had acted like a totalitarian state.\nSo Czwartos made his own decision: He would to go to Venice anyway, the government be damned.\nA detail view of 'Fish II' by Czwartos, which depicts three Polish anti-communist resistance fighters killed in 1951.

            "summary": "Two years ago, Nina Jankowicz briefly led an agency at the Department of Homeland Security created to fight disinformation — the establishment of which provoked a political and legal battle over the government's role in policing lies and other harmful content online that continues to reverberate.\nNow she has re-entered the fray with a new nonprofit organization intended to fight against what she and others have described as a coordinated campaign by conservatives and others to undermine researchers, like her, who study the sources of disinformation.\nAlready a lightning rod for critics of her work on the subject, Ms. Jankowicz inaugurated the organization with a letter accusing three Republican committee chairmen in the House of Representatives of abusing their subpoena powers to silence think tanks and universities that expose the sources of disinformation.\n'These tactics echo the dark days of McCarthyism, but with a frightening 21st-century twist,' she wrote in the letter on Monday with the organization's co-founder, Carlos Alvarez-Aranyos, a public-relations consultant who in 2020 was involved in efforts to defend the integrity of the American voting system.\nThe inception of the group, called the American Sunlight Project, reflects how divisive the issue of identifying and combating disinformation has become as the 2024 presidential election approaches. It also represents a tacit admission that the informal networks formed at major universities and research organizations to address the explosion of disinformation online have failed to mount a substantial defense against a campaign, waged largely on the right, depicting their work as part of an effort to silence conservatives.\nTaking place in the courts, in conservative media and the Republican-led House Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, the campaign has largely succeeded in eviscerating efforts to monitor disinformation, especially around the integrity of the American election system.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump that they fear could bring an end to U.S. support for Ukraine, some of Russia's most fervent foes are taking a different tack: making nice with the Trump camp.\nTo that end, the governing party of Lithuania, a steadfast supporter of Ukraine, last month organized meetings between Ukrainians, Baltic politicians who want increases in military spending to counter Russia, and a group of former Trump administration officials. Also attending were members of pro-Trump groups like the Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative group skeptical about helping Ukraine.\nLeading the participants from Ukraine was Oleksandr Merezhko, the chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament's foreign affairs committee and an ally of President Volodymyr Zelensky. Reaching out to the Trump camp, he said, was simply a recognition of Ukraine's perilous vulnerability to the shifting sands of American politics.\n'When we are fighting for our survival, we can't afford to antagonize either Biden or Trump,' Mr. Merezhko said. 'If we place the wrong bet, we risk losing our country.'\nMr. Trump has not detailed his plans for Ukraine if he is re-elected, but many of his supporters are strongly opposed to helping the country in its battle against Russia.\nOleksandr Merezhko, left, the chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament's foreign affairs committee, and Zygimantas Pavilionis, a conservative member of Lithuania's Parliament, in Washington in February.

            "summary": "Book bans in public schools continued to surge in the first half of this school year, according to a report released on Tuesday by PEN America, a free speech organization.\nFrom July to December 2023, PEN found that more than 4,300 books were removed from schools across 23 states — a figure that surpassed the number of bans from the entire previous academic year.\nThe rise in book bans has accelerated in recent years, driven by conservative groups and by new laws and regulations that limit what kinds of books children can access. Since the summer of 2021, PEN has tracked book removals in 42 states and found instances in both Republican- and Democratic-controlled districts.\nThe numbers likely fail to capture the full scale of book removals. PEN compiles its figures based on news reports, public records requests and publicly available data, but many removals go unreported.\nHere are some of the report's key findings.\nBook bans are not new in the United States. School and public libraries have long had procedures for addressing complaints, which were often brought by parents concerned about their children's reading material.\nBut the current wave stands out in its scope. Censorship efforts have become increasingly organized and politicized, supercharged by conservative groups like Moms for Liberty and Utah Parents United, which have pushed for legislation that regulates the content of library collections. Since PEN began tracking book bans, it has counted more than 10,000 instances of books being removed from schools. Many of the targeted titles feature L.G.B.T.Q. characters, or deal with race and racism, PEN found.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Speaker Ben Toma walked off the floor of the Arizona House of Representatives, resolute — if stressed — after he cast the pivotal vote to again block an effort to repeal the state's 1864 abortion ban.\nHe knew he was going against the wishes of top Republicans like former President Donald J. Trump, who had called on the Legislature to change the ban. He worried about political blowback to Republicans in the coming elections.\nBut Mr. Toma saw himself as upholding moral principles far more foundational than current politics, the past president or even the ban itself. Attempts to undercut it as 'a Civil-War-era law' were 'sort of ridiculous,' he said in an interview on Wednesday after the vote. He pointed to the Constitution and Bill of Rights — and the Bible.\n'Even all of our laws are actually based on, what, the Ten Commandments, and the Book of Genesis, which are thousands of years ago,' he said. 'The whole idea that we are equal in the sight of God, our maker, that we have unalienable rights, all that, that is all fundamentally a Christian worldview.'\nThis commitment to Arizona's 1864 ban — a near-total ban that the State Supreme Court recently reinstated — underscores the power of conservative Christian abortion opponents in shaping American abortion laws, even as they represent a minority view. Despite a popular backlash against the Supreme Court's decision overturning a constitutional right to abortion in 2022, anti-abortion forces have maintained a stronghold in many state legislatures, not only in deeply conservative states like Alabama, but also closely divided ones like Arizona.\nMembers of Students for Life of America went door to door try to persuade voters not to support a proposed ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights in the Arizona Constitution.

She was 94.\nConcerned Women for America, which Mrs. LaHaye founded in 1979, announced her death in a statement.\nIn the 1980s, Mrs. LaHaye ran an office in Washington of more than 25 employees, including lawyers and lobbyists. She urged Congress to send military aid to the right-wing contras of Nicaragua; rallied her members to barrage the television networks to protest condom commercials; and testified in the Senate for President Ronald Reagan's Supreme Court nominees Antonin Scalia and Robert Bork.\nPresident Reagan appeared at Concerned Women of America's 1987 convention, as Judge Bork's nomination was facing fierce liberal opposition. He was greeted by signs stating, 'All Ladies Want Bork.' (The Senate rejected him.)\n'In just a few short years,' the president told Mrs. LaHaye's crowd, 'you've become the largest politically active women's group in the nation.' He called Mrs. LaHaye 'one of the powerhouses on the political scene today.'\nShe had arrived just two years earlier, moving her headquarters to Washington from California 'to be closer to the center of action,' she told The Arizona Republic in 1984.\nAt a news conference announcing her arrival, Mrs. LaHaye said that conservative women who turned to the Bible for guidance on women's role in the family and society — and not to the writings of Betty Friedan and other feminists — now had a public voice. 'This is our message: The feminists do not speak for all women in America, and C.W.A. is here in Washington to end the monopoly of feminists who claim to speak for all women,' she said.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The Goldwater Institute and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California ordinarily have little in common. One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation's most liberal states.\nBut for the past six years, they have been aligned on one highly charged issue: the need for some legal way to clear homeless encampments that have proliferated in cities throughout the West.\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court will consider an Oregon case that could reshape homelessness policy nationally. On its face, The City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks.\nThe City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks. More broadly, however, the case deals with one of the thorniest aspects of the homelessness crisis — the balance between the government's responsibility to protect public health and the human right to exist without housing.\nThe conflict has been particularly acute in the West, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has issued opinions over the past six years that officials blame for the sprawling tent encampments in public spaces that have spread since the pandemic. As voters' frustration has grown, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping, only to have the courts reject them.\nAdvocates for homeless people, the American Psychiatric Association and several left-leaning states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, argue that criminalizing homelessness only worsens the problem. More effective, they say, is focusing on housing, treatment, education and jobs for people who are homeless.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Britain's Conservative government finally won passage of its flagship immigration policy on Monday, enshrining a Rwanda deportation bill that human-rights campaigners say is inhumane, immigration experts say is unworkable and legal critics say has corroded the country's reputation for rule of law.\nThe legislation is designed to allow the government to put some asylum seekers on one-way flights to Rwanda, where they would have their claims processed by the authorities in that Central African country. If they were then granted refugee status, they would be resettled in Rwanda, not Britain.\nFrom the moment the plan was first introduced in 2022, under then Prime Minister Boris Johnson, experts said it would breach Britain's human rights obligations under domestic and international law.\nEven after the passage of the new bill, which came under heavy opposition in the House of Lords and effectively overrides a ruling by Britain's Supreme Court, any deportation attempts are likely to encounter a flurry of further legal challenges, making it unlikely that large numbers of asylum seekers will ever be sent to Rwanda.\nYet the current prime minister, Rishi Sunak, insisted on Monday that the government would operate multiple charter flights every month, starting in 10 to 12 weeks. 'These flights will go, come what may,' a feisty Mr. Sunak said, hours before the final vote. 'This is novel,' he said of the policy. 'It is innovative, but it will be a game changer.'\nThe plan's tortured journey into law speaks mostly to the state of politics in post-Brexit Britain: a divided Conservative Party, desperate to exploit anxiety about immigration to close a polling gap with the opposition Labour Party, has clung to the policy for two years despite legal setbacks and deep doubts about its expense and viability.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Britain's Conservative government hopes to pass the Safety of Rwanda Bill on Wednesday, after a prolonged back and forth through the two houses of Parliament in which the legislation has come under sustained criticism.\nThe bill is intended to clear the way for the government to put some asylum seekers on one-way flights to Rwanda, in Central Africa, without first hearing their cases. Human rights experts have denounced that approach, which they say breaches Britain's obligations under domestic and international law.\nCrucially, under the government's plans, even asylum seekers who were granted refugee status would be resettled in Rwanda, not Britain. The plan was deemed unlawful by Britain's highest court late last year, with judges ruling that Rwanda was not a safe country for refugees to have their asylum cases heard or to be resettled. The purpose of the government's new bill is to overrule the Supreme Court, in a complicated piece of legislative wrangling that has raised concerns about the rule of law and the separation of powers in Britain.\nThree successive Conservative prime ministers have pursued the plan, arguing that it would deter people from attempting the dangerous crossing of the English Channel in small boats. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has repeatedly vowed to 'stop the boats' before the British election this fall, and he has heralded the Rwanda bill as a crucial step toward that goal.\nBritain has already paid Rwanda hundreds of millions of British pounds in development support and in fees to enact the plan. But not a single asylum seeker has been sent there yet, and legal challenges could thwart future deportation attempts. Here's what has happened so far.\nMarch 2021\nThe British government, led at the time by the former prime minister Boris Johnson, pledged 'comprehensive reform' of the country's asylum system, floating several measures, including the removal of asylum seekers who arrive in Britain by boat or other 'illegal' routes to third countries for processing. Mr. Johnson, a leading campaigner for Brexit, had promised to 'take back control' of Britain's borders by leaving the European Union.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

That bill would require TikTok's Chinese owners to sell it within nine months, otherwise the app could be banned.\nAfter the House, the measures head to the Senate, which has already approved a similar package, and then to President Biden, who has vowed to sign them. Final approval would be an enormous victory in the long effort to fund Ukraine, and a defeat for the voices of isolationism in the Republican Party.",

The publisher responded: Has it occurred to you that in 15 years no one might care? She wrote the book. 'Stand by Your Man: An Autobiography' (1979) was a hit.\nThe essayist and editor Joseph Epstein — whose memoir 'Never Say You've Had a Lucky Life,' is out now, alongside a greatest-hits collection titled 'Familiarity Breeds Content' — has probably never heard Wynette sing except by accident. (In a 1993 essay, he wrote that he wished he didn't know who Willie Nelson was, because it was a sign of a compromised intellect.) But his memoir illustrates another reason not to wait too long to commit your life to print.\nThere is no indication that Epstein, who is in his late 80s, has lost a step. His prose is as genial and bland, if comparison to his earlier work is any indication, as it ever was. But there's a softness to his memories of people, perhaps because it was all so long ago. This is the sort of memoir that insists someone was funny, or erudite, or charismatic, while rarely providing the crucial details.\nEpstein aw-shucks his way into 'Never Say You've Had a Lucky Life' — pretending to be self-effacing while not being so in the least is one of his salient qualities as a writer — by warning readers, 'I may not have had a sufficiently interesting life to merit an autobiography.' This is because he 'did little, saw nothing notably historic, and endured not much out of the ordinary of anguish or trouble or exaltation.' Quickly, however, he concludes that his life is indeed worth relating, in part because 'over the years I have acquired the literary skill to recount that life well.'\nHere he is wrong in both directions. His story is interesting enough to warrant this memoir. His personal life has taken complicated turns. And as the longtime editor of the quarterly magazine The American Scholar, and a notably literate conservative culture warrior, he's been in the thick of things.\nis interesting enough to warrant this memoir. His personal life has taken complicated turns. And as the longtime editor of the quarterly magazine The American Scholar, and a notably literate conservative culture warrior, he's been in the thick of things. He does lack the skill to tell his own story, though, if by 'skill' we mean not well-scrubbed Strunk and White sentences but close and penetrating observation. Epstein favors tasseled loafers and bow ties, and most of his sentences read as if they were written by a sentient tasseled loafer and edited by a sentient bow tie.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

They have pointed to the document to sharply criticize the bureau and suggested, without evidence, that it was part of a broader campaign by the Biden administration to persecute Catholics and conservatives over their beliefs.\nThe memo was quickly withdrawn after being leaked, and top law enforcement officials have repeatedly distanced themselves from it.\nThe assessment by the Justice Department's watchdog found that agents in the F.B.I.'s office in Richmond, Va., improperly conflated the religious beliefs of activists with the likelihood they would engage in domestic terrorism, making it appear as if they were being targeted for the faith.\nBut after a 120-day review of the incident ordered by Congress, Michael E. Horowitz, the department's inspector general — drawing from the F.B.I. report and interviews conducted by his own investigators — found no evidence that 'anyone ordered or directed' anyone to investigate Catholics because of their religion.\nA statement from the F.B.I. on Thursday said the inspector general's review aligned with the bureau's own accounting.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

He was 88.\nHis daughter, Colleen Bartow, confirmed the death. She said he had been suffering from several respiratory ailments.\nMr. Walsh began his career in 1961 at The St. Louis Globe-Democrat, where he hot-dogged around the newsroom smoking cigars and used the floor as his ashtray.\n'Walsh had the tenacity of a pit bull and seemed to be developing some of the facial features of the breed,' Pat Buchanan, the conservative commentator who was then an editorial writer at the paper, wrote in his autobiography, 'Right from the Beginning' (1988). 'His laugh was loud and uncontrolled and bordered on the malicious.'\nMr. Buchanan added, 'When Walsh sank his teeth into a politician, he usually did serious damage, and he was always reluctant to let go.'\nInvestigative reporters are an idiosyncratic breed of journalist.

            "summary": "Fishing guides in the Florida Keys began reporting unusual sightings to Ross Boucek last fall. Small bait fish, especially at night, would start spinning in tight circles in the water, seemingly in distress.\nAs the months went by, more reports trickled in to Dr. Boucek, a biologist with the Bonefish & Tarpon Trust, a nonprofit conservation group. Bigger fish — jacks, snook — were swimming in spirals or upside down in the shallow waters of the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. So were stingrays and the occasional shark.\nDr. Boucek called scientists at state agencies and universities. They held meetings, took samples of the water and fish and tried to figure out what might be causing the fish to behave so strangely. A parasite? A sewage spill? Some other contaminant?\nThen, in January, the mysterious ailment began afflicting smalltooth sawfish, a type of large, prehistoric-looking ray named for the look of its long snout lined with sharp teeth. The sawfish, which are endangered and reliably found only in southernmost Florida, started dying.\nThe search for answers became urgent, Dr. Boucek said, 'the second an endangered species started dying off at unprecedented rates.'\nDr. Boucek now spends much of his time in a wet suit, flippers and a snorkeling mask and collecting samples.

She was 86.\nThe cause was pancreatic cancer, her son Solomon Karmel said.\nMs. Karmel's tenure on the S.E.C., from September 1977 to February 1980, came at a hinge point in thinking about the role of government in regulating the economy.\nOn one hand, Stanley Sporkin was the S.E.C.'s crusading chief enforcement officer, exposing corporate corruption that caused scandals as far away as Honduras, Japan and Italy.\nYet at the same time, President Jimmy Carter, who appointed Ms. Karmel, had been elected the year before on a platform of making government leaner. His policy programs included deregulating the airline industry, measures that presaged a tilt toward laissez-faire economics in the 1980s.\nMs. Karmel seemed to be in the middle. She had worked as a lawyer at the S.E.C. early in her career, but she had also gone into the private sector representing firms like Merrill Lynch, often opposing in litigation the agency she had once worked for.\nWithin about a year of becoming an S.E.C. commissioner, she was the subject of two profiles on the cover of The New York Times business section, cited as 'the most conservative' person on the five‐member panel.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "A government-appointed commission in Germany recommended on Monday that lawmakers legalize abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy, a move that could push the country into a long-avoided debate on an issue that for decades remained in a legal gray zone.\nOutside of exceptions for medical reasons or because of rape, abortions in Germany are technically illegal. But, in practice, they are broadly permitted in the first 12 weeks if a woman has received mandatory counseling and then waits at least three days to terminate the pregnancy.\nAbortion rights activists say Germany has grown increasingly out of sync with the rest of Europe, where several countries have recently moved to loosen restrictions on abortion or to bolster laws protecting access to the procedure — especially after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\nLast month, legislators in France voted to explicitly enshrine access to abortion in the Constitution, making their country the first in the world to do so.\nIn Poland, where a previous conservative government enacted a near-total ban on abortion, politicians are moving forward with draft legislation to loosen some of Europe's most restrictive abortion laws.\nLast year, Germany's chancellor, Olaf Scholz followed through on one of the agenda items set out by his governing coalition by setting up a commission of ethicists, doctors, psychiatrists and other experts to issue recommendations on abortion, egg donations and surrogacy.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Just last year, Brad Herman, a longtime behind-the-scenes aide to celebrities, drew praise from the family of Cindy Birdsong, an ailing former member of the Supremes. He was credited with helping to rescue her from what they described as a friend's undue influence over her care and finances.\nBut now, Mr. Herman has been named in a petition brought by Ms. Birdsong's son, who is accusing him in court papers of financial elder abuse and misappropriation of her money.\nThe son, Charles Hewlett, who has been appointed the conservator of his mother's affairs, is seeking damages and the return of what his petition describes as missing funds.\nThe allegations follow months of court proceedings over who should control a conservatorship overseeing the finances and medical decisions of Ms. Birdsong, 84, who was once part of a Motown group that became music royalty.\nToday, Ms. Birdsong is not able to communicate and is on a feeding tube after a series of strokes. She has lived at nursing facilities and hospitals since 2021 and a judge ultimately put Mr. Hewlett in charge of her affairs late last year.\n'Mr. Herman used his position of trust and confidence to take advantage of Ms. Birdsong's dependency and exercised care, custody and control over Ms. Birdsong's property,' argues the petition filed in Los Angeles Superior Court this month by Susan Geffen, a lawyer for Mr. Hewlett.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "In recent decades, American universities have expanded their diversity programs to address concerns about the underrepresentation of minority groups on campus.\nBut over the past few years, many Republican-led states have taken steps to restrict or eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs and initiatives at public universities and colleges, with conservative lawmakers and groups arguing that such programs can be discriminatory to the people who are left out. But supporters of such efforts say they are necessary to promote diversity and help students from various backgrounds succeed on campus.\nFor some universities, the opposition to diversity programs comes at a challenging time, as they face an incoming student shortage and skepticism of the value of a college degree at today's prices. And after the Supreme Court's ban on race-conscious admissions last year, some educators are even more concerned about diversity on their campuses.\nHere's what to know about the efforts to limit D.E.I. programs in higher education.\nBy and large, D.E.I. initiatives in colleges and universities include programs, campus activities and events, curriculums, recruitment, admissions and policies that are focused on promoting and increasing the representation and participation of individuals from groups that have historically been underrepresented.\nThose groups can be based on race, ethnicity, national origin, gender and gender identity, age, culture, religion, disability status, socioeconomic status and sexual orientation, as well as other aspects of one's social identity.\nSome schools also have a requirement for prospective students and faculty members to include diversity statements in their applications, meaning a written pledge describing how they would help foster diversity on campus.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

As protests over Israel's war in Gaza continue to intensify, especially on college campuses, activists are preparing to be in Chicago this summer for the Democratic National Convention.\nImage Demonstrators faced off against National Guardsmen outside of the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Credit... Barton Silverman/The New York Times The very idea sends some Democrats right back to 1968, when their convention, also in Chicago, was overshadowed by infighting and violence between the police and antiwar protesters. Back then, many voters watching the nightly news got the impression that the party could not control its own delegates, never mind a country that was wrestling with an unpopular war.\nProtests over the Israel-Hamas war could also complicate this year's convention and the Democratic messaging for President Biden, whom Republicans have eagerly cast as too indulgent of chaos and disorder in American society. Last week, Fox News and other conservative outlets repeatedly showed demonstrations that made the country seem on the edge: Columbia University sending in the police to arrest students on campus; protesters shouting 'genocide!' at President Biden at a campaign stop; demonstrators chaining themselves to cars to block traffic, creating gridlock.\n'The whole Republican message is, ‘The world is out of control and Biden is not in command,'' said David Axelrod, the Democratic strategist and adviser to former President Barack Obama. 'They will exploit any images of disorder to abet and support it.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, in a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis.\nThe case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces.\nThe issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years.\nThe dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces. The question before the justices is whether those laws went so far that they punished people for being homeless and violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\nA group of homeless residents is challenging the city's enforcement of the ordinances as unconstitutional, arguing that they are involuntarily homeless in the city because there are not shelter beds available and that the city may not punish them without offering shelter.\nCity officials in Grants Pass counter that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment. They warn that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would fuel homeless encampments across the country and hamstring the ability of local governments to respond.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "A new Pentagon review of the events leading up to the bombing that killed 13 American service members at the airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, in August 2021, has reaffirmed earlier findings that U.S. troops could not have prevented the deadly violence.\nThe review's conclusions focus on the final days and hours at Abbey Gate before the attack, which also killed as many as 170 civilians. The review provides new details about the Islamic State bomber who carried out the suicide mission, including how he slipped into the crowds trying to evacuate the capital's airport just moments before detonating explosives.\nSome Marines who were at the gate have said they identified the suspected bomber — who became known to investigators as 'Bald Man in Black' — in the crowds hours before the attack but were twice denied permission by their superiors to shoot him. But the review, building on a previous investigation made public in February 2022, rejected those accusations.\nThe narrative of missed opportunities to avert tragedy has gained momentum over the past year among conservatives and has contributed to broader Republican criticisms of the Biden administration's troop withdrawal and evacuation from Kabul in August 2021.\nThe bombing was a searing experience for the military after 20 years of war in Afghanistan. Thirteen flag-draped coffins were flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, and a succession of funerals were held across the country for the service members, most of them under the age of 25.\nMilitary officials had stood by the conclusions of the earlier inquiry that a lone Islamic State suicide bomber carried out the attack and was not joined by accomplices firing into the crowd.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Opening arguments in former President Donald J. Trump's criminal trial will not start until next week, but media coverage of the proceedings has already been met with partisan furor.\nJury selection, which began on Monday, produced a full 12-person panel by Thursday and ended Friday with the selection of alternates. Over the course of the week, many conservatives claimed that the selection process had been rigged against Mr. Trump, while some progressives argued that the press was releasing too many details about possible jurors, putting them in potential danger.\nJournalists and commentators covering the trial, being held in Manhattan, face a tricky balancing act: inform the public about one of the most consequential cases in recent memory while not putting its participants in harm's way.\nThe judge, Juan M. Merchan, has ordered that the names of the potential and selected jurors remain confidential. The proceedings on Friday kicked off with a warning from a court official to reporters and members of the public attending the trial to follow courtroom rules around filming, photographs and technology.\nand members of the public attending the trial to follow courtroom rules around filming, photographs and technology. Several news outlets, including The New York Times, have published some information about the lives of the people in the jury pool, such as their profession and the neighborhood where they live.\nJesse Watters, a prime-time host on Fox News, went further than most. On Tuesday, he showed footage of one prospective juror who had been excused. The woman explained that she had told the judge that she could be unbiased, then explained that 'it's very difficult for anyone really in this country to come to this without prior opinions.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "A far-right party emerged on Thursday as a potential kingmaker in Croatia after the governing conservatives finished first in a bitterly contested parliamentary election but fell short of winning enough seats to form a new government.\nThe outcome of Wednesday's vote signaled a new era of messy political uncertainty in the Balkan nation, which has been dominated by one party, the Croatian Democratic Union, or HDZ, since 1991 when it declared independence from Yugoslavia.\nThe HDZ, led by the incumbent Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic, won 61 seats in the 151-member legislature, according to the near-final official tally. That was more than all its rivals, including Rivers of Justice, a left-leaning coalition formed by President Zoran Milanovic, which won 42 seats to finish second. The far-right Homeland Movement finished third with 13 seats.\nSpeaking early Thursday in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, Mr. Plenkovic said his party had 'convincingly won' but acknowledged that he would need help from rival groups to form a government and secure a third term as prime minister.\nHe later said in a post on Facebook that talks had already started with potential allies that he did not name. 'Everything is going well,' he said, and predicted that a government would formed 'soon,' putting a brave face on his party's losses.\nTihomir Cipek, a political science professor at the University of Zagreb, said the result reflected a general trend in Europe, particularly among new members of the European Union, which Croatia joined in 2013. 'The political center starts losing voters to parties to the far right and far left that are reaction to Europeanization,' he said.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "When a young former government employee said on national television in 2021 that she had been sexually assaulted in Australia's Parliament two years earlier, it shocked the nation and unleashed a wave of anger aimed at the country's insular, male-dominated political establishment.\nThe employee, Brittany Higgins accused her colleague Bruce Lehrmann of raping her when she was inebriated, and said that she felt pressure from the government at the time not to report the assault. She became a figurehead for a reckoning on women's rights that ultimately contributed to the electoral ousting of Australia's conservative national government. But for years, there was no legal conclusion to the case.\nOn Monday, it was finally — somewhat — settled, in a roundabout way.\nMr. Lehrmann lost a civil defamation suit that he had filed against the television station that first broadcast Ms. Higgins' account, with the judge ruling that based on the available evidence, it was more likely than not that Mr. Lehrmann had raped her.\nThe proceedings did not take place in a criminal court, and the offense did not have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, the standard of proof was a balance of probabilities — a legal term meaning whether something is more likely than not to have occurred.\nStill, for many, this was a long-awaited validation for Ms. Higgins.\n'Something resembling justice has been done,' said Sarah Maddison, a political science professor at the University of Melbourne.\nJustice Michael Lee of the Australian Federal Court in Sydney determined on Monday that it was more likely than not that Ms. Higgins had been inebriated, unaware of her surroundings, and lying still 'like a log' while Mr. Lehrmann assaulted her. The judge found that Mr. Lehrmann had been 'hellbent' on having sex with her, disregarding whether she had the capacity to consent.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "On a Monday in mid-March, the Wisconsin Republican Party gathered about 50 conservative activists on a Zoom call to train them in how to become poll workers, helping oversee and monitor the casting and counting of votes.\nHeavily Democratic areas of the battleground state were a key focus. 'Eau Claire, Madison, Milwaukee — that type,' Mike Hoffman, the state party's election integrity director, said as he ticked off places being targeted.\n'We're keeping a close eye on you,' he recounted telling one city clerk, according to audio recordings of the party's training sessions obtained by The New York Times.\nThe Wisconsin training sessions are a small part of an expansive operation announced on Friday by former President Donald J. Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee, which plan to dispatch more than 100,000 volunteers and lawyers to monitor and potentially challenge the electoral process in each battleground state. They will focus on every aspect of voting, including mail ballots, voting machines and post-Election Day recounts and audits.\nThe sprawling effort is rooted in Mr. Trump's persistent false claims that Democrats cheated to win the 2020 election. His allies have helped turn that belief into Republican doctrine despite the overwhelming conclusion by Democratic and G.O.P. election officials, as well as federal and state judges, that no evidence of widespread fraud exists.\n'Democrat tricks from 2020 won't work this time,' Charlie Spies, the chief counsel of the R.N.C., pledged in a statement announcing the program. 'In 2024, we're going to beat the Democrats at their own game and the R.N.C. legal team will be working tirelessly to ensure that elections officials follow the rules in administering elections.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "NPR has suspended Uri Berliner, the senior business editor who broke ranks and published an essay arguing that the nonprofit radio network had allowed liberal bias to affect its coverage.\nMr. Berliner was suspended by the network for five days, starting last Friday, for violating the network's policy against doing work outside the organization without first getting permission.\nMr. Berliner acknowledged his suspension in an interview with NPR on Monday, providing one of the network's reporters with a copy of the written rebuke. In presenting the warning, NPR said that Mr. Berliner had failed to clear his work for outside outlets, adding that he would be fired if he violated the policy again.\nMr. Berliner's essay was published last week in The Free Press, a popular Substack publication.\nHe declined to comment about the suspension. NPR said it did not comment on personnel matters.\nThe revelation of Mr. Berliner's punishment is the latest aftershock to rattle NPR since Mr. Berliner published his essay. Employees at the public radio network were taken aback by Mr. Berliner's public condemnation of the broadcaster, and several have said that they no longer trust him because of his remarks. Mr. Berliner told The New York Times last week that he did not reach out to the network before publishing his essay.\nAfter Mr. Berliner's essay was published, NPR's new chief executive, Katherine Maher, came under renewed scrutiny as conservative activists resurfaced a series of years-old social media posts criticizing former President Donald J. Trump and embracing progressive causes. One of the activists, Christopher Rufo, has pressured media organizations into covering controversies involving influential figures, such as the plagiarism allegations against Claudine Gay, the former Harvard president.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "excerpt": "Over time researchers have found fewer of the insects turning up in light traps, suggesting they may be less attracted to some kinds of light than they once were.",
            "summary": "It used to be that you could put a black light at the edge of a cornfield at night and expect a bountiful harvest of moths the next morning. For entomologists, such light traps have provided an invaluable record of moth numbers. But in recent decades, light traps have shown dwindling catches of insects of all kinds. Some have interpreted these empty traps as evidence of a documented decline in insect numbers around the world.\nBut there might be other factors at play. In a paper published on Friday in the Journal of Insect Conservation, researchers report that while some light traps show declining numbers of corn earworm moths, a well-known agricultural pest, their catches in another kind of trap are as healthy as ever. The results suggest that something has changed in the moths' attraction to light.\nFrom the very beginning of the study of evolution, entomologists have wondered about moths' tendency to fling themselves at light sources. That included Roland Trimen, who wrote to Charles Darwin to ask how he explained moths' unhealthy obsession with flames.\n'Darwin was like, ‘Very true, maybe it's because lights are quite new and moths haven't quite figured it out yet,'' recounted Avalon Owens, an entomologist at Harvard and an author of the new paper. 'But you might expect that over time they will stop doing this. He literally put that out there 150 years ago, and everybody just sort of forgot.'\nThe fact that natural selection might punish the very behavior scientists used to track moths made Dr. Owens wonder: Were there any tracking programs that used more than one kind of trap?\nShe discovered that a handful of farms in the United States used both light traps and pheromone traps, baited with a hormone produced by female moths, to keep an eye on levels of the corn earworm moth. She and her colleagues analyzed the number of moths that were caught in each kind of trap over the years, with the longest records, from Delaware, stretching back 25 years.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Kennedy Jr. threatening to upend the presidential race went from an idea to a reality in one of the country's most consequential battlegrounds on Thursday, when Mr. Kennedy qualified for the ballot in Michigan.\nThe decision by the Natural Law Party to grant Mr. Kennedy its ballot line in November ensures he will be a factor in a pivotal swing state where the presidential election is expected to be incredibly close and where President Biden has already shown vulnerability with key Democratic constituencies. During Michigan's primary in February, a protest movement over Mr. Biden's support for Israel's war in Gaza drew significant support.\nMr. Kennedy, a lifelong Democrat and the scion of perhaps the nation's most famous Democratic family, is running as an independent in 2024 and polling higher in early surveys than any third-party candidate since Ross Perot, the self-funding billionaire who ran in the 1990s.\nHis independent candidacy has earned him the estrangement of his own family — who campaigned this week with Mr. Biden in Pennsylvania — and many of his previous colleagues from the environmental movement, who denounced his candidacy publicly on Friday.\nMr. Kennedy has emerged as a leading voice of vaccine skepticism, both before and after Covid-19 vaccine, and dabbled in conspiratorial theories, including about the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, his father. He had initially declared his 2024 campaign as a Democratic challenger to Mr. Biden — and was heavily featured in conservative media — until he switched last fall to run as an independent.\nBoth parties are already rushing to define Mr. Kennedy as he races to get on the ballot nationwide.\nBrian Hughes, an adviser to Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, called Mr. Kennedy 'a leftist and liberal with a history of supporting an extreme environmental agenda that rivals Joe Biden for its ability to kill American jobs.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Each year, thousands of baby green sea turtles clamber across a beautiful, white-sand paradise that is one of the largest hatching sites of this species in the Atlantic, adorably making their way to the sea. There's one noticeable absence: people.\nThe spectacular hatching events take place between August and December on Poilão Island, a tiny, uninhabited speck off the coast of Guinea-Bissau in West Africa. It is the southernmost island of the 88 that make up the Bijagós archipelago, a UNESCO biosphere reserve. Last year, turtles laid more than 44,000 nests on its 1.4 mile-long beach.\nWhile the masses of turtles seem to have little trouble finding the spot to lay their eggs — some swim more than 600 miles across the North Atlantic — it's hard to imagine somewhere more challenging for human turtle-lovers to reach.\nThe country's tourism minister, Alberto Demba Touré, said that access is a main challenge. 'We want to increase the tourists who go to the Bijagós,' he said. Last year, UNESCO declared its support for the Bijagós Islands to seek World Heritage List status, which, if successful, would increase its visibility and strengthen its environmental protections.\nTurtle conservation programs have become a staple of resorts in many popular destinations, including in Hawaii, Mexico and throughout the Caribbean. Guinea-Bissau may like to capture a meager sliver of that pie, but it would be with steep challenges.\nPolitically fragile Guinea-Bissau has very little infrastructure and is one of the world's poorest and least touristed nations. Most flights to Bissau, the country's sleepy capital on the mainland, require a connection in Lisbon or Dakar, Senegal. Then, from Bissau, it's a bumpy one-hour drive to the coast, and five to seven hours in a speedboat (depending on the route) to Poilão Island.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The House voted resoundingly on Saturday to approve $95 billion in foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, as Speaker Mike Johnson put his job on the line to advance the long-stalled aid package by marshaling support from mainstream Republicans and Democrats.\nIn four back-to-back votes, overwhelming bipartisan coalitions of lawmakers approved fresh rounds of funding for the three U.S. allies, as well as another bill meant to sweeten the deal for conservatives that could result in a nationwide ban of TikTok.\nThe scene on the House floor reflected both the broad support in Congress for continuing to help the Ukrainian military beat back Russia, and the extraordinary political risk taken by Mr. Johnson to defy the anti-interventionist wing of his party who had sought to thwart the measure. Minutes before the vote on assistance for Kyiv, Democrats began to wave small Ukrainian flags on the House floor, as hard-right Republicans jeered.\nThe legislation includes $60 billion for Kyiv; $26 billion for Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza; and $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific region. It would direct the president to seek repayment from the Ukrainian government of $10 billion in economic assistance, a concept supported by former President Donald J. Trump, who had pushed for any aid to Kyiv to be in the form of a loan. But it also would allow the president to forgive those loans starting in 2026.\nIt also contained a measure to help pave the way to selling off frozen Russian sovereign assets to help fund the Ukrainian war effort, and a new round of sanctions on Iran. The Senate is expected to pass the legislation as early as Tuesday and send it to President Biden's desk, capping its tortured journey through Congress.\n'Our adversaries are working together to undermine our Western values and demean our democracy,' Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said Saturday as the House debated the measure. 'We cannot be afraid at this moment. We have to do what's right. Evil is on the march. History is calling and now is the time to act.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "excerpt": "Two ex-contestants on 'The Apprentice' sold the former president on the idea of a social media platform. Now, the company and the pair are wrangling over their stake.",
            "summary": "Twenty years ago, Wes Moss and Andy Litinsky met Donald J. Trump as contestants on his reality TV show, 'The Apprentice' — a connection that led them to help launch the former president's social media platform, Truth Social, with his blessing.\nNow, they might as well be starring in an episode of 'Family Feud.'\nFor weeks, Mr. Moss and Mr. Litinsky have been fighting with Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, over their roughly 8 percent stake in the company. In February, they sued the company, claiming that Trump Media — which made its trading debut last month at an $8 billion valuation — was trying to deprive them of the full value of their shares. Now they also claim the company is trying to prevent them from selling those shares.\nIn a separate lawsuit that followed, Trump Media claimed that Mr. Moss and Mr. Litinsky should forfeit their shares because their poor decision-making had contributed to a yearslong delay in its merger with Digital World Acquisition Corporation. Trump Media agreed to merge with Digital World, a cash-rich shell company, in 2021 as a way to go public, but the deal closed only in March.\nThe pair's stake is worth more than $220 million based on the current $26 share price of Trump Media, compared with $2 billion for Mr. Trump. Overall, the stock has fallen about 62 percent from where it began trading on March 26.\nThe litigation provides a portrait of some of the chaos that has bedeviled Trump Media since its inception. The lawsuits are also a distraction for the fledgling company, which is struggling to show that it is a viable business rather than a money-losing entity whose value is derived solely from Mr. Trump's presence on its flagship platform. On Tuesday, the company announced plans to launch a streaming video service to draw in more users.\nMr. Moss, now an Atlanta financial planner and radio host, and Mr. Litinsky, a conservative media personality, met Mr. Trump during the second season of 'The Apprentice,' which ran for 15 episodes in 2004. Mr. Trump 'fired' the two men in Weeks 11 and 12. Mr. Litinsky would later take a job as president of Mr. Trump's television production company.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The Algreen Soil Saver Composter user guide estimates that a third of all household waste (including yard waste) can go into an at-home composter. That may not seem like much, but by my conservative calculation, I've deposited roughly 1,900 pounds of organic materials into my bin over the past six or so years. My spent coffee grounds alone, at about 5 to 6 ounces a day, account for nearly 40% of that.\nDespite the fact that I don't do anything to help my food scraps decompose, my family has had no unpleasant experiences with rodents or funky smells (although, when I pop the bin's fitted lid to throw in my latest batch of kitchen gunk, I can see flies going to work inside it).\nEven better, I've never turned my compost with a spade or pitchfork, nor have I ever hosed it down, added worms to it, or done any other onerous chores a serious composter might undertake. All I've done is dump kitchen waste into the bin and walk away, just like I do when I bring trash from my indoor garbage cans to my outdoor garbage can.\nDoors at the bottom of the bin allow access to my sorta-kinda-finished compost, although I never touch the stuff.

Photo: Rose Maura Lorre The Redmon bin's black, plastic sides absorb and hold in heat and they're vented for airflow, so the bin itself does all the work necessary to break down organic matter. The process is so efficient that my bin has never been more than two-thirds full. (My husband did dig a hole about a foot deep that we placed the bin on top of when we set it up to give our pile a head start.)\nLittle hatch doors at the bottom allow access to your compost. Despite my stubborn anti-compost stance, my Redmon compost bin has produced what looks a lot like usable compost, albeit with plenty of still-intact eggshells and plant bits mixed in.\nIn fact, Brewer told me that my hastily made concoction still has value. 'I'd put the recognizable items back in for another cycle of composting,' she said. 'The rest could be applied as a soil amendment, just a thin layer.'\nDespite my worst intentions, it seems I've made compost after all.\nThis article was edited by Alex Aciman and Catherine Kast.\nThis article was edited by Alex Aciman and Catherine Kast.",

Republicans dug in against another aid package for Kyiv unless President Biden agreed to stringent anti-immigration measures, and then refused to take up legislation that paired the aid with stiffer border enforcement provisions.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

It came days after Iran launched a large aerial attack on Israel, amplifying calls for Congress to move quickly to approve the pending aid bill.\nEmerging from a meeting in which he briefed G.O.P. lawmakers on his plan, Mr. Johnson said he would cobble together a legislative package that roughly mirrors the $95 billion aid bill the Senate passed two months ago but is broken down into three pieces.

            "excerpt": "Here's how each member of the House voted on the foreign aid bills.",
            "summary": "Source: Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives\nThe House passed a long-stalled foreign aid package on Saturday that gives funding to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, with a majority of lawmakers backing money for American allies across the globe. The package, which now goes to the Senate, is almost certain to become law.\nThe Senate passed similar legislation in February. But in the face of distinct bases of opposition to different elements of the legislation, which threatened to tank the package as a whole, Speaker Mike Johnson advanced the foreign aid using a convoluted strategy: It split the package into three parts, each of which received its own vote, added a fourth bill with Republican priorities as a sweetener and melded it all together again once everything passed.\nThe plan, laid out in a rule that passed on Friday, was concocted to capitalize on the pools of support for each part of the $95.3 billion package, while preventing opposition to any one piece from taking down all of them.\nNote: Progressive Democrats are members of the House Progressive Caucus. Hard-right Republicans include members who were supported by the House Freedom Fund during the 2022 midterms, opposed Kevin McCarthy's election as speaker in January 2023, or voted to oust Mr. McCarthy from the speakership last October. The fund is the campaign arm of the House Freedom Caucus, a hard-right faction founded in 2015.\nA majority of Republicans voted against Ukraine aid on Saturday in a reflection of the stiff resistance within the G.O.P. to continuing to aid Ukraine against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia's invasion. The coalition that voted against the bill spanned right-wing members of the House Freedom Caucus to leadership, such as Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, the No. 3 House Republican. On Israel aid, on the other hand, most Republicans voted 'yes.'\nThirty-four right-wing Republicans also opposed aid to American allies in the Indo-Pacific, while Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, declined to take a yes-or-no position and voted 'present.' Representative Bob Good, Republican of Virginia and the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, was one of the 21 members of his party who voted against the Israel package. Echoing one of the many grievances shared by hard-right Republicans who opposed all of the aid measures, Mr. Good said his support for 'Israel's right to defend itself remains unshakeable' but that he disagreed with a measure that would add to the nation's debt.\nWhile all Democrats voted in favor of aid to Ukraine and all but Ms. Tlaib supported funding to Taiwan, 37 left-leaning Democrats defected to vote against the Israel aid bill. They said before the vote that they opposed unfettered aid to Israel that could be used in its offensive in Gaza. The opposition to the Israel aid bill represented a minority of Democrats, but reflected the deep resistance to unfettered aid and the divisions in the party on Gaza. Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, represented a notable new 'no' vote among Republicans, and other standouts included Representatives Donald S. Beyer Jr. of Virginia, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon and John Garamendi of California.\nStill, 37 'no' votes, while a break from Washington's ironclad support for the Jewish state, fell short of the opposition bloc progressives had hoped to muster. Thirty-nine Democrats had voted 'no' on Friday on the rule to allow the foreign aid package to come to the House floor, a target that progressives just missed on Saturday on the Israel bill. Fourteen of those Democrats voted on Saturday in favor of aid to Israel, while 12 Democrats who voted to allow the package on the floor on Friday then cast votes against the funding itself.\nTwenty-five Republicans voted against the fourth bill, which included measures that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the United States and that would redirect funds from seized Russian assets to help aid Ukraine. Democrats put up a big vote — 174 — in favor on this bill, which was intended to sweeten the overall package for conservatives.",

            "summary": "Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index The Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis. The case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces. The issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years. The dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces. The question before the justices is whether those laws went so far that they punished people for being homeless and violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. A group of homeless residents is challenging the city's enforcement of the ordinances as unconstitutional, arguing that they are involuntarily homeless in the city because there are not shelter beds available and that the city may not punish them without offering shelter. City officials in Grants Pass counter that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment. They warn that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would fuel homeless encampments across the country and hamstring the ability of local governments to respond. Here's what else to know: The case began in October 2018, when Debra Blake, a homeless woman in Grants Pass, sued the city, accusing officials of breaching the Constitution. 'The city of Grants Pass is trying to run homeless people out of town,' the lawsuit said. 'On any given day or night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, are forced to live outside due to the lack of emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.'\nThe plaintiffs' argument rests in part on a 1962 case, Robinson v. California, in which the Supreme Court held that laws imposing penalties on people for narcotics addiction violated the Eighth Amendment because they punished a state of being, not a specific action, like drug possession or sale. In a similar fashion, the plaintiffs contend, Grants Pass is punishing people for being involuntarily homeless, not for specific actions.\nThat argument held sway in a separate case, Martin v. Boise, in 2018. In that case, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Boise, Idaho, had violated the constitutional rights of homeless people by imposing criminal penalties for sleeping and camping outdoors, even though the city did not have enough shelter beds.\nLawyers for Grants Pass point to the Boise case as a cautionary tale. The decision only hastened 'sprawling encampments, rising deaths and widespread harms to the community, as localities are forced to surrender their public spaces,' the lawyers wrote in a brief. The lawyers added that lawmakers, not courts, were best suited to address homelessness and the complexity of its root causes.\nUnderlining the tricky balance inherent in the case, a number of groups have sought to strike something of a compromise. The Biden administration, the city and county of Los Angeles, the city and county of San Francisco, California and the state's governor have weighed in, all seeking to find a careful balance between support for homeless residents and for broader communities.\nThe Biden administration, which will participate in the oral arguments, has not chosen a side in the dispute. Even as it was sharply critical of laws that in effect criminalize homelessness — policies that it argues can make it harder for people to escape their circumstances — the administration said local governments had a basic responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces like parks and sidewalks. April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET The argument is scheduled for 65 minutes. But it will probably last more than twice that long. April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET The stakes are high. In San Francisco, which is embroiled in a lawsuit over encampments, city officials have complained for months that a sweeping injunction based on the Grants Pass decision and other Ninth Circuit rulings has complicated law enforcement around downtown tent camps. Over the weekend, I asked Senator Scott Wiener, a Democratic legislator who represents San Francisco, what he was hoping for from the Supreme Court. 'Certainty,' he told me, 'because things have been chaotic here.'  April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET In briefs on the case, California leaders have tried to take a nuanced position, arguing, in essence, that they don't want to criminalize homelessness but need more flexibility to clear the most dangerous encampments and compel people to take shelter when it is offered. This tricky balance was reflected in Gov. Gavin Newsom's brief 'in support of neither party.' April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET Outside the Supreme Court building this morning, activists hoping to protect the rights of homeless people have gathered with signs that call for 'Housing Not Handcuffs.' Many of them are draped in reflective thermal blankets. An encampment in Los Angeles in December. Credit... Mark Abramson for The New York Times Tent encampments lining public parks and city sidewalks. Piles of garbage, human waste and used needles. According to leaders across the political spectrum who have asked the Supreme Court to address homelessness, those are the consequences of a sharp increase in homelessness that have forced many cities to 'a breaking point.' Although the case before the court on Monday centers on the narrow issue of whether the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment shields homeless people with no options for shelter from fines, fees and jail time, officials and advocates across the country are watching the case closely for its potential to reshape homelessness policy. The case underscores deep divisions over how best to address homelessness and how much leeway to give to local and state officials to help solve the problem. Theane Evangelis, a lawyer for the city of Grants Pass, Ore., who also represented the city of Boise, Idaho, in a similar case in 2018, warned that 'the stakes could not be higher for every city in the country.' If the Supreme Court upheld an appeals court ruling on behalf of the homeless plaintiffs, she added, cities everywhere 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.' Those who side with the homeless plaintiffs counter that the issue before the court is a focused one, on how to interpret the Constitution. The cities' willingness to embrace solutions like more affordable housing will determine whether the homelessness crisis will begin to abate, they say. 'The first thing for folks who aren't in this field — or understanding the nuances of this case — to understand is that nobody wants a country where people are forced to sleep outside,' said Ann Oliva, chief executive of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, an advocacy group founded in the 1980s with bipartisan roots. In briefs, supporters of Grants Pass have contended that local and state policymakers, not judges, are best placed to devise homelessness policies. The cases from Grants Pass and Boise had allowed 'federal judges to serve as the nation's ‘homelessness policy czars,'' wrote the Cicero Institute, a Texas policy group critical of longstanding federal policy that channels funds to programs to provide the homeless with permanent housing without requiring people to undergo mental health or drug treatment. Lawyers for the National Alliance to End Homelessness say that imposing penalties, rather than providing housing and services, ignores the roots of the issue. In its brief to the court, the group said that the city of Grants Pass and its defenders, 'rather than working to end it,' sought 'to banish homeless people out of sight and out of mind.' 'The threat of criminal penalties does not reduce homelessness,' the brief argued. 'At most, it drives unsheltered homeless people into hiding, leading to greater health and safety concerns for localities. Criminal punishment for peaceably sleeping outside as an unsheltered homeless person is not only cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but unnecessary, expensive and counterproductive.'  April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET It is early in California, but today's arguments are being closely watched here. California has about 12 percent of the nation's population, but roughly a third of the nation's homeless people. A lot of factors play into that, including the sunny weather to a crippling housing shortage. But rulings by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit constraining tent camp enforcement have made California's homelessness crisis particularly wrenching and visible. April 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET This is the start of a big week at the court, featuring the final arguments of the term. In addition to the homelessness case today, the justices will hear an abortion case on Wednesday and a case on Trump's claim that he is immune from prosecution on Thursday. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has said that he opposes criminalizing homelessness but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass have impeded the ability of the local authorities to move people into shelters and temporary housing. Credit... Jeff Chiu/Associated Press The Goldwater Institute and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California ordinarily have little in common. One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation's most liberal states. But for the past six years, they have been aligned on one highly charged issue: the need for some legal way to clear homeless encampments that have proliferated in cities throughout the West. On Monday, the Supreme Court will consider an Oregon case that could reshape homelessness policy nationally. On its face, The City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks. More broadly, however, the case deals with one of the thorniest aspects of the homelessness crisis — the balance between the government's responsibility to protect public health and the human right to exist without housing. The conflict has been particularly acute in the West, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has issued opinions over the past six years that officials blame for the sprawling tent encampments in public spaces that have spread since the pandemic. As voters' frustration has grown, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping, only to have the courts reject them. Advocates for homeless people, the American Psychiatric Association and several left-leaning states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, argue that criminalizing homelessness only worsens the problem. More effective, they say, is focusing on housing, treatment, education and jobs for people who are homeless. In the nine Western states in the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction, however, officials have increasingly begged the court to explicitly define the point at which a community can reclaim its shared spaces without triggering lawsuits. Some echo conservative appointees on the Ninth Circuit like Judge Daniel Bress, who issued a scathing response last year after the liberal majority voted not to give the Grants Pass case a rehearing before the full appeals court. (The three-judge had panel found that penalties for bunking outdoors violated the Constitution if the local population of homeless people exceeded the city's shelter capacity.) The Ninth Circuit, he wrote, need only look to its doorstep to see the fruit of its decision — a dystopia of 'homelessness, drug addiction, barely concealed narcotics dealing, severe mental health impairment' and post-Covid 'hollowing out.' In Phoenix, where a massive encampment near the Arizona State Capitol consumed millions of state dollars and years of litigation, Timothy Sandefur, vice president for legal affairs of the Goldwater Institute, noted that both sides had asked the court for clarification. 'It just shows,' he said, 'that across the board, the Ninth Circuit ruling that you have a constitutional right to sleep in a public park is unworkable and has got to be reversed.' In California, where more than 180,000 people are homeless, Mr. Newsom wrote in his brief to the court that he opposes criminalizing homelessness, but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass 'have impeded not only the ability to enforce basic health and safety measures, but also the ability to move people into available shelter beds and temporary housing.' Since his election in 2018, California has pumped more than $20 billion into programs to address homelessness, including specialized housing, a new court-based approach for dealing with addiction and mental illness and a $6.38 billion bond. At a news conference last week, he recalled pitching in to dismantle one tent camp in Oakland that 'felt like a scene out of a ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark' where, you know, thousands and thousands of rats appeared running all around us.' 'This is to me just about common sense, not about ideology,' the governor said.  'Suddenly, I found myself homeless,' Laura Gutowski said. 'I never expected it to come to this.' Credit... Mason Trinca for The New York Times Inside a warming shelter, Laura Gutowski detailed how her life had changed since she became homeless two and a half years ago in Grants Pass, a former timber hub in the foothills of southern Oregon. Her husband's death left her without steady income. She lived in a sedan, and then in a tent, in sight of the elementary school where her son was once a student. She constantly scrambled to move her belongings to avoid racking up more fines from the police. 'I never expected it to come to this,' said Ms. Gutowski, 55. She is one of several hundred homeless people in this city of about 40,000 that is at the center of a major case before the Supreme Court on Monday with broad ramifications for the nationwide struggle with homelessness. After Grants Pass stepped up enforcement of local ordinances that banned sleeping and camping in public spaces by ticketing, fining and jailing homeless people, lower courts ruled that it amounted to 'cruel and unusual punishment' by penalizing people who had nowhere else to go. Many states and cities that are increasingly overwhelmed by homelessness are hoping the Supreme Court overturns that decision — or severely limits it. They argue that it has crippled their efforts to address sprawling encampments, rampant public drug use and fearful constituents who say they cannot safely use public spaces. That prospect has alarmed homeless people and their advocates, who contend that a ruling against them would lead cities to fall back on jails, instead of solutions like affordable housing and social services. The case highlights the fierce divide over the thorny issue of how to regulate homelessness. Theane Evangelis, a lawyer representing Grants Pass, said the Supreme Court's decision would reverberate widely. If it does not overturn the lower-court decision, she said, cities around the United States 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.' Ed Johnson, a lawyer for the Oregon Law Center, a nonprofit legal aid group, who represents the homeless residents, said a ruling against them would strip them of their few protections. 'Can a city make it illegal on every inch of city land, every minute of the day, for people to live outside when they have nowhere else to go?' he said. Homelessness across the country climbed to the highest total on record last year, increasing by 12 percent to more than 650,000 people, according to a count by the federal government. Lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Credit... Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times At the core of the Supreme Court battle over a small Oregon town's treatment of its homeless people is a narrow question: Does the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual treatment apply to a city's efforts to crack down on public sleeping and camping? The Eighth Amendment is most commonly applied to punishments, not to laws themselves, and it is often the focus of litigation around the death penalty, solitary confinement and life without the possibility of parole. But in the case on Monday, lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Because the town, Grants Pass, has no homeless shelter, unaffiliated with any religious group, that is open to everyone, they argue, all homeless people there are involuntarily homeless and cannot be punished for having nowhere to go. To make that argument, the homeless plaintiffs have looked to rulings that apply the amendment beyond punishments themselves and to the concept that a person cannot be penalized for their state of being. In one landmark 1962 decision, Robinson v. California, the court found that a person could not be punished for being addicted to drugs, paving the way for subsequent applications. Because those rulings found that the Eighth Amendment prohibits punishing people for having 'an involuntary status,' the homeless plaintiffs say that it would also be relevant to their situation. They add that they are being disciplined for circumstances outside their control, in this instance 'universal biological necessities like sleeping and using a blanket to survive cold temperatures when they have no choice but to be outside.' The city argues that this is an inappropriate use of the Eighth Amendment and a fundamental misunderstanding of its purpose. Two legal experts, in filing a friend-of-the-court brief siding with Grants Pass, argued that the Constitution did bar criminalizing someone's state of being, rather than their specific conduct. But that prohibition, the law professors — Peter W. Low of the University of Virginia and Joel S. Johnson of Pepperdine — added, had a 'shaky Eighth Amendment footing.'  © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis.\nThe case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces.\nThe issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years.\nThe dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces.

(The three-judge had panel found that penalties for bunking outdoors violated the Constitution if the local population of homeless people exceeded the city's shelter capacity.)\nThe Ninth Circuit, he wrote, need only look to its doorstep to see the fruit of its decision — a dystopia of 'homelessness, drug addiction, barely concealed narcotics dealing, severe mental health impairment' and post-Covid 'hollowing out.'\nIn Phoenix, where a massive encampment near the Arizona State Capitol consumed millions of state dollars and years of litigation, Timothy Sandefur, vice president for legal affairs of the Goldwater Institute, noted that both sides had asked the court for clarification.\n'It just shows,' he said, 'that across the board, the Ninth Circuit ruling that you have a constitutional right to sleep in a public park is unworkable and has got to be reversed.'\nIn California, where more than 180,000 people are homeless, Mr. Newsom wrote in his brief to the court that he opposes criminalizing homelessness, but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass 'have impeded not only the ability to enforce basic health and safety measures, but also the ability to move people into available shelter beds and temporary housing.' Since his election in 2018, California has pumped more than $20 billion into programs to address homelessness, including specialized housing, a new court-based approach for dealing with addiction and mental illness and a $6.38 billion bond.\nAt a news conference last week, he recalled pitching in to dismantle one tent camp in Oakland that 'felt like a scene out of a ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark' where, you know, thousands and thousands of rats appeared running all around us.'\n'This is to me just about common sense, not about ideology,' the governor said.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT 'Suddenly, I found myself homeless,' Laura Gutowski said. 'I never expected it to come to this.' Credit... Mason Trinca for The New York Times Inside a warming shelter, Laura Gutowski detailed how her life had changed since she became homeless two and a half years ago in Grants Pass, a former timber hub in the foothills of southern Oregon.\nHer husband's death left her without steady income. She lived in a sedan, and then in a tent, in sight of the elementary school where her son was once a student. She constantly scrambled to move her belongings to avoid racking up more fines from the police.\n'I never expected it to come to this,' said Ms. Gutowski, 55. She is one of several hundred homeless people in this city of about 40,000 that is at the center of a major case before the Supreme Court on Monday with broad ramifications for the nationwide struggle with homelessness.\nAfter Grants Pass stepped up enforcement of local ordinances that banned sleeping and camping in public spaces by ticketing, fining and jailing homeless people, lower courts ruled that it amounted to 'cruel and unusual punishment' by penalizing people who had nowhere else to go.\nMany states and cities that are increasingly overwhelmed by homelessness are hoping the Supreme Court overturns that decision — or severely limits it. They argue that it has crippled their efforts to address sprawling encampments, rampant public drug use and fearful constituents who say they cannot safely use public spaces.\nThat prospect has alarmed homeless people and their advocates, who contend that a ruling against them would lead cities to fall back on jails, instead of solutions like affordable housing and social services.\nThe case highlights the fierce divide over the thorny issue of how to regulate homelessness.\nTheane Evangelis, a lawyer representing Grants Pass, said the Supreme Court's decision would reverberate widely. If it does not overturn the lower-court decision, she said, cities around the United States 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.'\nEd Johnson, a lawyer for the Oregon Law Center, a nonprofit legal aid group, who represents the homeless residents, said a ruling against them would strip them of their few protections. 'Can a city make it illegal on every inch of city land, every minute of the day, for people to live outside when they have nowhere else to go?' he said.\nHomelessness across the country climbed to the highest total on record last year, increasing by 12 percent to more than 650,000 people, according to a count by the federal government.\nLawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Credit... Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times At the core of the Supreme Court battle over a small Oregon town's treatment of its homeless people is a narrow question: Does the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual treatment apply to a city's efforts to crack down on public sleeping and camping?\nThe Eighth Amendment is most commonly applied to punishments, not to laws themselves, and it is often the focus of litigation around the death penalty, solitary confinement and life without the possibility of parole.\nBut in the case on Monday, lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Because the town, Grants Pass, has no homeless shelter, unaffiliated with any religious group, that is open to everyone, they argue, all homeless people there are involuntarily homeless and cannot be punished for having nowhere to go.\nTo make that argument, the homeless plaintiffs have looked to rulings that apply the amendment beyond punishments themselves and to the concept that a person cannot be penalized for their state of being.\nIn one landmark 1962 decision, Robinson v. California, the court found that a person could not be punished for being addicted to drugs, paving the way for subsequent applications. Because those rulings found that the Eighth Amendment prohibits punishing people for having 'an involuntary status,' the homeless plaintiffs say that it would also be relevant to their situation. They add that they are being disciplined for circumstances outside their control, in this instance 'universal biological necessities like sleeping and using a blanket to survive cold temperatures when they have no choice but to be outside.'\nThe city argues that this is an inappropriate use of the Eighth Amendment and a fundamental misunderstanding of its purpose.\nTwo legal experts, in filing a friend-of-the-court brief siding with Grants Pass, argued that the Constitution did bar criminalizing someone's state of being, rather than their specific conduct. But that prohibition, the law professors — Peter W. Low of the University of Virginia and Joel S. Johnson of Pepperdine — added, had a 'shaky Eighth Amendment footing.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences",

            "summary": "Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index The Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis. The case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces. The issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years. The dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces. The question before the justices is whether those laws went so far that they punished people for being homeless and violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. A group of homeless residents is challenging the city's enforcement of the ordinances as unconstitutional, arguing that they are involuntarily homeless in the city because there are not shelter beds available and that the city may not punish them without offering shelter. City officials in Grants Pass counter that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment. They warn that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would fuel homeless encampments across the country and hamstring the ability of local governments to respond. Here's what else to know: The case began in October 2018, when Debra Blake, a homeless woman in Grants Pass, sued the city, accusing officials of breaching the Constitution. 'The city of Grants Pass is trying to run homeless people out of town,' the lawsuit said. 'On any given day or night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, are forced to live outside due to the lack of emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.'\nThe plaintiffs' argument rests in part on a 1962 case, Robinson v. California, in which the Supreme Court held that laws imposing penalties on people for narcotics addiction violated the Eighth Amendment because they punished a state of being, not a specific action, like drug possession or sale. In a similar fashion, the plaintiffs contend, Grants Pass is punishing people for being involuntarily homeless, not for specific actions.\nThat argument held sway in a separate case, Martin v. Boise, in 2018. In that case, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Boise, Idaho, had violated the constitutional rights of homeless people by imposing criminal penalties for sleeping and camping outdoors, even though the city did not have enough shelter beds.\nLawyers for Grants Pass point to the Boise case as a cautionary tale. The decision only hastened 'sprawling encampments, rising deaths and widespread harms to the community, as localities are forced to surrender their public spaces,' the lawyers wrote in a brief. The lawyers added that lawmakers, not courts, were best suited to address homelessness and the complexity of its root causes.\nUnderlining the tricky balance inherent in the case, a number of groups have sought to strike something of a compromise. The Biden administration, the city and county of Los Angeles, the city and county of San Francisco, California and the state's governor have weighed in, all seeking to find a careful balance between support for homeless residents and for broader communities.\nThe Biden administration, which will participate in the oral arguments, has not chosen a side in the dispute. Even as it was sharply critical of laws that in effect criminalize homelessness — policies that it argues can make it harder for people to escape their circumstances — the administration said local governments had a basic responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces like parks and sidewalks. April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET The argument is scheduled for 65 minutes. But it will probably last more than twice that long. April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET The stakes are high. In San Francisco, which is embroiled in a lawsuit over encampments, city officials have complained for months that a sweeping injunction based on the Grants Pass decision and other Ninth Circuit rulings has complicated law enforcement around downtown tent camps. Over the weekend, I asked Senator Scott Wiener, a Democratic legislator who represents San Francisco, what he was hoping for from the Supreme Court. 'Certainty,' he told me, 'because things have been chaotic here.'  April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET In briefs on the case, California leaders have tried to take a nuanced position, arguing, in essence, that they don't want to criminalize homelessness but need more flexibility to clear the most dangerous encampments and compel people to take shelter when it is offered. This tricky balance was reflected in Gov. Gavin Newsom's brief 'in support of neither party.' April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET Outside the Supreme Court building this morning, activists hoping to protect the rights of homeless people have gathered with signs that call for 'Housing Not Handcuffs.' Many of them are draped in reflective thermal blankets. An encampment in Los Angeles in December. Credit... Mark Abramson for The New York Times Tent encampments lining public parks and city sidewalks. Piles of garbage, human waste and used needles. According to leaders across the political spectrum who have asked the Supreme Court to address homelessness, those are the consequences of a sharp increase in homelessness that have forced many cities to 'a breaking point.' Although the case before the court on Monday centers on the narrow issue of whether the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment shields homeless people with no options for shelter from fines, fees and jail time, officials and advocates across the country are watching the case closely for its potential to reshape homelessness policy. The case underscores deep divisions over how best to address homelessness and how much leeway to give to local and state officials to help solve the problem. Theane Evangelis, a lawyer for the city of Grants Pass, Ore., who also represented the city of Boise, Idaho, in a similar case in 2018, warned that 'the stakes could not be higher for every city in the country.' If the Supreme Court upheld an appeals court ruling on behalf of the homeless plaintiffs, she added, cities everywhere 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.' Those who side with the homeless plaintiffs counter that the issue before the court is a focused one, on how to interpret the Constitution. The cities' willingness to embrace solutions like more affordable housing will determine whether the homelessness crisis will begin to abate, they say. 'The first thing for folks who aren't in this field — or understanding the nuances of this case — to understand is that nobody wants a country where people are forced to sleep outside,' said Ann Oliva, chief executive of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, an advocacy group founded in the 1980s with bipartisan roots. In briefs, supporters of Grants Pass have contended that local and state policymakers, not judges, are best placed to devise homelessness policies. The cases from Grants Pass and Boise had allowed 'federal judges to serve as the nation's ‘homelessness policy czars,'' wrote the Cicero Institute, a Texas policy group critical of longstanding federal policy that channels funds to programs to provide the homeless with permanent housing without requiring people to undergo mental health or drug treatment. Lawyers for the National Alliance to End Homelessness say that imposing penalties, rather than providing housing and services, ignores the roots of the issue. In its brief to the court, the group said that the city of Grants Pass and its defenders, 'rather than working to end it,' sought 'to banish homeless people out of sight and out of mind.' 'The threat of criminal penalties does not reduce homelessness,' the brief argued. 'At most, it drives unsheltered homeless people into hiding, leading to greater health and safety concerns for localities. Criminal punishment for peaceably sleeping outside as an unsheltered homeless person is not only cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but unnecessary, expensive and counterproductive.'  April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET It is early in California, but today's arguments are being closely watched here. California has about 12 percent of the nation's population, but roughly a third of the nation's homeless people. A lot of factors play into that, including the sunny weather to a crippling housing shortage. But rulings by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit constraining tent camp enforcement have made California's homelessness crisis particularly wrenching and visible. April 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET This is the start of a big week at the court, featuring the final arguments of the term. In addition to the homelessness case today, the justices will hear an abortion case on Wednesday and a case on Trump's claim that he is immune from prosecution on Thursday. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has said that he opposes criminalizing homelessness but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass have impeded the ability of the local authorities to move people into shelters and temporary housing. Credit... Jeff Chiu/Associated Press The Goldwater Institute and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California ordinarily have little in common. One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation's most liberal states. But for the past six years, they have been aligned on one highly charged issue: the need for some legal way to clear homeless encampments that have proliferated in cities throughout the West. On Monday, the Supreme Court will consider an Oregon case that could reshape homelessness policy nationally. On its face, The City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks. More broadly, however, the case deals with one of the thorniest aspects of the homelessness crisis — the balance between the government's responsibility to protect public health and the human right to exist without housing. The conflict has been particularly acute in the West, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has issued opinions over the past six years that officials blame for the sprawling tent encampments in public spaces that have spread since the pandemic. As voters' frustration has grown, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping, only to have the courts reject them. Advocates for homeless people, the American Psychiatric Association and several left-leaning states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, argue that criminalizing homelessness only worsens the problem. More effective, they say, is focusing on housing, treatment, education and jobs for people who are homeless. In the nine Western states in the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction, however, officials have increasingly begged the court to explicitly define the point at which a community can reclaim its shared spaces without triggering lawsuits. Some echo conservative appointees on the Ninth Circuit like Judge Daniel Bress, who issued a scathing response last year after the liberal majority voted not to give the Grants Pass case a rehearing before the full appeals court.

In Phoenix, where a massive encampment near the Arizona State Capitol consumed millions of state dollars and years of litigation, Timothy Sandefur, vice president for legal affairs of the Goldwater Institute, noted that both sides had asked the court for clarification. 'It just shows,' he said, 'that across the board, the Ninth Circuit ruling that you have a constitutional right to sleep in a public park is unworkable and has got to be reversed.'

California has about 12 percent of the nation's population, but roughly a third of the nation's homeless people. A lot of factors play into that, including the sunny weather to a crippling housing shortage. But rulings by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit constraining tent camp enforcement have made California's homelessness crisis particularly wrenching and visible.\nApril 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET This is the start of a big week at the court, featuring the final arguments of the term. In addition to the homelessness case today, the justices will hear an abortion case on Wednesday and a case on Trump's claim that he is immune from prosecution on Thursday.\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California has said that he opposes criminalizing homelessness but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass have impeded the ability of the local authorities to move people into shelters and temporary housing. Credit... Jeff Chiu/Associated Press The Goldwater Institute and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California ordinarily have little in common. One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation's most liberal states.\nBut for the past six years, they have been aligned on one highly charged issue: the need for some legal way to clear homeless encampments that have proliferated in cities throughout the West.\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court will consider an Oregon case that could reshape homelessness policy nationally. On its face, The City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks.\nThe City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks. More broadly, however, the case deals with one of the thorniest aspects of the homelessness crisis — the balance between the government's responsibility to protect public health and the human right to exist without housing.\nThe conflict has been particularly acute in the West, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has issued opinions over the past six years that officials blame for the sprawling tent encampments in public spaces that have spread since the pandemic. As voters' frustration has grown, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping, only to have the courts reject them.\nAdvocates for homeless people, the American Psychiatric Association and several left-leaning states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, argue that criminalizing homelessness only worsens the problem. More effective, they say, is focusing on housing, treatment, education and jobs for people who are homeless.\nIn the nine Western states in the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction, however, officials have increasingly begged the court to explicitly define the point at which a community can reclaim its shared spaces without triggering lawsuits. Some echo conservative appointees on the Ninth Circuit like Judge Daniel Bress, who issued a scathing response last year after the liberal majority voted not to give the Grants Pass case a rehearing before the full appeals court. (The three-judge had panel found that penalties for bunking outdoors violated the Constitution if the local population of homeless people exceeded the city's shelter capacity.)\nThe Ninth Circuit, he wrote, need only look to its doorstep to see the fruit of its decision — a dystopia of 'homelessness, drug addiction, barely concealed narcotics dealing, severe mental health impairment' and post-Covid 'hollowing out.'\nIn Phoenix, where a massive encampment near the Arizona State Capitol consumed millions of state dollars and years of litigation, Timothy Sandefur, vice president for legal affairs of the Goldwater Institute, noted that both sides had asked the court for clarification.\n'It just shows,' he said, 'that across the board, the Ninth Circuit ruling that you have a constitutional right to sleep in a public park is unworkable and has got to be reversed.'\nIn California, where more than 180,000 people are homeless, Mr. Newsom wrote in his brief to the court that he opposes criminalizing homelessness, but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass 'have impeded not only the ability to enforce basic health and safety measures, but also the ability to move people into available shelter beds and temporary housing.' Since his election in 2018, California has pumped more than $20 billion into programs to address homelessness, including specialized housing, a new court-based approach for dealing with addiction and mental illness and a $6.38 billion bond.\nAt a news conference last week, he recalled pitching in to dismantle one tent camp in Oakland that 'felt like a scene out of a ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark' where, you know, thousands and thousands of rats appeared running all around us.'\n'This is to me just about common sense, not about ideology,' the governor said.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT 'Suddenly, I found myself homeless,' Laura Gutowski said.

California, the court found that a person could not be punished for being addicted to drugs, paving the way for subsequent applications.

            "summary": "Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index The Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis. The case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces. The issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years. The dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces. The question before the justices is whether those laws went so far that they punished people for being homeless and violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. A group of homeless residents is challenging the city's enforcement of the ordinances as unconstitutional, arguing that they are involuntarily homeless in the city because there are not shelter beds available and that the city may not punish them without offering shelter. City officials in Grants Pass counter that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment. They warn that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would fuel homeless encampments across the country and hamstring the ability of local governments to respond. Here's what else to know: The case began in October 2018, when Debra Blake, a homeless woman in Grants Pass, sued the city, accusing officials of breaching the Constitution. 'The city of Grants Pass is trying to run homeless people out of town,' the lawsuit said. 'On any given day or night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, are forced to live outside due to the lack of emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.'\nThe plaintiffs' argument rests in part on a 1962 case, Robinson v. California, in which the Supreme Court held that laws imposing penalties on people for narcotics addiction violated the Eighth Amendment because they punished a state of being, not a specific action, like drug possession or sale. In a similar fashion, the plaintiffs contend, Grants Pass is punishing people for being involuntarily homeless, not for specific actions.\nThat argument held sway in a separate case, Martin v. Boise, in 2018. In that case, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Boise, Idaho, had violated the constitutional rights of homeless people by imposing criminal penalties for sleeping and camping outdoors, even though the city did not have enough shelter beds.\nLawyers for Grants Pass point to the Boise case as a cautionary tale. The decision only hastened 'sprawling encampments, rising deaths and widespread harms to the community, as localities are forced to surrender their public spaces,' the lawyers wrote in a brief. The lawyers added that lawmakers, not courts, were best suited to address homelessness and the complexity of its root causes.\nUnderlining the tricky balance inherent in the case, a number of groups have sought to strike something of a compromise. The Biden administration, the city and county of Los Angeles, the city and county of San Francisco, California and the state's governor have weighed in, all seeking to find a careful balance between support for homeless residents and for broader communities.\nThe Biden administration, which will participate in the oral arguments, has not chosen a side in the dispute. Even as it was sharply critical of laws that in effect criminalize homelessness — policies that it argues can make it harder for people to escape their circumstances — the administration said local governments had a basic responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces like parks and sidewalks.

            "summary": "Not since Eugene V. Debs campaigned from a prison cell more than a century ago has the United States experienced what might now happen: a prominent candidate with a felony conviction running for president. And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning.\nFor now, he faces no formal campaign restrictions, beyond having to be present in a courtroom, and he remains highly competitive in polls. But some of the cases are proceeding at a pace that could bring verdicts before the election — and the Constitution and American law have clear answers for only some of the questions that will arise if he is convicted.\nOthers would bring the country into truly uncharted territory, with huge decisions resting in the hands of federal judges.\nHere is what we know, and what we don't know.\nThis is the simplest question of the bunch. The answer is yes.\nThe Constitution sets very few eligibility requirements for presidents. They must be at least 35 years old, be 'natural born' citizens and have lived in the United States for at least 14 years.\nThere are no limitations based on character or criminal record. While some states prohibit felons from running for state and local office, these laws do not apply to federal offices.\nThe Republican and Democratic Parties have guaranteed spots on general-election ballots in every state, and the parties tell election officials whose name to put in their spot. States could, in theory, try to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on legally shaky ground.\n'We let states set the time, place and manner' of elections, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who specializes in election law, 'but I think the best reading of our Constitution is you don't let the state add new substantive requirements.'\nWhile that view is not universal among legal experts, it prevailed in court in 2019, after California passed a law requiring candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on primary ballots. A federal district judge blocked the law from taking effect, saying it was most likely unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court also unanimously blocked it as a violation of the state constitution, and the case never reached the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that states could not keep Mr. Trump off their ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies people who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' after taking an oath to support the Constitution.\nNumerous lawsuits had argued that Mr. Trump's actions before and on Jan. 6, 2021, met this bar. In December, the Colorado Supreme Court found him ineligible, and Maine's secretary of state did the same. But the Supreme Court — led by a conservative supermajority, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump himself — concluded that only Congress had the power to enforce Section 3 against candidates for federal office. (Four of the justices, including the three liberals, wanted to allow a wider range of options for disqualification.)\nCongress is not going to do that with Republicans in control of the House. And the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal cases, meaning convictions would not disqualify Mr. Trump either.\nCongress can designate either groups of people to whom Section 3 applies (such as people who fought for the Confederacy) or specific crimes that, upon conviction, would trigger disqualification, said Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University. But none of the crimes Mr. Trump is charged with carry that automatic penalty.\n'Whether or not Trump is tried, convicted, acquitted, that's a separate question from whether or not he's disqualified,' said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nOne of the charges in the federal case related to Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election — conspiracy to violate civil rights — once carried a disqualification penalty, Mr. Kreis said, but Congress removed it decades ago.\nNow that Mr. Trump has secured a majority of delegates to the Republican convention, the party has no mechanism to nominate somebody else. Under the party's official convention rules, if a delegate tries to support someone other than the person the primary results bound them to, 'such support shall not be recognized.'\nNor have top Republicans shown any interest in another nominee.\nIf he were forced to withdraw from the race after the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him.\nafter the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him. Probably not.\nMr. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, and he would be disenfranchised there if convicted of a felony.\nMost felons in Florida regain voting rights after completing their full sentence, including parole or probation, and paying all fines and fees. But it is highly unlikely that Mr. Trump, if convicted, would have time to complete his sentence before Election Day.\nHe could also petition for clemency, which would require the approval of the governor — Ron DeSantis, who ran against Mr. Trump in the Republican primary — and two Florida cabinet members. Chris Taylor, the director of external affairs for the Florida Commission on Offender Review, confirmed that a Florida resident convicted of a felony could apply to have their voting rights restored through that process even if their conviction happened outside Florida.\nSince Mr. Trump also has a residence in New York, he could switch his voter registration there to take advantage of its more permissive approach: Felons in New York can vote while on parole or probation. But, as in Florida and almost every other state, they are still disenfranchised while in prison.\nSo if Mr. Trump is imprisoned, he could be in the extraordinary position of being deemed fit to be voted for, but unfit to vote.\nNo one knows.\n'We're so far removed from anything that's ever happened,' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley. 'It's just guessing.'\nLegally, Mr. Trump would remain eligible to be president even if he were imprisoned. The Constitution says nothing to the contrary. 'I don't think that the framers ever thought we were going to be in this situation,' Professor Levinson said.\nIn practice, the election of an incarcerated president would create a legal crisis that would almost certainly need to be resolved by the courts.\nIn theory, Mr. Trump could be stripped of his authority under the 25th Amendment, which provides a process to transfer authority to the vice president if the president is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' But that would require the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare Mr. Trump unable to fulfill his duties, a remote prospect given that these would be loyalists appointed by Mr. Trump himself.\nMore likely, Mr. Trump could sue to be released on the basis that his imprisonment was preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional obligations as president. Such a case would probably focus on the separation of powers, with Mr. Trump's lawyers arguing that keeping a duly elected president in prison would be an infringement by the judicial branch on the operations of the executive branch.\nOn the federal charges only, he could also try to pardon himself — or to commute his sentence, leaving his conviction in place but ending his imprisonment. Either action would be an extraordinary assertion of presidential power, and the Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of whether a 'self pardon' was constitutional.\nOr President Biden, on his way out the door, could pardon Mr. Trump on the basis that 'the people have spoken and I need to pardon him so he can govern,' Professor Chemerinsky said.\nBut that wouldn't apply to the New York or Georgia cases, because the president does not have pardon power for state charges.\nAgain, no one knows, particularly when it comes to the New York and Georgia cases.\nIn the two federal cases, a likely outcome would be that a Trump-appointed attorney general would withdraw the charges.\nThe Justice Department does not indict sitting presidents, a policy outlined in a 1973 memo, during the Nixon era. It has never had reason to develop a policy on what to do with an incoming president who has already been indicted. But the rationale for not indicting sitting presidents — that it would interfere with their ability to perform their duties — applies just as well in this hypothetical scenario.\n'The reasons why we wouldn't want to indict a sitting president are the reasons we wouldn't want to prosecute a sitting president,' said Professor Chemerinsky, who has disagreed with the department's reasoning. 'My guess is, if the Trump prosecution were still ongoing in some way and Trump were elected, the Justice Department — which would be the Trump Justice Department — would say, ‘We're following the 1973 memo.''\nLike so much else here, this would be legally untested, and it is impossible to say what the Supreme Court would do if the question reached it.\nIn its Clinton v. Jones ruling in 1997, the court allowed a lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed. But that case was civil, not criminal, and it was filed by a private citizen, not by the government itself.\nCharlie Savage contributed reporting.",

In central Munich, a single ride costs €3.90, a day pass costs €9.20, and a week pass costs €21.10. On weekends, the system runs all night long. The MVG also offers bike sharing, which can be booked with an app. Uber operates in Germany as a regulated taxi service nearly identical to the city's other taxi companies.

From Odeonsplatz, a 19th-century square, stroll to the Hofgarten, a manicured park surrounded with hedges and crowned by an elegant central gazebo. From there, cross into the rambling Englischer Garten, which is larger than New York's Central Park. Wave to the bathers bobbing up and down in the Eisbach, the freezing man-made river that snakes through the park, and watch the daredevil surfers who ride its waves. You can also stop for an inaugural pint at the beer garden next to the Chinese Tower, a five-story wooden pagoda; take a boat out on the placid Kleinhesseloher See lake; or visit the hilltop Monopteros, a 19th-century replica of a Greek temple that was built for the Bavarian king Ludwig I.\nThe Eisbach in the Englischer Garten\n5 p.m. Confront Germany's darkest hour\n5 p.m. Confront Germany's darkest hour Germany's culture of commemoration, seen in its willingness to examine the crimes it committed during World War II, make the country unique. The Munich Documentation Center for the History of National Socialism, which opened in 2015 at the site of a former Nazi headquarters, charts the history of Nazism in Munich, the birthplace of the movement. It traces the rise of the party and Adolf Hitler, including his failed but deadly coup, known as the Beer Hall Putsch, in 1923, while also describing the persecution of Munich's Jewish population, which numbered roughly 12,000 before Hitler's rise to power, and the city's postwar reckoning with its Nazi past. The current temporary exhibition (through July 28) examines right-wing terrorism in post-war Germany to the present day, including the 1980 Oktoberfest bombing and the 2016 attack at a Munich shopping mall. (Entry, free.)\n8 p.m. Try new Alpine flavors\n8 p.m. Try new Alpine flavors Get a taste of modern Bavaria at Der Dantler, one of a new crop of restaurants injecting Alpine cuisine with Asian accents. The restaurant, in the former working-class neighborhood of Geising, has a casual, hole-in-the-wall vibe; friendly and attentive staff; and, in the evenings, a frequently changing five-course menu (105 euros per person) with ambitious preparations of regional produce. A recent dinner included roasted carrots coated with preserved lemon and a spicy macadamia crunch; and a tender saddle of veal in jus, served with schupfnudeln, or German gnocchi. Vegetarian and pescatarian options available. The wine pairing (currently 56 euros per person) is a great way to get to know the menu's German and Austrian bottles, including some adventurous natural wines. Reservations required.\nThe Fischbrunnen (Fish Fountain) on Marienplatz, the central square in Munich's old town, with the white Altes Rathaus (Old Town Hall) in the distance.\n10 a.m. Indulge in a quintessential Bavarian brunch\n10 a.m. Indulge in a quintessential Bavarian brunch Weisswurstfrühstück is a time-honored German tradition in the south: A pair of boiled veal sausages, eaten with sweet mustard and a chewy pretzel, washed down with beer. It's the Bavarian breakfast of champions. Try it at Drei Mühlen, a restaurant that gets its sausages from the area's best-known butcher, Magnus Bauch. Drei Mühlen recently raised its prices, but even so, its weisswurstfrühstück remains an unbeatable deal at €6.55 (which includes a half-liter of Augustiner lager beer). It's a bustling locals' hang, especially on weekends, so you might end up sitting at the cramped bar. Reservations recommended. For vegetarians, Café Zimt und Trallala, around the corner, bakes some of the best croissants in the city and not-to-be-missed franzbrötchen, a sticky, flaky, cinnamon-and butter-pastry (€2.80 each).\n11:30 a.m. Stroll the river's grassy banks (and maybe even take a dip)\n11:30 a.m. Stroll the river's grassy banks (and maybe even take a dip) After you've polished off your beer, head to the Isar, the river that flows through Munich. Cross the Wittelsbacherbrücke, a bridge, and walk along the dirt paths on the river's grassy bank. A bold, decade-long rewilding project, completed in 2011, widened the Isar here, purified its waters and added a series of gravel paths along its banks. Watch (and maybe even join) the courageous swimmers carried by the strong current around the Weideninsel, a small island that emerged during the rewilding. To keep exploring the banks of the Isar, walk south, past the lovingly maintained Rosengarten, whose flowers are just starting to bloom. You will soon reach the Flaucher, a series of pebbled beaches, connected by an elevated walkway, that are popular with both nudists and families who barbecue (they keep to their separate shores).\n12:30 p.m. Find a rock star's old haunts\n12:30 p.m. Find a rock star's old haunts The years that Freddie Mercury, the lead singer of the rock group Queen, lived in Munich (between 1979 and 1985) made him a local hero and one of the city's gay icons. Visit some of his haunts around Gärtnerplatz, a circular plaza, like the nearby Deutsche Eiche, nowadays a hotel and restaurant with a stunning rooftop terrace. (He was also a habitué at Pimpernel and Ochsengarten, two still-operating gay bars and nightclubs on the neighboring Müllerstrasse.) Mercury bought an apartment with the Austrian actress Barbara Valentin on Hans-Sachs-Strasse, a quaint street lined with prewar buildings. There, find Alva-Morgaine, a delightful wunderkammer (or cabinet of curiosities) of one-of-a-kind fashion, like 1920s flapper dresses. Around the corner is GötterSpeise, a cocoa emporium with a creative assortment of hot chocolates (€4 to €6).\n1:30 p.m. Snack around the market\n1:30 p.m. Snack around the market If the Englischer Garten are the lungs of Munich, then the Viktualienmarkt, one of Europe's best outdoor food markets, is the city's stomach. Try the heavenly pressed sandwiches at Luiginos Bio Feinkost, which include a pastrami-Cheddar melt or grilled eggplant, chevre and spinach (from €6.90); or head to Caspar Plautz, a potato merchant that serves stuffed baked spuds (from €7.50 a plate). If the weather is inclement, duck inside the temple-like Eataly directly next door for a slice of focaccia (from about €6). For dessert, try the freshly fried schmalznudels – Bavarian doughnuts — at Café Frischhut (from €3) — or the decadent cakes and pastries at Lea Zapf (from €4). The house-roasted coffee at the Kaffeerösterei Viktualienmarkt might be the best in town.\n3 p.m. Discover the unsung woman behind a significant art collection\n3 p.m. Discover the unsung woman behind a significant art collection Der Blaue Reiter, or the Blue Rider, a group of Expressionist artists which coalesced in Munich in 1911, is arguably the city's greatest contribution to 20th-century art. In boldly colorful works, the Blue Rider artists used modern painting as a conduit to the spiritual. The Lenbachhaus Museum, in the city's central Kunstareal, or museum quarter, boasts the world's largest collection of paintings by the group whose members included Wassily Kandinsky, Franz Marc and Paul Klee. The trove exists because of Gabriele Münter, a distinctive and prolific painter who was also Kandinsky's lover (he eventually left her to move back to Russia). In 1957, when she turned 80, she donated more than 1,000 works by herself, Kandinsky, Marc, Klee and others to the museum. (Entry, €10.)\n5:30 p.m. Eat a pre-theater meal alongside the performers\n5:30 p.m. Eat a pre-theater meal alongside the performers It's easy to miss Conviva im Blauen Haus, an unassuming restaurant behind the Münchner Kammerspiele, one of the city's three publicly funded theaters. The restaurant, with industrial lighting and long wooden tables, doubles as the theater's canteen and employs people with mental and physical disabilities as cooks and servers. Prompt and attentive service ensures that everyone — actors and audience members alike — gets to the show on time. A recent evening menu featured osso buco on saffron risotto, Iberian pork loin with king oyster mushroom and potato strudel, and sea bream with artichokes and fennel puree, all in the €20 range.\n7 p.m. Attend a world-class opera\n7 p.m. Attend a world-class opera Germany is home to more than 80 opera companies and the Bayerische Staatsoper (Bavarian State Opera), which traces its history back more than 350 years, might be the country's finest. These days, it has a reputation for a varied operatic repertoire, often presented in avant-garde productions. Locals love to get gussied up for performances at the company's grand main venue, the nearly 2,000-seat Nationaltheater. Germany's lavish public subsidies mean that there are tickets for every budget, including over 300 standing room tickets for under €20. Upcoming highlights include Romeo Castellucci's densely symbolic take on Wagner's 'Tannhäuser,' a new 'Tosca,' directed by the Hungarian filmmaker Kornel Mundruczo and the summertime premiere of 'Le Grand Macabre,' directed by Krzysztof Warlikowski, in honor of the Hungarian composer Gyorgy Ligeti's centennial.\n10 p.m. Climb aboard the ship for a cocktail\n10 p.m. Climb aboard the ship for a cocktail Munich still lags behind Berlin when it comes to clubbing, but its nightlife has become much more varied over the past decade. One of the most unusual club venues is Bahnwärter Thiel, a cultural space in the edgy Schlachhofviertel district, just south of the center of town. The large outdoor area contains abandoned subway cars and sea freight containers, one of which contains the Kulturhaus, a club that attracts some of Germany's best techno D.J.s. (Most concert tickets, €10.) A few blocks away is the Alte Utting, a bar and event space in a decommissioned passenger steam ship perched high above street level on a disused railway bridge.\nThe statue of Bavaria, the female personification of the southern German state, looks over the expansive Theresienwiese, the site of the annual Oktoberfest beer festival.\n10 a.m. Pay a euro to meet the masters\n10 a.m. Pay a euro to meet the masters On Sundays, Munich's state-run museums charge €1 entry to their permanent exhibitions. If you need to choose just one, head to the Alte Pinakothek, one of the world's finest collections of European paintings, which is housed under the soaring ceiling of an early-19th-century building. Highlights include a richly varied assortment of paintings by Peter Paul Rubens, which looks more stunning than ever after recent improvements to the skylights. More than 200 paintings in the main upper galleries have changed places as part of a recent reorganization that eschews traditional ordering along geographical and chronological lines in favor of a more flexible presentation. If you have time to spare, cross the road to the Pinakothek der Moderne, home to 20th- and 21st-century art. Be warned, though: It will set you back another euro.\n12 p.m. Head to the beer garden with thousands of friends\n12 p.m. Head to the beer garden with thousands of friends Man does not live by art alone. After you're done soaking in centuries' worth of masterpieces, head over to the Königlicher Hirschgarten, one of the world's largest beer gardens, founded in 1791. Find a spot in the main 7,000-seat area, which is self-service and has long, shared tables and Augustiner lager on tap. Sausages, potato salad and rotisserie chicken are king here, but the steckerlfisch, a whole grilled fish on a stick, is also a local delicacy. (Half-liter beer, €4.20; beer garden food, €3 to €20.) After lunch, stroll through the nearby Nymphenburg Palace, the former summer residence of Bavaria's ruling family. Explore the 445-acre garden and marvel at the palace's vast main building, whose 2,000-foot-long facade is larger than that of Versailles (gardens and parks entry, free; ceremonial rooms, €8).",

            "summary": "Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index Donald J. Trump's lawyers faced an uphill battle Monday with Justice Juan M. Merchan, a no-nonsense jurist. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab courtroom in New York City while Mr. Trump looked on. Mr. Trump was charged in Manhattan, a deeply Democratic county and his former home, with falsifying nearly three dozen business records in an attempt to cover up a payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, who has said she had a brief sexual encounter with him in 2006. Mr. Trump denies that encounter happened, and has declared his innocence, calling the charges politically motivated. He has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a Democrat, who also attended the first day of trial on Monday. Mr. Trump faces 34 felony counts and could face probation or up to four years of prison time. The trial, which is expected to last weeks, has a fascinating list of potential witnesses: Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer turned apostate, who made the payment; Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who says she, too, had an affair with Mr. Trump; and Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels herself may testify. Before any of that happens, a jury must be selected, a winnowing that began Monday. Here are five takeaways from Mr. Trump's first day on trial: Justice Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, has been consistent about batting back defense motions on issues including the tardy disclosure of documents by prosecutors and efforts to delay or even dismiss the case. That pattern continued on Monday, as Justice Merchan rejected a defense effort to force his recusal. The defense had cited several issues, including the fact that his daughter is a Democratic political consultant. He also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost. But Mr. Trump's lawyers convinced Justice Merchan that sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the so-called Access Hollywood tape, in which Mr. Trump was caught bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial, calling them 'complete rumors, complete gossip, completely hearsay.' Justice Merchan's decisions on Monday made it clear that the trial will resurface unsavory events in the former president's life. Those include the Access Hollywood tape and other stories that Mr. Trump sought to suppress including an alleged affair with Ms. McDougal. Justice Merchan said on Monday that both could be discussed. In a minor victory for the defense, the judge reaffirmed that the 'Access Hollywood' tape itself could not be played, but that Trump's exact words could be entered into the record. Still, most of Mr. Merchan's rulings indicated that salacious details of Mr. Trump's biography will be heard in court. Entering the courtroom, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here.' Once he was in front of Mr. Merchan, Mr. Trump looked a lot less enthusiastic. He slouched. He scowled. He scoffed. And he was quiet, not the norm for a man who built a political career with his gift for slashing attacks and vicious put-downs. In court, the former president spoke only briefly, when asked a few questions by Justice Merchan about procedural matters, and whether he understood the consequences — ejection or jail — if he interrupted proceedings. He did whisper with his lawyers. And when the prosecution played a recording of him claiming to have great respect for women, he mouthed the word 'true.' But all in all, it seems it could be an exhausting experience for Mr. Trump; at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep. It's easy to forget how long it takes to do a little in legal settings. On Monday, the morning session was dominated by maneuvering by prosecutors and the defense, even as prospective jurors waited. By lunch, they were still waiting. Jury selection could take days or weeks, and the trial itself may take two months. The Passover holiday could cause delays, Justice Merchan said, though he might make some of that up by holding hearings on court matters on Wednesdays, which was previously going to be an off day. By afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into Justice Merchan's courtroom. He warmly welcomed them, introduced the lawyers and Mr. Trump and read them a summary of the case. Justice Merchan asked if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president. Of the 96 prospective jurors in the room at that time, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused. The remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial. April 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET Trump spoke briefly to TV cameras after court adjourned for the day, repeating his longstanding claims that the trial is a 'political witch hunt' before heading to his motorcade and departing the courthouse. Video Reporter: [inaudible] the trial — [inaudible] So thank you very much. We had some amazing things happen today. As you know, my son is graduating from high school and it looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation of my son, who's worked very, very hard. He's a great student and he's very proud of the fact that he did so well. And was looking forward for years to have his graduation with his mother and father there. And it looks like the judges isn't going to allow me to escape this scam. It's a scam trial. If you read all of the legal pundits, all of the legal scholars today, there's not one that I see that said, this is a case that should be brought or tried. It's a scam. It's a political witch hunt.

'You don't think you should be here at all right now?' he asks. Blanche says that yes, they don't believe this trial should happen during campaign season. Merchan reminds him that his client is a criminal defendant and required to be in court — his request is denied. April 15, 2024, 4:39 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 4:39 p.m. ET There is still some business to attend to. Todd Blanche, Trump's lead lawyer, is asking Merchan to let Trump attend a hearing in one of his other cases next week. Steinglass, the prosecutor, pauses for a long time before answering that he isn't interested in saying yes to this. April 15, 2024, 4:42 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 4:42 p.m. ET The request by Blanche is quite interesting. Over the weekend he made the opposite request, asking the judge in the Florida classified documents case to delay a deadline he was facing because he's so busy in the New York case.

But a few have offered some further detail, such as a man who identified himself as a bookseller and said that 'no one is above the law,' including former presidents. Another prospective juror, a nurse, said that she received Trump's emails several years ago but that she 'unsubscribed.' Laura Loomer appeared outside the Manhattan courthouse on Monday. Credit... DavidAs former President Donald J. Trump's first criminal trial began inside a Manhattan courthouse on Monday, the scene outside had elements of a feisty political skirmish and a surreal circus rolled into one. The streets below the courtroom drew a mix of gawkers, activists and publicity hounds, along with a large contingent of journalists. Laura Loomer, a right-wing activist known for her aggressive tactics and closeness with Mr. Trump, led a chant of 'Donald Trump Did Nothing Wrong!' alongside Andrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and Trump lawyer. 'We're going to be here every single day talking to all you fake-news media freaks,' Ms. Loomer said through a Harvey Milk-style bullhorn in a video she posted on social media. 'And letting you know that Donald Trump did nothing wrong until you start reporting the truth.' Ms. Loomer described the case as a 'witch hunt' — a frequent assertion of Mr. Trump's — and criticized a key witness for the prosecution, Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, and the wife of the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan. Mr. Trump promptly reposted the video on Truth Social — despite a gag order that bars him from attacking witnesses in the case or Justice Merchan's family. His post, made during the lunch break, came shortly before Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month on prosecutors' request that Mr. Trump be held in contempt of court over statements they say violate the order. Performance artists also vied for attention. One, known as Crackhead Barney, stood screaming outside the gates surrounding Collect Pond Park that she had been kicked out, and demanded police officers' badge numbers. Another played the flute atop a park bench, notes drifting through the wind and his instrument glinting in the sunlight. Some anti-Trump demonstrators held handmade signs emblazoned with 'Loser' and 'Convict Trump Already,' while others tried to confront Ms. Loomer. One, Sue Scarlett Montgomery, asked reporters why they were paying attention to Ms. Loomer, a former Republican candidate for Congress who previously visited a treacherous migrant crossing in Panama as part of her anti-Muslim activism. 'They're covering me because I broke the story about this corrupt judge here,' Ms. Loomer shot back, attacking Judge Merchan's daughter, a Democratic political consultant who has also been a target of Mr. Trump.

April 15, 2024, 3:56 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:56 p.m. ET To prepare for that inevitability, Justice Merchan has already decided that certain topics are off-limits during jury selection: lawyers for both sides cannot ask who the prospective voters plan to vote for or have voted for in the past, their political party registration or past political contributions. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Everyone expected that picking a jury to try a polarizing figure like former President Donald J. Trump was going to be a challenge. But the experience of the first round of about 100 potential panelists gave a flavor of just how difficult the process could be: More than half told the judge that they could not hear the case against Mr. Trump fairly and were immediately excused. Justice Juan M. Merchan, who is presiding over the case, read aloud to the prospective jurors a list of people who might serve as witnesses or be mentioned during the trial, asking them whether they recognized the names. Many of those names were indeed very recognizable. Among those who could come up during the trial were Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump's former adviser, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and one of Mr. Trump's lawyers. Several of Mr. Trump's relatives were also on the list, including his wife, Melania, his older daughter, Ivanka, and his son-in-law Jared Kushner.  April 15, 2024, 3:28 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:28 p.m. ET The first prospective juror is a young woman of color with a business degree who reads The New York Times and watches CNN. She seemed unbothered by the need to be fair and impartial and answered questions rapidly and almost nonchalantly. April 15, 2024, 3:45 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:45 p.m. ET The second prospective juror is a white creative director with glasses who lives in Midtown. Also a Times reader (thank you prospective juror). He did not answer with any surprises. When we start to get different answers to the final series of questions — which are more political and some of which concern Trump — is when we'll get something a little more interesting. April 15, 2024, 3:46 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:46 p.m. ET The third prospective juror, asked about her hobbies, said she likes to 'go to the club.' She said it in a playful voice, prompting a big laugh from reporters in the overflow room. April 15, 2024, 3:27 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:27 p.m. ET One thing that is striking: Trump has used the previous court appearances in other cases to project an image of grandeur. That is hard to do in this dingy courtroom, which smells slightly off and where he is an island amid a sea of people. April 15, 2024, 3:25 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:25 p.m. ET Prospective jurors who have not indicated that they wish to be dismissed are now being seated to answer the 42 questions that lawyers have agreed upon. They are being seated by jury identification number. April 15, 2024, 3:26 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:26 p.m. ET Trump is reading along with the juror questionnaire as the first possible juror, a young woman, ticks through her answers. April 15, 2024, 3:11 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:11 p.m. ET Of the 96 possible jurors brought into the room, more than 50 raised their hands to say they couldn't be fair. They were immediately excused. April 15, 2024, 3:11 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:11 p.m. ET Trump turned and stared at possible jurors as they raised their hands indicating they couldn't be fair in the case. April 15, 2024, 3:12 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:12 p.m. ET It's remarkable that more than half of the potential jurors brought in for a first round of questioning immediately said they could not hear Trump's case fairly. We knew that it would be hard to pick a jury, but a fail rate of 50 percent or higher right out of the gate is surpassingly rare.  April 15, 2024, 3:05 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:05 p.m. ET Among the notable names that the judge just read out as potential witnesses or people who could come up were Stephen K. Bannon, Rudy Giuliani, Melania Trump and Jared Kushner. Not all will appear as witnesses or even potentially be mentioned. But it certainly gives jurors a sense of the cast of characters.  The jury selection process in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan could take two weeks or more. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Lawyers representing the State of New York and Donald J. Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate. The potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair. The process could take two weeks or more — and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court. 'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.' The stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County — Manhattan, as most people know it — which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020. Mr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated. Prosecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28. Unlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.' Some may not be completely forthcoming. 'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said. Mr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors. 'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'     Former President Donald J. Trump smirked and scoffed during pretrial proceedings on Monday in Manhattan. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Former President Donald J. Trump seemed alternately irritated and exhausted Monday morning, as his lawyers and prosecutors hashed out pretrial motions before jury selection in his criminal case. Even as a judge was hearing arguments on last-minute issues in a criminal case that centers on salacious allegations and threatens to upend his bid for the presidency, Mr. Trump appeared to nod off a few times, his mouth going slack and his head drooping onto his chest. The former president's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, passed him notes for several minutes before Mr. Trump appeared to jolt awake and notice them. At other times, Mr. Trump whispered and exchanged notes with Mr. Blanche. He sat motionless while his own words from the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape — on which bragged about grabbing women's genitals — were read from a transcript by a prosecutor. At times, Mr. Trump's emotions were characteristically on display. He smirked and scoffed, and appeared frustrated when the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, did not immediately agree that he could miss court to attend the graduation of his youngest son, Barron. But when Justice Merchan warned that Mr. Trump could be ejected or thrown in jail if he disrupts the proceedings, the former president indicated that he understood. The only time Mr. Trump showed a flash of humor was when he laughed at one of his own social media posts, which attacked his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be the prosecution's central witness.  Former President Donald J. Trump's comments on the 'Access Hollywood' tape will allowed to be introduced as evidence. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times The judge in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial on Monday again refused to allow the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape to be played for jurors, but said that the comments Mr. Trump made on the tape could be introduced as evidence. On the tape, revealed in The Washington Post about a month before Mr. Trump was elected president in 2016, he is heard bragging about grabbing women's genitals, saying he could do so with abandon because 'when you're a star, they let you do it.' 'You can do anything,' Mr. Trump said on the recording. The tape rocked Mr. Trump's campaign. And prosecutors in Manhattan say it led him to agree to pay off Stormy Daniels, a porn star, who was shopping a story of a 2006 sexual encounter with the candidate. Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, paid Ms. Daniels $130,000. The payment is at the heart of the 34 felony charges against Mr. Trump, who is accused of falsifying business records to cover it up. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, had previously ruled that prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office could question witnesses about the tape, but found that it would be prejudicial to allow the actual video to the played. He reaffirmed that ruling on Monday. 'You can bring out what was said in the tape,' Justice Merchan said, adding that he didn't want jurors 'to hear Mr. Trump's voice and his gestures' in the tape. In a victory for the defense, the judge also ruled that the prosecution could not introduce evidence about sexual assault allegations against Mr. Trump that surfaced in the aftermath of the tape becoming public, calling them 'complete hearsay.' However, Justice Merchan said that prosecutors could introduce emails that followed the tape's disclosure, showing frantic efforts by Trump advisers to contain the fallout. The correspondence, he said, 'bolsters the people's claim that this was a crucial event.' Todd Blanche, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, had called on Justice Merchan to reconsider admitting 'this extremely salacious evidence,' which he described as 'very prejudicial.' Mr. Trump, who is again the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has denied any wrongdoing and has cast the case against him as politically motivated. Justice Juan M. Merchan has already reprimanded Donald J. Trump's lawyers for arguments that he considered frivolous. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Inside a dreary Lower Manhattan courtroom on a recent Wednesday, Justice Juan M. Merchan convened a special session for people with mental health troubles who had landed in legal jeopardy. He calmly counseled them, praised any signs of progress and shook the hand of one man who, thanks to medication, had turned his life around. But a different type of criminal defendant is now testing the judge's equanimity: Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump's trial on charges that he covered up a sex scandal before and after the 2016 presidential election will bring a maelstrom that no other judge in New York's vast judiciary has ever experienced. Known as a no-nonsense, drama-averse jurist, Justice Merchan, 61, has already reprimanded Mr. Trump's lawyers for arguments that he considered frivolous and issued a gag order intended to protect prosecutors, witnesses and his own family from Mr. Trump's vitriol — and yet the former president has continued to post articles with pictures of the judge's daughter, a political consultant who has worked with Democratic candidates. Although Justice Merchan is a registered Democrat, records show he was previously a Republican, and people who know him described the judge as a moderate, law-and-order former prosecutor. Two people close to Justice Merchan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the judge had privately expressed pain over the attacks on his daughter, but the people said that those attacks won't compromise his ability to oversee the case. Other people who know the judge said that he will cast aside Mr. Trump's drama — and exert control over the trial. 'It is Judge Merchan's show,' said Jill Konviser, a retired judge who has known Justice Merchan for more than 15 years. She added: 'He will do everything he can to, one, control his courtroom and two, ensure a fair trial for the defendant.' In Justice Merchan's 17 years on the bench, 13 as presiding judge in the Mental Health Court he created, he has had his share of unusual cases. There was a murder trial involving a supposed curse on the defendant; the daredevils who jumped off the World Trade Center with parachutes; and a so-called soccer-mom madam accused of running a high-end brothel on the Upper East Side. In that case, an appeals court reduced the steep bail Justice Merchan had set, calling it 'unreasonable.' None of those defendants challenged the judge quite like Mr. Trump, who claims that the case is a witch hunt and declared that Justice Merchan's gag order had infringed on his First Amendment rights. The former president has tested the order's limits by posting articles that named and attacked Justice Merchan's daughter, Loren, and his wife, Lara. The articles, by the conservative activist Laura Loomer, included photos of Loren Merchan and copies of a 2007 mortgage statement for a house owned by Justice Merchan and his wife. Previously, Mr. Trump falsely accused Loren Merchan of posting an image of him behind bars on social media. The trial, which could last two months as a parade of former aides and allies takes the stand against him, will dominate Justice Merchan's calendar this spring. On off-days, he will continue to preside over Mental Health Court. The program is for defendants charged with felonies and diagnosed with a serious mental illness. People who are accepted enter a guilty plea and then begin a period of treatment and judicial supervision. Those who complete the program successfully can have their charges reduced or dismissed. During one recent session, Justice Merchan showed particular interest in the relationship between a defendant and his child, and praised him for his dedication. 'You want to do better by your daughter,' Justice Merchan said. 'I'm sure she's going to appreciate that.'  Donald J. Trump has repeatedly tried to have Juan M. Merchan removed as the judge in his case. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Juan M. Merchan, the judge overseeing Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan, has declined to step aside from the case, rejecting the former president's effort to delay the trial and attack his integrity. The judge announced the decision in the opening minutes of Mr. Trump's trial on Monday morning. After Justice Merchan rules on a variety of legal issues, the trial will begin in earnest with jury selection. 'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said Monday before rejecting the request. 'We want to follow the law,' he added. 'We want justice to be done.' Mr. Trump's lawyers had called on Justice Merchan to recuse himself in a recent court filing, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. The Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case that accuses Mr. Trump of falsifying records to conceal a sex scandal from voters, had argued that no conflict of interest existed. And judicial ethics experts cast doubt on Mr. Trump's request, noting that the judge was not responsible for his daughter's career. It was just the latest attempt by Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, to both delay the trial and oust Justice Merchan. Nor will it be the last: In a separate civil action filed last week, Mr. Trump asked an appeals court to pause the case while it considers whether to remove Justice Merchan. It is a long-shot bid that a single appeals court judge rejected and will be likely to fail before a full five-judge panel. When Mr. Trump tried last year to have Justice Merchan kicked off the case, Justice Merchan rejected it then as well, citing a state advisory committee on judicial ethics that determined that his impartiality could not reasonably be questioned based on his daughter's interests. The repeated attempts reflect the former president's long-running effort to delay all four of his criminal cases past Election Day. Stalling is one of Mr. Trump's favored legal tactics, and he uses it liberally in Manhattan, as well as in the three other cities where he faces criminal charges. If Mr. Trump reclaims the White House, the criminal cases against him would most likely grind to a halt. In the attempt in appeals court to compel the judge's recusal, Emil Bove, a lawyer for the former president, argued that certain facts had changed since Justice Merchan first declined to step aside last year, including that Mr. Trump was now the presumptive Republican nominee for president. But a lawyer for the court system, Lisa Evans, said that there was no reason that the judge should step aside. 'There is absolutely no evidence to show that Judge Merchan will stand to benefit from the outcome of this trial,' Ms. Evans said.

Adam Gray/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The streets outside the Manhattan courtroom where former President Donald J. Trump was set to go on trial were buzzing with anticipation on Monday morning as a crush of reporters — and a trickle of protesters — gathered to bear witness. Right-wing activists were planning rallies in the park directly opposite the court, which was subject to a heavy police presence. Some journalists and line-sitters had arrived late Sunday night, staking out places in the line to secure limited spaces inside the court's overflow room, where most reporters were gathered. Cameras lined the sidewalks outside the courthouse, a glowering edifice at 100 Centre Street, just blocks from New York's City Hall. TV crews were going live in intervals since before dawn, even as the police manned metal barricades. As the sun rose, some anti-Trump demonstrators had arrived, including one toting a sign reading 'Loser,' a favorite insult of the former president. Nadine Seiler, 58, took a midnight bus from Waldorf, Md., to get to the courthouse by dawn. 'This is the first and possibly only trial he's going to be on,' she said, holding up a spray-painted sheet reading 'Convict Trump Already.' Mr. Trump also had fans outside the courthouse, including Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist who argued with an anti-Trump protester as a gaggle of journalists surrounded them. Andrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City and lawyer for Mr. Trump, also came by to show support, arguing that the trial was a political persecution. 'He's somebody who I consider to be a mentor, almost like an uncle to me,' said Mr. Giuliani. Noting Mr. Trump's status as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Mr. Giuliani claimed: 'They want to tie him up for months at a time.' Others were simply there to witness the moment. 'I think it's a really difficult moment in American history,' said Sue Scarlett Montgomery, a filmmaker. 'It's a sad day, but here we are.'  The first criminal trial of an American president officially began on Monday as prosecutors and defense lawyers convened in a Manhattan courtroom to start selecting the jury that will decide Donald J. Trump's fate. The initial pool of prospective jurors dwindled rapidly. More than half of the first group of 96 were dismissed in short order after indicating that they did not believe they could be impartial. Court adjourned for the day roughly two hours after jury selection began, with zero jurors chosen. Before beginning the arduous process of choosing a jury for the landmark trial — on allegations that Mr. Trump falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star — the judge overseeing the case once again declined to step aside, rejecting Mr. Trump's latest effort to oust him. But there was also a ruling that favored the former president: The judge, Juan M. Merchan, rejected a request by prosecutors to introduce accusations of sexual assault that women lodged against Mr. Trump years ago, calling them 'rumors' and 'complete gossip.' The Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case against Mr. Trump, also asked the judge to hold Mr. Trump in contempt and penalize him $3,000 for violating a gag order barring him from attacking witnesses in the case. On social media over the weekend, Mr. Trump assailed one of the prosecution's key witnesses: Michael D. Cohen, his former fixer. Mr. Cohen paid $130,000 to the porn star, Stormy Daniels, during the 2016 presidential campaign to keep quiet about a sexual encounter she said she had with Mr. Trump. After the lunch break — during which Mr. Trump posted a video of an ally yelling about the judge's wife — Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month to discuss potential violations of the gag order, which also bars Mr. Trump from attacking the judge's family. The jury selection process could take two weeks or more, and the trial may spill into June. Mr. Trump is expected to be in the courtroom for much of it. Mr. Trump seemed alternately irritated and exhausted during pretrial arguments on Monday, sometimes smirking and scoffing, but also appearing to nod off, his mouth slack and his head drooping to his chest. After the trial got underway in the afternoon, he chuckled when Justice Merchan told the first group of 96 prospective jurors that he would ensure a fair trial. Mr. Trump, who might take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied the sexual encounter with Ms. Daniels. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records to hide the reimbursements to Mr. Cohen. They argue the payment to Ms. Daniels was part of a pattern: Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election. Here's what else to know about Mr. Trump's trial: This is the Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump, and it was brought by the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a year ago. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. The case, one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America. Mr. Trump's team will be looking for red needles in a blue haystack.\nMr. Trump has twice sought Justice Merchan's recusal, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. Justice Merchan has declined to step aside, noting a ruling by a judicial ethics commission that found his daughter's work posed no conflict for him. 'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said in court on Monday, adding, 'we want to follow the law, we want justice to be done.' Mr. Trump has also attacked the judge's daughter on social media.\nHundreds of potential jurors have been summoned. Those who say they cannot be fair or otherwise serve are being excused, and the remaining prospective jurors will answer 42 questions compiled before the trial. Lawyers on both sides will be able to remove a limited number of them without explanation. The lawyers can also ask to remove a potential juror 'for cause' by providing specific reasons they believe that person cannot be fair. In addition to the payment to Ms. Daniels, Mr. Bragg's office is expected to highlight two other deals involving The National Enquirer, a tabloid that has longstanding ties to Mr. Trump. In one deal, the tabloid bought the silence of a man who had heard that Mr. Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock, a rumor that turned out to be false, and in the other, it paid Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, who wanted to sell her story of an affair with Mr. Trump.\nThe prosecution's witness list is expected to include David Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, as well as Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal could also testify. Prospective jurors will answer a uniform set of questions aimed at discerning bias for or against the former president. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Follow our live coverage of Trump's hush money trial . The hundreds of New Yorkers who report for jury duty Monday morning in Manhattan will embark on an experience not found in history books: They will be vetted as jurors for the trial of a former U.S. president. The task won't be easy. Lawyers for Donald J. Trump and prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney's office will narrow the pool to 12 jurors and several alternates. Both sides will try to discern biases that could alter the outcome of the trial, posing dozens of questions that have been discussed and debated for weeks. The jurors, for their part, will be expected to answer each question honestly in an intimidating environment, just steps away from the former president, who is expected to attend much of the trial. Here's what we know about the process: The jury pool is composed of Manhattanites. Beyond that, little about the group is known, even by prosecutors and defense lawyers. Both sides will use the next several days, or weeks, to find out all they can. Because New York State does not allow juries to operate in full anonymity, the parties, including the former president, will know the jurors' names. The lawyers will also have access to their addresses. (Mr. Trump will not.) The public may never know the jurors' names. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, granted the prosecutors' request to withhold them. After reading a summary of the allegations, Justice Merchan will ask the prospective jurors whether they believe they can be fair and impartial. They will also be asked if they have any scheduling conflicts that would prevent them from attending every day of the trial, which could last more than six weeks. Those who raise concerns will most likely be removed from the pool. The jurors who remain will all be asked the same set of questions. One by one, they will talk — briefly and vaguely — about what they do for a living, their education and their families. They will be asked where they get their news, what radio and podcasts they listen to and whether they've read books written by Mr. Trump or his former fixer Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be a central witness. Other questions will be more pointed. Jurors will be asked if they've ever volunteered or attended a campaign event for Mr. Trump or one of his opponents. They will also be asked to divulge feelings or opinions they have about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case. But the jurors will not be asked how they voted in past elections, whom they plan to vote for, whether they have made political contributions or their party registration. Mr. Trump's legal team and prosecutors for the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, can challenge the inclusion of prospective jurors by providing specific reasons they believe a juror cannot be fair and impartial. The judge has the final say. Both sides will also receive a certain number of chances to remove jurors without explanation. After all of the challenged jurors are removed from the jury pool, Justice Merchan will seat the jury with those who remain. If Mr. Trump's behavior at previous trials is any guide, he is likely to be very involved in jury selection. In a previous defamation case, Mr. Trump was fixated on the jurors from the moment they walked into the courtroom. He pivoted in his chair to study them as they answered biographical questions. He frequently talked to his attorneys. But Mr. Trump's comments about the jurors in this case should start and stop in the courtroom. In addition to being ordered not to reveal their names, Mr. Trump is also subject to a gag order issued by Justice Merchan preventing him from making public statements about them.  © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nDonald J. Trump's lawyers faced an uphill battle Monday with Justice Juan M. Merchan, a no-nonsense jurist. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab courtroom in New York City while Mr. Trump looked on.\nMr. Trump was charged in Manhattan, a deeply Democratic county and his former home, with falsifying nearly three dozen business records in an attempt to cover up a payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, who has said she had a brief sexual encounter with him in 2006.\nMr. Trump denies that encounter happened, and has declared his innocence, calling the charges politically motivated. He has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a Democrat, who also attended the first day of trial on Monday.\nMr. Trump faces 34 felony counts and could face probation or up to four years of prison time.\nThe trial, which is expected to last weeks, has a fascinating list of potential witnesses: Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer turned apostate, who made the payment; Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who says she, too, had an affair with Mr. Trump; and Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels herself may testify.\nBefore any of that happens, a jury must be selected, a winnowing that began Monday.\nHere are five takeaways from Mr. Trump's first day on trial:\nJustice Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, has been consistent about batting back defense motions on issues including the tardy disclosure of documents by prosecutors and efforts to delay or even dismiss the case.\nThat pattern continued on Monday, as Justice Merchan rejected a defense effort to force his recusal. The defense had cited several issues, including the fact that his daughter is a Democratic political consultant.\nHe also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost.\nBut Mr. Trump's lawyers convinced Justice Merchan that sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the so-called Access Hollywood tape, in which Mr. Trump was caught bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial, calling them 'complete rumors, complete gossip, completely hearsay.'\nJustice Merchan's decisions on Monday made it clear that the trial will resurface unsavory events in the former president's life.\nThose include the Access Hollywood tape and other stories that Mr. Trump sought to suppress including an alleged affair with Ms. McDougal. Justice Merchan said on Monday that both could be discussed.\nIn a minor victory for the defense, the judge reaffirmed that the 'Access Hollywood' tape itself could not be played, but that Trump's exact words could be entered into the record.\nStill, most of Mr. Merchan's rulings indicated that salacious details of Mr. Trump's biography will be heard in court.\nEntering the courtroom, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here.'\nOnce he was in front of Mr. Merchan, Mr. Trump looked a lot less enthusiastic. He slouched. He scowled. He scoffed. And he was quiet, not the norm for a man who built a political career with his gift for slashing attacks and vicious put-downs.\nIn court, the former president spoke only briefly, when asked a few questions by Justice Merchan about procedural matters, and whether he understood the consequences — ejection or jail — if he interrupted proceedings. He did whisper with his lawyers. And when the prosecution played a recording of him claiming to have great respect for women, he mouthed the word 'true.'\nBut all in all, it seems it could be an exhausting experience for Mr. Trump; at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep.\nIt's easy to forget how long it takes to do a little in legal settings. On Monday, the morning session was dominated by maneuvering by prosecutors and the defense, even as prospective jurors waited. By lunch, they were still waiting.\nJury selection could take days or weeks, and the trial itself may take two months. The Passover holiday could cause delays, Justice Merchan said, though he might make some of that up by holding hearings on court matters on Wednesdays, which was previously going to be an off day.\nBy afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into Justice Merchan's courtroom. He warmly welcomed them, introduced the lawyers and Mr. Trump and read them a summary of the case.\nJustice Merchan asked if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president. Of the 96 prospective jurors in the room at that time, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused.\nThe remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.\nApril 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET Trump spoke briefly to TV cameras after court adjourned for the day, repeating his longstanding claims that the trial is a 'political witch hunt' before heading to his motorcade and departing the courthouse.\nVideo Reporter: [inaudible] the trial — [inaudible] So thank you very much. We had some amazing things happen today. As you know, my son is graduating from high school and it looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation of my son, who's worked very, very hard.

And it looks like the judges isn't going to allow me to escape this scam. It's a scam trial.

'And letting you know that Donald Trump did nothing wrong until you start reporting the truth.'\nMs. Loomer described the case as a 'witch hunt' — a frequent assertion of Mr. Trump's — and criticized a key witness for the prosecution, Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, and the wife of the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan.\nMr. Trump promptly reposted the video on Truth Social — despite a gag order that bars him from attacking witnesses in the case or Justice Merchan's family. His post, made during the lunch break, came shortly before Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month on prosecutors' request that Mr. Trump be held in contempt of court over statements they say violate the order.\nPerformance artists also vied for attention. One, known as Crackhead Barney, stood screaming outside the gates surrounding Collect Pond Park that she had been kicked out, and demanded police officers' badge numbers. Another played the flute atop a park bench, notes drifting through the wind and his instrument glinting in the sunlight.\nSome anti-Trump demonstrators held handmade signs emblazoned with 'Loser' and 'Convict Trump Already,' while others tried to confront Ms. Loomer. One, Sue Scarlett Montgomery, asked reporters why they were paying attention to Ms. Loomer, a former Republican candidate for Congress who previously visited a treacherous migrant crossing in Panama as part of her anti-Muslim activism.\n'They're covering me because I broke the story about this corrupt judge here,' Ms. Loomer shot back, attacking Judge Merchan's daughter, a Democratic political consultant who has also been a target of Mr. Trump.\nApril 15, 2024, 4:15 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 4:15 p.m. ET The latest potential juror to be questioned reads The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, but is also the first person to say they are a New York Post reader.

They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair.\nThe process could take two weeks or more — and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court.\n'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.'\nThe stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County — Manhattan, as most people know it — which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020.\nMr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions.\nMr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated.\nProsecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28.\nUnlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.'\nSome may not be completely forthcoming.\n'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said.\nMr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors.\n'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J.

He sat motionless while his own words from the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape — on which bragged about grabbing women's genitals — were read from a transcript by a prosecutor.\nAt times, Mr. Trump's emotions were characteristically on display. He smirked and scoffed, and appeared frustrated when the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, did not immediately agree that he could miss court to attend the graduation of his youngest son, Barron.\nBut when Justice Merchan warned that Mr. Trump could be ejected or thrown in jail if he disrupts the proceedings, the former president indicated that he understood.\nThe only time Mr. Trump showed a flash of humor was when he laughed at one of his own social media posts, which attacked his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be the prosecution's central witness.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J.

Trump's criminal trial on Monday again refused to allow the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape to be played for jurors, but said that the comments Mr. Trump made on the tape could be introduced as evidence.\nOn the tape, revealed in The Washington Post about a month before Mr. Trump was elected president in 2016, he is heard bragging about grabbing women's genitals, saying he could do so with abandon because 'when you're a star, they let you do it.'\n'You can do anything,' Mr. Trump said on the recording.\nThe tape rocked Mr. Trump's campaign. And prosecutors in Manhattan say it led him to agree to pay off Stormy Daniels, a porn star, who was shopping a story of a 2006 sexual encounter with the candidate.\nMichael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, paid Ms. Daniels $130,000. The payment is at the heart of the 34 felony charges against Mr. Trump, who is accused of falsifying business records to cover it up.\nThe judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, had previously ruled that prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office could question witnesses about the tape, but found that it would be prejudicial to allow the actual video to the played. He reaffirmed that ruling on Monday.\n'You can bring out what was said in the tape,' Justice Merchan said, adding that he didn't want jurors 'to hear Mr. Trump's voice and his gestures' in the tape.\nIn a victory for the defense, the judge also ruled that the prosecution could not introduce evidence about sexual assault allegations against Mr. Trump that surfaced in the aftermath of the tape becoming public, calling them 'complete hearsay.'\nHowever, Justice Merchan said that prosecutors could introduce emails that followed the tape's disclosure, showing frantic efforts by Trump advisers to contain the fallout. The correspondence, he said, 'bolsters the people's claim that this was a crucial event.'\nTodd Blanche, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, had called on Justice Merchan to reconsider admitting 'this extremely salacious evidence,' which he described as 'very prejudicial.'\nMr. Trump, who is again the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has denied any wrongdoing and has cast the case against him as politically motivated.\nJustice Juan M.

Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Inside a dreary Lower Manhattan courtroom on a recent Wednesday, Justice Juan M. Merchan convened a special session for people with mental health troubles who had landed in legal jeopardy. He calmly counseled them, praised any signs of progress and shook the hand of one man who, thanks to medication, had turned his life around.\nBut a different type of criminal defendant is now testing the judge's equanimity: Donald J. Trump.\nMr. Trump's trial on charges that he covered up a sex scandal before and after the 2016 presidential election will bring a maelstrom that no other judge in New York's vast judiciary has ever experienced.\nKnown as a no-nonsense, drama-averse jurist, Justice Merchan, 61, has already reprimanded Mr. Trump's lawyers for arguments that he considered frivolous and issued a gag order intended to protect prosecutors, witnesses and his own family from Mr. Trump's vitriol — and yet the former president has continued to post articles with pictures of the judge's daughter, a political consultant who has worked with Democratic candidates.\nAlthough Justice Merchan is a registered Democrat, records show he was previously a Republican, and people who know him described the judge as a moderate, law-and-order former prosecutor.\nTwo people close to Justice Merchan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the judge had privately expressed pain over the attacks on his daughter, but the people said that those attacks won't compromise his ability to oversee the case. Other people who know the judge said that he will cast aside Mr. Trump's drama — and exert control over the trial.\n'It is Judge Merchan's show,' said Jill Konviser, a retired judge who has known Justice Merchan for more than 15 years. She added: 'He will do everything he can to, one, control his courtroom and two, ensure a fair trial for the defendant.'\nIn Justice Merchan's 17 years on the bench, 13 as presiding judge in the Mental Health Court he created, he has had his share of unusual cases. There was a murder trial involving a supposed curse on the defendant; the daredevils who jumped off the World Trade Center with parachutes; and a so-called soccer-mom madam accused of running a high-end brothel on the Upper East Side. In that case, an appeals court reduced the steep bail Justice Merchan had set, calling it 'unreasonable.'\nNone of those defendants challenged the judge quite like Mr. Trump, who claims that the case is a witch hunt and declared that Justice Merchan's gag order had infringed on his First Amendment rights.\nThe former president has tested the order's limits by posting articles that named and attacked Justice Merchan's daughter, Loren, and his wife, Lara. The articles, by the conservative activist Laura Loomer, included photos of Loren Merchan and copies of a 2007 mortgage statement for a house owned by Justice Merchan and his wife. Previously, Mr. Trump falsely accused Loren Merchan of posting an image of him behind bars on social media.\nThe trial, which could last two months as a parade of former aides and allies takes the stand against him, will dominate Justice Merchan's calendar this spring.\nOn off-days, he will continue to preside over Mental Health Court. The program is for defendants charged with felonies and diagnosed with a serious mental illness. People who are accepted enter a guilty plea and then begin a period of treatment and judicial supervision. Those who complete the program successfully can have their charges reduced or dismissed.\nDuring one recent session, Justice Merchan showed particular interest in the relationship between a defendant and his child, and praised him for his dedication.\n'You want to do better by your daughter,' Justice Merchan said. 'I'm sure she's going to appreciate that.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Donald J. Trump has repeatedly tried to have Juan M. Merchan removed as the judge in his case. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Juan M. Merchan, the judge overseeing Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan, has declined to step aside from the case, rejecting the former president's effort to delay the trial and attack his integrity.\nThe judge announced the decision in the opening minutes of Mr. Trump's trial on Monday morning. After Justice Merchan rules on a variety of legal issues, the trial will begin in earnest with jury selection.\n'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said Monday before rejecting the request. 'We want to follow the law,' he added. 'We want justice to be done.'\nMr. Trump's lawyers had called on Justice Merchan to recuse himself in a recent court filing, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant.\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case that accuses Mr. Trump of falsifying records to conceal a sex scandal from voters, had argued that no conflict of interest existed. And judicial ethics experts cast doubt on Mr. Trump's request, noting that the judge was not responsible for his daughter's career.\nIt was just the latest attempt by Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, to both delay the trial and oust Justice Merchan. Nor will it be the last: In a separate civil action filed last week, Mr. Trump asked an appeals court to pause the case while it considers whether to remove Justice Merchan. It is a long-shot bid that a single appeals court judge rejected and will be likely to fail before a full five-judge panel.\nWhen Mr. Trump tried last year to have Justice Merchan kicked off the case, Justice Merchan rejected it then as well, citing a state advisory committee on judicial ethics that determined that his impartiality could not reasonably be questioned based on his daughter's interests.\nThe repeated attempts reflect the former president's long-running effort to delay all four of his criminal cases past Election Day. Stalling is one of Mr. Trump's favored legal tactics, and he uses it liberally in Manhattan, as well as in the three other cities where he faces criminal charges. If Mr. Trump reclaims the White House, the criminal cases against him would most likely grind to a halt.\nIn the attempt in appeals court to compel the judge's recusal, Emil Bove, a lawyer for the former president, argued that certain facts had changed since Justice Merchan first declined to step aside last year, including that Mr. Trump was now the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\nBut a lawyer for the court system, Lisa Evans, said that there was no reason that the judge should step aside.\n'There is absolutely no evidence to show that Judge Merchan will stand to benefit from the outcome of this trial,' Ms. Evans said.\nVideo transcript\nTrump Supporters Rally Outside New York Courthouse Pro-Trump protesters gathered near the Manhattan courthouse where the former president's criminal trial is taking place.

Adam Gray/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The streets outside the Manhattan courtroom where former President Donald J. Trump was set to go on trial were buzzing with anticipation on Monday morning as a crush of reporters — and a trickle of protesters — gathered to bear witness.\nRight-wing activists were planning rallies in the park directly opposite the court, which was subject to a heavy police presence. Some journalists and line-sitters had arrived late Sunday night, staking out places in the line to secure limited spaces inside the court's overflow room, where most reporters were gathered.\nCameras lined the sidewalks outside the courthouse, a glowering edifice at 100 Centre Street, just blocks from New York's City Hall. TV crews were going live in intervals since before dawn, even as the police manned metal barricades. As the sun rose, some anti-Trump demonstrators had arrived, including one toting a sign reading 'Loser,' a favorite insult of the former president.\nNadine Seiler, 58, took a midnight bus from Waldorf, Md., to get to the courthouse by dawn. 'This is the first and possibly only trial he's going to be on,' she said, holding up a spray-painted sheet reading 'Convict Trump Already.'\nMr. Trump also had fans outside the courthouse, including Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist who argued with an anti-Trump protester as a gaggle of journalists surrounded them.\nAndrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City and lawyer for Mr. Trump, also came by to show support, arguing that the trial was a political persecution.\n'He's somebody who I consider to be a mentor, almost like an uncle to me,' said Mr. Giuliani.\nNoting Mr. Trump's status as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Mr. Giuliani claimed: 'They want to tie him up for months at a time.'\nOthers were simply there to witness the moment. 'I think it's a really difficult moment in American history,' said Sue Scarlett Montgomery, a filmmaker. 'It's a sad day, but here we are.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT The first criminal trial of an American president officially began on Monday as prosecutors and defense lawyers convened in a Manhattan courtroom to start selecting the jury that will decide Donald J. Trump's fate.\nThe initial pool of prospective jurors dwindled rapidly. More than half of the first group of 96 were dismissed in short order after indicating that they did not believe they could be impartial. Court adjourned for the day roughly two hours after jury selection began, with zero jurors chosen.\nBefore beginning the arduous process of choosing a jury for the landmark trial — on allegations that Mr. Trump falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star — the judge overseeing the case once again declined to step aside, rejecting Mr. Trump's latest effort to oust him.\nBut there was also a ruling that favored the former president: The judge, Juan M. Merchan, rejected a request by prosecutors to introduce accusations of sexual assault that women lodged against Mr. Trump years ago, calling them 'rumors' and 'complete gossip.'\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case against Mr. Trump, also asked the judge to hold Mr. Trump in contempt and penalize him $3,000 for violating a gag order barring him from attacking witnesses in the case.\nOn social media over the weekend, Mr. Trump assailed one of the prosecution's key witnesses: Michael D. Cohen, his former fixer. Mr. Cohen paid $130,000 to the porn star, Stormy Daniels, during the 2016 presidential campaign to keep quiet about a sexual encounter she said she had with Mr. Trump.\nAfter the lunch break — during which Mr. Trump posted a video of an ally yelling about the judge's wife — Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month to discuss potential violations of the gag order, which also bars Mr. Trump from attacking the judge's family.\nThe jury selection process could take two weeks or more, and the trial may spill into June. Mr. Trump is expected to be in the courtroom for much of it.\nMr. Trump seemed alternately irritated and exhausted during pretrial arguments on Monday, sometimes smirking and scoffing, but also appearing to nod off, his mouth slack and his head drooping to his chest. After the trial got underway in the afternoon, he chuckled when Justice Merchan told the first group of 96 prospective jurors that he would ensure a fair trial.\nMr. Trump, who might take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied the sexual encounter with Ms. Daniels. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records to hide the reimbursements to Mr. Cohen. They argue the payment to Ms. Daniels was part of a pattern: Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election.\nHere's what else to know about Mr. Trump's trial:\nThis is the Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump, and it was brought by the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a year ago. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. The case, one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America. Mr. Trump's team will be looking for red needles in a blue haystack.\nMr. Trump has twice sought Justice Merchan's recusal, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. Justice Merchan has declined to step aside, noting a ruling by a judicial ethics commission that found his daughter's work posed no conflict for him. 'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said in court on Monday, adding, 'we want to follow the law, we want justice to be done.' Mr. Trump has also attacked the judge's daughter on social media.\nHundreds of potential jurors have been summoned. Those who say they cannot be fair or otherwise serve are being excused, and the remaining prospective jurors will answer 42 questions compiled before the trial. Lawyers on both sides will be able to remove a limited number of them without explanation. The lawyers can also ask to remove a potential juror 'for cause' by providing specific reasons they believe that person cannot be fair.\nIn addition to the payment to Ms. Daniels, Mr. Bragg's office is expected to highlight two other deals involving The National Enquirer, a tabloid that has longstanding ties to Mr. Trump. In one deal, the tabloid bought the silence of a man who had heard that Mr. Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock, a rumor that turned out to be false, and in the other, it paid Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, who wanted to sell her story of an affair with Mr. Trump.\nThe prosecution's witness list is expected to include David Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, as well as Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal could also testify.\nProspective jurors will answer a uniform set of questions aimed at discerning bias for or against the former president. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Follow our live coverage of Trump's hush money trial .\nFollow our live coverage of Trump's hush money trial . The hundreds of New Yorkers who report for jury duty Monday morning in Manhattan will embark on an experience not found in history books: They will be vetted as jurors for the trial of a former U.S. president.\nThe task won't be easy. Lawyers for Donald J. Trump and prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney's office will narrow the pool to 12 jurors and several alternates. Both sides will try to discern biases that could alter the outcome of the trial, posing dozens of questions that have been discussed and debated for weeks.\nThe jurors, for their part, will be expected to answer each question honestly in an intimidating environment, just steps away from the former president, who is expected to attend much of the trial.\nHere's what we know about the process:\nThe jury pool is composed of Manhattanites. Beyond that, little about the group is known, even by prosecutors and defense lawyers. Both sides will use the next several days, or weeks, to find out all they can.\nBecause New York State does not allow juries to operate in full anonymity, the parties, including the former president, will know the jurors' names. The lawyers will also have access to their addresses. (Mr. Trump will not.)\nThe public may never know the jurors' names. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, granted the prosecutors' request to withhold them.\nAfter reading a summary of the allegations, Justice Merchan will ask the prospective jurors whether they believe they can be fair and impartial. They will also be asked if they have any scheduling conflicts that would prevent them from attending every day of the trial, which could last more than six weeks. Those who raise concerns will most likely be removed from the pool.\nThe jurors who remain will all be asked the same set of questions. One by one, they will talk — briefly and vaguely — about what they do for a living, their education and their families. They will be asked where they get their news, what radio and podcasts they listen to and whether they've read books written by Mr. Trump or his former fixer Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be a central witness.\nOther questions will be more pointed. Jurors will be asked if they've ever volunteered or attended a campaign event for Mr. Trump or one of his opponents. They will also be asked to divulge feelings or opinions they have about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case.\nBut the jurors will not be asked how they voted in past elections, whom they plan to vote for, whether they have made political contributions or their party registration.\nMr. Trump's legal team and prosecutors for the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, can challenge the inclusion of prospective jurors by providing specific reasons they believe a juror cannot be fair and impartial. The judge has the final say.\nBoth sides will also receive a certain number of chances to remove jurors without explanation. After all of the challenged jurors are removed from the jury pool, Justice Merchan will seat the jury with those who remain.\nIf Mr. Trump's behavior at previous trials is any guide, he is likely to be very involved in jury selection. In a previous defamation case, Mr. Trump was fixated on the jurors from the moment they walked into the courtroom. He pivoted in his chair to study them as they answered biographical questions. He frequently talked to his attorneys.\nBut Mr. Trump's comments about the jurors in this case should start and stop in the courtroom. In addition to being ordered not to reveal their names, Mr. Trump is also subject to a gag order issued by Justice Merchan preventing him from making public statements about them.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences",

            "summary": "Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index The United States and other members of the United Nations Security Council urged restraint in the Middle East on Sunday, as officials in Israel debated how to respond to a direct attack by Iran over the weekend that threatened to further destabilize the region. Israel's military, with the help of the United States, Britain and Jordan, shot down nearly all of the drones and missiles that Iran fired on Saturday, in what was believed to be the first direct Iranian attack on Israel after years of a shadow war. Life largely returned to normal in Israel on Sunday, and there were indications that the military would not seek to immediately retaliate against Iran, even as tensions remained high in the region. Iranian officials also appeared to signal that its operation against Israel was over. Israel's war cabinet concluded a meeting on Sunday evening without deciding how to respond to Iran's assault, according to an official briefed on the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks more freely. By nightfall, the military had yet to detail possible options, the official said.\nIn public, Israeli ministers appeared divided over how to respond. Benny Gantz, a centrist minister and one of three voting members of the war cabinet, said that Israel should exact a price from Iran, but only 'in a way and at a time that suits us.' Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right minister, then criticized Mr. Gantz for his perceived moderation, arguing that Israel should deter Iran by going 'crazy.'\nThe Biden administration is advising Israel that it does not necessarily need to fire back at Iran, with U.S. officials saying that Israel had proved its ability to protect itself.\nIranian officials issued a series of statements that appeared designed to keep tensions from escalating further. Iran's foreign minister said that Tehran 'has no intention of continuing defensive operations, but if necessary it will not hesitate to protect its legitimate interests against any new aggression.' Residents remove possessions and inspect their homes following Israeli airstrikes in Khan Yunis, Gaza, on Saturday. Israeli military analysts are divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza. Credit...Within moments of Israel and its allies shooting down a fusillade of Iranian missiles and drones this weekend, many began wondering what the latest exchange between Israel and Iran would mean for the war in the Gaza Strip. The Iranian attack was retaliation for what was widely believed to be an Israeli strike this month on an embassy building in Damascus that killed seven Iranian officials, including three top commanders in Iran's armed forces. But it occurred against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel is battling Hamas, a militant group funded and armed by Iran. Israeli military analysts were divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza, now in its sixth month. The next fulcrum in that war could hinge on whether Israel decides to pursue Hamas in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have fled amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis. Some analysts argued that the implications for Gaza would depend on whether Israel responded with a major counterattack against Iran. Others contended that Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip would be unaffected. Shlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general and a former director of the Israeli military's strategic planning division, said that if Israel responds with substantial force to the Iranian attack, it could spark a multifront war that would compel the Israeli leadership to move its attention away from Gaza. In the case of a significant regional conflagration, General Brom said, Israel might choose to delay its plans to invade Rafah, which Israeli officials describe as the last Hamas stronghold. 'It's not comfortable for us to have simultaneous, high-intensity wars in multiple theaters,' General Brom added. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to send ground forces into Rafah, despite international pressure to back off the operation. On Sunday, an Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that the Iranian attack would have no effect on the military's plan to invade Rafah. A large-scale direct confrontation with Iran could potentially bring the war in Gaza to a close, General Brom said. But for the war to end in such a way, it would require a broader cease-fire that encompassed several parties, including Israel, Iran and the Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. 'There's an idea that in order to resolve a crisis, the situation first needs to become worse,' he said, explaining that an escalation followed by a comprehensive cease-fire with Iran might incline that country to push its regional proxies to stop fighting with Israel. While the members of Israel's war cabinet did not issue a formal statement after meeting on Sunday, a separate Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, indicated that the country would respond to the Iranian assault — although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how. Other military experts, however, dismissed the link between the Iranian attack and the war in Gaza. 'There's no connection at all,' said Amos Gilead, a retired major general who served in Israeli military intelligence. General Gilead said that Israel's army had enough resources to fight against Iran and continue to wage war against Hamas in Gaza. Others analysts made a similar point, arguing that the resources needed to fight Iran were different from those needed in Gaza. Israel needs fighter jets and air defense systems to counter Iran, they said. In contrast, they added, the army mainly requires ground troops, drones, and attack helicopters to fight Hamas in Gaza. 'There's no real tension between these two things,' said Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former head of Israel's National Security Council. Still, General Eiland said that the success of the coalition that repelled the Iranian attack, which included the United States, Britain and Jordan, could inspire Israel to take advantage of the momentum to overcome its declining status internationally by ending the war in Gaza. Though the United States, Israel's closest ally, has broadly supported Israel's decision to go to war in Gaza, it has increasingly signaled its displeasure over the mounting death toll and warned against a major ground assault in Rafah. The support the United States provided Israel on Sunday in shooting down Iranian drones and missiles could give it more leverage over its Israeli counterparts. While General Eiland said such an outcome could help Israel develop good will in the international community and contribute to reaching a solution to end the war in Gaza and skirmishes with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, he was doubtful that Mr. Netanyahu would purse such a path. 'He says he wants to achieve ‘total victory' in Gaza and conquer Rafah, a process that could last two or three months,' he said, referring to the prime minister. 'It's clear Netanyahu has a different mind-set and priorities.' Aaron Boxerman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

Credit... Yuki Iwamura/Associated Press The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, with diplomats urging restraint by all parties to prevent conflict in the region from escalating. The brazen attack this weekend, when Iran launched a barrage of drones and missiles in retaliation for Israel's attacking its embassy compound in Syria earlier in the month, was the first time Iran had launched open attacks against Israel from its soil. The attack has unnerved a region already roiling in conflict, raising concerns among diplomats and U.N. officials that a new, potentially wide and destructive war could spark if both sides don't stand down. António Guterres, the Secretary General of the U.N., told the Council that it was 'time to step back from the brink,' and that its members, as well as the United Nations at large, had the collective responsibility 'to actively engage all parties concerned to prevent further escalation.' The meeting on Sunday was convened at the request of Israel. The Council has not collectively issued a statement condemning Iran's attack, and it has also not issued a statement condemning Israel's attack on Iran's embassy in Damascus that killed several senior commanders. All 15 members of the Council must reach a consensus for a statement to be issued and none was reached on both issues. The Security Council is one of the few venues where adversaries engaged in conflict come face to face and sit in the same chamber. On Sunday, both Israel and Iran's ambassadors were present and delivered fiery comments about the other's country, blaming each other for actions they both called terrorism. Gilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador, said Iran's attack had 'crossed every red line' and Israel reserved the right to retaliate. Mr. Erdan called for the Council to take severe action against Iran, including 'crippling' sanctions and statements of condemnation. 'The fact that Israel's air defense proved to be superior does not change the brutality of Iran's attack,' he said. Iran's ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, said his country had an 'inherent right to self-defense' after Israel's attack on its diplomatic compound. Mr. Iravani said that Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region,' but that if its interests, people or national security came under attack it would 'respond to any such threat or aggressions vigorously and in accordance with international law.' The United States and Iran both said that they do not seek war with one another, but that if one attacks the other's interests, there would be a defensive response. Robert A. Wood, a U.S. representative to the U.N., told the Security Council that the 'U.S. is not seeking escalation, our actions have been defensive in nature,' and said the U.S. goal was to 'de-escalate' and then get back to securing an end to the conflict in Gaza. Mr. Wood said the U.S. planned to bring further action on Iran at the Council and called on the Council to unequivocally condemn Iran's actions. Any resolution against Iran put forth by the U.S. at the Council would likely be vetoed by Russia and China, two of Iran's close allies, who sharply criticized Israel for what they said was reckless violation of international law when it attacked Iran's embassy compound. 'What happened in the night of the 14th of April did not happen in a vacuum,' said Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's ambassador to the U.N. China's ambassador, Dai Bing, called on the Council to 'exercise maximum calm and restraint' and said the implementation of an immediate cease-fire is the 'top priority.' Israel has said that the embassy compound was a legitimate military target because senior commanders from Iran's Quds Forces, the external branch of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, were holding a meeting inside the building. April 14, 2024, 7:11 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 7:11 p.m. ET Michael D. Shear Reporting from Washington The White House said that President Biden and King Abdullah II of Jordan spoke on Sunday about the Iranian attacks and pledged to stay in contact in the days ahead. Officials said the two men also discussed the situation in Gaza, pledging to increase humanitarian aid and to work to end the conflict as soon as possible.

Ramadan Abed/Reuters As thousands of displaced Palestinians attempted to return to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday, Israeli troops fired at the crowd, forcing people to turn back in panic, according to an emergency worker and two people who tried to make the journey. Wafa, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency, reported that five people were killed and 23 wounded by Israeli gunfire and artillery in the incident on Al-Rashid Street south of Gaza City as a crowd of Gazans headed north to their homes. The circumstances of the deaths could not be confirmed independently, and the Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions about whether its forces opened fire on Palestinian civilians trying to cross to northern Gaza. For months, the Israeli military has barred Palestinians who have been displaced by the war in Gaza from returning to their homes in northern Gaza. It has become a sticking point in negotiations between Israel and Hamas. It was not clear why some Palestinians believed that Israel would not block them from returning on Sunday. But they were making the journey on a day when Iran had launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel. More than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its assault there in October, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health. The assault occurred in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people. On Sunday morning Jamila Ibrahim, 39, said that she began hearing of some Palestinians who left early and managed to get back to the north. She later spoke with friends who were able to return north. But there were very few. Around 10:30 a.m. she and her three children — who are between 10 and 17 — set out, joining other people on the journey. She said there were no official notices from the Israel military, which has occupied large parts of Gaza after it launched a ground invasion, that residents would be allowed to return to their homes. It was just based on word of mouth, as well as people seeing others leaving and being encouraged to join the trek home, she said. 'Some people were scared, they didn't know what fate they were heading to, they didn't know what would happen,' she said. 'Some were happy that they were going to return.' Most people were on foot — carrying what little food they had or their few belongings in bags and luggage — and some paid large sums of money to go by car, trucks or donkey carts, she said. But they all took the same seaside road, heading north toward an Israeli checkpoint that has cut off southern Gaza from the north. 'There was lots of tension, lots of tension among the people, they were scared they could be shot,' she said. Those who tried to cross north in the middle of the night — around 4 a.m. — managed to make it to the north, she said, based on her conversation with friends who crossed successfully. But later that morning, by the time she and other displaced Palestinians tried to follow, Israeli forces opened fire on them, she said. 'Around 12:30 the Israelis started shooting,' she said. Mazen Al-Harazeen, a first responder in Gaza, said Israeli forces fired weapons and he did not know how many had been killed, but he said, 'There was shooting and martyrs.' Early Sunday morning, Avichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces, or I.D.F., wrote on social media that the rumors that the army was allowing residents to return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip were false. 'The I.D.F. will not allow the return of residents,' he added. 'For your safety, do not approach the forces operating there.' Nearly 2 million Gazans have been displaced by the war between Hamas and Israel, now in its sixth month. One of their biggest concerns is when and if they will be allowed to return to their homes, or whether they will be permanently displaced, as previous generations were. Around 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes in 1947 and 1948 during the wars surrounding Israel's establishment as a state. Bilal Shbair contributed reporting. April 14, 2024, 5:49 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:49 p.m. ET Aaron Boxerman Reporting from Jerusalem While Israel's war cabinet members didn't issue a formal statement after the meeting, an Israeli official familiar with the discussions indicated that Israel would undoubtedly respond — although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, said Israel's military still needed to detail possible options. At Amina al-Hasoni's house in the village of al-Fur'ah, Israel, the Iranian attack wounded her and ripped holes in the roof and floor. Credit... Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times The hospital waiting room was quiet on Sunday: There was no crowd of relatives, no flood of patients. Israel's air defenses had just fended off a large-scale Iranian attack, with only one serious casualty recorded. But there was no sense that a crisis had been averted outside the pediatric intensive care unit at Soroka Medical Center in southern Israel's city of Beersheba. Instead, tension filled the air until the doors to the ward swung open and a gasping mother stumbled out, her face contorted. Then raw emotion quickly took its place as she crumbled into a chair, crying. While Israel suffered little in the way of significant damage overnight, this one family was dealt a devastating blow. Amina al-Hasoni, 7, was clinging to life — the sole serious casualty of the Iranian barrage. And were it not for systemic inequities in Israel, her relatives said, maybe she too could have been spared. There are roughly 300,000 Arab Bedouins in the Negev desert. About a quarter of them live in villages that are not recognized by Israeli officials. Without state recognition, those communities have long suffered from a lack of planning and basic services like running water, sewers and electricity. And few have access to bomb shelters, despite repeated requests to the state. The Hasoni family lives in one such community, sharing a hilltop in the Negev village of al-Fur'ah with a plot of disconnected houses. When rocket warning sirens went off on Saturday night, Amina's uncle Ismail said he felt stuck — there was nowhere to go. Booms overhead signaled air defenses intercepting missiles before there was a big explosion. Then he heard a woman screaming — his sister — and 'I started running,' he said. Ismail, 38, found his sister outside her house holding Amina, who was bleeding from the head. Her family had decided to flee the rockets, running out the front door. But Amina, who slept in a back room with pink walls covered in painted butterflies, didn't make it. A missile fragment ripped through the home's thin metal roof, shearing a hole with sharp metallic edges. It made impact just in front of the door — which is where Amina was knocked unconscious. 'I think it hit her while she was running away,' Ismail said. He said he took the injured Amina from his sister and lifted the girl into his own arms. Ismail then tracked down a car that raced her toward the hospital, more than 40 minutes away on a rutted, winding road that fades out in some places, with camels crossing in others. Only then, with Amina on her way, did he go inside the house, where he said he saw a large, black piece of shrapnel about the size of a pretzel jar. And 'there was blood,' he said, a puddle that had turned into a stream across the tile floor, to the front door. By Sunday afternoon, the orange patterned tiles had been cleaned. None of the dozen or so relatives there could say who had done it, only that 'it was bad for the children to see' all the blood. But Ismail hasn't gone back inside. 'It's difficult,' he said, his jeans and boots still spattered with blood. Not far from where he sat, a pink Minnie Mouse blanket and a small black-and-white girl's dress hung on a family clothesline. 'We could have built shelters here,' Ismail added. He dismissed any suggestions that what happened to Amina was bad luck. 'It's part of a policy,' he said. 'We can't do anything.' The missile fragment that tore into Amina's home was one of more than 150 collected in the area on Sunday by police bomb disposal teams, and the family said officers had taken away the piece that hit their home. The teams combed the desert for hours, searching for debris and carting away huge hunks of twisted metal — efforts repeated across Israel. The Hasoni home is not far from a military base, Nevatim, that was reportedly a target of the Iranian assault and that Israeli officials said was lightly damaged. That is little consolation to Amina's father, Muhammad, who spent the morning at the hospital taking turns at her bedside. He didn't say much to her, he said, and just repeated her name. Amina — the youngest of his 14 children — 'likes to laugh and have fun all the time,' said Muhammad, 49. She's a good student with a 'strong personality,' he added, who doesn't always listen to instructions. And she loves to draw. He called Iran's actions 'inhumane.' 'May God demolish them,' he said, without hesitation.

Erdan called for the Council to take severe action against Iran, including sanctions and statements of condemnation. 'The fact that Israel's air defense proved to be superior does not change the brutality of Iran's attack,' he said.

Tomer Neuberg/Associated Press After convening a virtual meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, Group of 7 leaders adopted a joint declaration that reaffirmed their 'full solidarity and support to Israel' and accused Iran of having risked 'provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation' that must be avoided. Iran's attack, which appeared to have been mostly intercepted by Israel and its allies, was carried out in retaliation for Israeli attacks on an Iranian Embassy building in Syria earlier this month. Iranian leaders have signaled that their retaliation is over unless they are attacked again. The joint declaration from the leaders of G7 nations — Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, as well as the European Union — demanded that 'Iran and its proxies cease their attacks.' The leaders said they were ready 'to take further measures now and in response to further destabilizing initiatives.' Hoping to head off Israel from further escalating the conflict, President Biden privately advised Israel against firing back on Iran, U.S. officials said on Sunday. It was not yet clear how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his government would respond. Leaders of the European Union have publicly urged restraint from both countries as they, too, condemned Iran's actions. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, called the attack 'blatant and unjustifiable,' adding that 'all actors must now refrain from further escalation.' Charles Michel, president of the European Council, said that the condemnation from G7 leaders was unanimous and that 'all parties must exercise restraint.' 'Ending the crisis in Gaza as soon as possible, notably through an immediate cease-fire, will make a difference,' Mr. Michel added.

It was not immediately clear what the group had decided about possibly responding to Iran's overnight strikes. Demonstrators gather at Palestine Square in Tehran on Sunday. Credit... Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times Many Iranians stayed glued to their television screens and phones Saturday night, anxiously following updates as their country launched a military attack on Israel and fearing a wider war that would only add to the country's current economic upheaval. In Tehran and several other big cities, lines of cars stretched a mile or more outside gas stations in the middle of the night. Some parents kept their children home from school on Sunday. Tehran's airport closed down, and will remain that way until at least Monday morning. Iranians living inside the country said in interviews that they were worried the confrontation with Israel would spiral out of control and hoped both sides would avoid escalating the conflict. Soheil, a 37-year-old engineer in Isfahan who, like several other Iranians, asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution, said all he and his colleagues could talk about at work on Sunday was the prospect of a broader conflict. 'I'm afraid of war,' he said. 'It will have a great impact on our daily lives, especially on the economy and the price of dollar, and the anxiety will affect our mental health.' Since a strike two weeks ago on the Iranian Embassy complex in Syria that killed three top military commanders, Iran's currency, the rial, has fallen sharply against the U.S. dollar, shrinking purchasing power as Iran's leaders vowed to respond. Nafiseh, a 36-year-old high school teacher in Tehran, said that many of her students did not attend school on Sunday because parents were worried about counterattacks from Israel. 'It's all everyone is talking about, from teenagers to teachers and family members, it's all about the war and attacks,' she said. Supporters of the government hailed the attacks as Iran's showcasing its military might to defend itself on Saturday, with several hundred gathering in Tehran's Palestine Square to celebrate with fireworks and chants of 'Death to Israel.' A large mural on the square depicted Iranian missiles with a message written in Farsi and Hebrew that read, 'Next time the slap will be harder.' On Sunday night, a crowd formed again in the square, carrying signs and chanting anti-Israel slogans. Others took to social media to say they would fight for their country unconditionally if Iran were to go to war. 'When a foreign enemy is involved, honor means standing with our country even at the cost of our lives,' Reza Rashidpour, a civil engineer, wrote on social media. 'Long live Iran, long live soldiers of Iran.' But critics of the government denounced the attacks, seeing them as a misadventure that risks harming ordinary Iranians. Many Iranians oppose government policies that include funding, arming and training groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanese armed group that has increasingly traded fire with Israel since the Oct. 7 attacks that set off the current fighting in Gaza. In protests against the government over the past few years a recurring chant has been, 'No to Gaza, no to Lebanon, my life for Iran.' Ali, a 53-year-old veteran of the Iran-Iraq war who lives in Kerman, said the existence of the Islamic Republic depends on 'crisis.' 'Now they are exploiting the war and the crisis to survive,' he said. April 14, 2024, 4:08 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 4:08 p.m. ET Gaya Gupta Reporting from New York The United Nations Security Council has begun its emergency meeting to address Iran's attacks on Israel. 'The people of the region are confronting a real danger of a devastating, full-scale conflict,' the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, said in opening remarks. 'Now is the time to defuse and deescalate. Now is the time for maximum restraint.' April 14, 2024, 4:36 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 4:36 p.m. ET For the Security Council to issue any statement condemning Iran's actions all of its 15 members would have to agree — a prospect that appears unlikely, given its recent lack of consensus over issuing condemnation statements on Hamas's Oct. 7 attacks and the attack on the Iranian Embassy compound in Syria, which prompted Iran's strikes.

Hannah Mckay/Reuters After many Israelis spent a long night huddled in bomb shelters, life crept back toward calm on Sunday, even as the people of Israel waited tensely to see how their government would respond to the Iranian strikes that set off rarely heard sirens in Jerusalem. Jerusalem is targeted much less frequently than border communities or the coastal metropolis of Tel Aviv, but during the assault loud booms resounded in the skies, where missiles and interceptors wove around one another like fireflies. In areas of Jerusalem with a mostly Jewish population, many crowded into public bomb shelters, some wearing pajamas and lugging sleeping bags. 'There were more people there than usual,' said Zev Palatnik, 33, who spent some of the night in his building's bomb shelter alongside his neighbors. 'There's a sense that the rockets from Iran are more sophisticated than the ones from Gaza,' he said, adding that there was a higher level of anxiety as a result. But on Sunday, a relatively steady amount of foot traffic flowed in downtown Jerusalem as Israelis returned to work. Ron Cohen, a 37-year-old engineer, said he had hoped that the Israeli government would immediately strike back at Iran, but he did not expect a significant Israeli response. 'Not much, maybe a few small things,' he said. 'Our government knows how to defend, but not how to attack.' For the Israelis among the tens of thousands forced to flee communities along the borders with Gaza and Lebanon, the assault compounded six exhausting months of war. Many expressed uncertainty over the best way for the government to respond. Gidi Lapid, who left his home in Metula, near the border with Lebanon, with his family at the beginning of the war, said Israel might be able to show strength through restrained action. But at the same time, Iranians 'should be the ones in existential dread, in bomb shelters, stocking up on food and water,' Mr. Lapid said by phone from Eliav, a small town near Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem. 'Not our peace-seeking nation.'

Although Hezbollah, Iran's most powerful regional proxy, launched rockets into the Golan Heights amid the overnight attack, it largely remained on the sidelines. April 14, 2024, 2:48 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 2:48 p.m. ET Adam Sella Reporting from Tel Aviv With much attention shifted to Iran, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an Israeli grass-roots citizens' group, reiterated its call for a deal to release the approximately 100 hostages held in Gaza. The group said in a statement that the fear and uncertainty felt by Israelis during Iran's overnight strike 'pale in comparison to the terror, dread, despair, loneliness, cold, physical and mental torment' experienced by the hostages. April 14, 2024, 2:32 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 2:32 p.m. ET Eric Schmitt Reporting from Washington American officials said U.S. fighter jets shot down more than 70 exploding drones in the attack Saturday, while two Navy warships in the eastern Mediterranean destroyed between four and six ballistic missiles and an Army Patriot battery in Iraq knocked down at least one missile that passed overhead. The more than 300 drones and missiles Iran launched was on the high end of what U.S. analysts had expected, one official said. April 14, 2024, 1:52 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 1:52 p.m. ET After a virtual meeting today, leaders of the Group of 7 nations reaffirmed their 'full solidarity and support to Israel' in a statement condemning Iran's attack.

'We're going to try again this week,' Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday about voting on a bill to aid Israel. Credit... Kenny Holston/The New York Times Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday after Iran's overnight attack on Israel that the House would vote in the coming days on aid for Israel, and he suggested that aid for Ukraine could be included in the legislation. 'House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing with Israel,' Mr. Johnson said on Fox News, noting that he had previously advanced two aid bills to help the U.S. ally. 'We're going to try again this week, and the details of that package are being put together. Right now, we're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues.' U.S. funding for both Israel and Ukraine has languished in Congress; Mr. Johnson initially refused to take up a $95 billion aid package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan passed by the Senate, and the Senate refused to take up a House Republican proposal that conditioned aid to Israel on domestic spending cuts. In recent weeks, Mr. Johnson has repeatedly vowed to ensure that the House moves to assist Ukraine. He has been searching for a way to structure a foreign aid package that could secure a critical mass of support amid stiff Republican resistance to sending aid to Kyiv and mounting opposition among Democrats to unfettered military aid for Israel. But the attacks from Iran have ratcheted up the pressure on Mr. Johnson to bring some kind of package to the floor this week, potentially forcing him to make a decision he has been agonizing over for weeks. He left it unclear on Sunday whether the legislation he said the House would advance this week would also include aid for Ukraine. Mr. Johnson said he believed that some proposals around Ukraine aid enjoyed broad support among House Republicans. He noted that he met with former President Donald J. Trump on Friday at his estate in Florida and that Mr. Trump had been supportive of conditioning the aid as a loan. 'I think these are ideas that I think can get consensus, and that's what we've been working through,' Mr. Johnson said. 'We'll send our package. We'll put something together and send it to the Senate and get these obligations completed.' Before the attacks in Israel over the weekend, Mr. Johnson had privately floated bringing up the $95 billion spending package for Ukraine and Israel passed by the Senate in February — and moving it through the House in tandem with a second bill containing policies endorsed by the conservative wing of his party. That plan envisioned two consecutive votes — one on the Senate-passed bill and another on a package of sweeteners geared toward appeasing Republicans who otherwise would be infuriated by Mr. Johnson's decision to push through a bipartisan aid package for Ukraine. Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Sunday that the two conflicts were tied together, and that he hoped they would be addressed together. 'What happened in Israel last night happens in Ukraine every night,' he said on CBS's 'Face The Nation.' Mr. McCaul said that he had previously secured a 'commitment' from Mr. Johnson that a broad national security bill would be brought to the House floor for a vote, but that the timing was unclear. 'My preference,' he said, 'is this week.' Minho Kim contributed reporting.

Iranian officials also appeared to signal that its operation against Israel was over.\nIsrael's war cabinet concluded a meeting on Sunday evening without deciding how to respond to Iran's assault, according to an official briefed on the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks more freely. By nightfall, the military had yet to detail possible options, the official said.\nIn public, Israeli ministers appeared divided over how to respond. Benny Gantz, a centrist minister and one of three voting members of the war cabinet, said that Israel should exact a price from Iran, but only 'in a way and at a time that suits us.' Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right minister, then criticized Mr. Gantz for his perceived moderation, arguing that Israel should deter Iran by going 'crazy.'\nThe Biden administration is advising Israel that it does not necessarily need to fire back at Iran, with U.S. officials saying that Israel had proved its ability to protect itself.\nIranian officials issued a series of statements that appeared designed to keep tensions from escalating further.

Israeli military analysts are divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza. Credit...Within moments of Israel and its allies shooting down a fusillade of Iranian missiles and drones this weekend, many began wondering what the latest exchange between Israel and Iran would mean for the war in the Gaza Strip.\nThe Iranian attack was retaliation for what was widely believed to be an Israeli strike this month on an embassy building in Damascus that killed seven Iranian officials, including three top commanders in Iran's armed forces. But it occurred against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel is battling Hamas, a militant group funded and armed by Iran.\nIsraeli military analysts were divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza, now in its sixth month. The next fulcrum in that war could hinge on whether Israel decides to pursue Hamas in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have fled amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis.\nSome analysts argued that the implications for Gaza would depend on whether Israel responded with a major counterattack against Iran. Others contended that Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip would be unaffected.\nShlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general and a former director of the Israeli military's strategic planning division, said that if Israel responds with substantial force to the Iranian attack, it could spark a multifront war that would compel the Israeli leadership to move its attention away from Gaza.\nIn the case of a significant regional conflagration, General Brom said, Israel might choose to delay its plans to invade Rafah, which Israeli officials describe as the last Hamas stronghold.\n'It's not comfortable for us to have simultaneous, high-intensity wars in multiple theaters,' General Brom added.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to send ground forces into Rafah, despite international pressure to back off the operation. On Sunday, an Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that the Iranian attack would have no effect on the military's plan to invade Rafah.\nA large-scale direct confrontation with Iran could potentially bring the war in Gaza to a close, General Brom said. But for the war to end in such a way, it would require a broader cease-fire that encompassed several parties, including Israel, Iran and the Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah.\n'There's an idea that in order to resolve a crisis, the situation first needs to become worse,' he said, explaining that an escalation followed by a comprehensive cease-fire with Iran might incline that country to push its regional proxies to stop fighting with Israel.\nWhile the members of Israel's war cabinet did not issue a formal statement after meeting on Sunday, a separate Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, indicated that the country would respond to the Iranian assault — although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how.\nOther military experts, however, dismissed the link between the Iranian attack and the war in Gaza.\n'There's no connection at all,' said Amos Gilead, a retired major general who served in Israeli military intelligence.\nGeneral Gilead said that Israel's army had enough resources to fight against Iran and continue to wage war against Hamas in Gaza.\nOthers analysts made a similar point, arguing that the resources needed to fight Iran were different from those needed in Gaza. Israel needs fighter jets and air defense systems to counter Iran, they said. In contrast, they added, the army mainly requires ground troops, drones, and attack helicopters to fight Hamas in Gaza.\n'There's no real tension between these two things,' said Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former head of Israel's National Security Council.\nStill, General Eiland said that the success of the coalition that repelled the Iranian attack, which included the United States, Britain and Jordan, could inspire Israel to take advantage of the momentum to overcome its declining status internationally by ending the war in Gaza.\nThough the United States, Israel's closest ally, has broadly supported Israel's decision to go to war in Gaza, it has increasingly signaled its displeasure over the mounting death toll and warned against a major ground assault in Rafah. The support the United States provided Israel on Sunday in shooting down Iranian drones and missiles could give it more leverage over its Israeli counterparts.\nWhile General Eiland said such an outcome could help Israel develop good will in the international community and contribute to reaching a solution to end the war in Gaza and skirmishes with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, he was doubtful that Mr. Netanyahu would purse such a path.\n'He says he wants to achieve ‘total victory' in Gaza and conquer Rafah, a process that could last two or three months,' he said, referring to the prime minister. 'It's clear Netanyahu has a different mind-set and priorities.'\nAaron Boxerman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.\nWhere air defense systems were seen intercepting missiles or drones Damage or other evidence of attack visible\nWhere air defense systems were seen intercepting missiles or drones Damage or other evidence of attack visible United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addresses the United Nations Security Council during an emergency meeting at U.N. headquarters on Sunday. Credit... Yuki Iwamura/Associated Press The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, with diplomats urging restraint by all parties to prevent conflict in the region from escalating.\nThe brazen attack this weekend, when Iran launched a barrage of drones and missiles in retaliation for Israel's attacking its embassy compound in Syria earlier in the month, was the first time Iran had launched open attacks against Israel from its soil. The attack has unnerved a region already roiling in conflict, raising concerns among diplomats and U.N. officials that a new, potentially wide and destructive war could spark if both sides don't stand down.\nAntónio Guterres, the Secretary General of the U.N., told the Council that it was 'time to step back from the brink,' and that its members, as well as the United Nations at large, had the collective responsibility 'to actively engage all parties concerned to prevent further escalation.'\nThe meeting on Sunday was convened at the request of Israel. The Council has not collectively issued a statement condemning Iran's attack, and it has also not issued a statement condemning Israel's attack on Iran's embassy in Damascus that killed several senior commanders. All 15 members of the Council must reach a consensus for a statement to be issued and none was reached on both issues.\nThe Security Council is one of the few venues where adversaries engaged in conflict come face to face and sit in the same chamber. On Sunday, both Israel and Iran's ambassadors were present and delivered fiery comments about the other's country, blaming each other for actions they both called terrorism.\nGilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador, said Iran's attack had 'crossed every red line' and Israel reserved the right to retaliate. Mr. Erdan called for the Council to take severe action against Iran, including 'crippling' sanctions and statements of condemnation.\n'The fact that Israel's air defense proved to be superior does not change the brutality of Iran's attack,' he said.\nIran's ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, said his country had an 'inherent right to self-defense' after Israel's attack on its diplomatic compound. Mr. Iravani said that Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region,' but that if its interests, people or national security came under attack it would 'respond to any such threat or aggressions vigorously and in accordance with international law.'\nThe United States and Iran both said that they do not seek war with one another, but that if one attacks the other's interests, there would be a defensive response.\nRobert A. Wood, a U.S. representative to the U.N., told the Security Council that the 'U.S. is not seeking escalation, our actions have been defensive in nature,' and said the U.S. goal was to 'de-escalate' and then get back to securing an end to the conflict in Gaza. Mr. Wood said the U.S. planned to bring further action on Iran at the Council and called on the Council to unequivocally condemn Iran's actions.\nAny resolution against Iran put forth by the U.S. at the Council would likely be vetoed by Russia and China, two of Iran's close allies, who sharply criticized Israel for what they said was reckless violation of international law when it attacked Iran's embassy compound.\n'What happened in the night of the 14th of April did not happen in a vacuum,' said Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's ambassador to the U.N.\nChina's ambassador, Dai Bing, called on the Council to 'exercise maximum calm and restraint' and said the implementation of an immediate cease-fire is the 'top priority.'\nIsrael has said that the embassy compound was a legitimate military target because senior commanders from Iran's Quds Forces, the external branch of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, were holding a meeting inside the building.\nApril 14, 2024, 7:11 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 7:11 p.m. ET Michael D.

It has become a sticking point in negotiations between Israel and Hamas.\nIt was not clear why some Palestinians believed that Israel would not block them from returning on Sunday. But they were making the journey on a day when Iran had launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel.\nMore than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its assault there in October, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health. The assault occurred in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people.\nOn Sunday morning Jamila Ibrahim, 39, said that she began hearing of some Palestinians who left early and managed to get back to the north. She later spoke with friends who were able to return north. But there were very few.\nAround 10:30 a.m. she and her three children — who are between 10 and 17 — set out, joining other people on the journey.\nShe said there were no official notices from the Israel military, which has occupied large parts of Gaza after it launched a ground invasion, that residents would be allowed to return to their homes. It was just based on word of mouth, as well as people seeing others leaving and being encouraged to join the trek home, she said.\n'Some people were scared, they didn't know what fate they were heading to, they didn't know what would happen,' she said. 'Some were happy that they were going to return.'\nMost people were on foot — carrying what little food they had or their few belongings in bags and luggage — and some paid large sums of money to go by car, trucks or donkey carts, she said. But they all took the same seaside road, heading north toward an Israeli checkpoint that has cut off southern Gaza from the north.\n'There was lots of tension, lots of tension among the people, they were scared they could be shot,' she said.\nThose who tried to cross north in the middle of the night — around 4 a.m. — managed to make it to the north, she said, based on her conversation with friends who crossed successfully.\nBut later that morning, by the time she and other displaced Palestinians tried to follow, Israeli forces opened fire on them, she said.\n'Around 12:30 the Israelis started shooting,' she said.\nMazen Al-Harazeen, a first responder in Gaza, said Israeli forces fired weapons and he did not know how many had been killed, but he said, 'There was shooting and martyrs.'\nEarly Sunday morning, Avichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces, or I.D.F., wrote on social media that the rumors that the army was allowing residents to return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip were false.\n'The I.D.F. will not allow the return of residents,' he added. 'For your safety, do not approach the forces operating there.'\nNearly 2 million Gazans have been displaced by the war between Hamas and Israel, now in its sixth month. One of their biggest concerns is when and if they will be allowed to return to their homes, or whether they will be permanently displaced, as previous generations were.\nAround 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes in 1947 and 1948 during the wars surrounding Israel's establishment as a state.\nBilal Shbair contributed reporting.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:49 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:49 p.m. ET Aaron Boxerman\nAaron Boxerman Reporting from Jerusalem While Israel's war cabinet members didn't issue a formal statement after the meeting, an Israeli official familiar with the discussions indicated that Israel would undoubtedly respond — although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, said Israel's military still needed to detail possible options.\nAt Amina al-Hasoni's house in the village of al-Fur'ah, Israel, the Iranian attack wounded her and ripped holes in the roof and floor. Credit... Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times The hospital waiting room was quiet on Sunday: There was no crowd of relatives, no flood of patients. Israel's air defenses had just fended off a large-scale Iranian attack, with only one serious casualty recorded.\nBut there was no sense that a crisis had been averted outside the pediatric intensive care unit at Soroka Medical Center in southern Israel's city of Beersheba. Instead, tension filled the air until the doors to the ward swung open and a gasping mother stumbled out, her face contorted. Then raw emotion quickly took its place as she crumbled into a chair, crying.\nWhile Israel suffered little in the way of significant damage overnight, this one family was dealt a devastating blow. Amina al-Hasoni, 7, was clinging to life — the sole serious casualty of the Iranian barrage. And were it not for systemic inequities in Israel, her relatives said, maybe she too could have been spared.\nThere are roughly 300,000 Arab Bedouins in the Negev desert. About a quarter of them live in villages that are not recognized by Israeli officials. Without state recognition, those communities have long suffered from a lack of planning and basic services like running water, sewers and electricity. And few have access to bomb shelters, despite repeated requests to the state.\nThe Hasoni family lives in one such community, sharing a hilltop in the Negev village of al-Fur'ah with a plot of disconnected houses. When rocket warning sirens went off on Saturday night, Amina's uncle Ismail said he felt stuck — there was nowhere to go.\nBooms overhead signaled air defenses intercepting missiles before there was a big explosion. Then he heard a woman screaming — his sister — and 'I started running,' he said.\nIsmail, 38, found his sister outside her house holding Amina, who was bleeding from the head. Her family had decided to flee the rockets, running out the front door. But Amina, who slept in a back room with pink walls covered in painted butterflies, didn't make it.\nA missile fragment ripped through the home's thin metal roof, shearing a hole with sharp metallic edges. It made impact just in front of the door — which is where Amina was knocked unconscious.\n'I think it hit her while she was running away,' Ismail said.\nHe said he took the injured Amina from his sister and lifted the girl into his own arms. Ismail then tracked down a car that raced her toward the hospital, more than 40 minutes away on a rutted, winding road that fades out in some places, with camels crossing in others.\nOnly then, with Amina on her way, did he go inside the house, where he said he saw a large, black piece of shrapnel about the size of a pretzel jar. And 'there was blood,' he said, a puddle that had turned into a stream across the tile floor, to the front door.\nBy Sunday afternoon, the orange patterned tiles had been cleaned. None of the dozen or so relatives there could say who had done it, only that 'it was bad for the children to see' all the blood. But Ismail hasn't gone back inside.\n'It's difficult,' he said, his jeans and boots still spattered with blood. Not far from where he sat, a pink Minnie Mouse blanket and a small black-and-white girl's dress hung on a family clothesline.\n'We could have built shelters here,' Ismail added.\nHe dismissed any suggestions that what happened to Amina was bad luck.\n'It's part of a policy,' he said. 'We can't do anything.'\nThe missile fragment that tore into Amina's home was one of more than 150 collected in the area on Sunday by police bomb disposal teams, and the family said officers had taken away the piece that hit their home. The teams combed the desert for hours, searching for debris and carting away huge hunks of twisted metal — efforts repeated across Israel.\nThe Hasoni home is not far from a military base, Nevatim, that was reportedly a target of the Iranian assault and that Israeli officials said was lightly damaged.\nThat is little consolation to Amina's father, Muhammad, who spent the morning at the hospital taking turns at her bedside. He didn't say much to her, he said, and just repeated her name.\nAmina — the youngest of his 14 children — 'likes to laugh and have fun all the time,' said Muhammad, 49. She's a good student with a 'strong personality,' he added, who doesn't always listen to instructions. And she loves to draw.\nHe called Iran's actions 'inhumane.'\n'May God demolish them,' he said, without hesitation.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET Iran's ambassador to the U.N., Amir Saeid Iravani, addressed the Council after his Israeli counterpart and defended his country's actions as the 'inherent right to self-defense' in response to the attack on its diplomatic compound in Syria two weeks ago.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET Iravani said Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region' and has 'no intention' of engaging in conflict with the United States, but warned that it would respond proportionately if Israel or the U.S. military were to attack Iran or its interests.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:26 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:26 p.m. ET Israel's U.N. ambassador, Gilad Erdan, who had requested the emergency meeting of the Security Council, assailed Iran and its proxies, saying Iran had crossed every red line in its attack and that Israel reserved the right to retaliate.

Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times Many Iranians stayed glued to their television screens and phones Saturday night, anxiously following updates as their country launched a military attack on Israel and fearing a wider war that would only add to the country's current economic upheaval.\nIn Tehran and several other big cities, lines of cars stretched a mile or more outside gas stations in the middle of the night. Some parents kept their children home from school on Sunday. Tehran's airport closed down, and will remain that way until at least Monday morning.\nIranians living inside the country said in interviews that they were worried the confrontation with Israel would spiral out of control and hoped both sides would avoid escalating the conflict.\nSoheil, a 37-year-old engineer in Isfahan who, like several other Iranians, asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution, said all he and his colleagues could talk about at work on Sunday was the prospect of a broader conflict.\n'I'm afraid of war,' he said. 'It will have a great impact on our daily lives, especially on the economy and the price of dollar, and the anxiety will affect our mental health.'\nSince a strike two weeks ago on the Iranian Embassy complex in Syria that killed three top military commanders, Iran's currency, the rial, has fallen sharply against the U.S. dollar, shrinking purchasing power as Iran's leaders vowed to respond.\nNafiseh, a 36-year-old high school teacher in Tehran, said that many of her students did not attend school on Sunday because parents were worried about counterattacks from Israel. 'It's all everyone is talking about, from teenagers to teachers and family members, it's all about the war and attacks,' she said.\nSupporters of the government hailed the attacks as Iran's showcasing its military might to defend itself on Saturday, with several hundred gathering in Tehran's Palestine Square to celebrate with fireworks and chants of 'Death to Israel.' A large mural on the square depicted Iranian missiles with a message written in Farsi and Hebrew that read, 'Next time the slap will be harder.' On Sunday night, a crowd formed again in the square, carrying signs and chanting anti-Israel slogans.\nOthers took to social media to say they would fight for their country unconditionally if Iran were to go to war.\n'When a foreign enemy is involved, honor means standing with our country even at the cost of our lives,' Reza Rashidpour, a civil engineer, wrote on social media. 'Long live Iran, long live soldiers of Iran.'\nBut critics of the government denounced the attacks, seeing them as a misadventure that risks harming ordinary Iranians.\nMany Iranians oppose government policies that include funding, arming and training groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanese armed group that has increasingly traded fire with Israel since the Oct. 7 attacks that set off the current fighting in Gaza. In protests against the government over the past few years a recurring chant has been, 'No to Gaza, no to Lebanon, my life for Iran.'\nAli, a 53-year-old veteran of the Iran-Iraq war who lives in Kerman, said the existence of the Islamic Republic depends on 'crisis.'\n'Now they are exploiting the war and the crisis to survive,' he said.\nApril 14, 2024, 4:08 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 4:08 p.m. ET Gaya Gupta\nGaya Gupta Reporting from New York The United Nations Security Council has begun its emergency meeting to address Iran's attacks on Israel.

Credit... Hannah Mckay/Reuters After many Israelis spent a long night huddled in bomb shelters, life crept back toward calm on Sunday, even as the people of Israel waited tensely to see how their government would respond to the Iranian strikes that set off rarely heard sirens in Jerusalem.\nJerusalem is targeted much less frequently than border communities or the coastal metropolis of Tel Aviv, but during the assault loud booms resounded in the skies, where missiles and interceptors wove around one another like fireflies.\nIn areas of Jerusalem with a mostly Jewish population, many crowded into public bomb shelters, some wearing pajamas and lugging sleeping bags.\n'There were more people there than usual,' said Zev Palatnik, 33, who spent some of the night in his building's bomb shelter alongside his neighbors. 'There's a sense that the rockets from Iran are more sophisticated than the ones from Gaza,' he said, adding that there was a higher level of anxiety as a result.\nBut on Sunday, a relatively steady amount of foot traffic flowed in downtown Jerusalem as Israelis returned to work. Ron Cohen, a 37-year-old engineer, said he had hoped that the Israeli government would immediately strike back at Iran, but he did not expect a significant Israeli response.\n'Not much, maybe a few small things,' he said. 'Our government knows how to defend, but not how to attack.'\nFor the Israelis among the tens of thousands forced to flee communities along the borders with Gaza and Lebanon, the assault compounded six exhausting months of war. Many expressed uncertainty over the best way for the government to respond.\nGidi Lapid, who left his home in Metula, near the border with Lebanon, with his family at the beginning of the war, said Israel might be able to show strength through restrained action.\nBut at the same time, Iranians 'should be the ones in existential dread, in bomb shelters, stocking up on food and water,' Mr. Lapid said by phone from Eliav, a small town near Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem.

Kenny Holston/The New York Times Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday after Iran's overnight attack on Israel that the House would vote in the coming days on aid for Israel, and he suggested that aid for Ukraine could be included in the legislation.\n'House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing with Israel,' Mr. Johnson said on Fox News, noting that he had previously advanced two aid bills to help the U.S. ally. 'We're going to try again this week, and the details of that package are being put together. Right now, we're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues.'\nU.S. funding for both Israel and Ukraine has languished in Congress; Mr. Johnson initially refused to take up a $95 billion aid package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan passed by the Senate, and the Senate refused to take up a House Republican proposal that conditioned aid to Israel on domestic spending cuts.\nIn recent weeks, Mr. Johnson has repeatedly vowed to ensure that the House moves to assist Ukraine. He has been searching for a way to structure a foreign aid package that could secure a critical mass of support amid stiff Republican resistance to sending aid to Kyiv and mounting opposition among Democrats to unfettered military aid for Israel.\nBut the attacks from Iran have ratcheted up the pressure on Mr. Johnson to bring some kind of package to the floor this week, potentially forcing him to make a decision he has been agonizing over for weeks.\nHe left it unclear on Sunday whether the legislation he said the House would advance this week would also include aid for Ukraine.\nMr. Johnson said he believed that some proposals around Ukraine aid enjoyed broad support among House Republicans. He noted that he met with former President Donald J. Trump on Friday at his estate in Florida and that Mr. Trump had been supportive of conditioning the aid as a loan.\n'I think these are ideas that I think can get consensus, and that's what we've been working through,' Mr. Johnson said. 'We'll send our package. We'll put something together and send it to the Senate and get these obligations completed.'\nBefore the attacks in Israel over the weekend, Mr. Johnson had privately floated bringing up the $95 billion spending package for Ukraine and Israel passed by the Senate in February — and moving it through the House in tandem with a second bill containing policies endorsed by the conservative wing of his party. That plan envisioned two consecutive votes — one on the Senate-passed bill and another on a package of sweeteners geared toward appeasing Republicans who otherwise would be infuriated by Mr. Johnson's decision to push through a bipartisan aid package for Ukraine.\nRepresentative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Sunday that the two conflicts were tied together, and that he hoped they would be addressed together. 'What happened in Israel last night happens in Ukraine every night,' he said on CBS's 'Face The Nation.'\nMr. McCaul said that he had previously secured a 'commitment' from Mr. Johnson that a broad national security bill would be brought to the House floor for a vote, but that the timing was unclear.\n'My preference,' he said, 'is this week.'\nMinho Kim contributed reporting.\nApril 14, 2024, 1:02 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 1:02 p.m. ET Adam Sella\nAdam Sella Reporting from Tel Aviv The Israeli military said in a statement that it is calling up 'approximately two reserve brigades for operational activities on the Gaza front.'

Credit... Jim Hollander/EPA, via Shutterstock In a deeply divided Israel, even the dramatic scene above the country's skies on Sunday is open to political interpretation.\nFor supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's display of defensive technology against an Iranian salvo that included hundreds of drones and missiles proves Mr. Netanyahu has long been right to warn about the threat posed by Iran.\nHis opponents are loath to give him any credit, reserving their praise for the air force.\n'Like everything in Israel in recent years, the story is split into two narratives,' said Mazal Mualem, an Israeli political commentator for Al-Monitor, a Middle East news site, and the author of a recent biography of the Israeli leader.\n'The division and polarization in Israeli society prevents people from seeing the full picture,' Ms. Mualem added.\nIran's barrage on Sunday, launched in response to an Israeli attack on an Iranian Embassy building this month in Damascus that killed several high-ranking commanders in Iran's armed forces, came at a perilous time for Mr. Netanyahu.\nAt home, he is an unpopular leader whom many hold responsible for his government's policy and intelligence failures that led to the deadly Hamas-led attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, which prompted Israel to go to war in Gaza. Abroad, he is the focus of international censure over Israel's prosecution of that war, which has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Gazans.\nHow he ultimately emerges from this episode may depend on what happens next.\nMr. Netanyahu now must make a choice. Will he respond to Iran with a forceful counterattack and potentially entangle Israel and other countries in a broader war? Or will he absorb the attack, which gravely injured one 7-year-old girl but otherwise did limited damage, and defer to the coalition that helped defend Israel in the interests of regional stability?\nIsrael's allies have been urging restraint.\n'The question is whether Israel is going to retaliate immediately, or surprise the Iranians in one way or another,' said Efraim Halevy, who served as director of Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, during the latter part of Mr. Netanyahu's first term in the 1990s.\nNo Israeli leader has warned about Iran so consistently as Mr. Netanyahu or, for that matter, has spent so long in office. Israel's longest serving prime minister, he has been in power for about 17 years overall.\nSince his first year in office in 1996, Mr. Netanyahu warned that a nuclear Iran would be catastrophic and that time was running out. For the nearly three decades since, he has been sounding the same alarm.\nIran maintains a network of proxy militias across the region, including in Gaza, which the government funds and supplies with weapons. Some of those militias in Yemen, Syria and Lebanon have battled with Israel, creating distractions for the Israeli government and military amid the war with Hamas.\nBut perhaps more troubling, experts say, is that Iran is closer than ever to obtaining a nuclear weapon. Mr. Netanyahu's backers still credit him with having put Iran's nuclear program on the world agenda then, and they praise him now for investing in the mighty, multilayered air defense system that allowed Israel and its allies, including the United States, to intercept the vast majority of Iranian drones and missiles this weekend before they reached Israel.\nSometimes resorting to gimmicks and antics to draw attention to Iran's nuclear progress, Mr. Netanyahu has in the past made opposing Iran a key part of his global diplomacy. Once, at the United Nations General Assembly he held up a cartoonish drawing of a bomb marked with red lines depicting enrichment levels. Another time, at the Munich Security Conference, he waved around a piece of wreckage from what he said was an Iranian drone sent from Syria and shot down by Israel.\n'Everywhere he went he was talking about it,' recalled Jeremy Issacharoff, a former Israeli ambassador to Germany and for years the Ministry of Foreign Affairs point man coordinating diplomatic efforts on regional security and the Iranian threat.\nAt times, Mr. Netanyahu's campaign against Iran has severely strained Israel's relations with American presidents, though bipartisan U.S. support for Israel has long been considered a strategic asset.\nAround 2012, Mr. Netanyahu infuriated the Obama administration by pushing hard for President Barack Obama to set clear 'red lines' on Iran's nuclear progress that would prompt the United States to undertake a military strike. Before that, the Israeli prime minister was making plans for a unilateral Israeli strike in the face of tough opposition from Washington and public criticism from a string of former Israeli security chiefs. It was never clear if Mr. Netanyahu was bluffing, and the prospect of an imminent strike receded.\nHe further challenged Mr. Obama in 2015 with an impassioned speech to a joint meeting of Congress denouncing what he called a 'bad deal' being negotiated by the United States and other world powers with Iran to curb its nuclear program.\nWhen President Donald J. Trump came to power, Mr. Netanyahu encouraged him to withdraw from the agreement — a move that many Israeli experts have called a dire mistake and a failure of Mr. Netanyahu's Iran policy.\n'Since then, there have been no constraints on the program,' Mr. Issacharoff said, adding, 'It has never been more advanced.'\nBut it was also under Mr. Netanyahu's watch that Israel forged diplomatic relations with more Arab states that are considered part of the moderate, anti-Iranian axis, including the United Arab Emirates.\nRegardless of what comes next, Ms. Mualem, the Netanyahu biographer, said, 'Bibi is still in the game,' referring to him by his nickname. 'He's a central player, and it isn't over, diplomatically or politically. And he plays a long game.'\nMourners on Sunday with the bodies of Palestinians in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip. Credit... Ramadan Abed/Reuters As the world's attention shifted to Iran's attack on Israel, Palestinians in Gaza experienced a relatively calm night for the first time in more than six months but were quickly jolted back to reality when airstrikes there continued on Sunday morning.\nWhile Iranian drones and aircraft were making their way to Israeli territory on Saturday night, the incessant noise of Israeli drones and warplanes disappeared from Gaza's skies, residents said.\n'Finally some calmness after six months of buzzing and noises!' Yousef Mema, a Gazan activist with a significant social media following, wrote on Instagram.\nAnother influencer, Mahmoud Shurrab, recorded himself walking in the middle of the street, the skies overhead quiet. 'I can't believe it, silence,' he said in a video posted on Instagram.\nThe calm did not last. The Israeli military said on Sunday that its forces were pressing on with a raid in the central Gaza Strip for the fourth day, where they 'eliminated dozens of terrorists in face-to-face battles and with air support.' And Wafa, the Palestinian Authority news agency, reported that several Palestinians had been killed in a strike on a home in Nuseirat in central Gaza, and that at least eight others were wounded in a strike on three homes in Beit Hanoun, a city in the northeast of the strip.\nSome Palestinians worried that an escalation between Israel and Iran would distract from the dire situation in the Gaza Strip, potentially diverting international attention from the Israeli bombardment and looming famine there.\n'I think it is not at all in the Palestinians' side or favor to have a new front open with Israel,' said Amer Nasser, 64. 'This will distract the people around the world from seeing what is happening in Gaza,' he added.\nFor many, the Iranian attack was unexpected.\nFayez al-Samman, a 76-year-old car trader from Gaza City who is sheltering in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza, said he spent the night listening to the news on the radio. 'It was a surprise for me when I heard the missiles were targeting Israeli sites,' he said.\nOsama al-Hato, 53, another man from Gaza City staying in Deir al-Balah, said he was happy that Iran had targeted Israel. 'However, I did not follow the news nor expect the Iranian reaction to this extent,' he added.\nAymen Zidan, 57, a wholesale vegetable supplier from Deir al-Balah, said he had had little expectation that Iran would target Israel, although he believed Iran's attack was for its own interests, not for the sake of Palestinians in Gaza like him.\nEven so, he said, he felt 'relieved that there is a country that said no to Israel.'\nRaja Abdulrahim contributed reporting from New York.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences",

            "summary": "Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index The challenging process of choosing a jury in the first criminal trial of a former American president proceeded slowly on Tuesday, as prospective jurors were questioned individually about their ability to fairly consider the charges against Donald J. Trump. Shortly before noon, lawyers began directly questioning the first group of prospective jurors to make it through initial queries. Questions involved their opinions on campaign finance law and on the trial's potential witnesses, including a porn star and a tabloid publisher. Earlier, some prospective jurors who had previously indicated that they would be able to be impartial had changed their minds after taking a night to think about it. 'I don't think I can be as impartial and unbiased as I hoped I could be,' one admitted. He was excused. It could take two weeks or more to pick the 12 jurors who will decide the case, which centers on allegations that the former president falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star, Stormy Daniels. The pool of possible jurors being scrutinized on Tuesday came from an initial group of 96, dozens of whom were dismissed immediately on Monday after indicating that they felt they could not fairly reach a decision. The dismissals underscored the difficulty of picking a jury in a city where the defendant is widely reviled. Mr. Trump, who may take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied all wrongdoing. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records that hid reimbursements to his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who had paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 to buy her silence. Prosecutors say that Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election. Here's what to know about the case: The case was brought a year ago by Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. It is one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, but may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nA day after Mr. Trump appeared to nod off during pretrial motions, he was back at the defense table. He appeared somewhat bored as the jury selection process continued, with prospective jurors responding to a series of mostly yes or no questions.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America.\nMr. Trump has repeatedly complained that the case is a politically motivated witch hunt and has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and his family, as well as key witnesses, including Mr. Cohen. Justice Merchan has imposed a gag order on Mr. Trump that bars him from attacking witnesses, jurors, prosecutors or the judge's family. Even before the trial began on Monday, prosecutors asked Justice Merchan to hold the former president in contempt of court over social media posts about Mr. Cohen; the judge said he would hold a hearing later this month.

Asked about the fairness of Trump being on trial in Manhattan, where he's an unpopular figure, Adams replied, 'That is beyond my pay grade.' But, he added, 'This city is a fair city.' April 16, 2024, 2:00 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 2:00 p.m. ET Olivia Bensimon Reporting from outside the courthouse 'Justice is going to take its course here in the city,' Adams told the assembled reporters. After stressing that the trial was proceeding in an 'orderly fashion,' he was escorted down Centre Street away from the news media. Video Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, accused Donald J. Trump of falsifying business records connected to a hush money payment to a porn star. Mr. Trump pleaded not guilty to all 34 felony counts. Credit Credit... Andrew Seng for The New York Times All 34 felony counts at the center of the Manhattan criminal case against former President Donald J. Trump stem from a $130,000 hush-money payment handed over to a porn star in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign. The specific charges are far less titillating: falsifying business records in the first degree. But a conviction could still result in jail time. The payment was made by Mr. Trump's fixer, Michael D. Cohen, to Stormy Daniels in order to buy her silence about a sexual liaison she said she had with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump directed him to make the payment. Paying hush money is not illegal. But while serving as the commander in chief, prosecutors say, Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen in a manner that constituted fraud: In internal records, Mr. Trump's company classified the reimbursement as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet there were no such expenses, according to prosecutors, who say the agreement was also fictional. Those records underpin the 34 counts of falsifying business records: 11 involve the checks, 11 center on monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted to the company and 12 involve entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust. Mr. Trump has denied all wrongdoing. In announcing the charges a year ago, Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, said that his office must keep a close eye on how companies conduct business in New York. 'This is the business capital of the world,' Mr. Bragg said. 'We regularly do cases involving false business statements. The bedrock — in fact, the basis for business integrity and a well-functioning business marketplace — is true and accurate record-keeping.' The charges against Mr. Trump are all Class E felonies, the lowest category in New York. Each count carries a maximum prison sentence of four years. Nothing in the law requires the judge, Juan E. Merchan, to imprison Mr. Trump if the jury convicts him. The judge could instead sentence him to probation. But Justice Merchan has made it clear that he takes white-collar crime seriously and could put Mr. Trump behind bars. It's possible, however, if Mr. Trump is convicted of more than one count, Justice Merchan would impose a concurrent sentence, under which Mr. Trump would serve all time simultaneously. Key Players in the Trump Criminal Trial ›  April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET Olivia Bensimon Reporting from outside the courthouse Journalists still vastly outnumber the Trump supporters who have gathered near the courthouse today. One man's Stars and Stripes flag flaps in the breeze, two other people are sitting on benches. Neighborhood workers on their lunch breaks bask in the spring sun. Jury selection is often a lengthy process, but in the first criminal trial of a former American president, currently taking place in a Manhattan criminal courthouse, it's going more slowly than normal. In part, that is because of the nature of the case: Jurors, once seated, will be asked to decide whether Donald J. Trump committed a crime. Prosecutors have charged him with 34 felonies, accusing him of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal that could have hurt his first presidential run. But the process has been particularly drawn-out because, once would-be jurors say they can be fair and impartial, they are being asked a series of 42 questions. After that, they face additional scrutiny from lawyers for the prosecution and the defense. Here are the 42 questions: 1. Without telling us your address, in what neighborhood do you live? For example, Upper East Side, Lower East Side, Inwood, etc. How long have you lived there? Are you a native New Yorker? If not, where did you live previously? 2. What do you do for a living?

Are you signed up for or have you ever been signed up for, subscribed to, or followed any newsletter or email lists run by or on behalf of any anti-Trump group or organization? Do you currently follow any anti-Trump group or organization on any social media site, or have you done so in the past? 30. Have you ever considered yourself a supporter of or belonged to any of the following: (the QAnon movement, Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Three Percenters, Boogaloo Boys, Antifa) 31.

If Mr. Trump chooses not to testify, or to introduce any evidence, can you give us your assurance that you will not hold that against him? 42. Is there any reason, whether it be a bias or something else, that would prevent you from being fair and impartial if you are selected as a juror for this case? New York State makes no provision for anonymous juries, even in a case as sensitive as this one. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Last month, Justice Juan M. Merchan ordered that prospective jurors' names would be shielded from the public, underscoring the need for privacy for those who may decide Donald J. Trump's criminal fate — and tempt the anger of his followers. Yet on the first two days of jury selection, several prospective jurors revealed potentially identifying information, reflecting the difficulty of having an anonymous jury in a case with an intense media spotlight. On the first day, a woman said she worked for a city agency of approximately 500 people and revealed its name. Later, a man who identified himself as a bookseller revealed the name of the small store where he works. This continued on Tuesday when others revealed the names of employers. While some worked for companies that were large, where the potential jurors could likely remain unidentifiable, others were less cautious. One woman revealed the name of the three-person company she owns with her husband. Justice Merchan did not interject as the prospective jurors divulged the information, nor did he caution them against doing so. Juries are not completely anonymous in New York State. Mr. Trump, his lawyers and the prosecutors have access to the names of the prospective jurors. But after a request by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, Justice Merchan decided to withhold the names from the public. Mr. Trump did not oppose the request. The accidental self-identifications are a notable departure from how federal Judge Lewis A. Kaplan conducted jury selection in Mr. Trump's defamation trial in January, brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll. In the federal system, jurors are allowed to remain anonymous, even to parties in the case. Before potential jurors answered basic questions about their backgrounds, Judge Kaplan instructed them not to reveal personal information. 'Don't give us anything that could enable anybody to pin you down geographically,' he said. He also cautioned them not to reveal their names to each other, and when the trial concluded, he left them with these ominous words: 'My advice to you is that you never disclose that you were on this jury,' Judge Kaplan said. 'And I won't say anything more about it.'

There are currently 18 remaining from yesterday's initial group who have been interviewed by lawyers, and six more who have yet to be interviewed. The judge, Juan Merchan, said that he's hoping to bring in a new group of prospective jurors — likely around 100 of them — in the afternoon. Soon, we may have some actual jurors. Maybe we can give the word 'prospective' some much-needed rest.

We can see prosecutors huddling and going over their notes, presumably evaluating the jurors and their responses. It's no exaggeration to say that this is one of the highest-stakes moments of the trial: evaluating who may help or sink the case based on little more than appearance, disposition and responses to a few questions.

But the man refused to talk about it multiple times, saying it had \"absolutely no bearing on the case.' After some back and forth, he finally said he was a Democrat, but he did not budge further.

He takes issue right away with one of the analogies made by Joshua Steinglass, a prosecutor, who compared jurors analyzing information to spectators at a baseball game disagreeing with an umpire's calls.

April 16, 2024, 12:16 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 12:16 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse It sounds as if Trump has waived his right to be present for the small conferences held out of earshot of jurors, known as sidebars. Justice Merchan knows the importance of getting this little piece of the process right: an appeals court two years ago overturned a conviction in a case he presided over when a defendant did not appear at an important sidebar, and the defendant hadn't waived the right to do so.

We are running 5 to 7 minutes per person. The very premise of the trial is that prosecutors believe Donald J. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times Donald J. Trump first ran for president nearly a decade ago. Now, as he runs again in a political climate that he helped create, his Manhattan criminal trial is partly a referendum on his tactics during that first campaign. The trial's very premise is that prosecutors believe Mr. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign — sex scandals involving a porn star and a Playboy model, for example — he concealed them, the prosecutors say. But in a development that will bolster their case, prosecutors on Monday secured permission from the judge to admit evidence connected to Mr. Trump's overall political strategy in 2016. Much of it bears the former president's imprint: aggressive tweets, false denials, coordination with a tabloid publisher and more. The judge's ruling showed how the weapons that worked so well for Mr. Trump then are being turned against him in the courtroom now. The techniques prosecutors highlighted Monday were not invented by Mr. Trump for use in his campaign; they are behaviors he exhibited throughout his life as a businessman and a reality-television star. But in modern American political history, such raw tactics had rarely been seen at such a high level. One example is Mr. Trump's relationship with The National Enquirer tabloid and its publisher, David Pecker, who is expected to appear as a witness. The Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case, obtained permission from the judge on Monday to introduce evidence related to a 2015 meeting among Mr. Trump, Mr. Pecker and Mr. Trump's former fixer, Michael D. Cohen. A prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, said on Monday that the three men had 'conspired to influence the 2016 election.' That meeting laid the groundwork for hush-money deals with a porn star, Stormy Daniels, and a Playboy model, Karen McDougal. But another result of that meeting, Mr. Steinglass said, were explosive headlines about Mr. Trump's opponents in the Republican primary, including those claiming that Ben Carson had committed 'medical malpractice' and that Senator Ted Cruz had a 'family connection to J.F.K.'s assassin.' A lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, protested the admission of evidence related to that meeting, saying that newspaper publishers met with candidates 'all the time,' and that there was nothing improper about it, let alone illegal. That admission worked against him. The judge, Juan M. Merchan, said that he was glad that Mr. Blanche believed that there was nothing wrong with the meeting — because it meant that he should not mind that the evidence would be introduced. 'There is no reason not to allow it in,' Justice Merchan said. Mr. Steinglass won again when he persuaded Justice Merchan to admit evidence of the Trump campaign in crisis after the publication in 2016 of the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump boasted about grabbing women by their genitals. 'The video sent the campaign into a tailspin,' Mr. Steinglass said. He offered up an email sent by a Washington Post reporter to Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump's campaign spokeswoman. Mr. Steinglass said that Ms. Hicks had forwarded the exchange to Stephen K. Bannon, Kellyanne Conway and other members of the campaign team, 'suggesting that their response should be to deny, deny, deny.' Eventually, he said, Mr. Bannon sent it to Mr. Cohen. Mr. Blanche again protested, but was again rebuffed. The judge said he would allow jurors to see the email, saying that the ensuing thread was relevant. The exchanges that prosecutors and defense lawyers debated on Monday underscored Mr. Trump's penchant for delegating dirty work to others, giving himself some distance in the process. The hush-money deals worked that way: Mr. Cohen paid off Ms. Daniels, while The National Enquirer bought Ms. McDougal's silence. (Mr. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to his reimbursement of Mr. Cohen.) That habit is still on display this year, and can be helpful given that Justice Merchan has barred Mr. Trump from attacking witnesses, prosecutors and the judge's own family. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump posted on social media a video of Laura Loomer, a political ally, in the park outside the courthouse. Ms. Loomer, speaking into a bullhorn, insinuated that the judge's family was politically compromised. Had Mr. Trump said that himself, he would have risked violating the judge's gag order.

Asked whether she knew anyone in the legal field, one prospective juror gave a candid answer. 'I dated a lawyer for a while,' she said, before pausing and adding: 'It ended fine.' Her honesty led to hearty chuckles among the reporters in the overflow room. Trump did not laugh.

But a few of those who have made it to this stage have realized while answering questions that they may have a tougher time than they thought. One prospective juror just admitted: 'I don't think I can be as impartial and unbiased as I hoped I could be.' He was excused. April 16, 2024, 10:19 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 10:19 a.m. ET Kate Christobek Reporting from the courthouse Trump is mostly sitting motionless as jurors answer the largely yes or no questions on the jury questionnaire. Occasionally he fidgets, appears to write notes, whispers to his lawyer and at one point examined his tie. He largely stares ahead, not looking in the direction of the prospective jurors. But his glare fixates on the jury box when prospective jurors bring up conflicts, including a woman who said she realized overnight that she could not be impartial and unbiased.

On Tuesday, the spectacle of the first trial of a president was fading into New York's usual urban bustle. Credit... Yuki Iwamura/Associated Press The scene outside Manhattan's Criminal Court on Tuesday morning was placid — by New York standards — after the tense crush on the first day of Donald J. Trump's trial. On Monday, cable news stations had staked out every concrete surface bordering Centre Street. On Tuesday, there were swaths of open ground in the space reserved for media organizations. As the sun rose and workers in Collect Pond Park removed overflowing trash cans around 5:30 a.m., only five people were in the line for those holding official passes for entry. In the line for the general public were some familiar faces among court-watchers, including Ron Sinibaldi, whose hobbies include following high-profile cases. He's previously attended proceedings involving Senator Robert Menendez, who is accused of taking bribes, and New Jersey officials involved in closing the George Washington Bridge as political retribution. Everyday street scenes played out nearby. Around 7 a.m., a lone man fed pigeons in the park, which was sparsely populated by the time Mr. Trump's motorcade arrived nearly two hours later. An exception: one older man holding up a red Trump 2024 flag and shouting at television reporters: 'Fight! Fight! Fight for Donald Trump!' Shortly after, a line of young children toddled through, flanked by teacher's aides and clutching a rope, their neon orange vests a pop of color. Anusha Bayya contributed reporting.

One of the prospective jurors who was next to answer questions was experiencing flu-like symptoms and was sent home. Two other jurors, who answered questions yesterday, are running late.

Justice Merchan kindly reminded them to be on time going forward.  In court Monday, former President Donald J. Trump scowled and scoffed, and apparently slept. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab New York City courtroom as Mr. Trump looked on. Before jury selection began, the judge, Juan M. Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, rejected another effort to force his recusal by the defense, which cited several issues, including his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. He also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost. But Mr. Trump's lawyers did persuade Justice Merchan that mentioning sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump was recorded bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial. Entering the courtroom Monday, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here,' but he looked less enthusiastic in front of Justice Merchan. He quietly slouched and scowled — and at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep. By afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into the courtroom. Some quickly left: When the judge asked the first group of 96 if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused. The remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.   The jury selection process in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan could take two weeks or more. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Lawyers representing the State of New York and Donald J. Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate. The potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair. The process could take two weeks or more — and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court. 'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.' The stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County — Manhattan, as most people know it — which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020. Mr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated. Prosecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28. Unlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.' Some may not be completely forthcoming. 'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said. Mr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors. 'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'  Former President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Not since Eugene V. Debs campaigned from a prison cell more than a century ago has the United States experienced what might now happen: a prominent candidate with a felony conviction running for president. And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning. Former President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases: two federal, one in New York and another in Georgia. The first of those to go to trial is the sex scandal cover-up in New York, where jury selection began on Monday. For now, he faces no formal campaign restrictions, beyond having to be present in a courtroom, and he remains highly competitive in polls. But some of the cases are proceeding at a pace that could bring verdicts before the election — and the Constitution and American law have clear answers for only some of the questions that will arise if he is convicted. Others would bring the country into truly uncharted territory, with huge decisions resting in the hands of federal judges. Here is what we know, and what we don't know. This is the simplest question of the bunch. The answer is yes. The Constitution sets very few eligibility requirements for presidents. They must be at least 35 years old, be 'natural born' citizens and have lived in the United States for at least 14 years. There are no limitations based on character or criminal record. While some states prohibit felons from running for state and local office, these laws do not apply to federal offices. The Republican and Democratic Parties have guaranteed spots on general-election ballots in every state, and the parties tell election officials whose name to put in their spot. States could, in theory, try to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on legally shaky ground. 'We let states set the time, place and manner' of elections, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who specializes in election law, 'but I think the best reading of our Constitution is you don't let the state add new substantive requirements.' While that view is not universal among legal experts, it prevailed in court in 2019, after California passed a law requiring candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on primary ballots. A federal district judge blocked the law from taking effect, saying it was most likely unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court also unanimously blocked it as a violation of the state constitution, and the case never reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that states could not keep Mr. Trump off their ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies people who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' after taking an oath to support the Constitution. Numerous lawsuits had argued that Mr. Trump's actions before and on Jan. 6, 2021, met this bar. In December, the Colorado Supreme Court found him ineligible, and Maine's secretary of state did the same. But the Supreme Court — led by a conservative supermajority, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump himself — concluded that only Congress had the power to enforce Section 3 against candidates for federal office. (Four of the justices, including the three liberals, wanted to allow a wider range of options for disqualification.) Congress is not going to do that with Republicans in control of the House. And the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal cases, meaning convictions would not disqualify Mr. Trump either. Congress can designate either groups of people to whom Section 3 applies (such as people who fought for the Confederacy) or specific crimes that, upon conviction, would trigger disqualification, said Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University. But none of the crimes Mr. Trump is charged with carry that automatic penalty. 'Whether or not Trump is tried, convicted, acquitted, that's a separate question from whether or not he's disqualified,' said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. One of the charges in the federal case related to Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election — conspiracy to violate civil rights — once carried a disqualification penalty, Mr. Kreis said, but Congress removed it decades ago. Now that Mr. Trump has secured a majority of delegates to the Republican convention, the party has no mechanism to nominate somebody else. Under the party's official convention rules, if a delegate tries to support someone other than the person the primary results bound them to, 'such support shall not be recognized.' Nor have top Republicans shown any interest in another nominee. If he were forced to withdraw from the race after the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him. Probably not. Mr. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, and he would be disenfranchised there if convicted of a felony. Most felons in Florida regain voting rights after completing their full sentence, including parole or probation, and paying all fines and fees. But it is highly unlikely that Mr. Trump, if convicted, would have time to complete his sentence before Election Day. He could also petition for clemency, which would require the approval of the governor — Ron DeSantis, who ran against Mr. Trump in the Republican primary — and two Florida cabinet members. Chris Taylor, the director of external affairs for the Florida Commission on Offender Review, confirmed that a Florida resident convicted of a felony could apply to have their voting rights restored through that process even if their conviction happened outside Florida. Since Mr. Trump also has a residence in New York, he could switch his voter registration there to take advantage of its more permissive approach: Felons in New York can vote while on parole or probation. But, as in Florida and almost every other state, they are still disenfranchised while in prison. So if Mr. Trump is imprisoned, he could be in the extraordinary position of being deemed fit to be voted for, but unfit to vote. No one knows. 'We're so far removed from anything that's ever happened,' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley. 'It's just guessing.' Legally, Mr. Trump would remain eligible to be president even if he were imprisoned. The Constitution says nothing to the contrary. 'I don't think that the framers ever thought we were going to be in this situation,' Professor Levinson said. In practice, the election of an incarcerated president would create a legal crisis that would almost certainly need to be resolved by the courts. In theory, Mr. Trump could be stripped of his authority under the 25th Amendment, which provides a process to transfer authority to the vice president if the president is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' But that would require the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare Mr. Trump unable to fulfill his duties, a remote prospect given that these would be loyalists appointed by Mr. Trump himself. More likely, Mr. Trump could sue to be released on the basis that his imprisonment was preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional obligations as president. Such a case would probably focus on the separation of powers, with Mr. Trump's lawyers arguing that keeping a duly elected president in prison would be an infringement by the judicial branch on the operations of the executive branch. On the federal charges only, he could also try to pardon himself — or to commute his sentence, leaving his conviction in place but ending his imprisonment. Either action would be an extraordinary assertion of presidential power, and the Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of whether a 'self pardon' was constitutional. Or President Biden, on his way out the door, could pardon Mr. Trump on the basis that 'the people have spoken and I need to pardon him so he can govern,' Professor Chemerinsky said. But that wouldn't apply to the New York or Georgia cases, because the president does not have pardon power for state charges. Again, no one knows, particularly when it comes to the New York and Georgia cases. In the two federal cases, a likely outcome would be that a Trump-appointed attorney general would withdraw the charges. The Justice Department does not indict sitting presidents, a policy outlined in a 1973 memo, during the Nixon era. It has never had reason to develop a policy on what to do with an incoming president who has already been indicted. But the rationale for not indicting sitting presidents — that it would interfere with their ability to perform their duties — applies just as well in this hypothetical scenario. 'The reasons why we wouldn't want to indict a sitting president are the reasons we wouldn't want to prosecute a sitting president,' said Professor Chemerinsky, who has disagreed with the department's reasoning. 'My guess is, if the Trump prosecution were still ongoing in some way and Trump were elected, the Justice Department — which would be the Trump Justice Department — would say, ‘We're following the 1973 memo.'' Like so much else here, this would be legally untested, and it is impossible to say what the Supreme Court would do if the question reached it. In its Clinton v. Jones ruling in 1997, the court allowed a lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed. But that case was civil, not criminal, and it was filed by a private citizen, not by the government itself. Charlie Savage contributed reporting.  © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe challenging process of choosing a jury in the first criminal trial of a former American president proceeded slowly on Tuesday, as prospective jurors were questioned individually about their ability to fairly consider the charges against Donald J. Trump.\nShortly before noon, lawyers began directly questioning the first group of prospective jurors to make it through initial queries. Questions involved their opinions on campaign finance law and on the trial's potential witnesses, including a porn star and a tabloid publisher.\nEarlier, some prospective jurors who had previously indicated that they would be able to be impartial had changed their minds after taking a night to think about it. 'I don't think I can be as impartial and unbiased as I hoped I could be,' one admitted. He was excused.\nIt could take two weeks or more to pick the 12 jurors who will decide the case, which centers on allegations that the former president falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star, Stormy Daniels.\nThe pool of possible jurors being scrutinized on Tuesday came from an initial group of 96, dozens of whom were dismissed immediately on Monday after indicating that they felt they could not fairly reach a decision. The dismissals underscored the difficulty of picking a jury in a city where the defendant is widely reviled.\nMr. Trump, who may take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied all wrongdoing. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records that hid reimbursements to his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who had paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 to buy her silence. Prosecutors say that Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election.\nHere's what to know about the case:\nThe case was brought a year ago by Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. It is one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, but may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nA day after Mr. Trump appeared to nod off during pretrial motions, he was back at the defense table. He appeared somewhat bored as the jury selection process continued, with prospective jurors responding to a series of mostly yes or no questions.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America.\nMr. Trump has repeatedly complained that the case is a politically motivated witch hunt and has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and his family, as well as key witnesses, including Mr. Cohen. Justice Merchan has imposed a gag order on Mr. Trump that bars him from attacking witnesses, jurors, prosecutors or the judge's family. Even before the trial began on Monday, prosecutors asked Justice Merchan to hold the former president in contempt of court over social media posts about Mr. Cohen; the judge said he would hold a hearing later this month.\nApril 16, 2024, 2:00 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 2:00 p.m. ET Anusha Bayya\nAnusha Bayya Reporting from outside the courthouse A midday addition to the crowd here, albeit briefly: Mayor Eric Adams has come by, flanked by his security detail, and was soon peppered with questions by reporters.

Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, accused Donald J. Trump of falsifying business records connected to a hush money payment to a porn star. Mr. Trump pleaded not guilty to all 34 felony counts. Credit Credit... Andrew Seng for The New York Times All 34 felony counts at the center of the Manhattan criminal case against former President Donald J. Trump stem from a $130,000 hush-money payment handed over to a porn star in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign.\nThe specific charges are far less titillating: falsifying business records in the first degree. But a conviction could still result in jail time.\nThe payment was made by Mr. Trump's fixer, Michael D. Cohen, to Stormy Daniels in order to buy her silence about a sexual liaison she said she had with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump directed him to make the payment.\nPaying hush money is not illegal. But while serving as the commander in chief, prosecutors say, Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen in a manner that constituted fraud: In internal records, Mr. Trump's company classified the reimbursement as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet there were no such expenses, according to prosecutors, who say the agreement was also fictional.\nThose records underpin the 34 counts of falsifying business records: 11 involve the checks, 11 center on monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted to the company and 12 involve entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust. Mr. Trump has denied all wrongdoing.\nIn announcing the charges a year ago, Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, said that his office must keep a close eye on how companies conduct business in New York.\n'This is the business capital of the world,' Mr. Bragg said. 'We regularly do cases involving false business statements. The bedrock — in fact, the basis for business integrity and a well-functioning business marketplace — is true and accurate record-keeping.'\nThe charges against Mr. Trump are all Class E felonies, the lowest category in New York. Each count carries a maximum prison sentence of four years.\nNothing in the law requires the judge, Juan E. Merchan, to imprison Mr. Trump if the jury convicts him. The judge could instead sentence him to probation.\nBut Justice Merchan has made it clear that he takes white-collar crime seriously and could put Mr. Trump behind bars. It's possible, however, if Mr. Trump is convicted of more than one count, Justice Merchan would impose a concurrent sentence, under which Mr. Trump would serve all time simultaneously.\nKey Players in the Trump Criminal Trial › Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET Olivia Bensimon\nOlivia Bensimon Reporting from outside the courthouse Journalists still vastly outnumber the Trump supporters who have gathered near the courthouse today.

Neighborhood workers on their lunch breaks bask in the spring sun.\nJury selection is often a lengthy process, but in the first criminal trial of a former American president, currently taking place in a Manhattan criminal courthouse, it's going more slowly than normal.\nIn part, that is because of the nature of the case: Jurors, once seated, will be asked to decide whether Donald J. Trump committed a crime. Prosecutors have charged him with 34 felonies, accusing him of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal that could have hurt his first presidential run.\nBut the process has been particularly drawn-out because, once would-be jurors say they can be fair and impartial, they are being asked a series of 42 questions. After that, they face additional scrutiny from lawyers for the prosecution and the defense.\nHere are the 42 questions:\n1. Without telling us your address, in what neighborhood do you live?

Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Last month, Justice Juan M. Merchan ordered that prospective jurors' names would be shielded from the public, underscoring the need for privacy for those who may decide Donald J. Trump's criminal fate — and tempt the anger of his followers.\nYet on the first two days of jury selection, several prospective jurors revealed potentially identifying information, reflecting the difficulty of having an anonymous jury in a case with an intense media spotlight.\nOn the first day, a woman said she worked for a city agency of approximately 500 people and revealed its name. Later, a man who identified himself as a bookseller revealed the name of the small store where he works.\nThis continued on Tuesday when others revealed the names of employers. While some worked for companies that were large, where the potential jurors could likely remain unidentifiable, others were less cautious. One woman revealed the name of the three-person company she owns with her husband.\nJustice Merchan did not interject as the prospective jurors divulged the information, nor did he caution them against doing so.\nJuries are not completely anonymous in New York State. Mr. Trump, his lawyers and the prosecutors have access to the names of the prospective jurors. But after a request by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, Justice Merchan decided to withhold the names from the public. Mr. Trump did not oppose the request.\nThe accidental self-identifications are a notable departure from how federal Judge Lewis A. Kaplan conducted jury selection in Mr. Trump's defamation trial in January, brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll.\nIn the federal system, jurors are allowed to remain anonymous, even to parties in the case. Before potential jurors answered basic questions about their backgrounds, Judge Kaplan instructed them not to reveal personal information.\n'Don't give us anything that could enable anybody to pin you down geographically,' he said.\nHe also cautioned them not to reveal their names to each other, and when the trial concluded, he left them with these ominous words: 'My advice to you is that you never disclose that you were on this jury,' Judge Kaplan said. 'And I won't say anything more about it.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 16, 2024, 1:11 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 1:11 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich\nJonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse The prospective jurors have just been excused for lunch.

We are running 5 to 7 minutes per person.\nThe very premise of the trial is that prosecutors believe Donald J. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times Donald J. Trump first ran for president nearly a decade ago.\nNow, as he runs again in a political climate that he helped create, his Manhattan criminal trial is partly a referendum on his tactics during that first campaign.\nThe trial's very premise is that prosecutors believe Mr. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign — sex scandals involving a porn star and a Playboy model, for example — he concealed them, the prosecutors say.\nBut in a development that will bolster their case, prosecutors on Monday secured permission from the judge to admit evidence connected to Mr. Trump's overall political strategy in 2016. Much of it bears the former president's imprint: aggressive tweets, false denials, coordination with a tabloid publisher and more.\nThe judge's ruling showed how the weapons that worked so well for Mr. Trump then are being turned against him in the courtroom now.\nThe techniques prosecutors highlighted Monday were not invented by Mr. Trump for use in his campaign; they are behaviors he exhibited throughout his life as a businessman and a reality-television star. But in modern American political history, such raw tactics had rarely been seen at such a high level.\nOne example is Mr. Trump's relationship with The National Enquirer tabloid and its publisher, David Pecker, who is expected to appear as a witness.\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case, obtained permission from the judge on Monday to introduce evidence related to a 2015 meeting among Mr. Trump, Mr. Pecker and Mr. Trump's former fixer, Michael D. Cohen. A prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, said on Monday that the three men had 'conspired to influence the 2016 election.'\nThat meeting laid the groundwork for hush-money deals with a porn star, Stormy Daniels, and a Playboy model, Karen McDougal. But another result of that meeting, Mr. Steinglass said, were explosive headlines about Mr. Trump's opponents in the Republican primary, including those claiming that Ben Carson had committed 'medical malpractice' and that Senator Ted Cruz had a 'family connection to J.F.K.'s assassin.'\nA lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, protested the admission of evidence related to that meeting, saying that newspaper publishers met with candidates 'all the time,' and that there was nothing improper about it, let alone illegal.\nThat admission worked against him. The judge, Juan M. Merchan, said that he was glad that Mr. Blanche believed that there was nothing wrong with the meeting — because it meant that he should not mind that the evidence would be introduced.\n'There is no reason not to allow it in,' Justice Merchan said.\nMr. Steinglass won again when he persuaded Justice Merchan to admit evidence of the Trump campaign in crisis after the publication in 2016 of the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump boasted about grabbing women by their genitals.\n'The video sent the campaign into a tailspin,' Mr. Steinglass said.\nHe offered up an email sent by a Washington Post reporter to Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump's campaign spokeswoman. Mr. Steinglass said that Ms. Hicks had forwarded the exchange to Stephen K. Bannon, Kellyanne Conway and other members of the campaign team, 'suggesting that their response should be to deny, deny, deny.' Eventually, he said, Mr. Bannon sent it to Mr. Cohen.\nMr. Blanche again protested, but was again rebuffed. The judge said he would allow jurors to see the email, saying that the ensuing thread was relevant.\nThe exchanges that prosecutors and defense lawyers debated on Monday underscored Mr. Trump's penchant for delegating dirty work to others, giving himself some distance in the process.\nThe hush-money deals worked that way: Mr. Cohen paid off Ms. Daniels, while The National Enquirer bought Ms. McDougal's silence. (Mr. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to his reimbursement of Mr. Cohen.)\nThat habit is still on display this year, and can be helpful given that Justice Merchan has barred Mr. Trump from attacking witnesses, prosecutors and the judge's own family.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Trump posted on social media a video of Laura Loomer, a political ally, in the park outside the courthouse. Ms. Loomer, speaking into a bullhorn, insinuated that the judge's family was politically compromised.\nHad Mr. Trump said that himself, he would have risked violating the judge's gag order.\nApril 16, 2024, 10:51 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 10:51 a.m. ET Kate Christobek\nKate Christobek Reporting from the courthouse Jury selection has been a slow and slogging exercise but there are occasional moments of levity.

Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab New York City courtroom as Mr. Trump looked on.\nBefore jury selection began, the judge, Juan M. Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, rejected another effort to force his recusal by the defense, which cited several issues, including his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant.\nHe also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost.\nBut Mr. Trump's lawyers did persuade Justice Merchan that mentioning sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump was recorded bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial.\nEntering the courtroom Monday, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here,' but he looked less enthusiastic in front of Justice Merchan. He quietly slouched and scowled — and at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep.\nBy afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into the courtroom. Some quickly left: When the judge asked the first group of 96 if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused.\nThe remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT The jury selection process in Donald J.

Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate.\nThe potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair.\nThe process could take two weeks or more — and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court.\n'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.'\nThe stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County — Manhattan, as most people know it — which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020.\nMr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions.\nMr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated.\nProsecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28.\nUnlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.'\nSome may not be completely forthcoming.\n'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said.\nMr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors.\n'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Not since Eugene V. Debs campaigned from a prison cell more than a century ago has the United States experienced what might now happen: a prominent candidate with a felony conviction running for president. And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning.\nFormer President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases: two federal, one in New York and another in Georgia. The first of those to go to trial is the sex scandal cover-up in New York, where jury selection began on Monday.\nFor now, he faces no formal campaign restrictions, beyond having to be present in a courtroom, and he remains highly competitive in polls. But some of the cases are proceeding at a pace that could bring verdicts before the election — and the Constitution and American law have clear answers for only some of the questions that will arise if he is convicted.\nOthers would bring the country into truly uncharted territory, with huge decisions resting in the hands of federal judges.\nHere is what we know, and what we don't know.\nThis is the simplest question of the bunch. The answer is yes.\nThe Constitution sets very few eligibility requirements for presidents. They must be at least 35 years old, be 'natural born' citizens and have lived in the United States for at least 14 years.\nThere are no limitations based on character or criminal record. While some states prohibit felons from running for state and local office, these laws do not apply to federal offices.\nThe Republican and Democratic Parties have guaranteed spots on general-election ballots in every state, and the parties tell election officials whose name to put in their spot. States could, in theory, try to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on legally shaky ground.\n'We let states set the time, place and manner' of elections, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who specializes in election law, 'but I think the best reading of our Constitution is you don't let the state add new substantive requirements.'\nWhile that view is not universal among legal experts, it prevailed in court in 2019, after California passed a law requiring candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on primary ballots. A federal district judge blocked the law from taking effect, saying it was most likely unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court also unanimously blocked it as a violation of the state constitution, and the case never reached the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that states could not keep Mr. Trump off their ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies people who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' after taking an oath to support the Constitution.\nNumerous lawsuits had argued that Mr. Trump's actions before and on Jan. 6, 2021, met this bar. In December, the Colorado Supreme Court found him ineligible, and Maine's secretary of state did the same. But the Supreme Court — led by a conservative supermajority, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump himself — concluded that only Congress had the power to enforce Section 3 against candidates for federal office. (Four of the justices, including the three liberals, wanted to allow a wider range of options for disqualification.)\nCongress is not going to do that with Republicans in control of the House. And the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal cases, meaning convictions would not disqualify Mr. Trump either.\nCongress can designate either groups of people to whom Section 3 applies (such as people who fought for the Confederacy) or specific crimes that, upon conviction, would trigger disqualification, said Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University. But none of the crimes Mr. Trump is charged with carry that automatic penalty.\n'Whether or not Trump is tried, convicted, acquitted, that's a separate question from whether or not he's disqualified,' said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nOne of the charges in the federal case related to Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election — conspiracy to violate civil rights — once carried a disqualification penalty, Mr. Kreis said, but Congress removed it decades ago.\nNow that Mr. Trump has secured a majority of delegates to the Republican convention, the party has no mechanism to nominate somebody else. Under the party's official convention rules, if a delegate tries to support someone other than the person the primary results bound them to, 'such support shall not be recognized.'\nNor have top Republicans shown any interest in another nominee.\nIf he were forced to withdraw from the race after the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him.\nafter the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him. Probably not.\nMr. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, and he would be disenfranchised there if convicted of a felony.\nMost felons in Florida regain voting rights after completing their full sentence, including parole or probation, and paying all fines and fees. But it is highly unlikely that Mr. Trump, if convicted, would have time to complete his sentence before Election Day.\nHe could also petition for clemency, which would require the approval of the governor — Ron DeSantis, who ran against Mr. Trump in the Republican primary — and two Florida cabinet members. Chris Taylor, the director of external affairs for the Florida Commission on Offender Review, confirmed that a Florida resident convicted of a felony could apply to have their voting rights restored through that process even if their conviction happened outside Florida.\nSince Mr. Trump also has a residence in New York, he could switch his voter registration there to take advantage of its more permissive approach: Felons in New York can vote while on parole or probation. But, as in Florida and almost every other state, they are still disenfranchised while in prison.\nSo if Mr. Trump is imprisoned, he could be in the extraordinary position of being deemed fit to be voted for, but unfit to vote.\nNo one knows.\n'We're so far removed from anything that's ever happened,' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley. 'It's just guessing.'\nLegally, Mr. Trump would remain eligible to be president even if he were imprisoned. The Constitution says nothing to the contrary. 'I don't think that the framers ever thought we were going to be in this situation,' Professor Levinson said.\nIn practice, the election of an incarcerated president would create a legal crisis that would almost certainly need to be resolved by the courts.\nIn theory, Mr. Trump could be stripped of his authority under the 25th Amendment, which provides a process to transfer authority to the vice president if the president is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' But that would require the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare Mr. Trump unable to fulfill his duties, a remote prospect given that these would be loyalists appointed by Mr. Trump himself.\nMore likely, Mr. Trump could sue to be released on the basis that his imprisonment was preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional obligations as president. Such a case would probably focus on the separation of powers, with Mr. Trump's lawyers arguing that keeping a duly elected president in prison would be an infringement by the judicial branch on the operations of the executive branch.\nOn the federal charges only, he could also try to pardon himself — or to commute his sentence, leaving his conviction in place but ending his imprisonment. Either action would be an extraordinary assertion of presidential power, and the Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of whether a 'self pardon' was constitutional.\nOr President Biden, on his way out the door, could pardon Mr. Trump on the basis that 'the people have spoken and I need to pardon him so he can govern,' Professor Chemerinsky said.\nBut that wouldn't apply to the New York or Georgia cases, because the president does not have pardon power for state charges.\nAgain, no one knows, particularly when it comes to the New York and Georgia cases.\nIn the two federal cases, a likely outcome would be that a Trump-appointed attorney general would withdraw the charges.\nThe Justice Department does not indict sitting presidents, a policy outlined in a 1973 memo, during the Nixon era. It has never had reason to develop a policy on what to do with an incoming president who has already been indicted. But the rationale for not indicting sitting presidents — that it would interfere with their ability to perform their duties — applies just as well in this hypothetical scenario.\n'The reasons why we wouldn't want to indict a sitting president are the reasons we wouldn't want to prosecute a sitting president,' said Professor Chemerinsky, who has disagreed with the department's reasoning. 'My guess is, if the Trump prosecution were still ongoing in some way and Trump were elected, the Justice Department — which would be the Trump Justice Department — would say, ‘We're following the 1973 memo.''\nLike so much else here, this would be legally untested, and it is impossible to say what the Supreme Court would do if the question reached it.\nIn its Clinton v. Jones ruling in 1997, the court allowed a lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed. But that case was civil, not criminal, and it was filed by a private citizen, not by the government itself.\nCharlie Savage contributed reporting.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences",
