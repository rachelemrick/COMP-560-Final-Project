It will be San Francisco's first time hosting the beloved animals long-term \u2014 the result of a yearlong advocacy campaign, Breed said.\nSan Diego previously announced it was receiving two pandas back in February.\nChina is home to the only natural habitat for pandas and owns most of the black-and-white bears in the world. Beijing loans the animals to other countries as a tool for diplomacy and wildlife conservation.\n\"San Francisco is absolutely thrilled to be welcoming giant pandas to the San Francisco Zoo,\" Breed said after signing a letter of intent for international cooperation on giant panda conservation.\nBreed said the city had been working with its Chinese and Asian communities to advocate for the pandas for almost a year leading up to an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' meeting in San Francisco last November, during which the U.S. and Chinese presidents met.\nCWCA Secretary General Wu Minglu said the association will work with San Francisco officials to prepare for the pandas' arrival and to ensure the technical standards for their conservation.\n\"We look forward to a pair of giant pandas being in San Francisco in 2025,\" he said.\nWhen San Diego broke the news in February that it would receive a pair of pandas, it was the first time in more than two decades that China had agreed to send pandas to the United States.\nOnly four giant pandas are currently in the U.S., all at the zoo in Atlanta. China in recent years has not renewed loan agreements at zoos in Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee, sparking fears it was ending its historic panda diplomacy with Western nations due to geopolitical tensions.\nThe black-and-white bears have been a symbol of U.S.-China friendship ever since Beijing gifted a pair of pandas to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., in 1972, ahead of the normalization of bilateral relations. China later loaned pandas to zoos to help breed cubs and boost the population.\nFriday's announcement comes ahead of a planned visit to China next week by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\nWashington and Beijing have boosted their diplomatic exchanges in recent months, in an effort to ease escalating tensions. But frictions remain on trade, national security and the countries' diverging stances on conflicts such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Pandas.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.2023296,"_id":"4135975b8b1e1b9bc8488b255a18f08e"},{"title":"Biden launches billion-dollar climate work program as part of Earth Day actions","author":"Thomas Catenacci","published_date":"2024-04-22 18:59:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-launches-billion-dollar-climate-work-program-earth-day-actions","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"President Biden is moving forward with establishing the \"groundbreaking\" climate corps program, employing thousands of Americans to fight global warming.","summary":"President Biden officially launched the so-called American Climate Corps, a program that is slated to \"mobilize\" tens of thousands of Americans for conservation and eco-friendly projects nationwide.\nThe president's actions on the work program come on Earth Day and are part of broader actions the White House unveiled Monday to commemorate Earth Day. In addition to the American Climate Corps announcement, the White House touted recent regulations blocking off 13 million acres of federal land from future oil drilling and revealed $7 billion in grants for mainly state-level solar projects.\n\"Here's the bottom line: President Biden laid out the most ambitious land and water conservation agenda in American history,\" White House Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory told reporters during a call about the administration's Earth Day actions. \"And he is delivering, already cementing a legacy as one of the nation's strongest conservation presidents.\"\n\"The groundbreaking corps represents, yet again, a way to make accessible the economic opportunity and upside that comes with tackling the climate crisis,\" added White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi. \"So, for young people of all backgrounds, no matter their qualification, no matter their zip code, there will now be pathways and positions that they can fill that help them gain the skills to succeed in the clean energy economy.\"\nOverall, the American Climate Corps will consist of 20,000 Americans who will work in a variety of roles combating climate change. The positions generally don't require previous experience and will be geared towards conservation, green energy and environmental justice work.\nOn Monday, the White House launched a new website for interested workers to apply for such roles. The site is expected to soon list 2,000 positions \u2013 such as field coordinator, forestry technician, hydrologic technician, and land conservation crew member \u2013 located across 36 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico.\nThe White House said the overarching goal of the corps is to make it easy for any American to \"find work tackling the climate crisis while gaining the skills necessary for the clean energy and climate resilience workforce of the future.\" It added the first class of the American Climate Corps will be deployed in June 2024.\n\"From day one, the President has seen the urgency of taking action on climate not just because of the situation it creates in our communities, represented in wildfires and floods and hurricanes, but also a profound sense of urgency to get American workers back in the game competing for the jobs of the future,\" a senior administration official told reporters.\nBiden first took executive action to begin forming the government work program in September after facing pressure from progressives and environmental groups who had called for such an action. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., the two architects of the Green New Deal, had led such calls among Democratic lawmakers.\nAccording to a senior administration official, ahead of the announcement Monday, the White House held listening sessions with Markey and Ocasio-Cortez to hear from Americans interested in the program.\nBut the program has faced heavy criticism from Republicans who have argued congressional action is needed to move forward with it.\nIn an October letter, Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., and Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, expressed concern that it is unclear where funding for the program would be coming from.\n\"Unlike the Civilian Conservation Corps, which was implemented by President Roosevelt in response to an authorization in a law passed by Congress, the announcement of the program does not reference any legal authority giving rise to the program,\" they wrote.\nTogether, Comer and Sessions are spearheading an oversight investigation of the program.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Thomas Catenacci","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/07/Biden-admin-rule-curbing-oil-drilling-mining-faces-widespread-opposition.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.175966,"_id":"82bd4d7731102f0c4976e9c3e8b09b79"},{"title":"Conservatives' attempt to repeal hate speech law that made Scotland an \u2018international mockery' fails","author":"Alexander Hall","published_date":"2024-04-17 23:00:30","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/conservatives-attempt-repeal-hate-speech-law-made-scotland-international-mockery-fails","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Scottish parliament defeated an attempt by Conservatives to repeal the hate speech law that had put Scotland's government in the international spotlight.","summary":"Scottish conservatives attempted to repeal a controversial new hate speech law Wednesday, saying its passage made Scotland an \"international mockery.\"\nThe Scottish parliament voted to keep the Hate Crime and Public Order Act after a challenge from Scottish Conservatives, which cited concerns that its vague wording, expansive coverage and potentially selective enforcement could be disastrous for common people.\nSky News reported Scottish Conservative politician Russell Findlay MSP had argued the new law \"transformed Scotland into a place of international mockery,\" and warned it was a \"disaster on paper, and it's a disaster in reality.\"\nJ.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter franchise, made international headlines when she tested the hate speech law's enforcement by criticizing transgender ideology. While the government and Scottish police stood down and claimed the law allows such speech, others, both for and against the law, suspected this was a case of selective enforcement.\nCiting Rowling's challenge, Findlay went on, \"But what of those without her cash and clout? Even if prosecutions are unlikely, being subject to investigation can be daunting, disruptive, humiliating and financially costly. Police arriving at your home or workplace, taken away in handcuffs, phone seized, forced to pay for a lawyer. Stigmatising and damaging to personal reputations and employment prospects.\"\nScottish police have reportedly been inundated by thousands of complaints since the law went into effect on April 1.\n\"This is about rejecting division by turning Scot against Scot. To clype [tattle] on friends, colleagues and family,\" Findlay said. \"And based on the evidence, we were right to vote against this law three years ago. And based on the evidence, we are right to call for its repeal today.\"\nScotland's top politician, First Minister Humza Yousaf, who is credited with shepherding the bill through parliament, derided the effort to repeal it as \"frankly dangerous,\" noting before the debate that he was \"pretty confident\" it would be rejected.\n\"If we repealed the hate crime act, we'd have virtually no protection against hatred for people here in Scotland in relation to their race or their religion or their sexual orientation or their disability or their transgender identity,\" Yousaf said, according to Sky News. \"So, repealing that would almost give carte blanche to people in Scotland, send a signal to people in Scotland, that minority that indulge in hate, that actually their hatred was acceptable.\"\n\"And that's what the Conservatives want to try to bring to the parliament. It's disgraceful. It's dangerous,\" he added.\nThe text of the bill, originally introduced years before, warns against acts that \"stir up hatred\" against various groups based on various identities, such as being transgender. The maximum penalty for violating this new law is a seven-year jail sentence.\nThe Scottish parliament's explanatory notes on the law say Scots can be prosecuted for sharing offensive rhetoric, by \"Displaying, publishing or distributing the material e.g. on a sign; on the internet through websites, blogs, podcasts, social media etc., either directly, or by forwarding or repeating material that originates from a third party; through printed media such as magazine publications or leaflets, etc.\n\"Giving, sending, showing or playing the material to another person e.g. through online streaming, by email, playing a video, through public performance of a play, etc.\n\"Making the material available to another person in any way e.g. through the spoken word, the written word, electronic communications, etc. either directly (as the originator of the material), or by forwarding or repeating the material.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Alexander Hall","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/humza-parliament.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.15248,"_id":"85d0989c699f3de4e0df0a2005f08726"},{"title":"GOP AGs put a major US bank on notice for alleged 'de-banking' of conservatives","author":"Brianna Herlihy","published_date":"2024-04-15 23:55:15","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-ags-put-major-u-s-bank-noticed-alleged-de-banking-conservatives","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Over a dozen Republican attorneys general are warning a major U.S. bank against alleged practices of 'de-banking\" certain customers because of their religious or political views.","summary":"Over a dozen Republican attorneys general are warning a major U.S. bank against alleged practices of \"de-banking\" certain customers because of their religious or political views.\nIn a letter obtained exclusively by Fox News Digital, Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, along with 14 of his Republican colleagues told Bank of America CEO Brian T. Moynihan that the company \"appears to be conditioning access to its services on customers having the bank's preferred religious or political views.\"\n\"Your discriminatory behavior is a serious threat to free speech and religious freedom, is potentially illegal, and is causing political and regulatory backlash,\" the letter sent Monday states. \"Your bank needs to be transparent with and assure us, its shareholders, and others that it will not continue to de-bank customers for their speech or religious exercise,\" the AGs wrote.\nMedia relations representative, Bill Halldin, denied the claims in a statement saying, \"Religious beliefs are not a factor in any account-closing decision.\"\n\"We are proud to provide banking services to non-profit organizations affiliated with diverse faith communities throughout the United States,\" he said.\nThe AGs claim that Bank of America has previously denied services to gun manufacturers, distributors, and sellers, fossil-fuel producers, contractors for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and private prisons and related services.\nThe letter cites recent news reports that the bank cooperated with the FBI and U.S. Treasury to profile conservative and religious Americans as potential domestic terrorists.\n\"Bank of America's practice of canceling the bank accounts of conservatives and even turning over information about customer's purchases to federal law enforcement undermines free speech, religious freedom, and the right to privacy,\" Kobach told Fox News Digital.\n\"It's discriminatory and likely illegal. As state attorneys general, we will vigorously defend the constitutional rights of all Americans when they are threatened by big business.\"\n\"Those agencies outrageously used innocuous information\u2014such as whether someone shopped at outdoor stores, supported Trump, purchased religious texts, had conservative views on COVID-19 or immigration, or associated with groups like Alliance Defending Freedom, Family Research Council, and the Ruth Institute, which champion mainstream views on free speech, religious freedom, and life\u2014to tar ordinary Americans as potential domestic terrorists,\" the letter states.\nThe letter also cites a report from the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Weaponization of the Federal Government which found that Bank of America \"willingly participated in financial surveillance\" and voluntarily shared confidential customer information without a warrant and without notifying its customers.\n\"We are deeply concerned that Bank of America is willing to cooperate in the infringement of its customers' constitutional and privacy rights to help federal law enforcement surveil and target millions of conservative Americans, many of whom live in our states,\" the letter states.\nBut Bank of America said that it \"followed all applicable laws in our interactions with the Trump Administration's Treasury Department and law enforcement. \"\n\"These interactions began when the Trump Administration's Treasury Department urgently gathered major banks and law enforcement on Jan. 15, 2021 and shared information regarding potential criminal activity that could disrupt the upcoming inauguration. We have cooperated with the committee as they evaluate whether the laws we complied with should be changed,\" the company said.\nThe AGs wrote that \"as attorneys general of our respective states, we take great interest in protecting a culture of free speech within our borders,\" noting that Bank of America is the second-largest bank in the country and have nearly 15% of all domestic deposits.\n\"You appear to be using this power to punish conservative and religious customers by handing their data over to federal law enforcement and even canceling their accounts. This not only undermines free speech and religious freedom, but also is potentially illegal and could lead to investigations, litigation, regulation, and political backlash,\" they wrote.\nThe group of AGs, which include Mississippi, Idaho, Iowa, Alabama, Utah, Texas, Montana, Virginia, Arkansas, South Carolina, South Dakota, Indiana, Missouri and Nebraska, asked that within 30 days of receipt, the bank provides them with a written report about their account-cancellation policies and practices, particularly regarding \"risk tolerance,\" \"reputational risk,\" \"hate,\" \"intolerance,\" and similar terms, and whether Bank of America considers a customer's speech or religious exercise \u2014 or public perception or other groups' perception of them \u2014 as a component of those policies.\nThey also asked that the bank update its terms of service to state that it does not discriminate against customers for their religious or political views or speech, and support shareholder proposals protecting religious and political diversity.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brianna Herlihy","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Bank-of-America-Mortgage.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.1159883,"_id":"34805aca02ec0763fdb36b80c9c35fe6"},{"title":"Endangered Bornean orangutan born at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-15 21:53:54","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/endangered-bornean-orangutan-born-busch-gardens-tampa-bay","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"An endangered Bornean orangutan was born at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay over the weekend, delivered by cesarean section and weighing in at just over three pounds.","summary":"An endangered Bornean orangutan baby has been welcomed into the world at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in Florida.\nThe baby orangutan was delivered by cesarean section on Saturday, weighing just over three pounds, park officials said.

Why should American taxpayers, who lean conservative, support the organization with their money?","summary":"Imagine if the Federal Highway Administration spent just 11% of its congressional funding on roads in red states and 67% of its funding on roads in blue states. Would that last long?\nOf course, not--Republicans and moderates in Congress would put an end to it immediately. It would be clearly unfair to taxpayers and a dysfunctional way to operate a federally funded highway system.\nBut that's how things work at the nation's largest public radio news organization, and that's why I am introducing the Defund NPR Act.\nNational Public Radio (NPR) has 87 registered Democrats and zero registered Republicans working in its Washington, D.C.. newsroom, and they've been preaching to the choir. Over two-thirds of NPR listeners are liberals and barely more than one out of every ten leans conservative.\nBut the U.S. taxpayers -- who are sending NPR nearly $100 million dollars a year in federal funding\u2014i.e. the American people\u2014lean conservative.\nWhy should they pay for a radio station that they don't like to listen to? Their money doesn't go to a conservative alternative to NPR, which is fine, but we shouldn't make an exception for far-left radio.\nOf course, the problem isn't just that NPR doesn't appeal to conservative Americans\u2014it's far worse than that. The heart of the issue is that NPR despises Republicans and their values.\nJust listen to their new CEO, Katherine Maher, who said that the \"the number one challenge here [to censoring Americans] that we see is, of course, the First Amendment in the United States.\"\nMaher believes that \"our reverence for the truth might be a distraction that's getting in the way of finding common ground and getting things done.\" Maher, who is expected to take in about $600,000 a year from American taxpayers, is openly contemptuous of our Constitution and objective journalism, and advocates for suppressing speech she disagrees with. Of course, according to Maher, \"Donald Trump is a racist.\" I'm sure she feels the same way about his supporters.\nUnfortunately, the rot runs deep at NPR and there's no easy fix. Firing Maher won't save the station, though it's still the right thing to do.\nNPR has a massive DEI staff that ensures that everything the outlet publishes is sufficiently woke. According to Uri Berliner, a 25-year NPR veteran who recently resigned, these partisan administrators monitor reporters' interviewees, run \"unconscious bias\" training sessions, and host employee affinity groups, including a \"Marginalized Genders and Intersex People of Color mentorship program\" and a group for \"Women, Gender-Expansive, and Transgender People in Technology Throughout Public Media.\"\nNPR has been a liberal propaganda machine for years.\nThe last and final time I went on NPR was during the first hoax impeachment of President Trump in 2019. I pointed out that Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who was leading the impeachment hoax, had lied about his relationship with the supposed Ukraine \"whistleblower,\" a man we now know to be Eric Ciaramella. The New York Times published a report confirming my statement the same day as my interview. But NPR still published a ridiculous \"correction\" accusing me of \"misinformation\" and apologizing to their listeners for airing the interview. Of course, NPR invited Schiff on to spread lies about the Russia hoax 25 times.\nThe fact is that NPR is just as biased, if not more biased, than left-wing outlets like CNN or MSNBC. Activists at NPR like Katherine Maher aren't hiding it anymore: Their mission is to boost Democrat politicians and indoctrinate the American public.\nCongress shouldn't give NPR another dime.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Rep.

Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., and others could be seen huddled with Johnson on the House floor after morning votes.\nThe discussion appeared to be interrupted a short while later when Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., confronted the group, and wound up in a particularly heated back-and-forth with Gaetz. Van Orden later told Fox News Digital that he called Gaetz \"tubby\" and dared the GOP rebels to trigger a vote for Johnson's ouster \u2013 a threat he's facing from Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who were not in the group.\nGaetz later told reporters that the conversation with Johnson was \"tense\" and that they were expressing opposition to his $95 billion proposal of separate bills for aid to Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific.\nIt comes as Johnson faces blowback from members on the right of his conference over the plan, which is roughly the same cost as the Senate's combined Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan funding package passed earlier this year.\n\"We don't want to pass his bill. The only win we've got in the House of Representatives is blocking the Senate supplemental. If we're going to throw in the towel on that, what are we doing here?\" Gaetz asked.\nA key difference in Johnson's plan is having House members vote on each of the bills separately before sending them in a combined package to the Senate \u2013 in order to give lawmakers the opportunity to take a stand on each issue and separating the politically fraught matter of Ukraine.\nBut conservatives balked at the lack of U.S. border security provisions tied to the Ukraine bill. Indeed, a GOP lawmaker familiar with the confrontation on the House floor told Fox News Digital that they were pushing Johnson to consider options that include border policy rather than going forward with his planned Saturday foreign aid vote.\n\"I thought we were making some real headway, and then had a member walk up and just start name-calling and just getting in people's faces,\" the GOP lawmaker said.\nThey were almost certainly referring to Van Orden, who later told Fox News Digital that he joined the fray because he noticed the speaker needed \"a swim buddy,\" a term for a teammate that Van Orden borrowed from his days in the Navy SEALs.\n\"Gaetz was speaking to the speaker in a matter that I just, I did not think it was appropriate,\" Van Orden said.\n\"They start calling me stupid \u2013 incredibly juvenile things. And so I said something along the lines of, \u2018Kick rocks, tubby,' to Matt \u2026 And the reason I did that is because Matt Gaetz is a bully. He just got up in my face, and I'm not gonna be intimidated by that guy.\"\nVan Orden is one of the many rank-and-file Republicans who have accused House Freedom Caucus members and their allies of hurting the conference with hardball tactics against their fellow GOP lawmakers.\nHe said he dared them to make good on threats to call a motion to vacate, a procedural maneuver that would trigger a vote on ousting the speaker.\nWhen asked about his confrontation with Van Orden later, Gaetz called it \"very puzzling and concerning.\"\n\"The only thing I gleaned from it is that Mr. Van Orden is not a particularly intelligent individual,\" Gaetz said.\nHe added that his confidence in Johnson was \"diminishing\" over his actions on foreign aid.\nCurrently, a vote on those bills is expected Saturday evening. Another border security bill that Johnson put forward to ease GOP concerns was blown up on Thursday night before it could get to the House floor by conservatives who accused Johnson of putting it up as a messaging bill with no real momentum.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Elizabeth Elkind","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Johnson-scaled.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.720548,"_id":"8284a9adc28e0195c8b5db8eb29aa78a"},{"title":"'Crazy plane lady' Tiffany Gomas comes out as 'anti-woke' with bikini-and-beer pic","author":"Andrea Vacchiano","published_date":"2024-04-20 21:57:57","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/crazy-plane-lady-tiffany-gomas-comes-out-anti-woke-bikini-beer-pic","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"'Crazy plane lady' Tiffany Gomas posted a picture of her endorsing an \"anti-woke\" beer company Ultra Right Beer on X this week, seemingly coming out as conservative.","summary":"The Texas woman who became famous after having an outburst on a plane last year seemingly came out as conservative-leaning on X this week.\nTiffany Gomas, who was dubbed \"Crazy plane lady\" last summer after her July 2 flare-up went viral on social media, publicized her \"anti-woke\" views on X.\nOn Wednesday, Gomas posted a mirror selfie of herself wearing a red, white and blue bikini while holding a can of Ultra Right Beer, an \"anti-woke\" company.\n\"Wonder how many people I'm gonna piss off with this post,\" the Texas resident captioned the photo.\nThe picture, which racked up over 55,000 likes, received positive attention from conservative social media users.\n\"Liberals have nothing on conservative women.

Tony Evers.","summary":"MADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Wisconsin Supreme Court justices questioned Wednesday how much power legislative committees should wield, in a case that Democratic Gov. Tony Evers brought against the Republican-controlled Legislature and that could have a major impact on how state government functions.\nA ruling in favor of Evers would upend decades-old practices in the Legislature and make it easier to approve projects in a land stewardship program. But justices echoed concerns raised by Republicans that the case could have far broader impacts on the separation of power between the executive and legislative branches.\nSiding with Evers would \"overturn how our state government has functioned for almost a century,\" Misha Tseytlin, a lawyer for the Legislature, told the court.\nBut liberal Justice Jill Karofsky, in deflecting arguments that the court should not overturn such established practices, said \"Maybe they've been wrong for the last century and we shouldn't double down on how wrong this is.\"\nEvers argues that the Legislature's powerful budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, which is controlled 12-4 by Republicans, is exceeding its constitutional lawmaking authority and effectively acting as a fourth branch of government. The Legislature counters that the committee's powers, including the approval of certain state conservation projects, are well established in state law and court precedent.\nKarofsky questioned whether the budget committee had too much power.\n\"There doesn't seem to me to be any limits whatsoever,\" she said. \"There are zero guardrails here.\"\nIf the court sides with Evers, then numerous other functions of the budget committee, the state building commission and other legislative committees that have been in place for a century would also be unconstitutional, Tseytlin said.\nConservative Justice Rebecca Bradley questioned whether the court's ruling would apply across a myriad of legislative committees and their powers.\n\"You're asking us to make a big shift,\" she said, adding that the court can't \"slice and dice separation of powers\" between the executive and legislative branches.\n\"Either we're going to apply it strictly or we're not,\" she said.\nLiberal Justice Ann Walsh Bradley echoed some concerns raised by conservative justices.\n\"Your position seems to be black and white: Once the Legislature has passed a bill, hands off,\" she said to Evers' attorney. \"Isn't there any nuance to the position, some kind of limitations on your black-and-white argument? It seems to me there should be.\"\nEvers' attorney Colin Roth said the constitution is clear that once the Legislature passes a law, it is up to the executive branch to carry it out. The Legislature is overreaching its authority when committees can veto actions such as the approval of stewardship projects, he said.\nEvers, speaking about the case on Tuesday, said the state Supreme Court needs to recognize that the Legislature's budget committee has been acting as a fourth branch of government and should be reined in.\n\"The idea that somehow they have the ability to essentially work as a fourth arm of our state is just wrong,\" Evers told reporters.\nThe lawsuit cites the committee's rejection of dozens of conservation projects selected by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program.\nThe Legislature created the stewardship program in 1989. It provides funding primarily to local governments, conservation groups and the DNR to purchase blocks of land to preserve natural areas and wildlife habitat, protect water quality and fisheries, and expand outdoor recreational opportunities. Supporters herald it as a way to further protect natural areas from development.\nRepublicans have been trying for years to scale back stewardship purchases, complaining that they take too much land off the tax rolls, rob northern Wisconsin municipalities of revenue and drive up state debt.\nLegislative oversight of the program increased as concerns grew about the scope and cost of the stewardship program.\nThe Legislature did its job when it passed laws creating and funding the program, attorneys for Evers argue in court filings. But the budget committee's ability to block approval of stewardship projects, essentially vetoing decisions of the executive branch, is an unconstitutional separation of powers violation, they say.\nConservative Chief Justice Annette Ziegler questioned whether the case should be put on hold so the court could gather more facts and take a broader look at legislative and executive powers.\n\"Why rush this case?\" she asked.\nThe court will issue a ruling in the next several weeks or months.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Wisconsin-Governor-Sues-Legislature.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.6553683,"_id":"c920cec15d2794c63df4bb37bbd472fa"},{"title":"Bank of America accused of discriminating against conservatives:","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-17 10:14:24","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6351090505112","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita and Timothy Two Project International founder Steve Curtis joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the bombshell allegations and how the bank has responded to the\u2026","summary":"All times eastern FOX News Radio Live Channel Coverage\nAll times eastern FOX News Radio Live Channel Coverage","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/b28a3e17-cd40-41f3-804b-a98834905b89/4c640d38-2199-40a9-8879-a61cc57609a8/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.629636,"_id":"e6960c20a916ef147fc57a480e0f1c14"},{"title":"British parliament votes to ban smoking for all people born after 2009","author":"Timothy Nerozzi","published_date":"2024-04-18 13:18:32","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/british-parliament-votes-ban-smoking-all-people-born-2009","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The U.K. House of Commons has voted in favor of banning the purchase of nicotine products for all individuals born after 2009, aiming to create the country's first \"smoke-free generation.\"","summary":"The British parliament has voted to outlaw smoking for future generations.\nThe Tobacco and Vapes Bill, introduced and championed by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, is set to ban smoking for anyone born after 2009.\nIt overwhelmingly passed a vote in the House of Commons with 383 votes to 67 on\nGovernment officials have boasted that the bill will produce the U.K.'s first-ever \"smoke-free generation.\"\nThere is still several steps to officially passing the bill into law, including a debate and vote in the upper chamber of the U.K. parliament, the House of Lords.\nThe Conservative Party has seen internal tensions over the smoking ban, which many Tory leaders have claimed is a misstep.\n178 Conservative members of parliament voted for the bill with 57 voting against and 106 not recording a vote.\n\"When the party of Winston Churchill wants to ban cigars, donnez-moi un break [give me a break] as they say in Quebec, it's just mad,\" former Prime Minister Boris Johnson said last week at a conference in Canada.\nFellow ex-prime minister Liz Truess echoed Johnson's concerns, saying the goal of legislating the personal decisions of grown men and women was misguided.\n\"It is very important that until people have decision-making capability while they are growing up that we protect them,\" Truess said. \"But I think the whole idea that we can protect adults from themselves is hugely problematic.\"\nSupporters of the ban claim that the addictive nature of nicotine products takes away an individual's freedom to make a free decision about consuming them.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Timothy Nerozzi","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/09/cigarette_nutrition-study.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.6177077,"_id":"794c7cb50f25e1359209b72cdac6427b"},{"title":"What we want is a conservative solution: Rep.

Erdo\u011fan declared that \"the only winner today is Turkey.\"\nHowever, the most recent losses indicate that Erdo\u011fan cannot rest easy and that his close call was more of a portend than a speed bump, most importantly because the support has come from across the country.

No large-scale damage or casualties were reported in either incident.\nThe issue of Israel has also been a divisive one for Democrats, as a growing faction of left-wing lawmakers criticize Israel's invasion in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack.\nRepublicans, for the most part, have been united in backing Israel and its conservative government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Johnson has put two previous Israel funding bills on the House floor, one that offset the funding with cuts to the IRS, and one which provided the funding without any strings attached. Neither was taken up by the Senate.\nThis time, however, fiscal conservatives decried the lack of offsets and funding for Gaza.\n\"I will always stand with our greatest ally in the Middle East, Israel. But I rise today to express my serious concerns with a very flawed supplemental. In November, I supported the first security supplemental for Israel, which was financially paid for and would have provided weapons and equipment for Israel's fight against Hamas. The cost was offset by rescinding Democrats unprecedented expansion of the IRS. Today, we are considering a vastly different bill, one that is all borrowing another 26 billion of debt with no rescission,\" House Freedom Caucus member Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., said during debate on the bill.\n\"The legislation also contains 400 million for FEMA, which has nothing to do with supporting Israel, and over $9 billion for humanitarian aid in\u2026Gaza and the West Bank.\"\nClyde cited a Heritage Foundation report that said Hamas and other terror groups controlled the flow of all international humanitarian aid operating in Gaza.\n\"It is therefore highly likely U.S. taxpayer-funded humanitarian aid to Gaza, including some of the aid in this bill, will again be diverted to support further Hamas attacks against Israel,\" he said.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Elizabeth Elkind","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Johnson-Netanyahu-Split-Photo-1.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.8933334,"_id":"532a76b80a554ab37df03a866f0e7ef7"},{"title":"Where are they now?

As campaigning for the June 6-9 event heats up, mainstream parties fear that disenchanted voters might turn to the people at NatCon 2024.\n\"This is what we're up against. We're up against a new form of evil ideology,\" Nigel Farage, the man credited with taking Britain out of the European Union, told the gathering of a few hundred stridently nationalist and fundamentalist Christian politicians and think-tankers.\nAnti-migrant sentiment featured in a number of speeches. Some targeted what they saw as the follies of climate policy, \"narco-socialism\" or \"woke indoctrination,\" often with sharp opposition to multinational organizations like the EU.\nLashing out at the bloc's treaties, and the pledge in the preamble of the founding EU texts to an \"ever-closer Union\" among the 27 member countries, Polish lawmaker Ryszard Legutko said it all makes \"medieval monks look almost like intellectual anarchists.\"\nSurveys suggest that mainstream political parties are likely to retain power after the June elections, but quite possibly with a reduced majority.\nBelgian police quietly shut down the conference by barring attendees from re-entering the venue if they dared to leave. A dozen or so officers blocked the main entrance. It was the third venue for the gathering after the owners of two other locations shied away when anti-fascist protesters vowed to disrupt proceedings.\nThis year's NatCon, organized by the conservative U.S. think tank the Edmund Burke Foundation, was held under the banner of \"National Conservatism, Preserving the Nation-State in Europe.\"\nFrench far-right figurehead Eric Zemmour was scheduled to criticize the EU's new migrant and asylum rules but was turned away by police. Suella Braverman, who served as U.K. home secretary for just over a month in 2022 before being fired, railed for 27 minutes against the European Court of Human Rights.\nPoliticians and former leaders from Spain, Poland and the Netherlands were also on the agenda. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was due to speak on Wednesday.\n\"I guess they couldn't take free speech any longer,\" Orban posted on the social media platform X. \"The last time they wanted to silence me with the police was when the Communists set them on me in '88. We didn't give up then and we will not give up this time either!\"\nSpeakers summoned the grand ideas of figures like the Pope, Homer, Dostoyevsky, Leo Strauss, Tocqueville and Gramsci. English was the common language, spattered with classical Latin. Modern liberal democracy was likened to a form of \"neo-Marxist authoritarianism.\"\nMostly though, those who could speak before the gathering was shut down for the day focused on their \"enemies\" among the mainstream political parties.\n\"We have to know our enemies are in panic and they show it every day,\" said EU lawmaker Hermann Tertsch, from Spain's far-right Vox party. \"The enemy knows their time is running out.\"\nAs Brussels police warned that the conference's time was limited, too, Edmund Burke Foundation Chairman Yoram Hazony invited participants to stay as long as they dared.\n\"The new democracy works in mysterious ways.

Chip Roy, R-Texas, wrote on X after the meeting imploded.\nHe's one of three Republican foreign aid hawks on the House Rules Committee, which is the final barrier before a piece of legislation hits the House floor.\nIt comes as conservative rebels in the House GOP conference criticize the speaker's decision not to link border security measures to his $95 billion foreign aid plan.\nJohnson told lawmakers on Wednesday that the House would consider separate foreign aid bills on Ukraine, Israel, the Indo-Pacific and a fourth bill including various foreign policy provisions. If passed, they would be sent to the Senate in a combined package.\nTo appease Republicans concerned about not using it as an opportunity to crack down on the border crisis, he also unveiled a separate bill similar to H.R.2, the comprehensive immigration and border enforcement bill House Republicans passed last year but which the Democrat-controlled Senate refused to take up. He said that bill would go through procedural hurdles parallel to the foreign aid bills, rather than alongside them.\nIn a remarkable moment toward the end of the meeting, Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., the top Democrat on the committee, acknowledged that the bill has no support from Democrats and likely no future in Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's Senate. He also pointed out that the three conservative rebels on the panel would likely vote against the bill as well \u2013 meaning it would not even survive their committee.\n\"We've been here. We've done this already. We know what the Senate is going to do. And my three colleagues, who I know have been expressing some discontent about what's going on here, I mean, maybe we can end this hearing. I mean, I think if the three of you vote 'no' on this rule, we're done,\" McGovern said.\nHe pointed out that Roy called it a \"watered-down, dangerous cover vote\" and asked him, along with Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., if they planned to vote in favor of advancing the bill.\nMassie and Roy would not say, with Roy adding, \"I think I'm pretty well publicly not in favor of what's going here.\" Norman said he would oppose the bill.\nThe hearing soon recessed without a conclusion.\nForeign aid and aid to Ukraine, specifically, have proven to be politically fraught topics for Johnson as he navigates a historically slim House majority and new threats from fellow Republicans to trigger a vote on his ouster.\nJohnson has argued that tying U.S. border measures to foreign aid, especially Ukraine, would kill its chances of passing .\"We want the border to be part of every single thing we do here,\" he told reporters on Thursday morning, adding, \"We don't have the votes. If you put Ukraine in any package, you can't also do the border because I lose Republican votes on that rule.

The House erupted in cheers as the gavel came down.\nHouse lawmakers are in session on a rare Saturday working to pass Johnson's foreign aid plan, which also includes aid bills for Israel and the Indo-Pacific, as well as a bill with other national security measures.\nThe close margins within the GOP alone show what a divisive topic Ukraine funding has become for the right.\nA growing number of fiscal conservatives have been skeptical about the U.S.'s continued financial involvement with Ukraine, while others have raised questions about corruption within Kyiv's government.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's proposal to strip all funding related to Ukraine from the Ukraine funding bill predictably failed Saturday in a 71 to 351 vote.\nMore traditional Republicans and national security hawks warn that Ukraine's victory is critical to preventing a wider conflict between NATO and Russia, warning that its President Vladimir Putin is rapidly forming a second \"axis of evil\" with Iran and China.\nJohnson, who like his conservative colleagues was skeptical of Ukraine aid before becoming speaker, gave a sober warning earlier this week. \"I really do believe the intel and the briefings that we've gotten that I believe [Chinese President Xi Jinpimg] and Vladimir Putin and Iran really are an axis of evil. And I think they're in coordination on this. I think that Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed. I think he might go to the Balkans next. I think he might have a showdown with Poland or one of our NATO allies,\" he told reporters. \"To put it bluntly, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,\" he said.\nBut his support for foreign aid, particularly Ukraine, is also threatening to cut short his tenure as House speaker. Greene filed a resolution for a House-wide vote to oust Johnson, known as a motion to vacate, last month in protest of his work with Democrats on government spending and foreign aid.\nTwo more House Republicans \u2014 Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., formally backed her resolution this week.\n\"[R]ather than spending the resources to secure our southern border and combating the invasion of 11 million illegals and despite repeated promises there would be no additional money going to Ukraine without first securing our border, the United States House of Representatives, under the direction of the Speaker, is on the verge of sending another $61 billion to further draw America into an endless and purposeless war in Ukraine,\" Gosar said in a statement on Friday. \"I have added my name in support of the motion to vacate the Speaker. Our border cannot be an afterthought.\"\nHouse leaders do not have to put Greene's resolution up for a vote unless she files it as \"privileged,\" at which point it's required that lawmakers act on it within two legislative days.\nSeveral Democrats, however, have indicated that they were open to helping save Johnson's job if he put the Ukraine aid bill on the House floor.\nThe bill with roughly $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific overwhelmingly passed 385 to 34 earlier on Saturday.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Elizabeth Elkind","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Johnson-Zelensky-Split-Photo-1.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.7776527,"_id":"0933d793d1346dabea2747ec8238e025"},{"title":"Mike Johnson: The wartime Speaker battling on multiple fronts","author":"Chad Pergram","published_date":"2024-04-18 23:50:54","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mike-johnson-wartime-speaker-battling-multiple-fronts","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Republicans again are considering ousting the Speaker of the House of Representatives; will the House GOP successfully remove Mike Johnson from his title?","summary":"\"I regard myself as a wartime Speaker,\" declared House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.\nOnly, we're not sure if Johnson was referring to the internecine war among Republicans over whether he should keep his job.\nMany members wear pocket squares with their suits. But not Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. He walks around with a self-made, diode \"debt clock\" tucked into the breast pocket of his jacket, tracking the skyrocketing debt. Massie's ascending fiscal chronometer may have read more $34 trillion dollars this week. But the only number which mattered on Capitol Hill Tuesday morning was \"two.\" As in two House members who were ready to oust Johnson from his job: Massie and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.\n\"The motion (to remove Johnson) will get called. And then he's going to lose more votes than (former House Speaker) Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., And I told him this in private, like two weeks ago,\" said Massie.\nA reporter asked Massie about what that meant, not having a leader \u2013 again \u2013 for the second time in less than a year.\n\"Some would say we'd be rudderless. But we have a rudder. We're steering everything toward (Senate Majority Leader) Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.,\" replied Massie. \"There has not been a change. I mean, if the country likes Chuck Schumer, then they should like what Speaker Johnson's accomplished in the House.\"\nThere's strength in numbers \u2013 even if the numbers are low. After all, it's about the math. It matters even more in a House which is currently split at 218 Republicans to 213 Democrats. That meager Republican majority shrivels to 217-213 after Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wisc., quits. Gallagher was supposed to leave Friday. But Fox is told that the Wisconsin Republican will at least hang around until Saturday as the House tries to approve the international aid supplemental package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan.\nGreene beamed at the support from Massie for her effort to remove Johnson.\n\"It was significant,\" said Greene of Massie's backing. \"It also lets people know this is a lot more serious than people realized.\"\nGreene echoed Massie, suggesting \"there'll be more\" Republicans who might vote to remove Johnson \"than were against Kevin McCarthy.\"\nHere's the problem for Greene. She doesn't have someone who could win a Speaker's vote on the floor. That's why the House burned 22 days on the calendar last October and thrashed through three nominees for Speaker before finally settling on Johnson. If the House approved a \"motion to vacate the chair\" (a \"MTV,\" which removes the Speaker), there's no telling how long it would take the get a successor this time.\n\"I don't think that the threat is really real at this point, just because you don't have an alternative,\" said Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., who was a top lieutenant to McCarthy. \"We saw what happened last fall when this all went down. There's not an alternative.\"\nGraves said a number of conservatives who were mad at Johnson \"don't think past step one. Which is why we have so many problems here right now.\"\nGraves asserted that the \"painful scars\" of the McCarthy debacle would be \"a major disincentive for folks who actually pull the trigger on a motion to vacate.\"\nThere was significant blowback from conservatives after Johnson announced a four-pronged approach to grapple with the Middle East. Especially after the House plotted a course for the week of 17 bills dealing either with Israel or Iran. Johnson tailored his pitch on the foreign aid measure. He planned one bill for Israel. One for Ukraine. One for Taiwan. The final bill would include a plan to repossess Russian assets and grant some of the assistance to Ukraine as a \"lease.\" That's an option endorsed by former President Trump. But the sweetener to the fourth bill would be a measure to curb the use of TikTok in the U.S.\nThe House would then package the four bills together and send them to the Senate.\n\"It's got a chance of passing,\" said Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, Tuesday morning. But if you \"MIRV\" them together and pretend that they were really separate votes, but at the end of the day, it has the effect of being one vote. I mean, that's all smoke and mirrors.\"\nDavidson characterized the TikTok provisions as \"camouflage for defending America.\"\n\"\u2018MIRV' them together?\"\n\"MIRV\" is a Capitol vocabulary term you're going to hear about as the House tries to advance the four separate foreign aid bills - and then blend them into one for efficiency purposes before sending the package to the Senate.\nIt's pronounced \"merve.\" A \"MIRV\" is a vestige of the Cold War and missile counts between the United States and Soviet Union. It stands for \"Multiple Independently-Targetable Re-Entry Vehicle.\" Each MIRV had multiple nuclear warheads or \"MIRVs\" attached. This was an issue of contention between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. Was a MIRV counted as one missile or four or five?\nThe idea is that the House would vote on each individual bill - then blend them together as one for the Senate.\nA parliamentary MIRV!\nHence why conservatives are upset about the plan by Johnson. It's four bills. Or is it one?\nJohnson defended the MIRV maneuver.\n\"I'm concerned that Israel might not pass through the Senate right now if it's not included in the package,\" said Johnson. \"If you separate them, then none of our priorities will be reflected, I'm afraid.\"\nConservatives have also implored Johnson to attach border security to the plan. But that might not be feasible.\n\"We don't have the votes. If you put Ukraine in any package, you can't also do the border because I lose Republican votes on that rule. My friends don't get it,\" replied Johnson.\n\"Are they still your friends?\" asked yours truly.\n\"They're all my friends,\" said Johnson. \"I love everybody in this building.\"\nJohnson made his decision on Monday against taking the streamlined Senate aid bill approved in February and instead traveled his own route. Initial information about the plan was scant.\n\"What are they doing over there?\" asked Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., of your reporter on Monday night as we both exited the Capitol.\nThe \"what\" was the House's approach on an international aid package. But \"over there\" referred to the U.S. House of Representatives, that hostile, untamed, political wilderness which lies beyond the boundaries of the Capitol Rotunda.\nThe Senate isn't exactly a peaceful place. But considering the contretemps in the House, the Senate is practically Xanadu.

DOI said closing the land off from resource development would help protect various wildlife species, including caribou.\nThe regulations, initially proposed in September, have since garnered more than 10,000 public comment letters, reflecting both support for and opposition to the rules.\nAnd according to the Office of Management and Budget filings reviewed by Fox News Digital, DOI officials have met with several stakeholders.\nWhile the regulations have received support from Democrats and environmental groups, they have been blasted by the state of Alaska, Alaska's bipartisan congressional delegation, local leaders, Indigenous groups, energy industry associations and Republican lawmakers.\n\"Joe Biden is doing everything he can to attack American energy,\" Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said during a press conference late Thursday. \"They're going to prohibit oil production in, of all places, the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. That's like saying no more picnics in Yellowstone National Park.\"\nSen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, who organized the press conference, added in an interview with FOX Business on Thursday that locking up NPR-A lands would outsource oil and gas production to \"regimes that hate us\" like Russia, Venezuela and Iran.\nIn February, Sullivan, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, sent a letter to the White House, urging it to consider the perspectives of Native Alaskans, many of whom support oil and gas development in the NPR-A.\n\"While we obviously recognize the impacts of climate change on the Alaskan environment, the policy objectives of this administration do not negate congressional direction for the management of the Petroleum Reserve, nor do those objectives nullify the obligation to hear and consider the perspectives of the North Slope people that will be negatively impacted by this proposed rule,\" several Native Alaskan leaders wrote in a comment letter to DOI.\nOverall, NPR-A spans 23 million acres of public land in northern Alaska. It was first established as a petroleum reserve for the U.S. Navy in 1923 before it was transferred in 1976 to DOI under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act.\nDOI didn't respond to a request for comment.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Thomas Catenacci","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/biden-anwr.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.6854644,"_id":"582acec0240c8f00b6d788bd700910d4"},{"title":"Key piece of UK government's plan to send migrants to Rwanda expected to become law","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-15 12:53:46","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/key-piece-uk-governments-plan-send-migrants-rwanda-expected-law","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The British government is pushing forward with legislation to implement a controversial plan to send asylum-seekers to Rwanda, despite legal challenges.","summary":"A key plank in the British government's plan to send some asylum-seekers on a one-way trip to Rwanda is expected to become law this week, but opponents plan new legal challenges that could keep deportation flights grounded.\nA bill aimed at overcoming a U.K. Supreme Court block on sending migrants to Rwanda is expected to pass Parliament this week after the government overcomes efforts to water it down in the House of Lords.\nThe Rwanda plan is key to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak 's pledge to \"stop the boats\" bringing unauthorized migrants to the U.K., and Sunak has repeatedly said the long-delayed first flights will take off by June.\nIt has been two years since Britain and Rwanda signed a deal that would see migrants who cross the English Channel in small boats sent to the East African country, where they would remain permanently.

For decades, human rights groups and governments have documented alleged repression of dissent by Rwanda's government both inside the country and abroad, as well as serious restrictions on internet freedom, assembly and expression.\nIn response to the ruling, Britain and Rwanda signed a treaty pledging to strengthen protections for migrants.

The Lords' resistance underlines the strength of opposition in the upper house, where the governing Conservative Party does not have a majority.\nThe bill is still overwhelmingly likely to become law, but the latest move delays its passage, likely until next week.\nThe legislation will pave the way for deportation flights to take off \u2013 though opponents plan new legal challenges that could keep them grounded.\nThe Rwanda plan is key to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak 's pledge to \"stop the boats\" bringing unauthorized migrants to the U.K. across the English Channel, and Sunak has repeatedly said the first flights will take off in the spring.\nHome Office Minister Michael Tomlinson told lawmakers on Wednesday that the law is needed because \"we simply cannot stand by and allow people smugglers to control who enters our country and to see more lives being lost at sea.\"\n\"We have an obligation to the public and to those who are being exploited by criminal gangs to stop this vile trade and to protect our borders,\" he said.\nIt has already been two years since Britain and Rwanda signed a deal that would see migrants who cross the English Channel in small boats sent to the East African country, where they would remain permanently. The plan has been challenged in the courts, and no one has yet been sent to Rwanda under an agreement that has cost the U.K. at least 370 million pounds ($470 million).\nSunak's government says the plan will deter people from making dangerous journeys across one of the world's busiest shipping lanes and break the business model of people-smuggling gangs. Human rights groups and other critics say it is unworkable and unethical to send migrants to a country 4,000 miles (6,400 miles) away that they don't want to live in.\nThe Safety of Rwanda Bill is designed to overcome a ban on sending migrants to Rwanda imposed by the U.K. Supreme Court, which ruled in November that the East African country is not a safe destination for asylum-seekers because there is a risk they could be returned to the conflict-wracked home countries they'd fled.\nIn response, Britain and Rwanda signed a treaty pledging to strengthen protections for migrants.

Members of the Lords repeatedly inserted amendments to water down the legislation, including by exempting Afghans who worked with British forces from deportation.\nThe Commons rejected them all, but the Lords has repeatedly restored the changes.\nThe government has refused to accept any amendments. A spokesman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Wednesday: \"We're not considering concessions.\"\nBritain's main opposition parties oppose the legislation.

The 2024 version is a mix of woke and political correctness and at war with useful scientific discoveries like plastics.","summary":"\"Planet vs Plastics\" is the theme of Earth Day this year. Why? Because, according to the event's organizers, \"plastics are a danger to humanity and all living creatures, disrupting the balance of life on Earth.\" Therefore, \"EARTHDAY.ORG is unwavering in our commitment to end plastics for the sake of human and planetary health, demanding a 60% reduction in the production of ALL plastics by 2040.\"\nThat sort of hyperbolic condemnation is typical of many recent Earth Days. The reality is that Earthlings and plastics must coexist. In many ways, plastics improve our quality of life. They have revolutionized medicine with life-saving devices, made space travel possible, lightened cars and planes (conserving fuel and lowering air pollution), and made all manner of consumer goods less expensive.\nIt is true that their convenience and low cost have spawned a throw-away culture that has a dark side: Single-use plastics currently account for about 40% of the plastic produced every year. That percentage could and should be reduced, but the absolutism of the Earth Day organizers illustrates what is wrong with today's environmental movement.\nThe first Earth Day celebration, a nationwide environmental teach-in held in 1970, was the brainchild of Democratic Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, who was interested in environmental issues.\nHe recruited Pete McCloskey, a conservation-minded liberal Republican California congressman, to serve as his co-chair. In the spirit of the time, it was a touchy-feely, consciousness-raising New Age experience, and most activities were organized at the grassroots level.\nSadly, today's Earth Day shares much with the current zeitgeist: It reeks of wokeness, political correctness and virtue signaling. It has devolved into an occasion for environmental activists to prophesy apocalypse, dish anti-technology dirt and allow passion and zeal to trump reality.\nA generation ago, the mantra was simple and broadly accepted: \"reduce, re-use and recycle.\" However, we hasten to note, as John Tierney highlighted in his classic New York Times Magazine piece, \"Recycling is Garbage,\" recycling isn't always beneficial.\nInstead of setting up a false dichotomy of \"Planet vs. Plastics,\" environmental activists would do well to redirect their zeal and predictions of catastrophe to imagining what we can do to protect the planet. A little innovation can go a long way toward protecting our environment.\nYet, unfortunately, many of those stumping for Earth Day on April 22 this year will oppose environment-friendly advances in science and technology. Consider these several examples:\nWe are now scratching the surface for ingenious ways to remediate contaminated soil by using plants with the ability to remove toxins such as heavy metals from soil. A comprehensive review of the progress and promise of this technique, known as phytoremediation, states that, \"Plant abilities to uptake, translocate, and transform heavy metals, as well as to limit their toxicity, may be significantly enhanced via genetic engineering.\"\nHowever, most prominent environmental groups oppose genetic engineering and would rather soil a promising technology than abandon a deeply held ideological position.\nSimilarly, some green groups opposed one of the most innovative efforts to address allegations of climate change caused by animal agriculture \u2013 the Impossible Burger, an ingredient of which is a plant-sourced protein, leghemoglobin.\nThe protein contains heme, also present in animal meat, and is partly responsible for the taste, texture and appearance of bloody-good meat. As Business Insider noted, \"a handful of environmental activists have also taken issue with the burger. But their issue with the burger isn't heme \u2014 it's the fact that the Impossible Burger is made using genetically engineered ingredients, or GMOs. Those concerns largely take the shape of the old and unsubstantiated claim that GMOs cause everything from autism to cancer, despite the scientific consensus that they are safe.\"\nA pervasive Earth Day meta-message will be disdain for the capitalist system that drives the innovation needed for effective environmental protection and conservation. (It's no coincidence that low-income countries tend to be the most polluted.)\n\"Education\" features prominently in Earth Day activities, as in, \"Fifty four years ago, the first Earth Day started an environmental revolution. Now, we are igniting an education revolution to save the planet. EARTHDAY.ORG passionately envisions a world where every student ... is embraced by a rich education weaving together climate and environmental understanding, coupled with a strong civic engagement component.\"\nWell, education can take many forms. For a previous Earth Day, seventh graders at a tony private school near San Francisco were given an unusual Earth Day assignment: Make a list of environmental projects that could be accomplished with Bill Gates's fortune.\nThis approach to environmental awareness fits in well with the progressive worldview that the right to private property is subsidiary to undertakings that enlightened thinkers deem worthwhile.\nAnd how interesting that the resources made \"available\" for the students' thought experiment were not, say, the aggregate net worth of the members of Congress but the wealth of one of the nation's most successful and most innovative entrepreneurs.\nAnother Earth Day assignment for those same students was to read Rachel Carson's best-selling 1962 book, \"Silent Spring,\" an emotionally charged but deeply flawed excoriation of the widespread spraying of chemical pesticides to control insects.\nAs described by Roger Meiners and Andy Morriss in their scholarly yet eminently readable 2012 analysis, \"Silent Spring at 50: Reflections on an Environmental Classic,\" Carson exploited her reputation as a well-known nature writer to advocate and legitimatize \"positions linked to a darker tradition in American environmental thinking: neo-Malthusian population control and anti-technology efforts.\"\nCarson's proselytizing and advocacy led to the virtual banning of DDT and restrictions on other chemical pesticides even though \"Silent Spring\" was replete with gross misrepresentations and atrocious scholarship.\nHer observations about DDT were meticulously rebutted point by point by J. Gordon Edwards, a professor of entomology at San Jose State University, a longtime member of the Sierra Club and the Audubon Society, and a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences.\nIn his stunning 1992 essay, \"The Lies of Rachel Carson,\" Edwards demolished her arguments and assertions and called attention to critical omissions, faulty assumptions, and outright fabrications.\nMeiners and Morriss concluded correctly that the influence of \"Silent Spring\" \"encourages some of the most destructive strains within environmentalism: alarmism, technophobia, failure to consider the costs and benefits of alternatives, and the discounting of human well-being around the world.\" Sounds a lot like the agenda of Earth Day 2024.\nHenry Miller, a physician and molecular biologist, is the Glenn Swogger Distinguished Fellow at the American Council on Science and Health.

A fourth bill includes national security priorities like the House's recently passed crackdown on TikTok's ownership as well as the REPO Act, which would liquidate seized Russian assets and give that funding to Ukraine.\nDemocrats had to help bail the GOP-led proposals on Thursday night in the face of conservative opposition. The Rules Committee, the final barrier before legislation traditionally gets a House-wide vote, spent all day considering the bills before advancing their \"rules\" package in a 9-3 vote.\nIt's highly unusual for Democrats, or any opposition party, to cross the aisle on a Rules Committee vote as well as a House-wide rule vote. But it underscores the urgency that lawmakers on both sides feel about sending aid to foreign allies.\nThe three conservatives on the panel \u2014 Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. \u2014 all voted against the measure; an equally unusual move that's become common in the 118th Congress, where members of the House Freedom Caucus and their allies have wielded outsized influence in Republicans' thin majority by blocking procedural hurdles such as this.Democrats' support will be critical for the rule vote and potentially even final passage of the bills.\nJohnson has faced furious pushback from the right flank of his conference over most of his plan, particularly loaning $60 billion to Ukraine, which has become a politically fraught topic for much of the GOP.\nThose same foreign aid hawks have objected to some of the Israel funding being aimed at humanitarian aid in Gaza, though its inclusion was critical to winning Democratic support. In a victory for Republicans, however, it prevents any of the Israel-Gaza funding from going toward the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), a Palestinian refugee agency alleged to have ties to Hamas.\nConservative rebels also decried House GOP leaders' decision to combine the four bills into one before sending it to the Senate, arguing it amounted to the same $95 billion foreign aid package the Democrat-majority chamber passed earlier this year and which House Republicans oppose. Johnson has argued that packaging them together for the Senate would prevent them from neglecting the Israel bill at a time when the issue has divided the Democratic Party.\nEarlier this week Massie threatened he'd move to oust Johnson from the speakership if he did not step aside after having the House vote on his foreign aid plans. One GOP lawmaker who was present at the closed-door meeting where it happened told Fox News Digital on Tuesday that Johnson challenged him to do so.\nMassie is now signed onto Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to vacate resolution, which if deemed \"privileged\" by Greene would force the House to begin voting on Johnson's potential ouster within two legislative days.\nSome discussion over whether to raise the threshold needed to call a motion to vacate \u2014 currently just one member can call for it \u2014 ended with Johnson backing off of the controversial move after it enraged GOP rebels and spurred new ouster threats.\nMajority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., suggested to reporters earlier that a wide swath of rank-and-file Republicans supported the idea; but Johnson denied having such conversations earlier on Thursday when asked by Fox News Digital.\n\"Recently, many members have encouraged me to endorse a new rule to raise this threshold. While I understand the importance of that idea, any rule change requires a majority of the full House, which we do not have. We will continue to govern under the existing rules,\" Johnson said on Thursday evening.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"science","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Elizabeth Elkind","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Johnson_Ukraine_v1.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.4966846,"_id":"417b63a2ad0cbcf3cb6481857e3e78a0"},{"title":"USC should let its valedictorian speak or be honest about why it isn't","author":"David Marcus","published_date":"2024-04-19 09:00:38","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/usc-let-valedictorian-speak-honest","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Leaders at USC have rescinded an invitation to this year's valedictorian, who is anti-Israel, to speak at commencement. They cite possible 'threats' but the decision rings hollow.","summary":"Reasonable people can disagree about whether Asna Tabassum, who has expressed the view that the state of Israel should be destroyed, ought to be the University of Southern California's duly appointed commencement speaker.\nThere are prominent conservative voices such as Mary Katherine Ham, David Harsanyi, and Guy Benson, firm supporters of the Jewish state of Israel all, who say let her speak, in part because sunlight is the best disinfectant for ignorance or hate.\nI agree with them.\nBut there are others who say calling for Israel's demise is just as disqualifying as the unrepentant use of a racial slur, and I can certainly understand that perspective as well.\nBut what we should all agree on, what is utterly obvious and staring us in the face, is that USC's explanation as to why they canceled the valedictorian's speech is a sack of disingenuous dunnage. And worse, it all but scapegoats Jews.\nHere was the school's pathetic explanation, \"The intensity of feelings, fueled by both social media and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, has grown to include many voices outside of USC and has escalated to the point of creating substantial risks relating to security and disruption at commencement.\"\nIt is absolutely true that leftists have a long track record of causing mayhem when speakers on campus say things they don't like, it is also true that more recently anti Israel protesters have done the same.\nBut what we do not have is any record of pro-Israel entities or individuals acting in such violent or destructive manners. Put simply, the threat USC is describing does not exist.\nNo Muslim students have had to hide in a library as protestors accost them as happened to Jewish students at Cooper Union, no roving bands of pro Israel activists are shutting down bridges, burning flags or chanting \"death to America,\" or death to anything.\nIf the speaker were pro-Israel there might be a legitimate threat, but there is no threat here, which is exactly why USC won't specifically define it.\nSo what is the real reason for the cancellation? There are several plausible possibilities.\nMaybe the president of USC didn't want to be dragged before Congress for promoting antisemitism, maybe there were concerns that the speech could offend attendees, or even worse, large donors to the institution.\nBut If USC believes that Tabassum's statements and ideology are not disqualifying then they have a responsibility to protect her free speech, on the other hand, if they do, or if they fear harm to the reputation or bottom line of the school then they have a responsibility to say that too.\nIn other words, if you're canceling the speech because of hateful statements then say so, don't blame imaginary violent Jews.\nThis cop out from USC is especially cowardly and damning because Tabassum's virulent anti-Israel rhetoric, far from being rare or obscure, is mirrored by members of Congress.\nJust this week, 43 Democrats and Republican Thomas Masssie voted against condemning the phrase \"From the River to the Sea,\" which can only mean the destruction of Israel and its total replacement by a Muslim Palestinian State.\nSome of these members, such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Katie Porter were directly asked by Fox News if they condemned the chant \"Death to America,\" or the burning of American flags and they declined to answer.\nObviously, the left wishes to excuse and even normalize this kind of dangerous, anti-American rhetoric, and that is exactly what USC is doing with its lies about why Tasabbum won't be taking to a lectern.\nJust like AOC and Porter the university is refusing to comment when presented with the question of whether calling for the destruction of Israel is a disqualifying statement for a commencement speaker.\nThere is a long history of antisemitism being swept under the rug across the globe, it is an uncomfortable issue that people and institutions find ways to ignore.\nThat approach doesn't generally end well.\nWhether calling for the destruction of Israel is an antisemitic statement that should bar a person from an honor such as valedictorian is a reasonable argument, in fact, just the kind of debate that colleges and universities are meant to foster.\nInstead, USC has simply decided to punt on the question, leaving the completely false impression that Tabassum has been canceled by threats from conservatives or Zionists.\nFor my part, I say, let her give the speech, but what is more important is for the University of Southern California to explain exactly why that isn't happening.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David Marcus","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/USC-valedictorian.png","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.4922867,"_id":"5ec87ac5d9e440ab88243748db148d89"},{"title":"Rep.

They pointed to examples of Bank of America shuttering the accounts belonging to Christian groups and leaders, and joining a net-zero climate alliance, in addition to its poor viewpoint diversity rating.\n\"Americans should never have to worry that their personal financial decisions will be weaponized against them,\" Kentucky State Auditor Allison Ball said in a statement. \"This practice has become all too common, and banks must urgently course correct to uphold their fiduciary duty and safeguard the constitutional freedoms of Americans.\"\nShe blasted executives at financial institutions for taking advantage \"of the divided political climate to engage in politicized de-banking.\"\nIn one example highlighted by Ball and the other 14 officials, in April 2023, Bank of America shut down the bank account belonging to Indigenous Advance Ministries, a Christian charitable organization that assists at-risk children, prisoners and sex trafficking victims in Uganda. The bank further closed the accounts of a Memphis, Tenn., church that donated to that group.\nBank of America explained the action was taken because of the group's \"business type\" and that its activities exceeded the \"bank's risk tolerance.\" After repeated requests for clarification from Indigenous Advance Ministries, Bank of America claimed the accounts were closed because a business affiliated with the group engaged in debt collection, The Christian Post newspaper reported.\nAccording to the letter, in a similar action last year, Bank of America closed the account of Timothy Two Project International, which trains pastors in more than 65 countries. The bank reportedly informed Timothy Two Project International that it was \"operating a business type we have chosen not to service.\"\nAnd three years prior, Bank of America reportedly froze the accounts of Christian author and preacher Lance Wallnau for allegedly laundering money. It then unfroze his account after asking him \"invasive\" questions about his activities, the state officers wrote.\nThe letter stated that Bank of America's actions strongly suggest that \"systemic drivers of religious and political bias may be at work within the company as a whole. The bank, though, pushed back on those accusations.\n\"Given the large number of non-profits we serve that are affiliated with religious organizations, it's absurd to think religious beliefs are a factor in any account closing decision,\" Bank of America spokesperson Bill Halldin told Fox News Digital. \"Very simply, they are not.\"\nThe state financial officers also said Bank of America's membership in the so-called Net-Zero Banking Alliance, a global group that coordinates actions taken by banks to push a green energy transition, may facilitate de-banking. They noted that commitments made by Bank of America through its membership could greatly harm farmers in their states since it will lead to higher prices.\nAnd the letter pointed to Bank of America's low ranking on the Viewpoint Diversity Score Business Index, a benchmark measuring corporate respect for free speech and freedom of religion. The index found that Bank of America partners with left-wing groups like the Human Rights Campaign and the Center for American Progress when it comes to its gift-matching program, but leaves out faith-based groups, instead citing its support for \"homeless shelters, soup kitchens or other social service needs.\"\n\"This pattern of internal political and religious bias at Bank of America poses risks for public funds invested in the company as well as for the millions of individuals, businesses, and nonprofits who rely on its services,\" the letter to Moynihan stated. \"Bank of America's de-banking policies and practices improperly subordinate financial well-being to other factors and place the company's business interests at risk.\"\nThe letter concluded by asking Bank of America to take a number of good faith steps to address the concerns, including eliminating viewpoint discrimination and exiting the Net-Zero Banking Alliance.\n\"Financial institutions like Bank of America should not be allowed to restrict Americans' access to capital based solely on their political or religious views. SFOF will continue to work with our members to fight for financial sanity, free of political agendas,\" said State Financial Officers Foundation CEO Derek Kreifels.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Thomas Catenacci","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Bank-of-America-Mortgage.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.406818,"_id":"cee0c4dc8720621036a4c98271d8df57"},{"title":"House to vote on Johnson's foreign aid bills as GOP rebels' ouster threat looms","author":"Elizabeth Elkind","published_date":"2024-04-20 08:00:35","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-vote-johnsons-foreign-aid-bills-gop-rebels-ouster-threat-looms","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Speaker Mike Johnson is holding a rare Saturday vote for the House to try to advance a foreign aid and national security plan.","summary":"The House of Representatives is holding a rare Saturday vote to consider Speaker Mike Johnson's foreign aid plan, which has spurred calls for his ouster by a small group of GOP rebels.\nThree of the four bills fund Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific, totaling roughly $95 billion. A fourth bill includes national security priorities like the House's recently passed crackdown on TikTok's ownership, as well as the REPO Act, which would liquidate seized Russian assets and give that funding to Ukraine.\nEach is expected to receive a final vote sometime later this afternoon after lawmakers weigh amendments to all but the Israel bill, which House leaders decided must stay as is.\nAmong the amendments up for consideration is one by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., one of the House GOP's fiercest foreign aid skeptics, to strip all funds from the $60 billion Ukraine aid bill. It's not likely to pass, but it could get a significant amount of Republican support with a growing number of right-wing lawmakers opposed to the U.S.' involvement in Kyiv's war with Moscow.\nJohnson's handling of foreign aid and government spending spurred Greene to file a resolution calling for a vote to oust him from power, known as a motion to vacate the chair. Since revealing the details of his plan earlier this week, two more Republicans \u2014 Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. \u2014 have formally backed her effort.\nForeign aid has proven to be one of the most politically fraught fights Johnson has faced in his short tenure as speaker. As has been the case for most complicated issues, he's caught in a two-front battle between the Democrat-controlled Senate and White House, as well as outspoken conservatives in his own conference \u2014 namely the House Freedom Caucus and their allies.\nThe former group had been pressuring Johnson to take up the Senate's $95 billion supplemental aid package as one item, while the latter objected to foreign aid without spending offsets or border security measures.\nTo assuage GOP border concerns, Johnson is also holding a vote on a border security and immigration bill on Saturday \u2014 though it's unlikely to pass. Republican rebels blasted that move as a meaningless display, arguing that Johnson knows it has no chance in the Senate if not paired with foreign aid.\nThe foreign aid proposal passed a key procedural hurdle on Friday morning known as a rule vote, which now allows for debate and passage of the final bills.\nRule votes have traditionally fallen across party lines, with lawmakers on both sides following their leadership to allow for a vote on legislation even if they don't agree with its contents.\nHowever, members of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus have deliberately sunk GOP rule votes several times this Congress in protest of House Republican leadership's decisions.\nIn a stunning turn of events not often seen in modern U.S. politics, Democrats leaped to the foreign aid proposal's rescue and provided more than enough support to counter the 55 Republican defections \u2014 something that further irked Johnson's right-wing critics.\nNot only did Democrats vote for the rule, they outnumbered Republicans in support. It got 165 Democratic \"yes\" votes compared to 151 Republicans, for a total 316 to 94 margin.\n\"We agreed with the objective,\" Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., the former House majority leader, told reporters when asked about the overwhelming Democratic support. \"I think Democrats are going to continue to save the country. And when the speaker proposes something that we think is good for the country, we're not going to arbitrarily oppose it because it happens to be a Republican proposal.\"\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good, R-Va., accused Johnson of dividing the Republican Party but distanced himself from calls for his ouster.\n\"Funding Ukraine divides the country. It divides Republicans tremendously, divides the Republican conference, as evidenced by the vote today, just a moment ago. And so that should not be our starting point, to do what the Democrats want to do,\" Good said.\nRep. Jake Ellzey, R-Texas, one of the House's GOP national security hawks, said he was \"absolutely\" relieved that the bills advanced on Friday but that he was \"confident\" they would.\nUnlike his colleagues who were criticizing the show of bipartisanship, Ellzey said he was glad to see Democrats buck norms to support the rule.\n\"I think that, this is a good thing for us now, for our national security, and the assurance of our friends and allies across the world, that we are a steady partner, and it's bipartisan. Americans come together in times like this,\" he said.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Elizabeth Elkind","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/johnson-foreign-aid.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.3830028,"_id":"305b6eee4e4b455d0c37d8ef7d809e8a"},{"title":"UK lawmakers to vote on bill that would outlaw tobacco sale, create 'first smoke-free generation'","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-16 14:29:54","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-lawmakers-vote-bill-outlaw-tobacco-sale-create-first-smoke-free-generation","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"United Kingdom lawmakers will debate and vote on a bill that would phase out the legal sale of tobacco entirely by raising the age of sale by one year each year.","summary":"British lawmakers will on Tuesday debate and vote on the government's plans to introduce a landmark smoking ban that aims to stop young people from ever smoking.\nThe bill, a key policy announced by Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak last year, will make it illegal to sell tobacco products to anyone born after January 1, 2009.

The president said Americans can now apply to become the first members of the American Climate Corps and get paid to fight climate change by learning how to install solar panels, fight wildfires, rebuild wetlands and winterize homes, among other things.\nBiden said he has seen the \"devastating toll\" of climate change firsthand, saying since becoming president, he has flown over all the major fires and \"thousands upon thousands of acres\" that were burned flat by wildfires.\nHe also said he met with families whose homes were \"wiped off the map\" by hurricanes, floods and storms last year, adding that last year Earth faced the hottest day on record. In just two years, he said, natural disasters and extreme weather in America caused $270 billion in damages.\n\"But folks, despite the overwhelming devastation in red and blue states, there's still those who deny climate is in crisis,\" Biden told the crowd. \"My MAGA Republican friends don't seem to think it's a crisis\u2026 they actually want to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, which actually provides the funding for a vast majority of these projects and roll back\u2026 protections for clean air and clean water.\n\"I'm not going to go into it now, but I'm not making it up. It's real. Just listen to what they say,\" the president said. \"Anyone in or out of government who willfully denies the impacts of climate change is condemning the American people to a very dangerous future, and the world, I might add. They want to take us backwards, sideline our workers, let China and others lead the race for clean energy. I'm determined, absolutely determined we move forward.\"\nBefore the president walked up to the podium, several lawmakers spoke about Earth Day, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who thanked Biden for launching the American Climate Corps.\nOcasio-Cortez also spoke about Franklin D. Roosevelt inspiring the idea through a bill he put forward in 1933, to create the original Civilian Conservation Corps. Ocasio-Cortez called Roosevelt's bill revolutionary in the wake of the Great Depression, as it put over 3 million young people to work, created 711 new state parks and improved the nation's public lands.\nAt the beginning of Biden's speech, he acknowledged comments made by Bernie Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez.\n\"Bernie, you're the best. And Representative Ocasio-Cortez of New York. You know, I learned a long time ago, listen to that lady. Listen to that lady. We're going to talk more about another part of the world, too, really quickly,\" Biden said in a cryptic way.\nDespite what looked to be foreshadowing before his speech, the president never spoke of other parts of the world, except for when he mentioned the U.S. rejoining the Paris Agreement.\nIn his closing statement, Biden spoke about Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps, which Biden said, \"was referenced by the Congress lady,\" failing to refer to Ocasio-Cortez by name.\nBiden quoted Roosevelt, saying, \"more important than the material gains, will be the moral and spiritual value of such work.\"\n\"He always put it in context and went beyond just what the immediate need was,\" Biden said. \"I'd say the same holds true for what we're doing here today as a moral imperative, and I've never been more optimistic about America's future.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Greg Wehner","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/Biden-1.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.2100306,"_id":"eb28f47707f286435f2fb53e5fb6c600"},{"title":"UK climate activist won't be charged for sign telling jurors to vote their conscience","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-22 20:53:57","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-climate-activist-wont-charged-sign-telling-jurors-vote-conscience","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"A judge has ruled that Trudi Warner cannot be charged with contempt of court for holding up a sign outside of a courtroom that reminded jurors of their right to acquit defendants.","summary":"A climate protester who could have faced up to two years in prison for holding a sign outside a courthouse reminding jurors of their right to acquit defendants cannot be charged with contempt of court, a London judge ruled Monday.\nTrudi Warner had been arrested last March and accused of \"deliberately targeting\" jurors before a trial of climate activists from the group Insulate Britain.\nShe held a sign in front of Inner London Crown Court that said: \"Jurors you have an absolute right to acquit a defendant according to your conscience.\"\nHigh Court Justice Pushpinder Saini said her act was not a crime because jurors can reach a verdict based on their conscience and Warner had not interfered with jurors.\n\"It is fanciful to suggest that Ms. Warner's behavior falls into this category of contempt,\" Saini said. \"At no point did Ms. Warner assault, threaten, block, accost or impede anyone's access to the court.\"\nThe ruling comes as hundreds of environmental activists have been arrested for peaceful demonstrations in Europe and the U.K., where tough new laws restrict the right to protest.\nWhile the Conservative British government says the laws prevent extremist activists from hurting the economy and disrupting daily life, critics say civil rights are being eroded without enough scrutiny from lawmakers or protection by the courts.\nHundreds of people followed Warner's lead and held similar signs outside courthouses to protest what they said undermined the foundations of trial by jury.

He's now created \"Lord of the Flies.\" Ask anybody inside our conference; they actually know it.\nTensions flared in the House of Representatives on Thursday when a group of conservatives confronted Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., over his foreign aid plan, leading to another Republican trading barbs with the group of rebels.\nA group of lawmakers that included Reps. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.; Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.; Tim Burchett, R-Tenn.; and others could be seen huddled with Johnson on the House floor after morning votes.\nThe discussion appeared to be interrupted a short while later when Rep.

Help could be on the horizon as the Supreme Court hears a case that might let cities fight back.","summary":"The once-idyllic streets of our nation's most beautiful cities have been transformed into scenes straight out of a dystopian novel, where tents crowd sidewalks and the stench of decay (and human waste) hangs thick in the air. You can blame this grim reality on radical left politicians and activists, who seized the chaos and uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic to push through their disastrous policies on homelessness.\nThankfully, there's a glimmer of hope on the horizon, sparked by former President Donald Trump and an Oregon town that most of you have never heard of.\nThe catastrophic failures fueling a drug-addicted homeless crisis stem from progressives' blind allegiance to two deceptively named and profoundly damaging strategies: \"harm reduction\" and \"housing first.\"\nIn San Francisco, these policies have created conditions so dire that even its criminally liberal citizens revolted, voting to impose drug testing for welfare recipients \u2014 a clear repudiation of the city's \"progressive\" label, which earned a scolding by the left-wing San Francisco Chronicle declaring the city probably can't use the label any longer. But that's a good thing: progressive policies should be synonymous with failure.\nWhat did \"progressivism\" really bring to San Francisco? A staggering and tragic record of fatal drug overdoses \u2014 752 in 2023 alone, an all-time record. The streets became a permanent gallery of human misery and waste (unless Chinese diplomats are visiting, of course). The city's commercial heart, Union Square, began 2024 with the highest rate of office vacancies in the nation. In just the last month, two more large retailers announced closures -- North Face and Zara.\nThe situation is no better in downtown Seattle, another supposedly progressive \"utopia\" (where I live) that's still reeling under the grip of homeless drug addicts who have claimed the streets as their own. The exodus of major retailers, most recently Lululemon, fleeing what was once a bustling, high-end mall, speaks volumes.\nA 2023 poll by the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce found that 68% of voters now avoid downtown more than before the explosion of homelessness and crime. If there are no visitors, there are no customers. The crisis even scared away Amazon, announcing last week it's resuming construction in nearby business-friendly Bellevue -- all while the Seattle tech giant's footprint shrinks.\nRecently, a man was randomly stabbed in the head while walking his dog in a notoriously dangerous downtown Seattle corner \u2014 a place where the air is so saturated with the smell of urine that it clings to the back of your throat. Yet, progressive leaders and the radical activists they enable pretend the city is thriving, shaming anyone who says otherwise.\nThe radical left disguises harm reduction as an \"evidence-based\" solution to substance abuse. Yet, in practice, it does little more than enable addicts, providing them with clean drug paraphernalia like fentanyl pipes, clean needles and \"booty-bumping\" kits for taking drugs under the guise of \"reducing harm.\"\nHousing first, meanwhile, offers \"permanent supportive housing\" to the homeless, followed by a claim to address their underlying issues through on-site, wraparound services. In reality, these places often turn into drug dens with virtually no conditions on use. If you're homeless because of drug addiction, you continue to use \u2014 and likely die \u2014 in what inevitably become taxpayer-funded drug havens.\nI dissect these flawed approaches in my book, \"What's Killing America: Inside the Radical Left's Tragic Destruction of Our Cities,\" a critique the left-wing media won't give you. Their refusal to challenge these feelgood yet destructive policies only serves to push a partisan agenda under the radar. My book can help you save your community from the progressive policy creep.\nWith these strategies in mind, the radical left opposes sweeping homeless encampments, calling that cruel and inhumane, while cruelly using the homeless as pawns in their demands for free housing. They even fight to keep squatters and delinquent renters in properties they have no right to, driven by an ideology that rejects private property rights and repeats a lazy bumper sticker talking point: \"housing is a human right.\"\nIn the Seattle area, homelessness has worsened following drug decriminalization, yet instead of admitting failures, activist-politicians have poured tens of millions into converting hotels into permanent supportive housing.\nIn one recent move, the city council in nearby Redmond colluded with county officials to secretly transfer property without public notice. Their message to residents fed up with the encampments? Shut up and let officials spend millions more for subsidized housing and only then will tents be cleared.\nWhile the homeless remain outdoors waiting for \"free\" housing, diseases spread. Recently in downtown Portland, a Shigella outbreak \u2014 a highly contagious bacteria spread through fecal matter \u2014 was traced to the homeless. Seattle faced a Hepatitis A scare from homeless in January. And last August, in Los Angeles, homeless encampments contributed to a significant rise in flea-borne typhus.\nBut the progressive reign of despair may soon come to an end if conservative United States Supreme Court justices come to the rescue after hearing arguments for The City of Grants Pass Oregon v. Johnson on April 22. It might return a tool that can be part of a broader strategy to address homelessness more effectively.\nThe radical left disguises harm reduction as an \"evidence-based\" solution to substance abuse. Yet, in practice, it does little more than enable addicts, providing them with clean drug paraphernalia like fentanyl pipes, clean needles and \"booty-bumping\" kits for taking drugs under the guise of \"reducing harm.\"\nThis legal battle about whether cities can enforce public camping bans may be a defining moment for homelessness policy. A decision in favor of Grants Pass could empower cities across the nation to reclaim their public spaces, reducing crime and disease spread, while providing a truly meaningful pathway out of homelessness.\nMore importantly, it could signal the beginning of the end for the unchecked spread of radical left policies that have been long shielded behind claims of good intentions.\nIf the Supreme Court, fortified by Trump-appointed conservatives, sides with pragmatic policies, we might just see cities finally be released from the grip of progressive overreach, returning to an approach where compassion and regulation can actually coexist and assist the homeless. This isn't just about cleaning up the streets \u2014 it's about wrestling control back from the radical left.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jason Rantz","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/03/Oakland-California-Homeless-Closed-Businesses_06.jpg","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.9372377,"_id":"68a9bbb0a99d3f2f4aac28ef640051f0"},{"title":"Bill Maher: 'We've passed the Rubicon with 'Death to America' chants on US soil'","author":"Yael Halon","published_date":"2024-04-16 23:59:03","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-weve-passed-rubicon-death-to-america-chants-us-soil","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"\"Real Time\" host Bill Maher responded to chants of \"Death to America\" during a Dearborn, Michigan rally of anti-Israel protesters.","summary":"\"Real Time\" host Bill Maher said it's time to draw the line when it comes to chants of \"Death to America\" on American soil.\nOn Friday's \"Overtime\" segment on YouTube, Maher addressed the protesters in Dearborn, Michigan, who shouted \"Death to America\" and \"Death to Israel\" during an International Al-Quds Day rally earlier this month.\n\"Can I talk about American propaganda?

In California, voters can cast ballots in person and also by returning ballots to drop boxes or by mail.\nFox News Digital has reached out to Bonta's office and the Orange County Registrar of Voters for additional comment.\nHuntington Beach, dubbed \"Surf City USA\" and known for its scenic shoreline, has a history of sparring with state officials over the measures it can take under its city charter on topics ranging from immigration to housing.\nWhile Democrats outnumber Republicans in Orange County, the GOP is dominant in Huntington Beach with nearly 54,000 registered voters versus 41,000 Democrats, county data shows.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Bradford Betz","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Huntington-Beach.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.855774,"_id":"6fd440d9744ab4d209529666d5d75369"},{"title":"EU commission president urges unity as Finland closes Russian borders over migration surge","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-19 15:27:51","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/eu-commission-president-urges-unity-finland-closes-russian-borders-migration-surge","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has voiced the significance of Finland's decision to close its border with Russia due to a surge in migrants.","summary":"The head of the European Union's executive branch said Friday that Finland's decision to close its border crossings with Russia over a surge in migrants is a security matter for the whole 27-member bloc to consider.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen made the remarks during a trip to the frontier, visiting a part of the border located in southeastern Finland.\n\"We all know how (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and his allies instrumentalize migrants to test our defenses and to try to destabilize us,\" von der Leyen told officials. \"Now Putin is focusing on Finland, and this is no doubt in response to your firm support of Ukraine and your accession to NATO.\"\nOn April 4, Finland decided to extend the closure of its border crossing points with Russia \"until further notice\" because of what the government says is a high risk of organized migration being orchestrated by Moscow. Finland's government has closed eight of its nine checkpoints with Russia. The only one that remains open is dedicated to rail travel only, and cargo trains mainly run through it.\nFinland shares an 832-mile land border with Russia, running mostly through thick forests in the south, and to the rugged landscape in the Arctic north.\n\"This is not just about the security of Finland, but it is about the security of the European Union. We are in this together,\" von der Leyen said after visiting the border in Lappeenranta with Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo. \"We should be more Finnish when it comes to security.\"\nVon der Leyen and Orpo flew in a Finnish helicopter over the landscape of forests and towns on the border.\nIn a statement issued after the visit, Orpo said that \"the spring's warmer weather increases the risk of Russia helping people illegally try to get to Finland via the land border \u2026 outside the border crossing points.\"\nVon der Leyen is campaigning as a member of the conservative European People's Party bloc for a second term in office as head of the EU's powerful executive branch. Security is a top EPP theme ahead of the June 6-9 European Parliament elections.\nMost of the migrants hail from the Middle East and Africa. The vast majority of them have sought asylum in Finland, a member of the EU and NATO with a population of 5.6 million.\nFinland joined NATO in April 2023, ending decades of neutrality after the country's defeat by the Soviet Union in World War II.

The governing center-right Croatian Democratic Union, or HDZ, won the most votes but not enough to rule alone. Although it finished second, Milanovi\u0107's Social Democratic Party is also trying to muster a coalition in the 151-member parliament.\nMilanovi\u0107 made a surprise announcement that he would run for prime minister just hours after calling the election for April 17. The Constitutional Court warned him last month that he had to resign first, a warning that he ignored.\n\"The Constitutional Court established that with his statements and behavior the president ... brought himself in the position that he can neither be the prime minister-designate of the future government nor the future prime minister,\" the ruling said.\nMilanovic and his SDP party said the Constitutional Court has no right to counter the will of the people. They claimed that the future parliament can choose whomever they want as the next prime minister.\n\"The elections are over and the people's will will determine, and not the judges,\" Milanovic said at a press conference.\nSDP President Pedja Grbin described the ruling as \"shameful.\" He urged other opposition groups to help form a new government without HDZ.\nMilanovi\u0107 has insisted that he had not violated Croatia's top law by openly supporting the opposition during the campaign and saying he would become the new prime minister. He has accused the current Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovi\u0107 of widespread corruption.\nThe showdown between Croatia's two top politicians has dominated the vote, which is also seen as a test ahead of elections for the European parliament in June.\nMilanovi\u0107 is critical of EU policies over the war in Ukraine. If he were to form a government, that could potentially open space for stronger pro-Russia influence in the country, akin to Hungary and Slovakia.\nOfficials results of Wednesday's vote has shown that Plenkovi\u0107's HDZ won 61 parliamentary seats while the SDP got 42. The far-right Homeland Movement has emerged as a potential kingmaker with 14 seats.\nThe Constitutional Court said that Milanovi\u0107 could not now become prime minister even if he resigned as president to take up the new post. Some opposition politicians alleged the court is controlled by the ruling conservatives.\nFormer Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said the court's decisions and announcements ran against the constitution itself. Leftist politician Dalija Ore\u0161kovi\u0107 described Croatia's top court as \"one of a number of captured institutions.\"\nThe HDZ has largely held office since Croatia gained independence.

Bill Lee's plans to expand school vouchers and allow families to access public funds for private schooling has come to an end as legislative leaders do not reach an agreement.","summary":"Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee conceded defeat Monday in his push to enact universal school vouchers this year, acknowledging there was \"not a pathway for the bill\" after months of Republican infighting.\n\"I am extremely disappointed for the families who will have to wait yet another year for the freedom to choose the right education for their child, especially when there is broad agreement that now is the time to bring universal school choice to Tennessee,\" Lee, a Republican, said in a statement.\nLee first unveiled his plans last fall to allow families to access public money for private schooling, regardless of income. At the time, he was surrounded by national school choice advocates, the state's top Republican legislative leaders and even Arkansas GOP Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who had signed into law a voucher proposal just that year and used the event to tout that a conservative education revolution was happening around the country.\nYet despite the initial support, Lee's vision was always considered ambitious in a state where rural GOP lawmakers have remained skeptical of losing limited public school money in their own districts.\nFor months, Tennessee's GOP-dominant General Assembly has been deeply divided on the details surrounding how such a statewide plan would work. Differing versions advanced in the House and Senate but ultimately stalled as legislative leaders worked behind the scenes to come up with a deal.\nBut as of last week, the tone inside the Tennessee Capitol had noticeably shifted as lawmakers entered into the final weeks of session and hopes of a deal began to plummet. As of last week, no one would publicly declare the bill dead, instead saying that ultimately that call had to come from Lee.\nLee has since promised to renew the school voucher talks next session, though it's unclear how much more successful that attempt will fare, as some members won't be returning next year because of retirement and others are facing opponents in this year's election.\nNotably, both House and Senate budget writers still set aside $144 million for the voucher expansion in their spending proposals. That means that money will sit idly for nearly a year until school voucher talks can resume next January.\n\"Many initiatives need multiple years, or even multiple general assemblies, before they are ripe for passage,\" said Senate Speaker Randy McNally. \"This is not an end, but a new beginning. Conversations will continue over the summer and fall, and we will revisit the issue next session with renewed purpose.\"\nLee first asked lawmakers to consider expanding school vouchers back in 2019, when the plan was to allow parents of students in certain low-income districts with three or more schools ranked in the bottom 10% to receive $7,300 from a government-authorized account to pay for approved expenses.\nAfter much editing, Republicans just barely passed a program that applied only to Democratic strongholds in Davidson and Shelby counties, which encompass Nashville and Memphis.

I mean, not a fast shift, things could tip over the other way a little bit quicker, but you see people kind of malfunctioning because things are changing.\"\n\"Doctor Who\" is a BBC funded show that traces all the way back to the 1960s, with multiple actors playing different incarnations of the time-traveling character known as \"the Doctor\" as he goes on various sci-fi adventures. The latest iteration of this longstanding franchise has been widely criticized for catering to identity politics.\nAfter rejecting the pressure of aspiring to \"Black excellence\" to feel loved, he said, \"What the hell? There's so much [W]hite mediocrity that gets celebrated, and Black people, we have to be absolutely flawless to get half of [that] anyway. So, I'm slowly training myself out of that and being like, \u2018No sh--. You deserve love just for existing.'\"\nGatwa was asked how he feels about life in the U.K. where there is a \"pushback against individuality, against gender diversity, against trans identities\" at the moment.\nThe UK has made headlines for multiple cultural debates over transgender identity. The English government has recently stopped prescribing puberty blockers to children, and the Prime Minister of the U.K. overall, Rishi Sunak, sided with author J.K. Rowling's right to criticize transgender ideology without being punished by the government.\n\"Everything trickles down from the top, and when you see politicians openly attacking marginalised communities, when you see our politicians openly attacking trans people, it makes it OK for everyone else,\" Gatwa argued. \"And it is scary to see that we've got to a point where it is fine to attack vulnerable people because that's essentially what's happening. People who are the most vulnerable, the most disenfranchised, most disconnected from everyone else are being told that they are the threats.\"\nHe went on to say, \"It's sick because it's a hiding away of your own ineptitude. You're going to put the blame on immigrants, Black and Brown people, trans people, queer people, to hide the fact that you are not doing anything for people? It's easier to just create discord amongst people. It's divide and conquer, isn't it?\"\nGatwa also used what some have argued is a slur against conservative, working-class White people, referring to them as \"gamons,\" saying, \"[W]e've got to keep pushing for more.

Walters said in a statement Monday. \"In an era of worldwide political upheaval, she has remained a steadfast defender of freedom and an effective advocate for American security and prosperity. We are honored to have her join the Hudson team.\"\nDuring her White House bid, Haley advocated a muscular U.S. foreign policy to deal with global hot spots such as the war between Russia and Ukraine and the fighting between Israel and Hamas, often offering a stark contrast with Trump's American First agenda of keeping the nation out of international entanglements.\nHaley traded fire over America's overseas role with rival Vivek Ramanswamy, an advocate of Trump's America First philosophy, during the GOP presidential primary debates.\n\"When our policymakers fail to call out our enemies or acknowledge the importance of our alliances, the world is less safe. That is why Hudson's work is so critical,\" Haley said. \"They believe the American people should have the facts and policymakers should have the solutions to support a secure, free, and prosperous future. I look forward to partnering with them to defend the principles that make America the greatest country in the world.\"\nHaley, who received the Hudson Institute's global leadership award in 2018 during her tenure as U.N. ambassador, will serve as the institute's Walter P. Stern Chair. According to the Hudson Institute, the position was created four years ago to commemorate a former chair \"who was instrumental in making Hudson one of Washington's most respected research organizations.\"\nThe institute emphasized that \"it is fitting that Nikki has taken on this title\" because \"she is a courageous and insightful policymaker.\"\nHaley launched her presidential campaign in February of last year, becoming the first major candidate to challenge Trump, who had announced his candidacy three months earlier. Additionally, she was the final rival to Trump, battling the former president in a two-candidate showdown from the New Hampshire primary in late January through Super Tuesday in early March.\nHaley announced that she was suspending her White House campaign on March 6, the day Trump swept 14 of 15 GOP nominating contests on Super Tuesday.\nHowever, Haley made it clear when she exited the Republican presidential nomination race that she intends to keep speaking out.\n\"While I will no longer be a candidate, I will not stop using my voice for the things I believe in,\" she emphasized as she spoke at her presidential campaign headquarters on Daniel Island, in her hometown of Charleston.\nTo date, Haley has declined to endorse Trump.\n\"It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that,\" Haley said last month, as she pointed to those who supported her during her White House run.\n\"This is now his time for choosing,\" she emphasized.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Paul Steinhauser","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-2028795724.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.49441,"_id":"04601ddac62fcd8f945546ad55cf2d77"},{"title":"MSNBC host praises 'DEI' officials prosecuting Trump: 'Wonderfully poetic'","author":"Hanna Panreck","published_date":"2024-04-16 20:03:09","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-host-praises-deis-prosecuting-trump-wonderfully-poetic","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"MSNBC's Joy Reid applauded the \"DEIs\" prosecuting Donald Trump on Monday, calling it \"wonderfully poetic\" as his first criminal trial in New York is underway.","summary":"MSNBC host Joy Reid praised some of the Black public officials prosecuting former President Trump, saying Monday \"my DEIs are bringing it home.\"\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was the first person to criminally prosecute Trump, and it was \"wonderfully poetic,\" Reid said.

But he was. And he came out and graduated, and he's prosecuting you, Donald.\"\n\"And a Black woman is doing that same exact thing in Georgia and a Black woman forced you to pay a $175 million fine,\" Reid continued, referring to District Attorney Fani Willis in Georgia and New York Attorney General Letitia James. \"Donald Trump is being held to account by the very multicultural, multiracial democracy that he's trying to dismantle \u2026 It says something good about our country that we're still capable of having that happen. Go, DEI. My DEIs are bringing it home.\"\nTrump was indicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records in March 2023, following a yearslong investigation by Bragg. The charges against Trump are related to hush money payments made to Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges, and the trial for the hush money case began Monday.\nThe former president was also indicted in Georgia, as part of Willis' investigation, on multiple charges related to election interference. In James' case, Trump recently posted a $175 million bond \u2014 lowered from $454 million \u2014 to prevent the state from seizing his assets while he appeals a judge's ruling that he fraudulently inflated his wealth for financial gain.\nReid said Trump was \"outdoing actual mobsters\" by criticizing the judge on the hush money case, noting one of Trump's lawyers had mobster Benny Eggs as a client.\n\"So Donald Trump is at this point outdoing actual mobsters in his attacks on the judge's family, the daughter,\" she said. \"He knows he will never spend a day, a second, a moment in prison.\"\nTrump returned to the Manhattan courthouse for day two of his hush money payments trial on Tuesday, where Bragg called on Judge Juan Merchan to hold Trump in contempt of court.\nBragg filed the motion minutes after the second day of Trump's trial got underway in Manhattan. It relates to Merchan's gag order against Trump, which prohibits the former president from speaking publicly about prosecutors, witnesses, court officials and their families.\nIn his motion, Bragg argued Trump has \"willfully violated this Court's order by publishing several social media posts attacking two known witnesses\u2014 Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels.\"\nAn Associated Press/NORC poll found that just 35% of Americans believe Trump committed a crime in the case. Trump told reporters this week that payments he made to Cohen were merely a \"legal expense.\" Cohen has said Trump reimbursed him for a $130,000 payment to keep Daniels quiet about an alleged affair they had, which Trump denies.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Hanna Panreck","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/JOY-REID-TRUMP-DEI.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.4923787,"_id":"06ed191c9ff74aad062876912d8817ed"},{"title":"'Nothing more backwards' than US funding Ukraine border security but not our own, conservatives say","author":"Greg Wehner","published_date":"2024-04-20 23:31:19","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nothing-more-backwards-than-us-funding-ukraine-border-security-but-not-our-own-conservatives-say","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The House of Representatives, on Saturday, passed a $60 billion foreign aid package for Ukraine, though some Republicans take issue the bill did not address southern border.","summary":"A $60 billion aid package for Ukraine which provides about $300 million to bolster the country's border struck a nerve with several lawmakers increasingly frustrated with the administration's handling of the crisis at the U.S. southern border.\nOn Saturday, the House of Representatives approved spending $60 billion to help Ukraine build up its defense against Russia's invasion, with a 311 to 112 vote. Republicans were not unanimous in their approval of the measure, with 101 voting in favor of the aid package, and 112 voting against it.\nSpeaker Johnson, R-La., unveiled the foreign aid plan earlier in the week, though a lack of any border security measures prompted allies to be wary of letting the bills move forward.\nA meeting to advance the package ended Wednesday night without a vote because it provided funding for Ukraine and not U.S. border security.\nOne of those Republican foreign aid hawks on the House Rules Committee was Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas. The House Rules Committee is the final barrier before a piece of legislation moves to the House floor for a vote.\nAfter the vote, Roy and others turned to the social media platform X to express their discontent of the foreign aid package.\n\"Today, I voted no... These bills were brought forward under a contrived process to achieve a pre-determined outcome \u2014 a $100 billion, unpaid-for foreign aid package while failing to secure the border,\" Roy wrote. \"For months, House Republicans \u2014 specifically, Speaker Mike Johnson \u2014 have been unequivocal that we would not send billions in additional aid to Ukraine without securing our own border first. This package represents a complete reversal of a position that previously unified the Republican conference, despite the clear & present danger the southern border represents to U.S. national security.\"\nRoy said he supported Ukraine's effort to defeat Putin, but added he cannot support sending $60 billion in additional funding without the U.S. having a \"clear mission\" and \"policy changes necessary\" to secure its own border.\nLike Roy, Rep. Ben Cline, R-Va., voted against the package because of \"urgent problems\" happening in the U.S.\n\"States and cities across our nation are grappling with the consequences of Biden's border crisis, inflation continues to squeeze the budgets of every American household, and our country is over $34 trillion in debt,\" Cline said. \"As I continue fighting for the people of Virginia's Sixth District, I urge my colleagues in Congress and the Biden Administration to listen to the American people and put their concerns first.\"\nHouse Freedom Caucus member Rep. Eric Burlison also weighed in.\n\"Republicans have control of the House, and we should be leveraging it to secure our border, unfortunately the Uniparty is working to secure the borders of Ukraine instead of our own border,\" he said. \"This has to stop, we should be putting AMERICA FIRST!\"\nBurlison, Cline, and Roy could not be reached for comment on the matter.\nAccording to U.S. Customs and Border Protection sources, there were over 7,000 encounters at the southern border on Friday, following two days in a row of about 6,500. During prior weeks, the number of encounters had been in the 4,000s and 5,000s.\n\"We are beyond disappointed that the House would give aid to secure the borders of foreign countries but gave nothing to allow the Border Patrol to secure the safety of the United States,\" Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, told Fox News. \"There's nothing more backwards.

If enacted, it would allow up to $6,375 in spending per child.","summary":"Missouri lawmakers on Thursday passed a bill to expand private school scholarships statewide, an effort made possible by extensive compromises including a commitment to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more on public schools.\nThe GOP-led House voted with a bare-minimum margin of 82-69 to send the measure to Republican Gov. Mike Parson. If signed, it would offer up to $6,375 per child for expenses including tuition, textbooks, tutoring, transportation, extracurriculars and summer school.\nThe bill's passage is a victory for advocates who have struggled for years to expand access to charter schools, virtual schools and private schools in Missouri. Worries about taking away resources from traditional kindergarten-12th grade public schools have been bipartisan.\nThe heart of the legislation is the expansion of Missouri Empowerment Scholarships Accounts, which low-income families can draw from. The money will come from private donors, who in return get tax credits.\n\"This is a victory for parents who want more control over their children's education and for students who will now have more avenues to achieve their full potential,\" Republican Rep. Phil Christofanelli said in a statement.\nThe current scholarship program limits recipients to residents of the state's largest cities and to families who make less than 200% of the federal poverty level, which works out to $62,400 a year for a family of four.\nThe bill passed Thursday would raise the cap to 300%, or $93,600 for a family of four. Public school students who need extra help through individualized education plans would get some additional scholarship money under the new law.\nThe legislation increases the cap on tax credits for the private donations from $50 million to $75 million per year, to help pay for a possible influx of students.\nTo gain support from lawmakers focused on helping traditional public schools, senators included money to raise minimum teacher salaries to $40,000 a year and adjusted the state's formula for funding public schools, a change expected to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars more to public education over time.\nSeveral House Democrats cautioned that the state might not have enough revenue in future years to provide the massive influx in funding to public schools that the bill commits to.\n\"While the voucher expansion is essentially guaranteed, the promises to public schools depend on additional funding the state isn't expected to have and future lawmakers aren't required to provide,\" House Democratic Minority Leader Crystal Quade said in a statement.\nAnother provision would allow charter schools in Boone County, where Senate President Pro Tem Caleb Rowden lives. The bill also would require public votes to approve a school district's switch to four-day school weeks and incentivize schools that maintain five-day weeks.\nThis issue supporters call \"school choice\" has divided lawmakers beyond typical Republican-Democrat lines in Missouri.\nGOP legislators from rural districts have opposed allowing charter schools in their areas for years, fearing they could draw students away from traditional public schools seen as the backbone of their communities. Some Democrats, meanwhile, want students in underperforming urban schools to have more options.\nAnd some conservatives lobbied against more regulations for homeschoolers and private schools. One activist handed out \"dog poop\" brownies before the vote, suggesting that unwanted provisions could ruin what might otherwise be a nice treat.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-629564017.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.482375,"_id":"9f2b4db388f4bfd61f169f23a8513b21"},{"title":"Croatia votes in a bitter showdown of a parliamentary election between president and prime minister","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-17 12:50:23","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/croatia-votes-bitter-showdown-parliamentary-election-between-president-prime-minister","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Croatia's parliamentary election is viewed by some as the culmination of a rivalry between the country's pro-Western prime minister and pro-Russian president.","summary":"Croatia is voting Wednesday in a parliamentary election after a campaign that centered on a bitter rivalry between the president and prime minister of the country.\nThe ballot pits the ruling conservative Croatian Democratic Union, or HDZ, led by Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic, against an alliance of centrist and left-wing parties informally led by populist President Zoran Milanovic and his Social Democratic Party, or SDP.\nThe election is being held as Croatia, a European Union and NATO member, struggles with the highest inflation rate in the eurozone, a labor shortage, illegal migration and reports of widespread corruption.\nAt stake in the race for Croatia's 151-seat parliament isn't just the Adriatic Sea country's future domestic policies, but also the EU's unity as it grapples with the instability from Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nIf the HDZ stays in power, the country would continue on a pro-Western course in supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Success for SDP could put it on track for victory in the European Parliament election in June and the presidential election in December. It would shake the HDZ's long dominance of politics and potentially open space for stronger pro-Russia influence in the country, akin to Hungary and Slovakia.\nPolls close Wednesday evening and official results are expected Thursday.\nMost pre-election polls predicted a HDZ victory, but without enough seats to rule alone. The left-wing opposition may benefit from discontent with the country's high inflation and the general economic malaise in most EU member states. Smaller parties on the right and the left could be key to both the HDZ and SDP in their quest for power.\nThe HDZ has largely held office since Croatia gained independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991. The Balkan nation became the newest member of the European Union in 2013, and joined Europe's passport-free travel area and the eurozone last year.\nThe president holds a largely ceremonial role in Croatia, while the prime minister exerts most of the political power. The election has played out as the final episode in the long-running rivalry between Plenkovic and Milanovic.\nAfter Milanovic scheduled the election and announced his surprise bid for prime minister, he began campaigning on behalf of the SDP. But Croatia's constitutional court judges stepped in, saying the move was unconstitutional.\nThe judges said that the president can't run for prime minister, take part in the parliamentary election or campaign in favor of any party, unless he first resigns.\nMilanovic refused, openly ignoring the top court and continuing to campaign in favor of the left-wing alliance.\n\"I hope that the citizens will vote for a Croatia that respects the constitution and the constitutional order, for a Croatia that belongs to the Western and transatlantic democratic circle,\" Plenkovic said after he cast his ballot, appearing to reference Milanovic and his alleged breach of the constitution by actively taking part in the election process.\nMilanovic said that with his statement, Plenkovic breached electoral silence on the vote day.\n\"You have a prime minister who even today did not resist breaking that symbolic election silence, going wild and talking nonsense about violating the constitution, respecting the law,\" the president said.\nMilanovic also accused Plenkovic and the HDZ of rampant corruption and \"massive theft\" of state funds, referring to past and present scandals, some of which had ended up in the courts.\nPlenkovic, who has led the government since 2016, repeatedly denied the accusations, saying Milanovic as the prime minister would shift the country away from the EU and closer to Russia.\nMilanovic has often voiced a pro-Russia stance during the war in Ukraine, opposing the training of Ukrainian soldiers in Croatia as well as sending weapons to Ukraine because, in his view, it only prolongs the war. He also criticized the EU's policies over Ukraine.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Croatia-Election.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.3873167,"_id":"24c7e83ee3a38d018f03dac28620083b"},{"title":"Biden's Title IX rules are a victory for powerful teacher unions fueling Dem campaigns","author":"Thomas Catenacci","published_date":"2024-04-19 16:50:02","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bidens-title-ix-rules-are-a-victory-for-powerful-teacher-unions-fueling-dem-campaigns","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The Department of Education finalized a sweeping reversal of Trump-era Title IX reforms on Friday, a win for teachers unions that had advocated for such an action.","summary":"The Biden administration's actions finalizing revised Title IX regulations represent a victory for powerful teachers unions, which have fueled Democrats' 2024 election campaigns.\nOn Friday morning, the Department of Education finalized sweeping new Title IX rules that it said will \"strengthen vital protections\" from sex-based harassment and prevent discrimination based on gender identity. The regulations dismantle Trump-era actions that bolstered protections, but also prescribed a strict grievance process that ensures the accused are treated as innocent until proven guilty.\nThe nation's two largest teachers unions, the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association, have for months heavily advocated for the regulations to be finalized. During the current election cycle, the two unions have funneled millions of dollars to Democrat-aligned political action committees, but virtually nothing to Republicans, according to federal filings.\n\"Prior to the 2020 rule, there was progress on changing the culture of sexual violence on our education campuses, as well as improvements to student safety. But the Trump-DeVos rule quashed open discussion of sexual harassment and gender-based violence,\" AFT President Randi Weingarten wrote in a comment letter supporting the Biden administration's regulations.\nWeingarten added that the administration's rules \u2013 which are set to go into effect in August \u2013 would \"remove dangerous regulations put in place in 2020 and put us back on the path of honestly discussing the modern realities of equal access to education.\"\nIn a separate comment letter, NEA President Rebecca Pringle similarly praised the regulations and urged the Education Department to act expeditiously to finalize them.\n\"We commend the Department for this proposed rule, which restores crucial protections, creates uniform processes, and provides much-needed clarification and formalization of protections that further the broad mandate of Title IX to prohibit sex discrimination in education,\" Pringle wrote to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona and Assistant Secretary Catherine Lhamon.\nPringle's letter emphasized the importance of the regulations' expansion of Title IX protections to include transgender students. She said they would protect a transgender student who is \"discriminated against and shamed when told they cannot use the bathroom.\"\nAccording to NEA, the regulations would prohibit schools from excluding students from any educational activity because of transgender status; prohibit \"misgendering\" transgender students or teachers, force the use of a name selected by a transgender student or teacher, and require students to be allowed to use restrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity.\n\"The Department's clarification of Title IX protections moves us closer to making our schools places where we are all free to thrive and support one another for who we are and where students across race, background, and gender have the freedom to learn without fear or intimidation,\" Pringle continued.\nIn addition to the expanded protections for transgenders in schools under Title IX, the regulations would also undo sexual assault due process rules put in place by the Trump administration.\nColleges will no longer be required to hold live hearings to allow students to cross-examine one another through representatives. Instead, college officials will be able to interview students separately, allowing each student to suggest questions and get a recording of the responses.\nIn evaluating the parties' evidence, a school must use the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard of proof unless the school uses the clear and convincing evidence standard in all other comparable proceedings.\nDepartment of Education officials first proposed the regulations in 2022, but have delayed finalizing them to review the tidal wave of more than 240,000 public comments. The Trump-era regulations were finalized by then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in May 2020.\nCivil liberties, students' rights and conservative legal groups have called on the Biden administration to preserve the 2020 regulations.\nAFT and NEA didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Thomas Catenacci","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/Biden-Weingarten.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.385091,"_id":"bfe6a22ef254f1e2b09c07cee9491ced"},{"title":"Half of US states revolt against EPA crackdown on gas cars with major legal challenge","author":"Thomas Catenacci","published_date":"2024-04-18 16:06:18","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/25-states-hit-biden-admin-legal-challenge-climate-crackdown-gas-cars","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"FIRST ON FOX: A coalition of 25 states filed a federal legal challenge against the Biden administration on Thursday, arguing its crackdown on gas-powered cars is illegal.","summary":"FIRST ON FOX: A coalition of 25 state attorneys general filed a legal challenge Thursday against the Biden administration over recent environmental regulations targeting gas-powered car emissions and pushing electric vehicles.\nLed by Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, the coalition filed a challenge against the Environmental Protection Agency in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, asking the court to declare the new rules unlawful. According to the filing, the EPA regulations impose \"unworkable emissions standards\" on passenger cars and medium-duty vehicles.\n\"Conservative attorneys general are slamming the brakes on President Biden's radical green agenda that is using the weight of the federal government to force expensive EVs on families, workers and farmers,\" Coleman said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\"Even if Americans wanted to buy an electric car, we can't afford them amid historic inflation,\" he continued. \"We're taking President Biden's EPA to court to block this latest big-government mandate and protect the free market.\"\nIn a joint announcement with the White House last month, the EPA issued the regulations, which are the most aggressive multi-pollutant emission standards ever finalized. Those standards were officially published Thursday, opening the door to legal challenges and congressional resolutions.\nWhile the regulations target gas-powered vehicles, they are explicitly designed to push wider, nationwide adoption of EVs and, to a lesser extent, hybrid cars. President Biden said after the rules were finalized that they would help ensure the U.S. meets his goal of EVs accounting for 50% of all new car sales in 2030.\nUnder the standards, automakers will be forced to rapidly curb the emissions of greenhouse gases, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from new passenger cars, light trucks, and larger pickups and vans beginning in two years with model year 2027 vehicles. EPA said the rules will help \"tackle the climate crisis\" by reducing the transportation sector's carbon dioxide emissions.\nWhen the tailpipe emissions rules kick in, automakers will be compelled to increase production and sales of EVs, plug-in hybrids, traditional hybrids and fuel cell vehicles. Under one so-called \"low cost\" model, EPA said automakers would be forced to ensure 56% of light-duty car sales are battery electric and another 13% are hybrid by 2032.\n\"Kentucky is an agriculture state, and EVs aren't tough enough to keep up with our farmers,\" said Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell. \"We put a lot of miles on the Kentucky Department of Agriculture's vehicles to serve rural communities, and we can't stop on the side of the road to plug in. The Biden administration has it out for rural America, and I'm proud Kentucky is leading the fight to stop them.\"\nJoining Kentucky and West Virginia in the legal challenge filed Thursday are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming.\nEPA's regulations have been heavily criticized by state officials, Republican and Democratic lawmakers, agriculture industry groups like the National Corn Growers Association and energy associations, such as the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers and the American Petroleum Institute.\nIn 2023, 9.5% of new, light-duty vehicle sales were EVs, up from 7% in 2022 and 4.3% in 2021, according to data from the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that represents major automakers. At the same time, EVs remain more expensive than traditional, gas-powered cars.\nAnd the share of Americans who said they are considering an EV purchase has declined from 55% to 44% year-over-year, according to a Gallup poll conducted in March.\nCalls placed to the EPA seeking comment were not immediately returned.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Thomas Catenacci","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/10/biden-evs-2.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.385091,"_id":"9a4a9edf3f8f1390cbec360bad6da8fd"},{"title":"Plumbing problem at Glen Canyon Dam threatens water supply of Colorado River system","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-17 12:54:59","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/plumbing-problem-glen-canyon-dam-threatens-water-supply-colorado-river-system","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Plumbing issues at Glen Canyon Dam, which holds back the second-largest reservoir in the U.S., are causing concerns about future water delivery to southwestern states.","summary":"Plumbing problems at the dam holding back the second-largest reservoir in the U.S. are spurring concerns about future water delivery issues to southwestern states supplied by the Colorado River.\nFederal officials recently reported damage to four tubes known as \"river outlet works\" at Glen Canyon Dam on the Utah-Arizona border. The dam is responsible for generating hydropower and releasing water stored in Lake Powell downstream to California, Arizona, Nevada and eventually Mexico.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which operates the major dams in the Colorado River system, is evaluating issues related to Glen Canyon Dam when Lake Powell reaches low levels. Those issues include problems with the four tubes such as sedimentation and cavitation \u2014 when tiny air bubbles develop while water passes through plumbing. Cavitation can cause tears in metal and other mechanical damage.\nThe Colorado River provides water to seven U.S. states, nearly 30 Native American tribes and two states in Mexico. Years of overuse by farms and cities, and stubborn drought worsened by climate change has meant that much less water flows today through the 1,450-mile river than in previous decades.\nLake Mead and Lake Powell, which store water and are used for recreation and power generation, serve as barometers of the Colorado River's health. In recent years, they have fallen to historic lows then recovered somewhat thanks to above-average recent winter precipitation and water conservation.\nThe structural problems at Glen Canyon Dam, first reported by the Arizona Daily Star, could complicate how federal officials manage the river in years to come when hydrologists and others predict Lake Powell will fall below current levels. The damaged tubes sit below much larger ones known as penstocks that normally carry the reservoir's water. The smaller tubes that make up the \"river outlet works\" allow water releases at lower reservoir levels.\nLake Powell currently sits at about 32% capacity.\nBrenda Burman, general manager of the Central Arizona Project, a 336-mile canal system that delivers Colorado River water to Arizona's cities, raised the issue at a meeting last month related to the river.\n\"We received some difficult news from the Bureau of Reclamation,\" Burman said, adding that CAP would be working with Reclamation to investigate the problems in coming months.\nJB Hamby, chairman of the Colorado River Board of California, said the dam's design leaves open the possibility that huge amounts of water could be stranded in Lake Powell under low elevations.\nHe said an engineering solution would be the best way forward because other options could involve additional water cuts to states.\nDoug MacEachern, communications administrator at the Arizona Department of Water Resources, said his agency was working with Reclamation to see \"what, if any, technical fixes might exist.\"\nIf federal officials can't repair the tubes, MacEachern said his agency expected Reclamation to not place the burden of more water cuts solely on Arizona, California and Nevada, which make up the river's so-called Lower Basin. Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming form its Upper Basin.\nSeparately, states and tribes that rely on the Colorado River are working on a long-term deal to share the dwindling resource after current rules and guidelines governing how its water is divvied up expire in 2026.\nEnvironmental groups for years have cautioned that water levels at Lake Powell could reach a point where Glen Canyon dam can no longer be used for hydropower or release water downstream.\n\"What's at risk?\" said Kyle Roerink, executive director of environmental advocacy group Great Basin Water Network. \"The water supply for 25 million people and major agricultural producers.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Glen-Canyon-Dam.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.3838425,"_id":"e59caa8ce57bca4a3902d853ed2eb756"},{"title":"The troubling truth about our country's recycling programs","author":"Kurt Knutsson","published_date":"2024-04-22 10:00:21","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/tech/the-troubling-truth-about-our-countrys-recycling-programs","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Kurt 'CyberGuy\" Knutsson reveals how a Redditor exposed false recycling claims at their apartment, highlighting a report that only 21% of U.S. recyclables are processed.","summary":"Imagine diligently separating your recyclables, placing them into the green bin as instructed, and then discovering it's all for naught. That's the frustrating reality a Redditor faced, sparking a conversation on r/Apartmentliving about the disheartening state of recycling in their complex. The green dumpster was just a facade, and the company didn't even offer residential recycling. It begs the question: Is anyone else's complex out there lying about something so obvious?\nThis isn't an isolated incident. Across the nation, renters find themselves handcuffed by landlords who block eco-friendly practices like gardening or air-drying laundry. Yet, there's hope. In the U.S., 74 million people live under homeowners associations where there's room to navigate or even alter the rules for the betterment of the community.\nThe discourse on Reddit resonates with many who share similar struggles. One user lamented their building's failed recycling attempt due to contamination, and another mentioned the absence of recycling services altogether, leaving the responsibility on individuals to transport recyclables to centers.\nIn Washington, D.C., a report by The Recycling Partnership sheds light on the dire state of U.S. residential recycling. A mere 21% of recyclables actually get recycled. The report, \"State of Recycling: Present and Future of Residential Recycling in the U.S.,\" reveals the gap between current practices and the five pillars of an efficient recycling system. It's a call to action for policymakers, companies and communities to bridge these gaps.\nUnder-recycled materials: A staggering 76% of recyclables end up in the trash at home. Only 73% of households have recycling access, with a significant disparity between single-family (85%) and multifamily homes (37%). Participation is low, with only 43% of households recycling, and even then not to full potential.\nState-by-state disparities: Some states like Alabama and Mississippi recycle less than 10%, while others like California and New York exceed 30%. The report suggests that extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies could elevate recycling rates significantly.\nThe million-ton loss: Eleven states, including some with high recycling rates, lose over a million tons of recyclables each year. Local investment solutions are crucial for revamping the recycling infrastructure.\nThe Recycling Partnership's Chief System Optimization Officer, Cody Marshall, emphasizes the need for comprehensive action. Investing in access to recycling services and improving communication can lead to substantial progress. The report urges:\nPolicymakers: Adopt EPR to fund recycling improvements.\nCompanies: Design recyclable packaging and invest in closing the system's gaps.\nCommunity leaders: Use the report's data to enhance recycling efforts through education and engagement.\nThe report is an urgent call for action. Systemic change is a slow process, but the road map is clear. It's time for concerted efforts to ensure recycling fulfills its role in waste reduction and resource conservation.\nThe stories shared by individuals on platforms like Reddit aren't just tales of frustration; they're a rallying cry for change. From the deceptive green dumpsters to the stark disparities in recycling access, the issues are as real as they are widespread. But there's a silver lining \u2013 the collective voice of communities and the actionable insights from reports like The Recycling Partnership's are powerful catalysts for change. It's a reminder that every effort counts, and together, we can turn the tide on the recycling conundrum we find ourselves in.\nWhat changes do you think are necessary to make a real impact as far as recycling in this country?

There is no single definition of the event, but so far this year's blooms haven't been as vibrant or abundant as those that took over swaths of California last spring following drought-busting rains. This year, too, the state received ample winter rains.\nAfter especially wet winters, bursts of color may appear in the spring, drawing droves of visitors to California and other parts of the Southwest to glimpse the flowering fields and pose for pictures.\nHere are some key facts about the natural spectacle.\nScientists don't agree on any one definition. Across California and Arizona, there are stretches of desert that can quickly transform into dense fields of wildflowers, since seeds lie dormant in the soil and then germinate and blossom at around the same time.\nA recent study found that such widespread blooms, which have been visible by satellite imagery in some years, take place after seasons with greater than 30% average precipitation, said Naomi Fraga, director of conservation programs at the California Botanic Garden, east of Los Angeles.\nNo, according to Fraga. That's because there isn't a huge diversity in the flowers that have blossomed in places like California's Death Valley.\nThis year's blooms aren't as large or as dense as wildflowers in past years, she said.\n\"When I think of superblooms, I think of a bloom that is so extraordinary, that's a once in a lifetime event,\" Fraga said, adding that the wildflower display this year \"still makes a beautiful show.\"\nLast spring, early April visitors to Southern California's Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve were treated to dazzling orange displays of the state flower. But around the same time this year, the fields were absent of the orange blooms, with the reserve's officials posting that the window for an impressive show was becoming \"increasingly narrow.\"\nIn Death Valley, one of the driest places on earth, stretches of desert are dotted with gold thanks to sunflowers that emerged after an especially wet winter and spring.\nWhether that constitutes a superbloom is \"really in the eye of the beholder,\" said Evan Meyer, executive director of the California-based nonprofit Theodore Payne Foundation, which works to preserve California's native plants.\nApril is typically the peak month for spring wildflowers, but in high-elevation places they can continue to blossom later into the spring.\nSuperblooms generally refer to low-elevation desert regions, Fraga said.\n\"It's much more geographic than seasonal,\" Meyer said. \"Spring in the mountains hasn't started, and in the low desert, it's past its peak.\"\nWhen temperatures rise in the desert, the flowers can quickly dry out.\nExperts say it might be too soon to tell.\nClimate change is making precipitation patterns more erratic, but the effects on wildflowers could play out over decades or even centuries, Fraga said, since seeds stay dormant in the soil for long periods of time.\nSouthern California received heavy rain last summer, unlike its usually dry summers, which she said probably stimulated flowers to germinate out of season. Winter temperatures also were higher than average, so many of them were able to stay in bloom through the spring season.\n\"That made for a very unusual bloom,\" Fraga said.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/California-Superbloom.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.375426,"_id":"518ef019b24fb0af1377378229460587"},{"title":"Ohio judge temporarily blocks law banning sex-reassignment surgeries, hormone therapies for minors","author":"Brianna Herlihy","published_date":"2024-04-17 13:49:31","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ohio-judge-temporarily-blocks-law-banning-sex-reassignment-surgeries-hormone-therapies-minors","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"An Ohio judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked a impending law that would ban gender reassignment surgeries and certain hormone therapies for minors.","summary":"An Ohio judge temporarily blocked an impending law on Tuesday that would ban gender reassignment surgery and certain hormone therapy for minors.\nThe decision came weeks after the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) challenged the Saving Adolescents from Experimentation (SAFE) Act, or House Bill 68, on behalf of two transgender girls and their families, the Columbus Dispatch reported.\nThe measure prevents doctors from prescribing hormones, puberty blockers or gender reassignment surgery to patients under 18. It also bans transgender players from joining women's sports teams in high school and college.\nOhio Attorney General Dave Yost, in a statement following the decision, said, \"This is just the first page of the book\" and said he was \"confident\" the law would ultimately be upheld.\n\"We will fight vigorously to defend this properly enacted statute, which protects our children from irrevocable adult decisions,\" he said.\nHarper Seldin, staff attorney for the ACLU, praised the ruling, calling it \"a victory for transgender Ohioans and their families.\"\n\"Ohio's ban is an openly discriminatory breach of the rights of transgender youth and their parents alike and presents a real danger to the same young people it claims to protect,\" Selding said.\nIn Tuesday's decision, Franklin County Judge Michael Holbrook indicated that the law could be tossed out because of a single-subject violation, the Dispatch reported.\n\"It is not lost upon this Court that the General Assembly was unable to pass the (Saving Ohio Adolescents from Experimentation) portion of the Act separately, and it was only upon logrolling in the Saving Women's Sports provisions that it was able to pass,\" Holbrook wrote.\nHouse Bill 68 was set to go into effect on April 24 after a GOP-led state legislature overrode Gov. Mike DeWine's veto on the law.\nDeWine's opposition sparked outrage from conservatives, who blasted him as a \"coward\" for his decision.\n\"Were I to sign Substitute House Bill 68 or were Substitute House Bill 68 to become law, Ohio would be saying that the State, that the government, knows what is best medically for a child rather than the two people who love that child the most, the parents,\" DeWine said in his veto message.\nHe cited the \"profound\" consequences the bill could have on children struggling with gender dysphoria and said his decision boiled down to input from parents who believed their children's lives depended on the treatment they received.\n\"Ultimately, I believe this is about protecting human life. Many parents have told me that their child would not have survived, would be dead today if they had not received the treatment they received from one of Ohio's children's hospitals. I've also been told by those who are now grown adults that but for this care, they would have taken their life when they were teenagers,\" he said.\nAmong DeWine's criticizers was Chloe Cole, a detransitioner who is now one of the most outspoken activists against the practice.\nCole, who formerly took steps to complete a female-to-male transition and has since been among the most outspoken critics against gender reassignment health care for minors, claimed DeWine's veto came just days after she shared her story with him during a Zoom call.\n\"When I was describing every step of the treatment, and especially when I brought up how young I was during every step, having been 13 when my puberty was suppressed, when I was drawn to androgens, and that I was 15 when my breasts were surgically removed, he was visibly disturbed,\" she previously told Fox News Digital.\n\"Parents don't have a right to abuse their children.

Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., told Fox News Digital. \"So, you do it again, you're going to end up with the same results.\"\nThose GOP lawmakers are worried about repeating the three weeks of chaos that followed the ouster of ex-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., by a group of eight Republicans and all House Democrats. Most would not go so far as to say it could cost them the election in November, but they suggested it weakened the Republican position in the House while already dealing with just a razor-thin majority and a Democrat-controlled Senate and White House.\n\"The new speaker will have to play the same hand that this speaker is playing. The results are going to be the same,\" Gimenez said, adding that it \"could\" hurt the GOP in November.\nDuring a closed-door conference meeting on Tuesday morning, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., urged Johnson to step down or face a possible vote to vacate the speaker's chair. He's now signed onto a resolution introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., last month to oust Johnson over his actions on government spending and foreign aid.\nJohnson, for his part, told reporters he would not step down and called the threats \"absurd.\"\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus who ran for speaker after McCarthy's ouster, called vacating Johnson a \"bad idea.\"\n\"We don't need that. No way, no way. We don't. We don't want that. We shouldn't go through that again,\" Jordan told reporters.\nEven an ally of Greene and Massie, Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., said it was a \"mistake.\"\n\"Marjorie is my friend but she made a huge mistake there,\" Higgins said of Greene initiating the move. \"Mike is amazing man, a deeply principled Republican. And that's a very good starting point for a leader of our conference, and he was like thrust into an impossible job out of precarious moment with the slimmest majority in the history of Congress.\"\nMeanwhile Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good, R-Va., one of the eight Republicans who ousted McCarthy and who has been critical of Johnson for working with Democrats on critical legislation, suggested he had no appetite to follow the same path again right now.\n\"I don't have any comment on motion to vacate. You can ask the two members who are talking about doing that. I don't hear other members talking about doing that,\" Good told reporters. \"But I didn't go around cavalierly, flippantly throwing motion to vacate around.\"\nRep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., a leadership ally, called the three weeks Republicans spent without a speaker last year \"wasted time.\"\n\"I think it's an unwanted distraction,\" he said.\nAnd Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., who was close to McCarthy when he was speaker but has a noticeably more distant relationship with Johnson, said it was not in the House GOP's interest to oust his fellow Louisianan.\n\"I think we have a number of people here that, they don't think past step one, which is why we have so many problems here right now,\" he said of the vacate push.\nMassie said he would sign onto Greene's existing resolution to vacate Johnson. But unless they file it as a privileged motion, as was the case with McCarthy, there is nothing compelling House Republican leadership to hold a vote. If they do file it as privileged, however, the House will be forced to act on it within two legislative days.\nNeither Massie nor Greene were part of the eight Republicans to oust McCarthy in October, and criticized the people who did so.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Elizabeth Elkind","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/greene-massie-vacate.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.2823677,"_id":"15960eb59f7092adb51250b6f6202485"},{"title":"Biden takes heat over strange cannibal story: 'Like something out of a bad script'","author":"Alexander Hall","published_date":"2024-04-18 12:37:19","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-takes-heat-strange-cannibal-story-something-bad-script","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"President Biden told a shocking story about his uncle crashing in an area populated by cannibals, but commentators, the AP, and the military contradict his claims.","summary":"President Biden seemed to imply Wednesday that a relative of his was eaten by cannibals during World War II, but the tale quickly faced mockery and skepticism online.\nWhile in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Biden shared a story about his uncle, 2nd Lt. Ambrose J. Finnegan Jr., whom he called \"Bosie.\" \"He flew those single-engine planes as reconnaissance over war zones, and he got shot down in New Guinea. They never found the body because there used to be, there were a lot of cannibals, for real, in that part of New Guinea,\" he said.\nBiden had also told a version of the story earlier that day while visiting the missing-in-action war memorial in his hometown of Scranton claiming, \"He got shot down in an area where there were a lot of cannibals in New Guinea at the time. They never recovered [Finnegan's] body. But the government went back, when I went down there, and they checked and found some parts of the plane and the like.\"\nSources like the Associated Press said the details were incorrect, noting, \"The U.S. government's record of missing service members does not attribute Finnegan's death to hostile action or indicate cannibals were any factor.\"\nThe AP noted further that the Pentagon's Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said Biden's uncle had died on May 14, 1944, as a passenger on an Army Air Forces plane that was forced to ditch in the Pacific Ocean off New Guinea's northern coast. \"Both engines failed at low altitude, and the aircraft's nose hit the water hard,\" the agency stated. \"Three men failed to emerge from the sinking wreck and were lost in the crash.\"\nWhen reached for comment, White House spokesman Andrew Bates told Fox News Digital, \"President Biden is proud of his uncle's service in uniform, who lost his life when the military aircraft he was on crashed in the Pacific after taking off near New Guinea. The President highlighted his uncle's story as he made the case for honoring our \u2018sacred commitment\u2026to equip those we send to war and take care of them and their families when they come home,' and as he reiterated that the last thing American veterans are is \u2018suckers' or \u2018losers.'\"\nSocial media erupted over this latest tall tale from the president.\n\"Unsurprisingly, Biden has made up most of this war story. Lt. Ambrose Finnegan was a ground crew member and ordinance officer, not a reconnaissance pilot,\" GOP communications expert Zach Parkinson wrote, alongside a purported military record and newspaper clipping. \"In 1944, Finnegan was the passenger of an A-20 (a twin-engine, not single-engine plane) that ditched, it wasn't shot down.

Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., is planning to propose new legislative action that would threaten to cut National Public Radio's (NPR) federal funding if passed, prompted by the news that it suspended an editor who went viral for exposing the outlet's partisan uniformity in its newsroom.\nThe Tennessee Republican is weighing a variety of legislative options to take on federal funding that goes to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which provides funding to NPR in the form of grants. She is specifically looking to prevent NPR from benefiting from public funds, due to what her office characterized as left-wing bias.\n\"The mainstream media has become obsessed with doing the Left's bidding and taking down strong conservatives \u2014 and NPR has led the pack,\" Blackburn said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"It makes no sense that the American people are forced to fund a propagandist left-wing outlet that refuses to represent the voices of half the country. NPR should not receive our tax dollars'.\"\nBlackburn previously looked to sever the government's funding to NPR in 2011 when she was serving in the House of Representatives. At the time, the Republican-controlled House passed a measure that sought to cut $50 million from CPB.\n\"The time has come for us to claw back this money,\" Blackburn reportedly said at the time.\nCPB is \"fully funded by the federal government,\" per the nonprofit's website. The organization provides funding in the form of grants to both NPR and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The grants to NPR are used for its international bureaus and distribution infrastructure that provides content to all public radio stations.\nNPR veteran editor Uri Berliner was recently suspended without pay from NPR following his public criticism of his employer. The suspension was made public on Tuesday but began last Friday, according to NPR media reporter David Folkenflik. The organization reportedly told Berliner on Thursday that his punishment was a final warning, and that if he violated NPR's policy on employees seeking approval to do work for other news outlet, he would be fired.\n\"I love NPR and feel it's a national trust,\" Berliner said in an interview with Folkenflik. \"We have great journalists here. If they shed their opinions and did the great journalism they're capable of, this would be a much more interesting and fulfilling organization for our listeners.\"\nThe senior NPR business editor said he made several attempts to relay his concerns before choosing to publish an essay in the Free Press, but they weren't heard by the organization's leadership.\nIn Berliner's scathing review of his employer's ideological homogeneity, he revealed that there were \"87 registered Democrats working in editorial positions\" at the Washington, D.C., headquarters \"and zero Republicans. None.\"\nHe said that such a lack of viewpoint diversity seeped into the outlet's coverage, criticizing NPR's approach to a variety of prominent stories over the years, including allegations that former President Trump colluded with Russia in the 2016 election, the laptop belonging to President Biden's son, Hunter Biden, and the theory that COVID-19 was triggered by a lab leak in China.\nA spokesperson for Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, said that he is also trying to advance legislation in the House to defund NPR that he has introduced on multiple occasions, including the current Congress.\nJackson is actively seeking more co-sponsors for his bill and is pushing House leadership to consider it in the wake of recent events.\nRep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., similarly told Fox News Digital in a statement, \"I think Congress should exercise oversight of NPR, especially in light of the recent whistleblower's allegations and subsequent suspension.\"\n\"Taxpayers fund NPR, and it should be a source that provides a truly neutral and balanced perspective,\" he said. \"That can only be achieved through a politically diverse staff, otherwise, it is nothing more than a propaganda machine for the Democrat party.\"\n\"Sen. Cassidy was clear that Congress should end public funding for NPR,\" a spokesperson for Sen.

The statute governing parole, however, says that releases are only allowed due to urgent humanitarian reasons or \"significant public benefit.\" Republicans have accused the administration of abusing parole with its broad policies at the border, saying that the paroles often do not meet these criteria.\nRanking Member Rand Paul asked Mayorkas about Ibarra's release and about the legality of the basis for his parole. Mayorkas said that he would not comment on the case.\n\"All our hearts break for the family of Miss Riley. Secondly, the perpetrator of this heinous criminal act needs to meet justice to the fullest extent of the law. And I will not comment on the particulars of the case, because the matter is being prosecuted by authorities now,\" he said.\nWhen Paul followed up, including asking the secretary if he was pleading the Fifth, Mayorkas said \"I have provided my answer\" but later expanded.\n\"There are different bases for parole. I am not a legal expert in this regard, but let me assure you that when an individual is encountered at the border, and they are deemed to be at the time of encounter a threat to public safety or national security, they are a priority for detention,\" he said. \"If not, they receive a notice to appear and are placed in immigration enforcement proceedings. The number of individuals encountered at the border exceed the number of beds available in our detention facilities. That is not something specific to this administration.\"\nBut Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., then turned up the heat by reading directly from the parole file, which lawmakers had obtained. He also revealed that Ibarra had been given a work permit, despite having been accused of a crime against a child in New York and having the charges later expunged by local authorities.\n\"Nothing is done to this guy. He had a criminal record to start with, he's in the country on illegal grounds. You have falsely and illegally allowed him in. He committed a crime against a child. He's not prosecuted, it's expunged. In November, get this, in November, Ibarra files an application for employment authorization. And unbelievably, on December 9, 2023, it's approved,\" he said.\n\"So this is your policies [sic] in action, Mr. Secretary,\" he said.\n\"I am confident that justice will be vindicated in the criminal prosecution of the case,\" Mayorkas responded, which led Hawley to make a reference to the recent impeachment effort against Mayorkas.\nWell, hopefully he'll get more of a trial than you got,\" he said. \"Otherwise, there'll be no justice for anyone at all.\"\nSeparately, Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, raised the CHNV (Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuelan) parole program, which allows up to 30,000 migrants a month to fly or travel directly into the U.S. via parole.\n\"Why are you mass importing tens of thousands of Venezuelans into our country via parole, knowing they can't be deported, because Venezuela isn't exactly accepting removal flights? He asked him.\n\"We are not doing that, senator,\" Mayorkas said. \"The term \u2018importation' is incorrect.\"\nMayorkas also said it was false to say that Venezuela won't take return flights.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\"We have negotiated in the past removal flights to Venezuela. Those are suspended right now,\" he said, before adding that Mexico will sometimes take Venezuelan nationals.\n\"So, why do you say it's not correct when it's been suspended?

When lit, the cross is visible for miles, which the group says sends \"its message of God's love and as a comfort to the Christian community.\"\nThe surrounding area has since become public land but the cross is part of an easement dispute between the City of Albany and Lions Club.\nThe Pacific Justice Institute (PJI) \u2013 a conservative legal defense organization based in California \u2013 filed a petition for relief after the City of Albany removed the cross in June 2023. Brad Dacus, its president, told Fox News Digital he believes the city has an animus towards Christians.\n\"If there was a giant LGBT flag or something like that, this city would embrace it. No problem. So it's specifically because of the viewpoint and the religious viewpoint and perspective of the cross. That's their agenda,\" he said.\n\"The City's public statements and actions have been hostile and targeted the Christian cross because [of] its religious message,\" the petition, filed on March 22, said. \"The City Council lacked neutrality and attacked the cross and the Lions for its free exercise of religion and free speech.\"\nDacus said he believes the statements from city officials give him a slam dunk case.\n\"It is a vicious, blatant, anti-constitutional, discriminatory action by the City of Albany. And that's what makes this case so shocking. You know, the city didn't even hide it,\" Dacus said.\nThe petition cited comments from then-Mayor Aaron Tiedemann, who is associated with the Green Party. Tiedemann served as mayor from December 2022 to December 2023 and is currently a member of Albany City Council.\nTiedmann celebrated the cross removal in 2023 as a step consistent with the Bay Area city's values.\n\"The city has actually put its money where its mouth is, and our city looks a little bit more accepting now in a way that we think is consistent with our values,\" he told the East Bay Times in June. \"For the small local group of people that really want to see the cross stay, when you've had such privilege for so long, losing it feels like being oppressed. That's going to be an adjustment for folks, but I think we will all get used to it, and I think it's a real benefit.\"\nThe petition drew attention to the East Bay Times reporting, \"Tiedemann, who grew up in Albany, said people have long complained about the cross for a litany of reasons: it symbolizes a preference of one religion over others, offends some members of the city's diverse communities, is reminiscent of KKK cross-burnings in the East Bay hills in the 1920s, and is an eyesore.\"\nDacus says the city is using eminent domain to claim ownership over the property, and ensure the cross's removal.\n\"The takings clause doesn't allow the government to take property because they don't like the religious speech,\" he said. \"If they could get away with this, make no mistake, then they could get away with taking down a church with eminent domain, or any other kind of religious entity or organization. And, of course, we all know that the Constitution forbids that.\"\nDacus explained he was \"very optimistic with regard to the final outcome of this case\" and was willing to take it all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary.\nHe added that anti-Christian sentiment in the U.S. was relatively new and was coinciding with an uptick in antisemitism.\n\"The feeling of hostility and bigotry against\u2026 the Christian community is something that is relatively new. It's really come to the surface just within the last few decades and has specifically spiked within the last decade itself,\" he said. \"We've seen religious intolerance against the Jewish community in the past. Unfortunately, it's spiking. Antisemitism is unbelievably blatant and open in our country, our universities.\"\nThe PJI president said that voters need to be aware of who they are electing to ensure they are selecting those \"sensitive towards religious freedom\" who will \"not give in to the leftist extremist ideology.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to Tiedemann and did not immediately receive a response.

Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, shot back, \"Those who wanted to force a Senate vote on border security were betrayed by the surrender of leverage, not by opposition to the rule.\"\n\"If the speaker wanted to keep his own promises on border security, he would have attached border security to the rule. Those opposed would have been forced to accept it, or oppose the rule,\" Davidson responded.\nA rule vote is a procedural hurdle that sets terms for debate and a final vote on one or several pieces of legislation. It's decided by a majority in the House Rules Committee, which is the last test for bills before they reach the House floor.\nConservative foreign aid skeptics were outraged at the decision by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., last week to advance his four foreign aid bills under one rule vote and a fifth border security bill under a separate rule, arguing that it left Republicans with no leverage to force the Senate to take it up.\nIn protest, three of those skeptics joined all Democrats in killing the bill in the Rules Committee, which forced Johnson to bring the bill up for a vote by forgoing the procedural hurdle in exchange for raising the threshold for passage to two-thirds instead of a simple majority.\nPredictably, the bill failed with no Democrats backing the measure.\nRep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., took a veiled shot at GOP rebels after the Saturday vote, accusing them of throwing up roadblocks for media attention, \"Sadly we have some egos outpacing intellects. Could they survive a day [without] a microphone or camera in front of them? We are here TO GOVERN not play to the press.\"\nOn the other side of the argument, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, one of the three Rules Committee Republicans who blocked the border bill from getting a simple majority vote on the House floor, accused GOP leaders of putting it up for \"cover.\"\n\"Ukraine issues aside, our take down of the SEPARATE border\u2026 rule \u2013 they needed desperately to pass as cover \u2013 has enraged them [because] they now can't easily lie that border was attached in a package,\" Roy wrote on X in an unrelated post.\nMeanwhile, Rep. Dan Bishop, R-N.C., piled on Barr's earlier post, \"After each sellout, once the fury of Republican voters sets in, the self-serving lies begin. Leadership NEVER proposed to attach ANY border security measure to this Ukraine package. They set up a separate, cosmetic vote to give cover that the Senate would have been free to ignore. The Rules Committee conservatives killed that separate rule.\"\nBut even Johnson himself dismissed arguments that he was in a position to force border security measures through the Democrat-controlled Senate and White House, telling FOX Business' Larry Kudlow days before the vote, \"Some of my colleagues want the speaker of the House to have a magic wand. If we could close the border ourselves, we would have done it a long time ago.\"\nThe infighting is not a new phenomenon in the House, but it illustrates the exceptional divides in Johnson's GOP Conference.\nHouse lawmakers are back in their home districts this week, but when they return, GOP leaders will be grappling with just a one-seat majority after the early departure of Rep.

A fourth bill would combine miscellaneous national security priorities, including the House's recently passed bill that could pave the way to a TikTok ban and the REPO Act, a bipartisan measure to liquefy seized Russian assets and send that money to Ukraine.\nA lack of any border security measures, however, has prompted even reliable leadership allies to be wary of letting the bills move forward.\n\"I'm thinking of voting against the rule,\" Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital. \"Unless we vote to send something to the Senate the same day that addresses the border, requires the president to take action on his executive orders. Or we can put something with the underlying legislation that would actually do a couple of things \u2013 we can stop money from going to NGOs that are transporting individuals, we can stop Homeland Security from releasing criminals into the interior.\"\nWhile the four bills are designed to get separate House floor votes, they will first have to pass a procedural hurdle known as a rule vote, a House-wide measure that if passed will allow for debate and eventual votes on the four individual pieces.\nRule votes traditionally fall along party lines, and with Johnson's razor-thin majority, he can only afford to lose two Republicans on any party-line vote \u2013 and it's becoming increasingly likely that he might, meaning Democrats will need to break precedent to help get the bills over the line.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., whose disagreements with Johnson have led her to threaten his leadership role, said on Tuesday morning that she would vote against the rule unless the Democrat-controlled Senate took up the House GOP's comprehensive border security bill known as H.R.2 \u2013 which Democrats have panned as a nonstarter.\n\"NO, I am NOT voting for the rule on Johnson's bundle of funding bills for billions more to Ukraine and other foreign wars. When Joe Biden signs HR2 into law and Schumer holds the Mayorkas impeachment trial in the Senate, I will agree to vote for the rule only,\" Greene said on X. \"Speaker Johnson is not holding Democrats accountable nor leading our Republican majority, he's actually giving in to Democrats every demand. And he's using dirty swamp tactics to push through the America Last agenda.\"\nRep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, a member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, would not say how he would vote on the rule but told reporters, \"The rule that was proposed last night at conference will fail.\"\nOther critics of foreign aid similarly declined to say how they would vote but signaled they were opposed to Johnson's proposal itself.\n\"I think it leaves much to be desired. It doesn't have border control in it, it doesn't have any pay-fors in it,\" Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., told Fox News Digital. \"I think those are two problems.\"\nOther Republicans, however, argued it's a better plan than the Senate-passed $95 trillion supplemental aid package that its leaders are now pressuring Johnson to take up.\n\"No one wants to swallow the senate supplemental as a whole, and if we wait any longer without taking any action, that's exactly what's going to happen,\" Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital.\nRep. Anthony D'Esposito, R-N.Y., urged his colleagues to remember that they had already passed H.R.2 and have furiously been pushing for Democrats to take it up. He also told Fox News Digital that there were \"conversations\" about including border provisions before the text is released.\n\"I think we're in a critical time that, obviously, our allies need our support more than ever, and I hope that there's a way that we could include more border security into these packages,\" D'Esposito said. \"But I think we need to remind ourselves that we've as House Republicans done our job.

Even the medical examiner's report hasn't placated activists.","summary":"\u2018Never let a good tragedy go to waste' is the unspoken mantra of the radical progressive left, and that mantra has been hard at work in Oklahoma these past few weeks in the case of Nex Benedict. Indeed, the grotesquely distorted radical, progressive, Democrat narrative surrounding the death of a teenage girl in Oklahoma last month has been the source of a great deal of national media attention.\nHowever, this child's memory and the truth of what actually happened to her are just the latest instances of collateral damage in the woke mob and corporate media's efforts to smear school choice, traditional values and the Oklahomans who believe in them.\nHere's how the leftist narrative goes: a young girl who identified herself as nonbinary was beaten up in a high school bathroom in Owasso. She later tragically died of her injuries all as the result of hateful rhetoric of national conservative leaders all across the country. These leaders led others to cause violence against her. This narrative was spun for weeks without any evidence or proof.\nThey continuously tried to co-opt this story into a tale of martyrdom, where everything they claimed that this was all from a so-called \"climate of hate and bigotry\" and allege some deluge of new information about harassment in Oklahoma's public schools because of the values that the Oklahoma State Department of Education has been working to reinstill in public education.\nThat is not hyperbolic in the least. If you believe the leftist opinion headlines, this tragedy was a direct and inescapable outcome of making students use bathrooms that correspond with biological reality.\nIn response, hundreds of LGBT organizations and activists called for me to step down. Now, as then, I will disappoint the woke mob and give them every reason to run back to their keyboards and spin even more dishonest rhetoric.\nBut facts \u2014 John Adams reminds us \u2014 are stubborn things. And the facts of this case have turned out to be quite inconvenient for the narrative peddlers. It still remains unclear specifically why Benedict was beaten in that bathroom.\nNo reason is sufficient to justify a physical altercation. While details are murky at best, the motive is not something to be assumed or spun up out of thin air. Further, bodycam footage released amid the aftermath of the incident shows Benedict admitting to starting the altercation. Further, law enforcement authorities have indicated that Benedict did not die as the result of trauma. Finally, and most awful, deeper reporting on the matter revealed allegations of a longer horrific history of parental sexual abuse and psychological trauma than mere bullying at school. Yet the media and the activist cadre have yet to own up to their crass manipulation of this young woman's suffering.\nBecause let's be frank about what's actually going on here. This isn't about a teenager's death. It isn't even really about bullying. This is a pretext for attacking the traditional values and the educational freedom agenda that the people of Oklahoma elected me to fight for. The mob took the first news story that it could use for its own ends and ran with it. That's it. That's why the facts don't matter, the narrative is what they needed.\nTragically, Nex took her own life, according to the medical examiner's report in March.\nThe bottom line is this: the safety of my students has always been my first and foremost priority as an educator, from my first day in the classroom to now. I never tolerated bullying of any kind for any reason when I was a teacher, and I do not tolerate it whatsoever as the superintendent of Education.\nAny Oklahoma public school teacher or administrator who believes otherwise on the topic is always welcome to find other employment. But, I will make zero apologies for representing the values of the Oklahoma voters who elected me. I make zero apologies for working to serve the needs and interests of the parents and students that I serve.\nI'm not afraid of politics. I knew I would be attacked when I decided to get into this business, and I knew I would be lied about. Nevertheless, it is still despicable that anyone would not only so brazenly use a thing as horrific as a child's death to gin up political discord for personal gain. It is even more despicable that so many would willfully and knowingly turn a blind eye to the facts, simple reason and basic human dignity to keep the whole thing going once contradicted.\nThis mob and its rabid propaganda cannot change the facts of Benedict's death any more than they can change the simple realities of human biology, no matter how much bile and misinformation they spew into the public discourse.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ryan Walters","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/03/nex-benedict.jpg","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.0994,"_id":"47ce0c6d766f8ec2ef45068b6a19e337"},{"title":"'Die MAGA die': Dem congressional candidate in hot water for X post after Ukraine vote","author":"Emma Colton","published_date":"2024-04-21 17:02:27","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-congressional-candidate-hot-water-declaring-die-maga-die-ukraine-vote-you-lose","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"New York Democratic congressional candidate Nate McMurray has come under fire for a post saying \"Die MAGA die\" after the House approved a bill to fund Ukraine.","summary":"A New York Democratic congressional candidate celebrated the House passing a $60 billion bill to fund Ukraine while hoping for the death of the MAGA movement, a message posted to X shows.\n\"Slava Ukraine,\" New York congressional candidate Nate McMurray posted to X Saturday afternoon.\n\"Die MAGA die. You lose,\" he added of former President Trump's supporters and those who agree with the \"Make America Great Again\" platform.\nMcMurray's tweet followed the U.S. House passing a bill Saturday that provides $60 billion to Ukraine amid the nation's ongoing war against Russia. The aid package passed 311 to 112, with more Republicans voting against the bill, at 112, than Republicans who voted for it, at 101.\nMcMurray is running to represent New York's 26th Congressional District, which includes parts of Erie and Niagara counties in the western area of the state, after previously serving as the town supervisor of the Town of Grand Island and as an attorney.\nSome conservatives have railed against continuing to fund Ukraine while the U.S. is coping with a border crisis, and some voted against the bill for its failure to include funding to secure the U.S. border.\n\"Today, I voted no...

Others said they reported McMurray to X for inciting violence.\nMcMurray posted a follow-up message Saturday directed at Trump supporters, saying the MAGA movement should \"expire,\" \"fade\" or \"disintegrate.\"\n\"Dear MAGA: Send your regards to MAGA Mike, not me.

Tim Kennedy, who asked a state court last week to remove McMurray's name from the Democratic primary ballot. The state senator's suit claims more than 1,000 signatures collected for McMurray's electoral petition are invalid, either due to circumstances \"constituting fraud\" or were collected by an ineligible canvasser, WBFO reported.\nMcMurray has denied the claims.\nThe 26th District was previously represented by Democrat Brian Higgins, who officially stepped down from the position in February. A special election will be held on April 30 to replace Higgins for the remaining months of his term. McMurray is only running in the Democratic primary ahead of the general election in November, not the special election.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Emma Colton","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/mcmurray3.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.089946,"_id":"ec99bc8df349ab6c609c3d5b07782b24"},{"title":"On this day in history, April 17, 1970, Apollo 13 astronauts return alive, defy odds after space explosion","author":"Kerry Byrne","published_date":"2024-04-17 04:02:22","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/this-day-history-april-17-1970-apollo-13-astronauts-return-alive-defy-odds-space-explosion","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The three astronauts on board the Apollo 13 mission safely returned to Earth after an explosion in space threatened their lives on this day in history, April 17, 1970.","summary":"An incredible human drama in space exploration ended with the miraculous safe return of the three Apollo 13 astronauts on this day in history, April 17, 1970.\n\"In Mission Control, pandemonium erupted,\" NASA reports of the joy that overwhelmed the command center after the mission's capsule splashed down in the South Pacific shorty after noon Central Standard Time, just four miles from rescue recovery ship USS Iwo Jima.\nThe fate of the three astronauts of Apollo 13 \u2014 Commander James Lovell, Command Module pilot John \"Jack\" Swigert and Lunar Module pilot Fred W.

A fourth bill would combine miscellaneous national security priorities, including the House's recently passed bill that could pave the way to a TikTok ban and the REPO Act, a bipartisan measure to liquefy seized Russian assets and send that money to Ukraine.\nJohnson indicated to reporters after the meeting that he anticipates a vote on the bills by Friday.\n\"We won't be voting on the Senate supplemental in its current form, but we will vote on each of these measures separately in four different pieces. We will vote on the Israel aid, on the aid to Ukraine, on the aid to the Indo Pacific and then another measure that has our national security priorities included in that has some of the things with regard to the loan-lease option and the REPO Act and some other sanctions on Iran and other measures that we've been talking about here for quite some time,\" he said.\nJohnson added that the bills, the text of which is expected early on Tuesday, will allow for members to offer amendments.\nHe said later that he expects the funding levels to be \"roughly the same\" as the Senate's $95 billion bipartisan supplemental aid package, which included money for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and humanitarian causes like Gaza.\nBreaking apart the Senate's supplemental package was an idea backed by a significant share of House Republicans. However, it also appears to be a move aimed at appeasing fiscal hawks on Johnson's right flank who otherwise would have likely attempted to block the bills from getting to the floor.\nThe two GOP lawmakers who shared details of the plan with Fox News Digital said there was more support for the plan in the room than opposition.\n\"I think it's a good plan. I don't know that I'll support every single subject bill, but this is the way the House should work,\" Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., told Fox News Digital after the meeting.\nMace added that several members, including herself, urged Johnson to include some border security measures, which do not appear to be part of the latest proposal.\nMeanwhile, Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., also did not say if he'd support the measures but told reporters, \"I think any time you separate these out to single subject bills, I think that's a good strategy.\"\nBut others, including members of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, signaled they were still skeptical.\nBoth Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good, R-Va., and its policy chair, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, suggested they were not optimistic that border security measures would ultimately be part of the deal \u2013 despite their demands.\n\"I think that the border security component will come from the members,\" Good told Fox News Digital.\nGood was also dissatisfied that the funding bills would not be offset by spending cuts elsewhere, as was the case with Johnson's original $14 billion standalone Israel aid bill which passed the House in November.\n\"We ought not to be borrowing to do any of these, and so some of us will absolutely make amendments to pay for this,\" he said.\nAnd Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who has threatened to oust Johnson over his handling of government spending and foreign aid, trashed the plan after the meeting.\n\"I just think it's the wrong direction to go. Our border is the number one policy issue that voters care about all across the country. And the Senate has not taken up\u2026our border package that we sent over there, they're just demanding that the House vote to fund Ukraine, vote to fund Taiwan and send more money to Israel, claiming that our military is running out of ammunition,\" Greene said.\n\"Well, you want to know something?

Such listings would make harvesting the fish illegal, but without them, popular sturgeon harvest seasons in states such as Wisconsin and Michigan can continue.\nThe center argued that overharvesting and deteriorating habitat have \"severely depleted\" the species. Dams block access to spawning and rearing habitat and water pollution and diversions have done \"irreparable harm,\" the center said.\nBut stocking has helped grow adult lake sturgeon populations and increase spawning, agency officials said. Putting the creatures on the list would be like going to the emergency room, and the rebounding species doesn't need that level of protection, said Chuck Traxler, the wildlife service's Midwest deputy regional director.\n\"It doesn't mean everything is good right now,\" he said. \"It means keep up the good work.\"\nPopulations aren't at historical highs, the agency acknowledged in a December assessment, but stocking returned them to the Red River of the North between Minnesota and North Dakota, the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers, portions of the Mississippi River and the Coosa River.\nDam removals and habitat restoration efforts also have helped, the agency has said, citing work in 2015 to retrofit a dam on Wisconsin's Menominee River to allow spawning sturgeon to travel upstream and the removal of the Brecksville Dam on Ohio's Cuyahoga River in 2020.\nThe agency also pointed to reef restoration work in the corridor connecting Lake Huron and Lake Erie that has created a place for sturgeon to lay eggs and noted that nine of 43 toxic spots along Great Lakes shorelines have been cleaned up.\nThe assessment also noted the adaptable species should be able to withstand warmer water due to climate change.\nMedia officials with the Center for Biological Diversity didn't immediately respond to email messages seeking comment Monday.\nLake sturgeon are ancient North American freshwater fish. They're essentially living fossils, first appearing about 136 million years ago when dinosaurs ruled the planet. They resemble torpedoes, with dorsal ridges and snouts. They can grow up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 300 pounds. Males typically live about 50 years. Females can live anywhere between 80 and 150 years.\nThey're found in the upper and lower Mississippi River basin as well as the Great Lakes. Commercial anglers considered lake sturgeon a nuisance because they tore their nets, leading to widespread over-harvesting in the 1800s that continued into the 20th century.\nLake sturgeon can't reproduce fast enough to replace the losses. It takes up to three decades before they reach spawning age, and even then they don't spawn annually. And many don't survive the trip back to their birth waters to spawn. The wildlife service has compared lake sturgeon losses to the mass destruction of the American buffalo.\nTwenty states have outlawed sturgeon harvesting. Fourteen of those states have listed lake sturgeon as threatened or endangered. Volunteers and Wisconsin natural resources officials have been guarding spawning sturgeon from poachers on the Wolf River for 30 years.\nMichigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin still hold hook-and-line lake sturgeon fishing seasons. Michigan and Wisconsin hold sturgeon spearing seasons each winter as well where anglers drill holes through lake ice and impale sturgeon as they swim past.\nThe Wisconsin natural resources department reported 432 sturgeon were taken in February, down from 1,405 in 2023. Warm weather and poor ice conditions led to the diminished return, according to the department. Michigan officials set the total harvest limit at just six sturgeon but ended up canceling due to warm weather and unsafe ice conditions.\nThose states' seasons are so tightly regulated that the harvests don't impact the species overall, said Lori Nordstrom, the wildlife service's Midwest assistant regional director of ecological services.\nMichigan and Wisconsin, for example, allow an angler to take only one sturgeon per year. Minnesota anglers must release any sturgeon they catch in inland waters. Wisconsin regulations are designed to keep the harvest rate below 5%, with all tag fees going to the state's sturgeon conservation program, according to the wildlife service.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Wisconsin-Sturgeon.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":3.9910145,"_id":"d920afb26e536d1d870b9fd714354ce7"},{"title":"GOP bill cracks down on 'loophole' allowing foreign donors to pump dark money into US elections","author":"Andrew Miller","published_date":"2024-04-17 14:31:50","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-bill-cracks-down-loophole-allowing-foreign-donors-pump-dark-money-us-elections","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"A new bill aims to crack down on foreign billionaires using dark money networks to fund ballot measures in the United States using a workaround that critics say violates federal law.","summary":"FIRST ON FOX: Senate Republicans are introducing a bill on Wednesday that aims to prevent foreign nationals from improperly influencing American elections in response to a report outlining how a foreign billionaire allegedly funneled almost $250 million into a liberal dark money network that poured almost $100 million into nationwide ballot campaigns.\nThe Prevent Foreign Interference in American Elections Act, being introduced by Tennessee GOP Sen. Bill Hagerty, states that it will \"amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to further restrict contributions of foreign nationals.\"\nThe move comes after the Senate was briefed on a new report from Americans for Public Trust that shows Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss has sent more than $243 million to the Sixteen Thirty Fund which then invested $97.6 million in ballot campaigns across 25 states over the past decade. Those states included the key swing states of Michigan, Ohio, Colorado, and Nevada.\nThe tens of millions of dollars from the Sixteen Thirty Fund, which has also been funded by George Soros, went into ballot measures promoting abortion access, lessening drug penalties and prison sentences, raising the minimum wage, automatic voter registration and other progressive causes.\nWyss, who is referred to by some as the \"new George Soros\", also allegedly gave more than $135 million between 2016 and 2020 to a nonprofit that gave tens of millions to Super PACs that supported Joe Biden in 2020 and has steered tens of millions of dollars to Democratic fundraising committees, get out the vote efforts, and Democratic candidates via nonprofits.\n\"A single Swiss billionaire, Hansj\u00f6rg Wyss, has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into various left-wing causes meant to influence American politics,\" Honest Elections Project Executive Director Jason Snead told Fox News Digital last year. \"Since 2016 he has given at least $245 million to Arabella Advisors' dark money behemoths New Venture Fund and Sixteen Thirty Fund. In 2020 alone, CTCL (Center for Tech and Civic Life) received $25 million from New Venture Fund. CTCL and its new Alliance are opening avenues for foreign billionaires to pump funds directly into the heart of US elections.\"\nCaitlin Sutherland, who told Fox News Digital last year that Wyss is the \"most influential figure in politics that you've never heard of\", wrote in the report's forward that Sixteen Thirty Fund is using Wyss's money as part of its \"war chest\" to \"support massive get out the vote drives, issue advocacy campaigns bolstering President Biden's agenda, liberal pet projects from abortion to immigration, and attack ads against Republican lawmakers.\"\nHagerty's bill would clarify that the existing foreign-national ban on \"indirect\" contributions covers attempts to circumvent the ban through intermediaries or instructions which conservatives have long argued poses a threat to Democracy when funds are dumped into dark money groups inside the U.S. from abroad.\n\"Foreign nationals are prohibited from donating to U.S. political candidates, committees and super PACs but there is no federal law prohibiting foreign nationals from donating to ballot committees,\" the report's conclusion explains. \"Some state laws exist to try to prevent this type of foreign influence, but in a majority of states, foreign nationals like Hansjorg Wyss, are allowed to write blank checks to fund ballot issues that could prioritize their interests over those of the residents of the state.\"\n\"If state and federal law permits a Swiss billiionaire to fund ballot initiative campaigns, there is nothing stopping U.S. adversaries from Communist China, Russia, or North Korea from doing the same.\"\nThe bill would prohibit foreign nationals from funding ballot harvesting and GOTV efforts, prohibit foreign nationals from funding U.S. election administration, and prohibit foreign nationals from spending money to influence ballot measures.\n\"After years of hysteria over Russiagate and alleged foreign influence in American elections, it turns out Democrats have recently benefited from hundreds of millions of dollars in election-related contributions from a shadowy foreign billionaire, sidestepping the federal ban on foreign-national contributions in U.S. elections,\" Hagerty said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\"This type of influence undermines democracy and self-government here in America, and its staggering scope should be alarming. I'm pleased to introduce this commonsense and critical legislation that will put an end to covert foreign influence on our elections and protect Americans' voice in electing their leaders.\"\nIn a statement, Sutherland said that \"it is irresponsible and alarming that our laws leave the door open to foreign nationals and U.S. adversaries influencing American politics.\"\n\"Our report reveals that Sixteen Thirty Fund alone is acting as a conduit for massive amounts of money from a foreign billionaire with an expressed desire to reshape U.S. politics to align with his out-of-touch worldview.

Longtime Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who was indicted last year on federal corruption charges, is not running for re-election as a Democrat and instead is mulling an independent bid, which polls indicate would potentially take votes away from likely Democratic Senate nominee Rep. Andy Kim.\nBashaw, an entrepreneur and historic preservationist who is recognized in the Garden State for leading the restorations of the historic Congress Hall and the Virginia Hotel in Cape May, at the southern tip of the Jersey shore, is a first time politician.\n\"I'm a political outsider,\" Bashaw emphasized. \"I'm a business guy.

Kim sued in federal court to overturn the county lines in the Democratic Primary. But the GOP county lines were upheld.\n\"New Jersey is made up of thousands and thousands and thousands of small businesspeople. We are going to get to them really quickly and our name ID will go up really fast,\" Bashaw said.\nAnd pointing to a busy schedule on the campaign trail ahead of the primary, Bashaw showcased that \"I go to six coffees a day. I go talk to every single county in our state. I put a lot of miles on the car.\"\nAsked about former President Donald Trump, who is the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee, Bashaw told Fox News \"I'm supporting this ticket top to bottom.\"\nIt's been 36 years since a Republican carried New Jersey in a White House race, but Trump is planning a campaign stop in the state next month.\n\"Donald Trump thinks New Jersey's in play. I agree with him. Trump believes he can flip the country from blue to red. I believe we can flip this Senate seat from blue to red,\" Bashaw said.\nHe argued that \"there's a massive opportunity to pull\" New Jersey's large pool of unaffiliated voters \"to the Republican tent\u2026. We are going to pull those unaffiliated voters our way this fall.\"\nNational Republicans to date have not made any investments in the Senate race in the Garden State.\nBut National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director Mike Berg said \"we're keeping a close eye on New Jersey.\"\nA national Democratic Senate campaign aide, asked about the contest, told Fox News that \"Democrats have won every New Jersey Senate race since 1978 and 2024 will be no different.\"\nBashaw, in his interview, spotlighted a couple of key issues, including crime.\n\"New Jerseyans are not feeling safe and secure in their homes,\" he argued.\nOn immigration and border security, another key issue Republicans are spotlighting, he charged that New Jersey \"is now a border state. There are illegals coming into all of our counties.\"\n\"The woke ideology has permeated through our culture and we now have in our state, schools keeping secrets from parents about very, very, personal decisions,\" he claimed, as he defended parental rights in public education.\nOn the issue of abortion, which Democrats are spotlighting, Bashaw pointed to the two-year-old blockbuster decision by the Supreme Court's conservative majority that overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which for a half century had legalized abortion nationwide.\n\"I believe that the Dobbs decision was the correct decision,\" Bashaw said.\nBut he added that \"I don't support a federal ban,\" which some in his party are backing.\nThe Dobbs decision moved the fight over abortion back to the states, and in New Jersey abortion is legal in all stages of pregnancy.\n\"New Jersey's decided it,\" Bashaw said, before charging that \"the Democrats are the extremists on this issue, passing legislation allowing abortions up until the day of birth.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Paul Steinhauser","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Curtis-Bashaw-Cape-May-NJ-April-10-2024-scaled.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":3.933271,"_id":"938ed8733fa038d13fe7365d089522a4"},{"title":"Fox News Poll: Biden, Trump in dead heat in 2024 Pennsylvania rematch","author":"Victoria Balara","published_date":"2024-04-18 22:00:08","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-biden-trump-2024-pennsylvania-rematch","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"President Biden and former President Trump in a dead heat in the latest Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters","summary":"The Keystone State looks headed for another tight race as President Biden and former President Trump are in a dead heat in the latest Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters, a state Trump won by less than a point in 2016 and Biden reclaimed by just over a point in 2020.\nThe survey of registered voters, released Thursday, finds the former and current presidents tied at 48% each, a slight improvement for Biden who was down by 2 percentage points in March.\nBiden saw modest gains among nonwhite voters (+5), suburban voters (+5) and voters under age 35 (+9), while Trump's coalition, such as conservatives, White evangelicals, White men without a degree, and rural voters, held relatively steady. What's more, Trump kept the advantage he had among independents: He was ahead among them by 7 points in March and maintains an 8-point edge now.\nBiden won union households by 5 points in 2020. Today, he holds the small subgroup by 2 points (49% Biden, 47% Trump). Non-union households split 48% each.\nIn a potential five-way race that includes third-party candidates, Trump comes out on top by 2 points: Trump 44%, Biden 42%, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. 8%, Jill Stein 2%, and Cornel West 1%. In this scenario, 8% of two-way Trump supporters break for Kennedy (none for Stein or West), while 10% of Biden supporters go for Kennedy (6%), Stein (3%), and West (1%).\nBiden is in the Keystone State this week, focusing on the economy and advocating for higher taxes on the wealthy as he visits several cities, including his hometown of Scranton.\nOver 4 in 10 voters feel they are falling behind financially (44%). Almost as many (41%) say they are holding steady, while just 14% say they are getting ahead. Trump leads among those who feel they are falling behind by 53 points, while Biden is ahead by 42 points among those saying getting ahead/holding steady.\nThe March Fox News Poll identified the economy as the top issue for Pennsylvanians, when voters surveyed felt Trump would better handle the issue. Trump's advantage on the issue (+12 points) held steady in the April poll.\nTrump also has a 16-point lead on another top issue: immigration and border security, while voters favor him on foreign policy by 4 points.\nBiden is seen as better at handling abortion (+10), election integrity (+6), and health care (+6).\nThe two major candidates are nearly tied on energy policy (Biden +1), despite concerns among some Democrats that Biden's opposition to fracking might be unpopular, especially after the administration paused new exports of U.S. natural gas earlier this year. A House Oversight Committee hearing on Thursday saw Republicans question the impact the pause would have on the U.S., especially internationally.\nVoters split over the Biden administration's handling of the conflict in the Middle East: 24% think he's too supportive of the Israelis vs. 23% say he's too supportive of the Palestinians. The largest number, 40%, says Biden's approach is about right.\nDemocrats are more likely to think the White House is too supportive of the Israelis, while Republicans are more likely to think it is too supportive of the Palestinians.\nBiden's job approval rating is nearly identical to his personal favorability rating: 45% approve of the job he's doing and 44% have a favorable opinion of him, while 55% disapprove of his job performance and have an unfavorable view of him.\nTrump is perceived slightly better than Biden on his favorable rating, but still underwater by 5 points (47% favorable vs. 52% unfavorable), while Kennedy is underwater by 6 points (40% favorable, 46% unfavorable, 15% can't rate).\nThe candidates' mental soundness has been a topic of debate and Pennsylvania voters are more likely to think Trump has the mental fitness to serve effectively as president (49%) than say the same of Biden (43%). At least half think they both don't have the mental soundness to perform the duties of president (50% Trump does not, 55% Biden does not).\nThe Pennsylvania congressional race is tight as well: 47% say they would vote for the Democratic candidate in their district while 46% support the GOP candidate. That's a reversal from March when Republicans were up by 3 points.\n\"The liabilities Biden has nationally are present in Pennsylvania, but they're muted,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"His standing with core Democratic constituencies is a little stronger, and he does a little better on issues like abortion, health care, and election integrity. It's the difference between being down a few points versus being tied.\"\nConducted April 11-16 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,141 Pennsylvania registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file.

There are many ways you can celebrate and establish habits to protect the planet.","summary":"Earth Day happens every year on April 22.\nThere are many ways that you can celebrate the occasion with activities that both honor and protect the planet.\nBelow are a handful of ways you and the whole family can mark the annual occasion and also, continue appreciating planet Earth throughout the year.\nCheck out these 12 tips.\nEco-friendly shops are where you can find sustainable items like reusable household products and trendy clothing.\nUse social media and search engines to find eco-friendly shops and businesses that are local to you. In addition to local stores, consider purchasing from eco-friendly shops around the country. While this will require packaging, many containers and wrapping used to ship by eco-friendly businesses are also recyclable.\nFeel free to participate in a group-organized tree-planting event near you on Earth Day or plant one at home. Search online or via social media to locate an event that is looking for volunteers.\nIf you prefer to plant a tree at home, consider one that blooms in the warmer months or one that will provide some shade for your backyard. If you're looking to grow a tree that will benefit you daily beyond carbon dioxide, find one that produces fruit.\nConsider altering your diet to include more sustainable foods. Shop for locally grown items, avoid tossing leftovers while they're still good and consider planting your own garden.\nAttend a beach cleanup for Earth Day or get some friends together and start your own.\nThis is an easy and fun way to celebrate Earth Day.\nVisiting a local farmers market is a great way to help the Earth and to support small businesses. It is also a way to introduce new healthy eating habits for yourself and your family.\nBring the kids to choose their own fruits and vegetables. If you're in the mood to go a little more gourmet, stop for fresh dough, or make it at home, and use the kid's chosen veggies as pizza toppings to add to Earth Day celebrations.\nChoosing to walk or bike to work versus driving your car produces less air pollution and puts fewer emissions into the atmosphere.\nRoller blades are also making a comeback and might be worth the purchase.\nIf you are able, take Earth Day as an opportunity to enjoy the fresh air on your way to and from work, the gym, the store, etc.\nEarth Day is all about focusing on ways we can help the Earth but also celebrating nature.\nTake photos of everything around you, from the flowers to the sky and everything in between, including wildlife, and share them via social media or during conversation.\nYou never know what your excitement could do for someone else.\nGet creative with reusable items. There are so many easy crafts you can make for Earth Day with just simple everyday items that would otherwise be tossed away.\nMake a bird feeder out of an old milk jug, paint old cans and use them as pots for your plants, repurpose your old clothing or old towels and use them as rags.\nIf you have any old clothing that is still in good condition, consider donating it. While donating old clothing or other items is respectable, you want to make sure you're offering others good quality items without holes, stains, etc.\nDonating your old clothing helps conserve energy and gives items a second life by allowing someone else to use them. It is much more progressive for the environment to put your old clothes in someone else's hands rather than a landfill.\nHow empowering would it be if you could eat food that you grew in your own backyard? Whether you want to start with seeds or small plants, beginning a garden is great for the environment and for your health.\nIf you have never gardened before, start small with herbs and grow your garden more each year. You may find that it is an activity you enjoy and that you're saving money on pricey herbs.\nThis may seem simple, but make sure to get outside if the weather permits.\nEven if you just take a quick walk with the dog, the stroller or even just yourself, at some point in the day, make time to appreciate the surrounding nature.\nBreathe in the fresh air and be mindful of how wonderful the planet is.\nIn addition to this, sign up for an outdoor yoga class or a similar event happening in your area that you can attend.\nUse Earth Day as the first day you start to reduce your plastic use.\nThere are two easy ways you can start to incorporate more environmentally friendly items into your day-to-day life.\nThe first is by purchasing a refillable water bottle. Second, you can buy a few large reusable bags, or a foldable cart, to take with you to stores instead of using plastic bags with every shopping trip.\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ashlyn Messier","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/woman-holding-basket-of-kale.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":3.8305717,"_id":"fba41d8bdc450f7a7f235e56a99c8fb4"},{"title":"Bill Maher knocks CNN's non-stop Trump bashing: 'No one's been harder on him than me\u2026 and I'm bored with it'","author":"Joseph Wulfsohn","published_date":"2024-04-16 10:00:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-knocks-cnns-non-stop-trump-bashing","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"HBO's Bill Maher took a swipe at sister network CNN for its over-the-top \"negative\" coverage of former President Trump, saying he's \"bored\" by it despite being a Trump hater himself.","summary":"\"Real Time\" host Bill Maher took a swipe at his corporate colleagues at CNN for the network's non-stop bashing of former President Trump, suggesting it has gotten \"boring\" even for a Trump hater like himself.\nCNN, which has long been plagued with dwindling viewership, has relied on Maher for content over the past several months, more recently deciding to air encore episodes of his HBO show on Saturday nights as both networks are owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.\nOn Sunday's installment of his \"Club Random\" podcast, Maher told former TV anchor Katie Couric that he doesn't trust \"anyone\" in the legacy media, including CNN.\n\"I don't trust that anyone is giving me the full story. Everyone is giving me their spin on the story, including the places that used to be, I thought, fairly neutral, like CNN and The New York Times, I think, used to be a lot more neutral-\"\n\"You think they're sort of more activists?\" Couric asked.\n\"Yes,\" Maher responded. \"You could always slant any story\u2026 My earliest memories of my father and me talking about something\u2026 I remember him telling me like\u2026 the bias comes through somehow, and I remember the examples he used. He said, like, 'If you say he squawked about it, as opposed to he said.' Then he said, Robert Kennedy, so this must have been before \u201868 when he was killed. I was definitely under 12. He said, 'Robert Kennedy, if you like him, he is dedicated. If you hate him, he is ruthless.' But it got worse.\"\n\"And it got to the point where each side thinks they have to load their issues because we can't really be trusted with both sides because the other side is so powerful and such an existential threat, they both think the other side is an existential threat. We just have to do everything we can - we can't trust them to make sure they have the one true and correct opinion,\" Maher continued.\nCouric appeared to defend the media, saying how \"things changed so dramatically\" because of Trump and blamed him for the erasure of \"decorum\" and a \"level of basic decency\" in this country, points that Maher agreed with.\n\"For a place like CNN, I have total sympathy with them for that,\" Maher said. \"It was an impossible choice. Either you pretend that this is just the other side of normal, left, right, Republican, Democrat, or you start calling him a liar\u2026 I think the world needs a great CNN, so I'll do everything I can to help that organization. And they still do some great stuff and have some great people. I still tune to it when something happens.\"\nAfter noting that CNN had gotten rid of their pro-Trump voices, Maher then pointed to the network's Trump town hall and how the live audience filled with Republicans and independents \"loved it\" while the network's anchors, and others in the media, hated it.\n\"Here's what people saw in America. They saw Trump killing it, killing it with the crowd. Then you cut to a panel of six people who all just do nothing but dump on him and call him a liar. And America goes, 'Oh, didn't you just see that we like him?'\" Maher said. \"The people loved him and what he was saying. Then you cut to a panel of six know-it-alls in Washington who just do nothing but talk about the negative. I'm all in on the negative. No one's been harder on Trump than me. I get it, and I'm bored with it. There's a different way to do this, I think.\"\n\"So what is it?\" Couric asked.\n\"Not to defend Trump, but to defend the people who still vote for him,\" Maher responded. \"Because what they see on the other side, to them, is even more dangerous. Because it's very closer to home. 'My kid is coming home from school, and he thinks he's a racist.' He's five. What have you been telling him? 'My son thinks maybe he's not a boy,' and maybe that's true, that happens. Those things are what they say, 'that's why I'm voting for Trump.'\"\n\"A conservative guy once said to me, 'What you don't get about Trump is we don't like him either.' Now, that's not true for all people. There are people who just love his dirty drawers, and they are dirty. Lots of people, it's like that. 'We don't like him. He's all that stands between us and madness.' That's their view. I would like that view presented. That view, not election deniers, but just try to understand why even the election-denying thing is not a deal breaker for these people. And I think they're wrong. But I don't hate them. And they're not stupid.\"\nCNN did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\nLast month, Maher similarly took aim at The New York Times for no longer being a \"great newspaper.\"\n\"What is annoying about it is that it's not just, just give me the facts,\" Maher said. \"There's way too much editorializing on the front page, the way the articles that are just supposed to be the fact kind of articles are slanted one way. And I'm not even necessarily for the other side! I just want someone to tell me the whole truth, not just like your version of it. Because you can lie by what you omit. And both sides do.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Joseph Wulfsohn","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/MaherCNN.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":3.7769165,"_id":"3e4e4aa8c4600721e888ebf9b470255e"},{"title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene is an idiot.

No one should have to endure this level of hatred, let alone at school.\"\nHouse GOP Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., on Sunday demanded Columbia University President Dr. Nemat \"Minouche\" Shafik to \"immediately resign\" given how Columbia's leadership \"has clearly lost control of its campus\" within the last 24 hours, \"putting Jewish students' safety at risk.\"\nStefanik asserted that Columbia leadership's hours of preparation for their testimony before the House Education and the Workforce Committee hearing last week \"clearly was an attempt to cover up for their abject failure to enforce their own campus rules and protect Jewish students on campus.\"\nDespite Shafik allowing the New York Police Department onto campus the day after her testimony before Congress, where lawmakers grilled her about the lack of consequences for antisemitism at the Ivy League school, the more than 100 people arrested and suspended from the university on Thursday have since been released from custody.\nThe anti-Israel encampment on the locked campus has remained as police officers look on from across the gates.\nVideo circulating online appear to pass the threshold of simply supporting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement or human rights pleas for Palestinians in Gaza, as speakers described the Columbia encampment as a \"training ground\" for \"fighters\" and have praised the Oct. 7 attacks, when Hamas militants slaughtered nearly 1,200 Jews and took over 240 hostages.Beyond \"Free, Free Palestine,\" demonstrators' chants have included \"Al-Qassam you make us proud, kill another soldier now!\", \"We say justice, you say how. Burn Tel Aviv to the ground!\", and, \"Hamas we love you. We support your rockets too!\"\nOne anti-Israel agitator was seen holding a sign reading, \"Al-Qasam's next targets,\" pointing toward a group of Jewish students who were singing while waving the Israeli flag. The Al-Qassam Brigade is the military wing of Hamas.\nAnother video showed demonstrators shout at Jewish students leaving campus, \"Go back to Europe,\" and, \"All you do is colonize.\"\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, Ben Shapiro, founder of The Daily Wire, decried how universities \"have spent literally years telling conservatives on campus to shut up \u2013 that they might \u2018microaggress' sensibilities of far-Left students by saying that boys can't be girls and the like.\"\n\"They've spent those same years coddling radical Leftists who actively undermine the actual functioning of the universities. Columbia's latest protests weren't designed to be peaceful. They were designed to intimidate and harass,\" Shapiro said. He described how the latest protests featured pro-Hamas activists cheering Oct. 7, pledging a new Oct. 7 \"every day,\" and screaming, \"We're all Hamas.\"\n\"Columbia has no obligation to coddle terror supporters who harass students and obstruct the functioning of the university,\" Shapiro said. \"Columbia spent months doing so after October 7: there's already a lawsuit alleging that \u2018Jewish and Israeli students have been physically assaulted, spat at, threatened and subjected to relentless intimidation and vilification.'\"\nShai Davidai, a Jewish professor at Columbia who went viral in October calling out the school's inaction on antisemitism, demanded that the National Guard be brought in if the NYPD cannot take action.\n\"[Shafik] needs to open the gates of the university. And NYPD needs to come in and disperse the crowd and arrest everyone who refuses. And keep them in jail. And if the NYPD cannot do this, then we need the National Guard,\" Davidai told Fox News Digital. \"With all the fraught history the National Guard has had on U.S. campuses. If Columbia can't keep the Jewish students safe. And if the police continue to keep the Jewish students safe, then the National Guard must. Because this is a civil rights issue. This is not about the war in Israel. This is a Jewish civil rights issue.\"\n\"This is a hostile takeover of the university,\" he added. \"It's a showdown of support for Hamas on one hand and Western civilization on the other hand\u2026. The showdown is happening on Columbia's campus.\"\nAt the congressional hearing Wednesday, House Republicans grilled Shafik on what consequences Columbia professors Joseph Massad, Katherine Franke and Mohamed Abdou faced for celebrating Oct. 7. The university president vowed Abdou would never work at Columbia again but gave unclear testimony on whether Massad was reprimanded by his dean about his comments or was removed as the chair of a committee.\"Professor Joseph Massad described Hamas' October 7 terror attack on Israel as a \u2018resistance offensive' designed to fight \u2018racism toward the Palestinians,'\" Shapiro told Fox News Digital. \"Professor Katherine Franke said \u2018all Israeli students who served in the I.D.F. are dangerous and shouldn't be on campus.' Professor Mohamed Abdou posted on social media on October 11, \u2018I'm with Hamas & Hezbollah & Islamic Jihad.'

Would a heckler in today's audience [inside the Supreme Court] qualify, or at the State of the Union address? Would pulling a fire alarm before a vote qualify?\" asked Justice Neil Gorsuch. He may have been referring to Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D\u2013N.Y., charged with triggering a fire alarm in a House office building in a non-emergency.\nBut others on the court appeared to agree with the government's view that Congress intended to allow a \"classic catchall\" to include other obstructive behavior involving official proceedings.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor said the provision was designed to \"cover every base,\" including the Capitol riots.\n\"We've never had a situation before,\" she said, \"with people attempting to stop a proceeding violently.\"\nA federal judge earlier dismissed the obstruction offense against three Jan. 6 criminal defendants, ruling it did not cover their conduct on the Capitol grounds. Those defendants include Fischer, Garret Miller of the Dallas area, and Edward Jacob Lang of New York's Hudson Valley.\nThe high court accepted Fischer's appeal for final review.\nU.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, a 2019 Trump bench appointee, determined prosecutors stretched the law beyond its scope to inappropriately apply it in these cases, ruling a defendant must have taken \"some action with respect to a document, record or other object\" to obstruct an official proceeding under the law.\nThe Justice Department challenged that ruling, and a federal appeals court in Washington agreed with prosecutors that Nichols' interpretation of the law was too limited.\nThe relevant statute \u2013 18 U.S. Code Section 1512(c)(2) \u2013 of the Corporate Fraud Accountability, part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reads: \"Whoever corruptly\u2026 obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.\"\nCongress passed the law in 2002, after the Enron financial and accounting scandal. Executives at the Texas-based energy company were charged with fraud, and the company eventually went bankrupt.\nNichols, in his ruling in the Miller case, cited then-Senator Biden, who referred to the new provision at the time as \"making it a crime for document shredding.\"\nBoth the government and Fischer \u2013 who was a North Cornwall Township police officer in Pennsylvania at the time \u2013 offer contrasting accounts of his actions on Jan. 6, 2021.\nIn his appeal, Fischer's lawyers argued he \"was not part of the mob that forced the electoral certification to stop; he arrived at the Capitol grounds well after Congress recessed.\"\nAnd while he admits entering the Capitol building and pushing his way through the crowd, Fischer claims he also helpfully returned a pair of lost handcuffs to a U.S. Capitol police officer. After being pepper-sprayed by law enforcement, the defendant then says he left the complex just four minutes after entering.\nBut the Justice Department says Fischer \"can be heard on the video yelling 'Charge!' before pushing through the crowd and entering the building. Once inside, he allegedly ran toward a line of police officers with another rioter while yelling profanities.\nAnd the prosecution points to text messages he sent just before attending the \"Stop the Steal\" rally where Trump spoke \u2013 and the subsequent march to the Capitol.\n\"Take democratic congress to the gallows,\" he said in one post, and \"Can't vote if they can't breathe.. lol.\"\nFischer has pleaded not guilty to several charges, including disorderly and disruptive conduct; assault, resisting or impeding law enforcement officers; civil disorder; and obstruction. His trial is pending. His legal team argues hindering or affecting an official proceeding is too ambiguous, as applied to Fischer's conduct on the Capitol grounds.\nFor more than 90 minutes Tuesday, the justices offered a range of hypotheticals about how the relevant obstruction statute could be applied in other contexts.\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett raised the criminal charges against Trump in the election interference case. She asked whether the charges were evidence-related over obstructing or impeding evidence and could be applied to Trump's alleged efforts to disrupt the presidential electoral vote count and certification by Congress on Jan. 6.\n\"Do you agree that the government could take a shot at proving that your client actually did try to interfere with \u2026 evidence because he was trying to obstruct the arrival of the certificates arriving to the vice president's desk for counting?\" Barrett asked.\nJustice Clarence Thomas, who returned to the bench after missing Monday's oral arguments for unexplained reasons, asked whether other violent, anti-government protests were prosecuted under the statute.\nU.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar struggled to find specific examples but did say the obstruction provision was used in document forgery and witness tampering cases.\n\"For all the protests that have occurred in this court, the Justice Department has not charged any serious offenses,\" said Justice Samuel Alito, suggesting the obstruction statute was not being applied fairly.\n\"What happened Jan. 6 was very, very, serious. I'm not equating this with that,\" added Alito.\" But we need to find what are the outer reaches of this statute under your interpretation.\"\nFischer awaits trial on six other criminal offenses and has pleaded not guilty.\n\"Why aren't those six counts good enough?\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked, questioning the necessity of adding the obstruction offense.\nHow a Supreme Court ruling in the Fischer case would affect Trump's separate prosecution for election interference is unclear. If Fischer prevails, the former president could then ask the federal courts to formally dismiss his obstruction charge.\nThat could prompt a new round of separate legal appeals that might go back to the Supreme Court for final review.\nNine days after oral arguments in the Fischer case, the justices are expected to hold a public session to debate whether Trump enjoys absolute immunity from prosecution for conduct in office when allegedly seeking to overturn the 2020 election results and certification.\nThat has paused Trump's criminal conspiracy and obstruction trial indefinitely.\nThe separate challenge over the obstruction charge would also likely push the schedule well into next year.\nThe pending high court case is Fischer v. U.S. (23-5572). A ruling is expected by early summer.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Bill Mears","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/01/Supreme-Court-Justices-Photo-1.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":3.4186368,"_id":"f8bfcb35cea2d24cef94558838a0aee1"},{"title":"Supreme Court prepares to debate Trump immunity claim in election interference case","author":"Shannon Bream","published_date":"2024-04-22 08:00:15","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-prepares-to-debate-trump-immunity-claim-in-election-interference-case","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The high court will hold arguments Thursday morning in what could determine Donald Trump's personal and political future","summary":"In what may be the most closely watched case this term at the Supreme Court \u2013 involving the highest-profile appellant \u2013 former President Donald Trump has offered a sweeping argument for why he should not face trial for alleged election interference.\nThe high court will hold arguments Thursday morning in what could determine the former president's personal and political future. As the presumptive GOP nominee to retake the White House, Trump is betting that his constitutional assertions will lead to a legal reprieve from the court's 6-3 conservative majority \u2013 with three of its members appointed to the bench by the defendant himself.\nThe official question the justices will consider: Whether, and if so, to what extent does a former president enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office?\nThis is new territory for the Supreme Court and the nation. No current or former president has ever been criminally indicted.\nThe stakes could not be higher \u2013 both for the immediate election prospects, and the long-term effect on the presidency itself and the rule of law. But it will be the second time this term the high court will hear a case directly involving the former president.\nOn March 4, the justices unanimously ruled that Trump could remain on the Colorado primary ballot over claims he committed insurrection in the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riots.\nThe decision to intervene at this stage in the immunity dispute is a mixed bag for both Trump and the Special Counsel. The defendant wanted to delay the process longer \u2013 ideally past the November election \u2013 and Jack Smith wanted the high court appeal dismissed immediately so any trial could get back on track quickly.\nA federal appeals court had unanimously ruled against Trump on the immunity question.\n\"For the purpose of this criminal case, former President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant,\" the three-judge panel wrote. \"But any executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as President no longer protects him against this prosecution.\"\nSmith has charged the former president with conspiracy to defraud the U.S.; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights.\nThose charges stemmed from Smith's investigation into Trump's alleged plotting to overturn the 2020 election result, including participation in a scheme to disrupt the electoral vote count leading to the subsequent Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot.\nTrump pleaded not guilty to all charges in August.\nIn its brief on the merits submitted this month, the Special Counsel told the high court that \"presidents are not above the law.\"\n\"The Framers never endorsed criminal immunity for a former President, and all Presidents from the Founding to the modern era have known that after leaving office they faced potential criminal liability for official acts,\" said the government.\nBut Trump's legal team told the high court, \"A denial of criminal immunity would incapacitate every future President with de facto blackmail and extortion while in office, and condemn him to years of post-office trauma at the hands of political opponents.\"\nHis lawyers added: \"The threat of future prosecution and imprisonment would become a political cudgel to influence the most sensitive and controversial Presidential decisions, taking away the strength, authority, and decisiveness of the Presidency.\"\nIn a series of supporting briefs, 19 GOP-controlled states and more than two dozen Republican members of Congress are among those backing Trump's legal positions.\nSome of the issues the court will have to consider:\nCan a former president ever be prosecuted for \"official acts,\" or does he enjoy \"absolute immunity?\"\nBy including the words \"whether and to what extent\" in its official question framing the case, the Supreme Court \u2013 in the eyes of many legal scholars \u2013 may be prepared to limit or narrow \"absolute immunity,\" at least in this case.\nBut court precedent may give Trump some protection \u2013 that former presidents should not face civil liability \"predicated on his official acts\" (Fitzgerald v. Nixon, 1982). Trump, of course, is facing criminal charges brought by the government. The question remains: Will the court now extend any implied civil protection to a criminal prosecution?\nWhat constitutes an official act of a president? Will the court distinguish between Trump's alleged election interference as clearly acting in his executive capacity, or was he acting in a purely political or personal capacity as an incumbent candidate?\nA federal appeals court that rejected Trump's arguments in a separate civil lawsuit alleging that he incited the violent Capitol mob with his \"Stop the Steal\" rally remarks on Jan. 6, 2021 concluded that \"his campaign to win re-election is not an official presidential act.\" Trump is making the same immunity claims in those pending lawsuits.\nJustice Clarence Thomas, in a separate 2020 case involving Trump financial records sought by New York prosecutors, wrote, \"This Court has recognized absolute immunity for the President from 'damages liability predicated on his official acts,' But we have rejected absolute immunity from damages actions for a President's nonofficial conduct.\"\nThomas cited the 1997 Clinton v. Jones case, which determined that a sitting president did not have immunity from civil suits over his conduct prior to taking office and unrelated to his office. Again, the current dispute involves a criminal prosecution, and the justices may weigh whether that deserves greater deference to the constitutional claims from both sides.\nWhat acts are within the outer rim of a president's constitutional duties?\nThe lower federal courts deciding the matter pointedly avoided addressing that issue, but the high court now has full discretion to take it up. Questions or hypotheticals from the bench may offer hints about how broadly the justices may want to explore the orbit of presidential authority, when weighing political or \"discretionary\" acts vs. duty-bound or \"ministerial\" acts.\nDuring January oral arguments before the DC-based federal appeals court, Trump's lawyer, John Sauer, suggested that if a president were to order Seal Team Six military commandos to assassinate a political rival, he could then be criminally prosecuted only if first found guilty by Congress through the impeachment process.\nGiven the stakes, the Supreme Court may compromise here and issue a mixed ruling: rejecting Trump's broad immunity claims while preserving certain vital executive functions, like the national security role of commander-in-chief. The big unknown is what side Trump's election-related conduct would fall, in the eyes of the nine justices.\nDo federal courts have any jurisdiction to consider a president's official discretionary decisions?\nOn this separation-of-powers question, Smith's team and others have cited the 1952 Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer case that limited a president's power to seize private property \u2013 even in a wartime emergency \u2013 absent any express congressional authorization. That landmark ruling curbing executive power also affirmed the judiciary's binding role to review a president's actions in office.\nWill the Supreme Court ultimately decide not to decide, and throw the competing issues back to the lower courts for further review?\nThe justices may get buyer's remorse and conclude that weighty questions were not fully considered at the intermediate appellate or trial court level. That could significantly delay any trial.\nOr they may let the trial play out first, and give both sides a chance to make their claims before a jury. Depending on the verdict, the Supreme Court would then likely revisit the immunity questions.\nDespite Trump's urging, the court pointedly chose not to address another lingering issue: whether the criminal prosecution violates the Fifth Amendment's ban on \"double jeopardy,\" since he was acquitted by the Senate in February 2021 for election subversion, following his second impeachment.\nTrump faces criminal prosecution in three other jurisdictions: He faces a federal case over his alleged mishandling of classified documents while in office; a Georgia case over alleged election interference in that state's 2020 voting procedures; and a New York fraud case involving alleged hush money payments to an adult film star in 2016.\nJury selection in the New York case began on April 15.\nBut the start of the election interference trial in Washington remains in doubt. Depending on how the court rules, proceedings might not get underway until later this summer, in early fall or perhaps much later.\nThere is one other factor to consider: Trump could win re-election and then, upon taking office, order his attorney general to dismiss the Special Counsel and all his cases. Neither side's legal team has yet to publicly speculate on that scenario.\nSo, Jack Smith's case is frozen for now.\nAnd while this appeal would normally be decided in late June at the end of the Court's term, it is being expedited \u2013 so a ruling could come sooner.\nIf the Supreme Court rules in the government's favor, the trial court will \"un-pause\" \u2013 meaning all the discovery and pre-trial machinations that have been on hold would resume.\nTrump's team would likely argue to trial Judge Tanya Chutkan that they need several months at least from that point to actually be ready for a jury trial.\nChutkan said in December that she does not have jurisdiction over the matter while it is pending before the Supreme Court, and she put a pause on the case against him until the justices decide the matter on the merits.\nA sweeping constitutional victory for the former president would almost certainly mean that his election interference prosecution collapses, and could implicate his other pending criminal and civil cases.\nBut for now, Trump may have achieved a short-term win, even if he eventually loses before the Supreme Court \u2013 an indefinite delay in any trial that may carry over well past Election Day on Nov. 5.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Shannon Bream Bill Mears,Bill Mears,Shannon Bream","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Donald-Trump-NYC-Criminal-Case-Day-2_13.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":2.8894286,"_id":"03a492e44d09239ebd46681b658882aa"}],"user_input":{"q":"conservative","search_in":["title_summary_en"],"lang":["en"],"not_lang":null,"countries":null,"not_countries":null,"from":"2024-04-15 00:00:00","to":null,"ranked_only":"True","from_rank":null,"to_rank":null,"sort_by":"relevancy","page":1,"size":100,"sources":["foxnews.com"],"not_sources":[],"topic":null,"published_date_precision":null}}
