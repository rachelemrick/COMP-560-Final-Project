            "summary": "A new report from Pew Research Center shows the GOP has closed the gap with Democrats on the number of voters who are registered Republicans, while both parties have become more diverse.\n'Many of the factors long associated with voters' partisanship remain firmly in place,' the report reads. 'For decades, gender, race and ethnicity, and religious affiliation have been important dividing lines in politics. This continues to be the case today.'\nSome notable changes, however, have affected the makeup of both parties: Republicans have made noteworthy gains among rural voters, white evangelicals and voters without a college degree, The New York Times noted. 'At the same time, Democrats have held onto key constituencies, such as Black voters and younger voters, and have gained ground with college-educated voters.'\nHere are five key takeaways from the report on how the Democratic and Republican parties have changed over the last three decades:\nFour years ago, leading up to the 2020 election, the Democratic Party had the 'clear edge' over Republicans with 51% of voters identifying as Democrats vs. 46% identifying as Republican.\nNow, leading up to the 2024 election, that gap has closed. The survey found that registered voters are now evenly split along party lines: 49% identify as Democrats or lean toward the Democratic Party and 48% identify as Republicans or lean Republican.\n'In recent decades, neither party has had a sizable advantage, but the Democratic Party has lost the edge it maintained from 2017 to 2021,' according to the report.\nSince the 1990s, both the Republican and Democratic parties have become more diverse, the Pew report found.\nIn 1996, 85% of voters were White, 9% were Black, 4% were Hispanic and about 1% were Asian. Now, 67% are White, 11% are Black, 13% are Hispanic and 4% are Asian.\n'Both parties are more racially and ethnically diverse than three decades ago, but not to the same degree,' according to Pew. 'There has been more change in the composition of the Democratic coalition than the Republican coalition.'\nHowever, the Democratic Party's advantages among Black and Hispanic voters, in particular, have narrowed somewhat in recent years.\nHere are how the percentage of different ethnic and racial groups have changed in both parties since 1996:\nIn 1996, 93% of Republicans were white. Now, 79% are white — a 14% drop. The percent of white voters dropped 21% in the Democratic party (from 77% to 56%).\nThe percentage of Hispanics in both parties has tripled: from 3% to 9% for Republicans and from 5% to 16% for Democrats.\nAsian voters have increased from less than 1% of Democrats' coalition to 6%.\n'The share of Black voters within the Democratic coalition has remained fairly stable, and they currently make up 18% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters,' per Pew. Black voters make up 3% of Republicans.\nWhile 44% of Democrat voters are Hispanic, Black, Asian, another race or multiracial, only 20% of Republicans are non-white. 'However, the Democratic Party's advantages among Black and Hispanic voters, in particular, have narrowed somewhat in recent years,' Pew found.\nThe Pew survey found that registered voters who regularly attended religious services were more likely to identify as Republican.\n'In 2023, 62% of registered voters who attended religious services once a month or more aligned with Republicans, compared with 41% of those who attend services less often,' according to the report.\nThis has been the pattern for years, Pew says, among white, Hispanic and Asian voters. Black voters are the exception to this trend.\n'Only about one-in-ten Black voters who are regular attenders (13%) and a similar share (11%) of those who attend less often identify as Republicans or Republican leaners,' the report found.\nWhile the Democratic Party has an advantage among younger voters and the Republican Party has the edge among the older generations, the study found a significant age difference in the way generations approach political parties: Older voters overwhelmingly identify with a political party, while a substantial number of younger voters say they lean towards one party or the other\n'Younger voters are considerably more likely than older voters to opt out of identifying directly with a party,' according to Pew.\nAmong voters 80 and older, 77% identify with a party. For voters under 25, only 52% identify with a party. The other half say they are 'something else or independent, with 28% leaning Democratic and 20% leaning Republican.'\nThere is a gender gap in partisan affiliation. Men are more likely than women to associate with the Republican Party, and women tend to lean toward the Democratic party. The Pew report found that a majority of women voters continue to align with the Democratic Party, with 51% of women identifying as Democrats, and 44% as Republicans.\n'Nearly the reverse is true among men (52% align with the Republican Party, 46% with the Democratic Party)' according to the report. 'The gender gap is about as wide among married men and women.' However, this gap is even wider among unmarried men and women — 37% of never-married men identify as Republicans compared with 24% of never-married women.",

            "excerpt": "An exclusive USA TODAY/Ipsos poll showcases the tough fight ahead for Florida Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell in her campaign against incumbent Republican Sen. Rick Scott.",
            "summary": "Florida Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell may face even tougher odds than previously thought in her bid to unseat Republican Sen. Rick Scott.\nA new USA TODAY/Ipsos poll published Saturday finds that 74% of Florida voters have never heard of Mucarsel-Powell. That includes an overwhelming 61% of the state's Democratic voters and 78% of the independents the Democratic candidate is relying on to narrow her opponents lead in the race.\nScott edged Mucarsel-Powell 36%-26% in the poll, fielded between April 5 through April 7.\nThe results may dampen Democrats' hopes that the Florida Supreme Court's recent abortion ruling would boost Mucarsel-Powell's chances in the conservative-leaning state. In early April, the court upheld Florida's 15-week abortion ban and OK'd a ballot measure that, if passed, would protect access to the procedure in the state.\nAt the time of the ruling, experts suggested that the abortion ballot measure could incentivize liberal-leaning voters to head to the polls in November – which would help Democratic candidates like Mucarsel-Powell.\nBut, with eight months to go until the election, Mucarsel-Powell's low name recognition across the state could prove to be a major barrier in an already difficult-to-win race.\nMucarsel-Powell, 53, represented Florida's 26th District, which includes parts of Miami, for one term in Congress between 2019 and 2021. After leaving office, Murcarsel-Powell joined the gun violence prevention organization Giffords, founded by former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, as a senior adviser. She's previously worked in academic administration, including as an associate dean at Florida International University.\nShe's facing off against Scott, who is a longtime fixture in Florida politics. He served as the state's governor between 2011 and 2019 and went on to beat out Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson to win his Senate seat in 2018.\nA Democratic candidate hasn't won statewide in Florida since 2018.\nIn this year's Senate race, the USA TODAY/Ipsos poll shows that more than 20% of Democrats don't know who they'll vote for yet. But, more Democrats (9%) than Republicans (3%) say they don't plan on casting a ballot in the November Senate race.\nAnd 8% of Democrats surveyed said they were willing to cross party lines to vote for Scott, compared to just 2% of Republicans who were willing to do the same for Mucarsel-Powell.\nThe Florida race could play a pivotal role in the battle for control of the Senate. Democrats currently hold a 51-49 majority in the chamber, but are facing a slate of challenging races in 2024. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin's retirement heavily favors a Republican to take his seat in deep-red West Virginia, and races in Montana, Nevada and Ohio are all considered toss-ups. A Democratic pick-up of Scott's seat in Florida would be a major upset.\nSusan MacManus, a retired political science professor at the University of South Florida, argued that even with abortion on the ballot, Mucarsel-Powell will need name recognition to win the Senate race.\n'It's not impossible to get name ID, but name ID requires money and publicity and news,' MacManus said. 'That's why there's such a big push to get the Biden administration, the DNC and their deep-pocketed Democrats to pour money into Florida.'\nIn 2022, Republicans outspent Democrats in Florida by more than $100 million and GOP candidates, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, outperformed their Democratic competitors. If Democrats want to even the playing field this year, MacManus argued that they'll need to up their investment.\nShe also cautioned that Democrats like Mucarsel-Powell need to do a better job of communicating with young voters, who typically aren't affiliated with a political party.\n'They have to have a high turnout in a fairly cohesive vote among younger voters. In this state to be able to win statewide because the older voters leaned a little bit more Republican and their higher turnout,' she said.\nScott narrowly leads Mucarsel-Powell among independent voters in the state 28% to 25%, according to the USA TODAY/Ipsos survey. More than 20% of those polled said they don't know who they'll support in the race and 12% said they don't plan on voting.\nThe poll has a margin of error of +/-4.1%.\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Democrat challenging Scott faces dim prospects in Florida Senate race",

            "summary": "Democrats are somehow routinely shocked when their partisan power grabs are met with GOP retaliation despite the Democratic Party coming out on the worse end of these exchanges several times in the past decade.\nThe GOP retaliation now is taking the form of Ohio and Alabama threatening to exclude President Joe Biden from the ballot in 2024. The later Democratic National Committee nominating convention falls after several state deadlines, which has been the case for both parties for years. Republicans in Ohio and Alabama are threatening to buck the precedent of both parties offering exemptions to each other in these scenarios in order to keep Biden off the ballot.\n'This has not been something anybody has ever dealt with,' DNC member Elaine Karmarck said. 'No, this has never happened before.' And sure, while this exact method of and justification for keeping a major party candidate off the ballot may not have happened before, we are just one month removed from the Supreme Court having to intervene because Democrats wanted to keep former President Donald Trump off the ballot in several states.\nIn case you need a reminder, the Colorado Supreme Court and Maine's secretary of state both decided that Trump should be barred from the ballot despite Congress not determining that Trump had committed insurrection. In Illinois, a partisan Democratic judge overruled the State Board of Elections to ban Trump from the ballot. State legislators in New York and California's lieutenant governor also wanted to join in on this power grab.\nShould Ohio and Alabama be doing this? Of course not. But are we supposed to be surprised that Republicans would use the letter of the law to retaliate in kind for Democrats ignoring the law to keep their opponent off the ballot?\nYou would think Democrats would understand this better than anyone by now. Trump was able to get three justices confirmed to the Supreme Court because Republicans nuked the judicial filibuster in response to Democrats nuking the filibuster for other nominations. House Democrats started removing Republicans from committees over partisan disputes in 2022, and so Republicans responded in kind when they took back the chamber. When Democrats break a norm to grab power, Republicans respond.\nThis was always going to happen, and it is why Democrats should not have allowed this to reach this point in the first place or cheered it on as it happened. This is yet another slippery slope that Democrats have pushed a political norm down, only to be surprised that Republicans would respond as they always have.",

            "excerpt": "Leading up to the 2024 election, the party affiliation gap between Democrats and Republicans has closed, a new Pew report finds",
            "summary": "A new report from Pew Research Center shows the GOP has closed the gap with Democrats on the number of voters who are registered Republicans, while both parties have become more diverse.\n'Many of the factors long associated with voters' partisanship remain firmly in place,' the report reads. 'For decades, gender, race and ethnicity, and religious affiliation have been important dividing lines in politics. This continues to be the case today.'\nSome notable changes, however, have affected the makeup of both parties: Republicans have made noteworthy gains among rural voters, white evangelicals and voters without a college degree, The New York Times noted. 'At the same time, Democrats have held onto key constituencies, such as Black voters and younger voters, and have gained ground with college-educated voters.'\nHere are five key takeaways from the report on how the Democratic and Republican parties have changed over the last three decades:\nRepublicans close the gap Four years ago, leading up to the 2020 election, the Democratic Party had the 'clear edge' over Republicans with 51% of voters identifying as Democrats vs. 46% identifying as Republican.\nNow, leading up to the 2024 election, that gap has closed. The survey found that registered voters are now evenly split along party lines: 49% identify as Democrats or lean toward the Democratic Party and 48% identify as Republicans or lean Republican.\n'In recent decades, neither party has had a sizable advantage, but the Democratic Party has lost the edge it maintained from 2017 to 2021,' according to the report.\nBoth parties have become more diverse Since the 1990s, both the Republican and Democratic parties have become more diverse, the Pew report found.\nIn 1996, 85% of voters were White, 9% were Black, 4% were Hispanic and about 1% were Asian. Now, 67% are White, 11% are Black, 13% are Hispanic and 4% are Asian.\n'Both parties are more racially and ethnically diverse than three decades ago, but not to the same degree,' according to Pew. 'There has been more change in the composition of the Democratic coalition than the Republican coalition.'\nHowever, the Democratic Party's advantages among Black and Hispanic voters, in particular, have narrowed somewhat in recent years.\nHere are how the percentage of different ethnic and racial groups have changed in both parties since 1996:\nIn 1996, 93% of Republicans were white. Now, 79% are white — a 14% drop. The percent of white voters dropped 21% in the Democratic party (from 77% to 56%).\nThe percentage of Hispanics in both parties has tripled: from 3% to 9% for Republicans and from 5% to 16% for Democrats.\nAsian voters have increased from less than 1% of Democrats' coalition to 6%.\n'The share of Black voters within the Democratic coalition has remained fairly stable, and they currently make up 18% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters,' per Pew. Black voters make up 3% of Republicans. While 44% of Democrat voters are Hispanic, Black, Asian, another race or multiracial, only 20% of Republicans are non-white. 'However, the Democratic Party's advantages among Black and Hispanic voters, in particular, have narrowed somewhat in recent years,' Pew found.\nChurch attendance linked to Republican Party — except in this group The Pew survey found that registered voters who regularly attended religious services were more likely to identify as Republican.\n'In 2023, 62% of registered voters who attended religious services once a month or more aligned with Republicans, compared with 41% of those who attend services less often,' according to the report.\nThis has been the pattern for years, Pew says, among white, Hispanic and Asian voters. Black voters are the exception to this trend.\n'Only about one-in-ten Black voters who are regular attenders (13%) and a similar share (11%) of those who attend less often identify as Republicans or Republican leaners,' the report found.\nOlder voters identify, younger voters lean While the Democratic Party has an advantage among younger voters and the Republican Party has the edge among the older generations, the study found a significant age difference in the way generations approach political parties: Older voters overwhelmingly identify with a political party, while a substantial number of younger voters say they lean towards one party or the other\nidentify with a political party, while a substantial number of younger voters say they lean towards one party or the other 'Younger voters are considerably more likely than older voters to opt out of identifying directly with a party,' according to Pew.\nAmong voters 80 and older, 77% identify with a party. For voters under 25, only 52% identify with a party. The other half say they are 'something else or independent, with 28% leaning Democratic and 20% leaning Republican.'\nPartisan gap is bigger between unmarried men and women There is a gender gap in partisan affiliation. Men are more likely than women to associate with the Republican Party, and women tend to lean toward the Democratic party. The Pew report found that a majority of women voters continue to align with the Democratic Party, with 51% of women identifying as Democrats, and 44% as Republicans.\n'Nearly the reverse is true among men (52% align with the Republican Party, 46% with the Democratic Party)' according to the report. 'The gender gap is about as wide among married men and women.' However, this gap is even wider among unmarried men and women — 37% of never-married men identify as Republicans compared with 24% of never-married women.",

            "excerpt": "We are still waiting to see the Democratic Party's big comeback in the Sunshine State. | Opinion",
            "summary": "Since Donald Trump carried Florida in 2016 and then, again, by a larger margin in 2020, the Democratic Party has been supposedly staging a comeback in the Sunshine State.\nSo far, Democrats have little to show for it. The numbers have been going in the opposite direction: The Republican Party is becoming more popular among Floridians — if voter registration tallies are an indication.\nThis week, registered Republicans outpaced Democrats by 892,000 voters, up from an edge of 851,000 at the end of February. The GOP's party chair told Politico he expects to have a one million-plus advantage by the November elections.\nThere is a caveat to these numbers, Democratic Party spokeswoman Eden Giagnorio told the Herald Editorial Board. Voter registration numbers don't take into account 'inactive' voters who are still eligible to cast ballots, or independent voters.\nThanks to Florida's new election laws, thousands of voters have been deemed inactive with Democrats being 'disproportionately impacted,' she said. When you factor them in, the Republican advantage is closer to 509,000 voters based on 2023 data, according to Giagnorio.\n'Republicans are lying about their advantage... they are not telling the whole story,' she said.\nRegardless, the numbers don't look good for Democrats. Until just three years ago, they led the state in voter registrations. Not only did the GOP catch up with them, it surpassed them by stunning margins.\nThat's why there's a 'we'll believe it when we see it' feel to the Florida Democratic Party's 'Take Back Florida Coordinated Campaign' launching this weekend.\nWhen Republicans won Miami-Dade County for the first time in two decades in 2022, that was not just a reflection of Gov. Ron DeSantis' popularity — he won reelection by nearly 20 points — but also the long game the GOP has played nurturing support among Hispanic voters, and not just Cuban-Americans who have always leaned conservative.\nA constant complaint from Democrats is how the party failed to engage those voters on a regular basis. It's what Miami-based Democratic pollster Fernand Amandi described as 'demolition by neglect.'\n'I have seen a virtual abandonment of the field in South Florida,' Amandi told the Herald Editorial Board.\nMeanwhile, the Republican Party has treated Florida as its 'base state,' Amandi said, attracting conservative voters from other parts of the country. Florida has become a laboratory for GOP policies, from DeSantis' war on 'woke' to his administration flying migrants from Texas to Martha's Vineyard.\nHoping that voters would shun the GOP's extreme laws — such as the one known as 'Don't say gay' or the six-week abortion ban that goes into effect on May 1 — has not paid off so far. More than calling out Republicans' excesses and Trump's anti-democratic tendencies, Florida Democrats must show voters their vision for the state.\nTo be fair, since 2022, there have been some important Democratic victories under new party chair and former Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried. Democrats flipped a House seat in a January special election in Central Florida and the mayor's office in Jacksonville, the state's largest city, last year.\nIn the 2024 elections, Amendment 4 to protect abortion rights — along with another ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana — might be Democrats' best shot at boosting voter turnout and attracting much-needed money from wealthy donors. But that's not a given. Voters upheld abortion rights in every state where the issue was on the ballot, but several Democrats on those same ballots lost, a Politico analysis found.\nIt all goes back to investing in the state long before ballots are cast. There are signs that the Democratic Party is taking that seriously. This weekend, they will kick off their 'Take Back Florida ' initiative with eight events across the state, including in Miami-Dade, to register Democrats and re-enroll them to vote by mail.\nWith seven months before Election Day, will that be enough? Only if Democrats don't live up to their reputation of getting in their own way in Florida.\nClick here to send the letter.",

            "excerpt": "Primary voters will soon cast ballots in narrowly divided Pennsylvania. The state is sure to be a presidential battleground in the fall.",
            "summary": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The two parties in Pennsylvania's state House and its congressional delegation are nearly evenly divided, and that won't change once results are in from next week's primary election.\nBut come November, the candidates the parties will select April 23 for hundreds of legislative seats could alter what has been years of policy paralysis in Harrisburg and the similar partisan deadlock in Congress.\nThe state's voters will also cast primary ballots for this year's marquee contests for president and U.S. Senate. Democratic incumbents Joe Biden and Bob Casey and Republican challengers Donald Trump and Dave McCormick are shoo-ins to appear on the fall ballot.\nBoth parties will pick candidates for state attorney general, which was in Republican hands before Democrats went on a winning streak starting in 2012.\nIn the two other statewide 'row office' contests, Republicans Stacy Garrity, the treasurer, and Tim DeFoor, the auditor general, will find out which Democrats will try to unseat them in the fall.\nGENERAL ASSEMBLY\nIt took months and several special elections before Democrats were able to nail down their return to majority control of the state House last year, elevating one of their own to speaker in a chamber where the partisan breakdown is now 102-100. One seat, in a Poconos district where a Republican resigned in February, is vacant and will be filled by special election on primary day.\nWith the entire chamber on the ballot this year, Republicans would love to flip it back, denying Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro legislative leverage in policy and budget battles.\nIn the state Senate, where Republicans hold a 28-22 majority, Democrats would need to flip at least three seats in order for Democratic Lt. Gov. Austin Davis' tie-breaking vote to give them control.\nAmong the 25 Senate seats up this year, nearly half the total, or 12 incumbent senators, face no opponents this year.\nThere are contested Senate primaries in both parties for notable vacancies in a Republican-held seat in the Harrisburg area and a Democratic-held seat in Pittsburgh. The third vacancy is a Republican majority district in northern York County.\nLEGISLATIVE SHAKEUP\nDemocratic Rep. Nick Pisciottano, of Allegheny County, is leaving the House to run, along with two other Democrats and two Republicans, for a state Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Jim Brewster, D-Allegheny.\nRep. Dawn Keefer, R-York, is departing the lower chamber in a run to succeed retiring Sen. Mike Regan, R-York. Another House departure is Rep. Patty Kim, of Dauphin County, facing off against another Democrat for the nomination in the third Senate district involving a retirement, that of Sen. John DiSanto, R-Dauphin. Two Republicans also are vying to succeed DiSanto.\nDiSanto's seat is widely seen as the Senate Democrats' best chance for a pickup. Their longshot bid for the majority also likely would require beating Sen. Dan Laughlin, R-Erie, and Sen. Devlin Robinson, a first-term Republican whose district surrounds the western side of Pittsburgh.\nSen. Dave Argall, of Schuylkill County, who heads the GOP's Senate campaign effort, said a razor-close win for Brewster four years ago makes that a battleground, but their efforts to stay in the majority are wider.\n'There are going to be battles all across the state, but it's still pretty early to predict which ones are going to rise to the top of the list,' Argall said.\nLawmakers in nearly half of the 203 House seats, and slightly more Democrats than Republicans, have no primary or General Election opponents this year and can plan on serving another term starting in January.\nThere aren't many House vacancies this cycle: just nine seats held by Republicans and four by Democrats. Retiring members include Berks County Rep. Mark Rozzi, who spent a brief but notable time as House speaker early last year before fellow Democrats could muster the votes to elect their first choice to lead the chamber, Speaker Joanna McClinton of Philadelphia.\nReps. Ryan Mackenzie, of Lehigh County, and Rob Mercuri, of Allegheny, are relinquishing House seats to run in Republican primaries for Democratic-held congressional seats. Hedging their bets are Rep. Ryan Bizzarro, of Erie, and Rep. Jared Solomon, of Philadelphia, seeking reelection in the state House and running in Democratic primaries for state treasurer and state attorney general, respectively.\nCONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION\nAll 17 of Pennsylvania's incumbent members of the U.S. House of Representatives are running for another term, each with at least one opponent in the primary or fall elections. Court-ordered redistricting after the 2020 Census produced a 9-8 Democratic edge, and when the incumbents ran for reelection two years ago, all 17 were reelected.\nIn Allegheny County, freshman U.S. Rep. Summer Lee has a Democratic primary opponent, Bhavini Patel, as well as a Republican positioned to take on the Democratic winner in November.\nIn a district Democrats hope to flip, a race north of Philadelphia could signal how much power the abortion issue has in the suburbs. U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a centrist Republican, has a primary opponent whose anti-abortion position would not permit exceptions for rape or incest.\nThere is a three-way GOP primary for the nomination to take on Lehigh Valley Democratic U.S. Rep. Susan Wild in the fall. Wild's previous two wins were by single-digit margins. Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Democrat from the Scranton area who also has been repeatedly targeted in recent years, has no primary opponent, but a Republican looks to challenge him in November.\nSix Democrats are on the primary ballot in a district held by U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, a York County Republican who was deeply involved in efforts by then-President Donald Trump to overturn Trump's 2020 election defeat. Perry's prominent role in the ultra-right Freedom Caucus in Congress and some close reelection contests over the past six years also are making him a target for Democrats this year.\nSTATEWIDE ROW OFFICES\nAfter Shapiro's election as governor two years ago created a vacancy in his former job as state attorney general, he nominated his protege, Michelle Henry, to serve through the end of this year. She is not seeking to stay in the job.\nFive Democrats are running for the nomination: Philadelphia attorney Keir Bradford-Grey, former auditor general and state Rep. Eugene DePasquale, of Allegheny County, former prosecutor and Bucks County solicitor Joe Khan, Philadelphia state Rep. Jared Solomon and Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer.\nTwo Republicans are running: York County District Attorney Dave Sunday and state Rep. Craig Williams, of Delaware County. Sunday received his party's endorsement, while Williams has been helping lead House Republicans' efforts to remove from office progressive Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat.\nFor auditor general, state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, of Philadelphia, and Lehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley are the Democrats seeking to run against DeFoor in November. Kenyatta finished third in the Democratic U.S. Senate primary in 2022 won by John Fetterman.\nGarrity, the state treasurer, has no opposition in the GOP primary. Democratic voters will choose between Bizzarro and Erin McClelland, an addiction recovery and human services professional from Allegheny County.",

            "summary": "The race for control of the White House and Congress in November are slated to be hotly contested elections, and both Republicans and Democrats face different challenges in those battles.\nWhile the presidential election between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will be the marquee matchup, several other races will be affected by key factors that could be make or break for both parties. Here are two issues likely to play a role in the key states in November.\nAbortion\nWith the overruling of Roe v. Wade in the Supreme Court ‘s 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the midterm elections later that year — which had been hyped as a 'red wave' — saw surprising Democratic over-performance. In states where abortion was on the ballot in 2022, including Michigan, it did not fare well for Republicans.\nLooking ahead to November, several key states may have abortion measures on the ballot alongside key Republican races.\nIn Florida, the state Supreme Court approved a ballot measure that would enshrine abortion into the state constitution if approved by 60% of voters in November. Democrats, who have not won a Senate or presidential race in the Sunshine State since 2012, are feeling better about their odds with abortion now on the ballot. The Florida GOP does not think it will tip the scales in Florida.\n'Florida voters know better and they will reject the radical agenda being pushed by FL Dems this November,' Florida Republican Party chairman Evan Power said in a statement earlier this month.\nIn several other states, including Montana, Arizona, and Nevada, where Democrats are hoping to keep Senate seats within their caucus, abortion measures may be on the ballot — but still have some steps to go.\nIn Arizona, the state Supreme Court upheld a strict ban, which outlaws the practice unless the mother faces immediate life-threatening conditions. The law, which dates back to 1864, has caused bipartisan backlash in the state, with Democrats and some Republicans arguing it is too restrictive.\nWith abortion becoming a hot-button issue in the Grand Canyon State, a critical state for Trump's electoral chances, the GOP's odds at flipping the Senate could be in jeopardy.\nDemocratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison outlined the stakes Democrats hope to convey for the November election.\n'The stakes are clear: Reproductive freedom is on the ballot in November, and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the only candidates who will fight to codify Roe and stand up for women's right to make their own health care decisions,' Harrison said in a statement after the Arizona Supreme Court ruling.\nTrump has attempted to neutralize the abortion issue for his race, by arguing it is a state's decision and calling for little action either way at the federal level. He did slam the 1864 Arizona law as being too far and called on lawmakers in the state to 'act immediately' on a 'common sense' solution.\nVoter registration advantage\nWhile Republicans may have abortion as a weakness going into November, Democrats are facing a numbers problem in some key states – voter registration.\nData from Pew Research shows that in the past four years, Democrats have lost a decisive edge it held over Republicans with registered voters. In 2020, 51% of registered voters identified or leaned Democrat compared to only 46% who said they identified or leaned Republican, but data from Pew now suggest Democrats only have a 49%-48% advantage over the GOP.\nIn Florida, where Democrats are hoping to make a play with abortion on the ballot, the GOP has overtaken Democrats in terms of voter registration since the last presidential election.\nAt this time in 2020, Democrats had a 97,215 voter registration advantage over Republicans. The Florida GOP currently has a registration of 892,034 voters compared to Florida Democrats, as of state data from the end of March.\nIn the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, Republicans have narrowed the gap with Democrats since the 2020 election as Democratic registration numbers have fallen in the succeeding years.\nRepublicans trailed Democrats in terms of registered voters by 685,818 voters in November 2020, but now the GOP only trails by 397,241 voters, according to the latest data from the state.",

Jared Solomon, of Philadelphia, seeking reelection in the state House and running in Democratic primaries for state treasurer and state attorney general, respectively.\nCONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION\nAll 17 of Pennsylvania's incumbent members of the U.S. House of Representatives are running for another term, each with at least one opponent in the primary or fall elections. Court-ordered redistricting after the 2020 Census produced a 9-8 Democratic edge, and when the incumbents ran for reelection two years ago, all 17 were reelected.\nIn Allegheny County, freshman U.S. Rep. Summer Lee has a Democratic primary opponent, Bhavini Patel, as well as a Republican positioned to take on the Democratic winner in November.\nIn a district Democrats hope to flip, a race north of Philadelphia could signal how much power the abortion issue has in the suburbs. U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a centrist Republican, has a primary opponent whose anti-abortion position would not permit exceptions for rape or incest.\nThere is a three-way GOP primary for the nomination to take on Lehigh Valley Democratic U.S. Rep. Susan Wild in the fall. Wild's previous two wins were by single-digit margins. Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Democrat from the Scranton area who also has been repeatedly targeted in recent years, has no primary opponent, but a Republican looks to challenge him in November.\nSix Democrats are on the primary ballot in a district held by U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, a York County Republican who was deeply involved in efforts by then-President Donald Trump to overturn Trump's 2020 election defeat. Perry's prominent role in the ultra-right Freedom Caucus in Congress and some close reelection contests over the past six years also are making him a target for Democrats this year.\nSTATEWIDE ROW OFFICES\nAfter Shapiro's election as governor two years ago created a vacancy in his former job as state attorney general, he nominated his protege, Michelle Henry, to serve through the end of this year. She is not seeking to stay in the job.\nFive Democrats are running for the nomination: Philadelphia attorney Keir Bradford-Grey, former auditor general and state Rep. Eugene DePasquale, of Allegheny County, former prosecutor and Bucks County solicitor Joe Khan, Philadelphia state Rep. Jared Solomon and Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer.\nTwo Republicans are running: York County District Attorney Dave Sunday and state Rep. Craig Williams, of Delaware County. Sunday received his party's endorsement, while Williams has been helping lead House Republicans' efforts to remove from office progressive Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat.\nFor auditor general, state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, of Philadelphia, and Lehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley are the Democrats seeking to run against DeFoor in November. Kenyatta finished third in the Democratic U.S. Senate primary in 2022 won by John Fetterman.\nGarrity, the state treasurer, has no opposition in the GOP primary. Democratic voters will choose between Bizzarro and Erin McClelland, an addiction recovery and human services professional from Allegheny County.",

            "summary": "Florida Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell may face even tougher odds than previously thought in her bid to unseat Republican Sen. Rick Scott.\nA new USA TODAY/Ipsos poll published Saturday finds that 74% of Florida voters have never heard of Mucarsel-Powell. That includes an overwhelming 61% of the state's Democratic voters and 78% of the independents the Democratic candidate is relying on to narrow her opponents lead in the race.\nScott edged Mucarsel-Powell 36%-26% in the poll, fielded between April 5 through April 7.\nThe results may dampen Democrats' hopes that the Florida Supreme Court's recent abortion ruling would boost Mucarsel-Powell's chances in the conservative-leaning state. In early April, the court upheld Florida's 15-week abortion ban and OK'd a ballot measure that, if passed, would protect access to the procedure in the state.\nAt the time of the ruling, experts suggested that the abortion ballot measure could incentivize liberal-leaning voters to head to the polls in November – which would help Democratic candidates like Mucarsel-Powell.\nBut, with eight months to go until the election, Mucarsel-Powell's low name recognition across the state could prove to be a major barrier in an already difficult-to-win race.\nMucarsel-Powell, 53, represented Florida's 26th District, which includes parts of Miami, for one term in Congress between 2019 and 2021. After leaving office, Murcarsel-Powell joined the gun violence prevention organization Giffords, founded by former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, as a senior adviser. She's previously worked in academic administration, including as an associate dean at Florida International University.\nShe's facing off against Scott, who is a longtime fixture in Florida politics. He served as the state's governor between 2011 and 2019 and went on to beat out Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson to win his Senate seat in 2018.\nA Democratic candidate hasn't won statewide in Florida since 2018.\nIn this year's Senate race, the USA TODAY/Ipsos poll shows that more than 20% of Democrats don't know who they'll vote for yet. But, more Democrats (9%) than Republicans (3%) say they don't plan on casting a ballot in the November Senate race.\nAnd 8% of Democrats surveyed said they were willing to cross party lines to vote for Scott, compared to just 2% of Republicans who were willing to do the same for Mucarsel-Powell.\nThe Florida race could play a pivotal role in the battle for control of the Senate. Democrats currently hold a 51-49 majority in the chamber, but are facing a slate of challenging races in 2024. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin's retirement heavily favors a Republican to take his seat in deep-red West Virginia, and races in Montana, Nevada and Ohio are all considered toss-ups. A Democratic pick-up of Scott's seat in Florida would be a major upset.\nSusan MacManus, a retired political science professor at the University of South Florida, argued that even with abortion on the ballot, Mucarsel-Powell will need name recognition to win the Senate race.\n'It's not impossible to get name ID, but name ID requires money and publicity and news,' MacManus said. 'That's why there's such a big push to get the Biden administration, the DNC and their deep-pocketed Democrats to pour money into Florida.'\nIn 2022, Republicans outspent Democrats in Florida by more than $100 million and GOP candidates, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, outperformed their Democratic competitors. If Democrats want to even the playing field this year, MacManus argued that they'll need to up their investment.\nShe also cautioned that Democrats like Mucarsel-Powell need to do a better job of communicating with young voters, who typically aren't affiliated with a political party.\n'They have to have a high turnout in a fairly cohesive vote among younger voters. In this state to be able to win statewide because the older voters leaned a little bit more Republican and their higher turnout,' she said.\nScott narrowly leads Mucarsel-Powell among independent voters in the state 28% to 25%, according to the USA TODAY/Ipsos survey. More than 20% of those polled said they don't know who they'll support in the race and 12% said they don't plan on voting.\nThe poll has a margin of error of +/-4.1%.",

            "summary": "PHOENIX — Pew Research Center has been surveying registered voters for decades to ask if they consider themselves Republicans or Democrats.\nIn the late 90s, the gap between the two parties was narrow with Democrats having a slight advantage.\nIn 2003, Democrats took the lead and never relinquished it.\nThe gap spread to its widest in 2008 but narrowed to the parties running even in 2022. By the following year, Democrats had shifted a point ahead but it was the closest the parties have been before a presidential election year in two decades.\nA major reason for the narrow gap is the trend of voters sorting into the two parties by large demographic cohorts like age, race, and education which has continued with little change in momentum.\nBefore 1999, there was little difference between the party preferences of voters by what decade they were born in. In the decade that followed, a pattern emerged in which older voters began identifying at higher rates as Republicans and younger voters as Democrats.\nBy 2023, the difference between voters born in the 1940s and those born in the 1990s preferred the opposing party by a twenty-point margin.\nAnother big trend reported by Pew is the sorting of voters by education and gender.\nBy gender alone men are more Republican by a six-point margin while women are seven points more Democratic.\nIn recent years, more than half of men with college degrees said they were Democrats while men without college degrees, already more Republican, now lean to the right by ten points.\nFor women, the effect is the opposite. The largest spread by gender and education belongs to women with college degrees who are twenty-three points more Democratic. Women who do not have a college degree historically have also leaned Democratic, according to Pew's data, but since 2022 most of them now identify as Republican.\nPew also identified key demographic groups who identify most with either political party.\nFor Republicans, white evangelical protestants were the most loyal group. They make up 17% of registered voters and 85% of them identify as Republicans.\nBy contrast, the most loyal Democratic group was Black voters, who make up 11% of registered voters and 83% identify as Democrats.\nTo see the full report, click here.",

            "summary": "Florida Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell may face even tougher odds than previously thought in her bid to unseat Republican Sen. Rick Scott.\nA new USA TODAY/Ipsos poll published Saturday finds that 74% of Florida voters have never heard of Mucarsel-Powell. That includes an overwhelming 61% of the state's Democratic voters and 78% of the independents the Democratic candidate is relying on to narrow her opponents lead in the race.\nScott edged Mucarsel-Powell 36%-26% in the poll, fielded between April 5 through April 7.\nThe results may dampen Democrats' hopes that the Florida Supreme Court's recent abortion ruling would boost Mucarsel-Powell's chances in the conservative-leaning state. In early April, the court upheld Florida's 15-week abortion ban and OK'd a ballot measure that, if passed, would protect access to the procedure in the state.\nAt the time of the ruling, experts suggested that the abortion ballot measure could incentivize liberal-leaning voters to head to the polls in November – which would help Democratic candidates like Mucarsel-Powell.\nBut, with eight months to go until the election, Mucarsel-Powell's low name recognition across the state could prove to be a major barrier in an already difficult-to-win race.\nMucarsel-Powell, 53, represented Florida's 26th District, which includes parts of Miami, for one term in Congress between 2019 and 2021. After leaving office, Murcarsel-Powell joined the gun violence prevention organization Giffords, founded by former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, as a senior adviser. She's previously worked in academic administration, including as an associate dean at Florida International University.\nShe's facing off against Scott, who is a longtime fixture in Florida politics. He served as the state's governor between 2011 and 2019 and went on to beat out Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson to win his Senate seat in 2018.\nA Democratic candidate hasn't won statewide in Florida since 2018.\nIn this year's Senate race, the USA TODAY/Ipsos poll shows that more than 20% of Democrats don't know who they'll vote for yet. But, more Democrats (9%) than Republicans (3%) say they don't plan on casting a ballot in the November Senate race.\nAnd 8% of Democrats surveyed said they were willing to cross party lines to vote for Scott, compared to just 2% of Republicans who were willing to do the same for Mucarsel-Powell.\nThe Florida race could play a pivotal role in the battle for control of the Senate. Democrats currently hold a 51-49 majority in the chamber, but are facing a slate of challenging races in 2024. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin's retirement heavily favors a Republican to take his seat in deep-red West Virginia, and races in Montana, Nevada and Ohio are all considered toss-ups. A Democratic pick-up of Scott's seat in Florida would be a major upset.\nSusan MacManus, a retired political science professor at the University of South Florida, argued that even with abortion on the ballot, Mucarsel-Powell will need name recognition to win the Senate race.\n'It's not impossible to get name ID, but name ID requires money and publicity and news,' MacManus said. 'That's why there's such a big push to get the Biden administration, the DNC and their deep-pocketed Democrats to pour money into Florida.'\nIn 2022, Republicans outspent Democrats in Florida by more than $100 million and GOP candidates, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, outperformed their Democratic competitors. If Democrats want to even the playing field this year, MacManus argued that they'll need to up their investment.\nShe also cautioned that Democrats like Mucarsel-Powell need to do a better job of communicating with young voters, who typically aren't affiliated with a political party.\n'They have to have a high turnout in a fairly cohesive vote among younger voters. In this state to be able to win statewide because the older voters leaned a little bit more Republican and their higher turnout,' she said.\nScott narrowly leads Mucarsel-Powell among independent voters in the state 28% to 25%, according to the USA TODAY/Ipsos survey. More than 20% of those polled said they don't know who they'll support in the race and 12% said they don't plan on voting.\nThe poll has a margin of error of +/-4.1%.",

The tables turned over the years, with 5% more of American voters identifying as Democrats over Republicans in 2020. However, the Pew results from 2023 reveal a significant shift in party affiliation this cycle, reporting that 49% of voters identify as Democrat or leaning Democrat, while 48% identify as Republican or leaning Republican.\nAdditionally, about 33% of respondents said they identify as being conservative or moderate in 2023, while the other side of the aisle only sees 23% identifying as liberal Democrats or leaning liberal.\nThe poll found that while Democrats remain the party of choice for most Hispanic, Black and Asian voters, party support among non-Hispanic White Democratic voters has dropped 21 percentage points since 1996, falling from 77% to 56% in 2023.\nRecent polls have found that despite their advantage, Democratic support among minority voters is shrinking. A recent Gallup poll found that 19% of Black adults said they identify as lean Republican or Republican, while 66% identify as Democrat or lean Democrat, the \"smallest Gallup has recorded in its polling, dating back to 1999.\"\nAmong different age groups, Democrats maintain their advantage among young voters, while the majority of older individuals are Republican affiliated.\nRepublicans have gained ground among Hispanic voters in recent years, tripling affiliation with their base in the demographic over the past two decades from 3% to 9%.\nRural voters also appear to be shifting towards the GOP, with the new poll showing the party holds a 25-point advantage over Democrats, 60% to 35%, after the parties were evenly split among voters in 2008.\nPresident Biden and former President Donald Trump are expected to compete in a presidential election rematch in November. While Biden won the 2020 election against Trump, Pew's analysis reveals a potential shift in the political landscape that could be echoed on the ballot this fall.\nPew Research Center conducted the surveys via telephone for the results dating 1994 to 2018, and via online surveys from 2019 to 2023 among registered voters.",

            "excerpt": "\"There's the work that all of the serious adults are trying to work on, and then there is this nonsense.\"",
            "summary": "House Democrats are fuming over their Republican colleagues' plans to hold a vote denouncing what they say is President Biden's \"one-sided pressure\" on Israel.\nWhy it matters: Many pro-Israel Democrats, particularly Jewish lawmakers, are struggling to balance their affinity for Israel with their support of the president — while accusing Republicans of playing politics with a war.\n\"There's the work that all of the serious adults are trying to work on [to address] an incredibly complicated and gut-wrenching situation, and then there is this nonsense,\" Rep. Greg Landsman (D-Ohio) told Axios.\nZoom in: The three-page, non-binding resolution introduced by Rep. Maria Salazar (R-Fla.) opposes \"efforts to place one-sided pressure on Israel with respect to Gaza.\"\nIt cites Biden's call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this month in which the president urged an \"immediate ceasefire\" and a major shift in Israeli conduct in Gaza.\nIt also takes aim at the U.S. decision not to veto a U.N. Security Council resolution last month calling for a ceasefire.\nDriving the news: The House on Friday voted to advance the resolution to a final vote, which is set to come up next week and will likely pass with near-universal support from Republicans.\nBut some Democrats plan to help pad their margins: Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) told Axios he will vote for the measure.\nRep. Don Davis (D-N.C.) suggested he would vote for it as well: \"On that one – I tend to [be] very supportive of Israel, so I'm going to continue to be clear in that support,\" he said.\nThe backdrop: Republicans have held a score of Israel-related votes since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that Democrats say are primarily aimed at driving a wedge into their party — and it's worked.\n46 Democrats broke with their party in voting for a standalone Israel aid package in February that Democratic leaders opposed because it did not include aid for Ukraine or Palestinians.\nSeveral other Israel-related measures have garnered around a dozen Democratic defections, such as one in December equating antisemitism and anti-Zionism.\nAnd 22 Democrats voted with Republicans to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) in November for her criticism of Israel.\nYes, but: This resolution stands apart because it takes direct aim at President Biden.\nRep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) a member of Democratic leadership, told Axios of Democratic defections: \"There could be a few, but [the measure is] pretty bad.\"\nBetween the lines: Many Democrats are still undecided, with some raging about Republicans \"politicizing\" the war in Gaza.\n\"This has nothing to do with helping Israel,\" Landsman said, calling it a \"partisan political resolution\" that makes Israel \"more divisive as an issue.\"\nRep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) told Axios: \"Look, I try to stand with Israel every which way I can, even though they've had resolutions that have divided this caucus ... this is just another attempt to do that,\" said\nIn a sign of Democrats' tortured calculus, however, Moskowitz acknowledged there \"are paragraphs in there that I agree with, obviously – it talks about the establishment of the state of Israel.\"\nAnother undecided pro-Israel House Democrat said \"obviously, there are points that are categorically true.\"\nThe other side: Several pro-Israel Democrats said they are firmly against the resolution and defended Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\nRep. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.) said Biden is \"one of the best presidents for Israel\" and that she's \"not about to start bashing him.\"\nRep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) said Biden has been \"effective in getting Netanyahu to start providing more humanitarian aid ... so I think Biden's done a good job.\"",

            "summary": "Florida Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell may face even tougher odds than previously thought in her bid to unseat Republican Sen. Rick Scott.\nA new USA TODAY/Ipsos poll published Saturday finds that 74% of Florida voters have never heard of Mucarsel-Powell. That includes an overwhelming 61% of the state's Democratic voters and 78% of the independents the Democratic candidate is relying on to narrow her opponents lead in the race.\nScott edged Mucarsel-Powell 36%-26% in the poll, fielded between April 5 through April 7.\nThe results may dampen Democrats' hopes that the Florida Supreme Court's recent abortion ruling would boost Mucarsel-Powell's chances in the conservative-leaning state. In early April, the court upheld Florida's 15-week abortion ban and OK'd a ballot measure that, if passed, would protect access to the procedure in the state.\nAt the time of the ruling, experts suggested that the abortion ballot measure could incentivize liberal-leaning voters to head to the polls in November – which would help Democratic candidates like Mucarsel-Powell.\nBut, with eight months to go until the election, Mucarsel-Powell's low name recognition across the state could prove to be a major barrier in an already difficult-to-win race.\nMucarsel-Powell, 53, represented Florida's 26th District, which includes parts of Miami, for one term in Congress between 2019 and 2021. After leaving office, Murcarsel-Powell joined the gun violence prevention organization Giffords, founded by former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, as a senior adviser. She's previously worked in academic administration, including as an associate dean at Florida International University.\nShe's facing off against Scott, who is a longtime fixture in Florida politics. He served as the state's governor between 2011 and 2019 and went on to beat out Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson to win his Senate seat in 2018.\nA Democratic candidate hasn't won statewide in Florida since 2018.\nIn this year's Senate race, the USA TODAY/Ipsos poll shows that more than 20% of Democrats don't know who they'll vote for yet. But, more Democrats (9%) than Republicans (3%) say they don't plan on casting a ballot in the November Senate race.\nAnd 8% of Democrats surveyed said they were willing to cross party lines to vote for Scott, compared to just 2% of Republicans who were willing to do the same for Mucarsel-Powell.\nThe Florida race could play a pivotal role in the battle for control of the Senate. Democrats currently hold a 51-49 majority in the chamber, but are facing a slate of challenging races in 2024. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin's retirement heavily favors a Republican to take his seat in deep-red West Virginia, and races in Montana, Nevada and Ohio are all considered toss-ups. A Democratic pick-up of Scott's seat in Florida would be a major upset.\nSusan MacManus, a retired political science professor at the University of South Florida, argued that even with abortion on the ballot, Mucarsel-Powell will need name recognition to win the Senate race.\n'It's not impossible to get name ID, but name ID requires money and publicity and news,' MacManus said. 'That's why there's such a big push to get the Biden administration, the DNC and their deep-pocketed Democrats to pour money into Florida.'\nIn 2022, Republicans outspent Democrats in Florida by more than $100 million and GOP candidates, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, outperformed their Democratic competitors. If Democrats want to even the playing field this year, MacManus argued that they'll need to up their investment.\nShe also cautioned that Democrats like Mucarsel-Powell need to do a better job of communicating with young voters, who typically aren't affiliated with a political party.\n'They have to have a high turnout in a fairly cohesive vote among younger voters. In this state to be able to win statewide because the older voters leaned a little bit more Republican and their higher turnout,' she said.\nScott narrowly leads Mucarsel-Powell among independent voters in the state 28% to 25%, according to the USA TODAY/Ipsos survey. More than 20% of those polled said they don't know who they'll support in the race and 12% said they don't plan on voting.\nThe poll has a margin of error of +/-4.1%.",

The tables turned over the years, with 5% more of American voters identifying as Democrats over Republicans in 2020. However, the Pew results from 2023 reveal a significant shift in party affiliation this cycle, reporting that 49% of voters identify as Democrat or leaning Democrat, while 48% identify as Republican or leaning Republican.\nAdditionally, about 33% of respondents said they identify as being conservative or moderate in 2023, while the other side of the aisle only sees 23% identifying as liberal Democrats or leaning liberal.\nBLACK GEORGIA VOTERS ABANDONING BIDEN SAY THEY'RE SENDING MESSAGES ON GAZA: ‘DEMOCRATS SHOULD LISTEN'\nThe poll found that while Democrats remain the party of choice for most Hispanic, Black and Asian voters, party support among non-Hispanic White Democratic voters has dropped 21 percentage points since 1996, falling from 77% to 56% in 2023.\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\nRecent polls have found that despite their advantage, Democratic support among minority voters is shrinking.

While Biden won the 2020 election against Trump, Pew's analysis reveals a potential shift in the political landscape that could be echoed on the ballot this fall.\nPew Research Center conducted the surveys via telephone for the results dating 1994 to 2018, and via online surveys from 2019 to 2023 among registered voters.\nOriginal article source: New data reveals voters are shifting to this major political party ahead of heated 2024 rematch",

            "excerpt": "An exclusive USA TODAY/Ipsos poll showcases the tough fight ahead for Florida Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell in her campaign against incumbent Republican Sen. Rick Scott.",
            "summary": "Florida Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell may face even tougher odds than previously thought in her bid to unseat Republican Sen. Rick Scott.\nA new USA TODAY/Ipsos poll published Saturday finds that 74% of Florida voters have never heard of Mucarsel-Powell. That includes an overwhelming 61% of the state's Democratic voters and 78% of the independents the Democratic candidate is relying on to narrow her opponents lead in the race.\nScott edged Mucarsel-Powell 36%-26% in the poll, fielded between April 5 through April 7.\nThe results may dampen Democrats' hopes that the Florida Supreme Court's recent abortion ruling would boost Mucarsel-Powell's chances in the conservative-leaning state. In early April, the court upheld Florida's 15-week abortion ban and OK'd a ballot measure that, if passed, would protect access to the procedure in the state.\nAt the time of the ruling, experts suggested that the abortion ballot measure could incentivize liberal-leaning voters to head to the polls in November – which would help Democratic candidates like Mucarsel-Powell.\nBut, with eight months to go until the election, Mucarsel-Powell's low name recognition across the state could prove to be a major barrier in an already difficult-to-win race.\nMucarsel-Powell, 53, represented Florida's 26th District, which includes parts of Miami, for one term in Congress between 2019 and 2021. After leaving office, Murcarsel-Powell joined the gun violence prevention organization Giffords, founded by former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, as a senior adviser. She's previously worked in academic administration, including as an associate dean at Florida International University.\nShe's facing off against Scott, who is a longtime fixture in Florida politics. He served as the state's governor between 2011 and 2019 and went on to beat out Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson to win his Senate seat in 2018.\nA Democratic candidate hasn't won statewide in Florida since 2018.\nIn this year's Senate race, the USA TODAY/Ipsos poll shows that more than 20% of Democrats don't know who they'll vote for yet. But, more Democrats (9%) than Republicans (3%) say they don't plan on casting a ballot in the November Senate race.\nAnd 8% of Democrats surveyed said they were willing to cross party lines to vote for Scott, compared to just 2% of Republicans who were willing to do the same for Mucarsel-Powell.\nThe Florida race could play a pivotal role in the battle for control of the Senate. Democrats currently hold a 51-49 majority in the chamber, but are facing a slate of challenging races in 2024. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin's retirement heavily favors a Republican to take his seat in deep-red West Virginia, and races in Montana, Nevada and Ohio are all considered toss-ups. A Democratic pick-up of Scott's seat in Florida would be a major upset.\nSusan MacManus, a retired political science professor at the University of South Florida, argued that even with abortion on the ballot, Mucarsel-Powell will need name recognition to win the Senate race.\n'It's not impossible to get name ID, but name ID requires money and publicity and news,' MacManus said. 'That's why there's such a big push to get the Biden administration, the DNC and their deep-pocketed Democrats to pour money into Florida.'\nIn 2022, Republicans outspent Democrats in Florida by more than $100 million and GOP candidates, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, outperformed their Democratic competitors. If Democrats want to even the playing field this year, MacManus argued that they'll need to up their investment.\nShe also cautioned that Democrats like Mucarsel-Powell need to do a better job of communicating with young voters, who typically aren't affiliated with a political party.\n'They have to have a high turnout in a fairly cohesive vote among younger voters. In this state to be able to win statewide because the older voters leaned a little bit more Republican and their higher turnout,' she said.\nScott narrowly leads Mucarsel-Powell among independent voters in the state 28% to 25%, according to the USA TODAY/Ipsos survey. More than 20% of those polled said they don't know who they'll support in the race and 12% said they don't plan on voting.\nThe poll has a margin of error of +/-4.1%.",

            "summary": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The two parties in Pennsylvania's state House and its congressional delegation are nearly evenly divided, and that won't change once results are in from next week's primary election.\nBut come November, the candidates the parties will select April 23 for hundreds of legislative seats could alter what has been years of policy paralysis in Harrisburg and the similar partisan deadlock in Congress.\nThe state's voters will also cast primary ballots for this year's marquee contests for president and U.S. Senate. Democratic incumbents Joe Biden and Bob Casey and Republican challengers Donald Trump and Dave McCormick are shoo-ins to appear on the fall ballot.\nBoth parties will pick candidates for state attorney general, which was in Republican hands before Democrats went on a winning streak starting in 2012.\nIn the two other statewide 'row office' contests, Republicans Stacy Garrity, the treasurer, and Tim DeFoor, the auditor general, will find out which Democrats will try to unseat them in the fall.\nGENERAL ASSEMBLY\nIt took months and several special elections before Democrats were able to nail down their return to majority control of the state House last year, elevating one of their own to speaker in a chamber where the partisan breakdown is now 102-100. One seat, in a Poconos district where a Republican resigned in February, is vacant and will be filled by special election on primary day.\nWith the entire chamber on the ballot this year, Republicans would love to flip it back, denying Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro legislative leverage in policy and budget battles.\nIn the state Senate, where Republicans hold a 28-22 majority, Democrats would need to flip at least three seats in order for Democratic Lt. Gov. Austin Davis' tie-breaking vote to give them control.\nAmong the 25 Senate seats up this year, nearly half the total, or 12 incumbent senators, face no opponents this year.\nThere are contested Senate primaries in both parties for notable vacancies in a Republican-held seat in the Harrisburg area and a Democratic-held seat in Pittsburgh. The third vacancy is a Republican majority district in northern York County.\nLEGISLATIVE SHAKEUP\nDemocratic Rep. Nick Pisciottano, of Allegheny County, is leaving the House to run, along with two other Democrats and two Republicans, for a state Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Jim Brewster, D-Allegheny.\nRep. Dawn Keefer, R-York, is departing the lower chamber in a run to succeed retiring Sen. Mike Regan, R-York. Another House departure is Rep. Patty Kim, of Dauphin County, facing off against another Democrat for the nomination in the third Senate district involving a retirement, that of Sen. John DiSanto, R-Dauphin. Two Republicans also are vying to succeed DiSanto.\nDiSanto's seat is widely seen as the Senate Democrats' best chance for a pickup. Their longshot bid for the majority also likely would require beating Sen. Dan Laughlin, R-Erie, and Sen. Devlin Robinson, a first-term Republican whose district surrounds the western side of Pittsburgh.\nSen. Dave Argall, of Schuylkill County, who heads the GOP's Senate campaign effort, said a razor-close win for Brewster four years ago makes that a battleground, but their efforts to stay in the majority are wider.\n'There are going to be battles all across the state, but it's still pretty early to predict which ones are going to rise to the top of the list,' Argall said.\nLawmakers in nearly half of the 203 House seats, and slightly more Democrats than Republicans, have no primary or General Election opponents this year and can plan on serving another term starting in January.\nThere aren't many House vacancies this cycle: just nine seats held by Republicans and four by Democrats. Retiring members include Berks County Rep. Mark Rozzi, who spent a brief but notable time as House speaker early last year before fellow Democrats could muster the votes to elect their first choice to lead the chamber, Speaker Joanna McClinton of Philadelphia.\nReps. Ryan Mackenzie, of Lehigh County, and Rob Mercuri, of Allegheny, are relinquishing House seats to run in Republican primaries for Democratic-held congressional seats. Hedging their bets are Rep. Ryan Bizzarro, of Erie, and Rep. Jared Solomon, of Philadelphia, seeking reelection in the state House and running in Democratic primaries for state treasurer and state attorney general, respectively.\nCONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION\nAll 17 of Pennsylvania's incumbent members of the U.S. House of Representatives are running for another term, each with at least one opponent in the primary or fall elections. Court-ordered redistricting after the 2020 Census produced a 9-8 Democratic edge, and when the incumbents ran for reelection two years ago, all 17 were reelected.\nIn Allegheny County, freshman U.S. Rep. Summer Lee has a Democratic primary opponent, Bhavini Patel, as well as a Republican positioned to take on the Democratic winner in November.\nIn a district Democrats hope to flip, a race north of Philadelphia could signal how much power the abortion issue has in the suburbs. U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a centrist Republican, has a primary opponent whose anti-abortion position would not permit exceptions for rape or incest.\nThere is a three-way GOP primary for the nomination to take on Lehigh Valley Democratic U.S. Rep. Susan Wild in the fall. Wild's previous two wins were by single-digit margins. Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Democrat from the Scranton area who also has been repeatedly targeted in recent years, has no primary opponent, but a Republican looks to challenge him in November.\nSix Democrats are on the primary ballot in a district held by U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, a York County Republican who was deeply involved in efforts by then-President Donald Trump to overturn Trump's 2020 election defeat. Perry's prominent role in the ultra-right Freedom Caucus in Congress and some close reelection contests over the past six years also are making him a target for Democrats this year.\nSTATEWIDE ROW OFFICES\nAfter Shapiro's election as governor two years ago created a vacancy in his former job as state attorney general, he nominated his protege, Michelle Henry, to serve through the end of this year. She is not seeking to stay in the job.\nFive Democrats are running for the nomination: Philadelphia attorney Keir Bradford-Grey, former auditor general and state Rep. Eugene DePasquale, of Allegheny County, former prosecutor and Bucks County solicitor Joe Khan, Philadelphia state Rep. Jared Solomon and Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer.\nTwo Republicans are running: York County District Attorney Dave Sunday and state Rep. Craig Williams, of Delaware County. Sunday received his party's endorsement, while Williams has been helping lead House Republicans' efforts to remove from office progressive Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat.\nFor auditor general, state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, of Philadelphia, and Lehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley are the Democrats seeking to run against DeFoor in November. Kenyatta finished third in the Democratic U.S. Senate primary in 2022 won by John Fetterman.\nGarrity, the state treasurer, has no opposition in the GOP primary. Democratic voters will choose between Bizzarro and Erin McClelland, an addiction recovery and human services professional from Allegheny County.",

In Wyoming, Democrats will award 13 delegates using a presidential preference vote held at 23 county-level caucuses. (AP Photo/Robert Yoon, File) JUNEAU, Alaska — President Joe Biden looks to nudge further ahead in his party's nomination for reelection with Democratic voting Saturday in Wyoming and Alaska. As two of the least populated states, Alaska and Wyoming play minuscule roles in both intraparty and general election voting in presidential election years. Biden effectively clinched the Democratic nomination on March 12 with the Georgia primary and is now all but certain to face former President Donald Trump as the Republican nominee in November. ALASKA Alaska Democrats will hold a voice vote for their party-run preference poll at in-person and virtual district meetings Saturday. Biden is the only candidate on the ballot after the other Democrat to qualify, Dean Phillips, suspended his campaign last month. The vote is being held during meetings where other party business is conducted. The polling was delayed a week. Democrats had planned a ranked vote election by mail on April 6 but those plans changed when just two candidates — Biden and Phillips — qualified for the ballot and when Phillips suspended his run. Changes to their plan were approved by the Democratic National Committee. Biden was the only candidate on the ballot, with no provisions for write-ins or uncommitted, said Lindsay Kavanaugh, the Alaska party's executive director. 'There is no option to vote nay,' she said. 'You can abstain. You don't vote yes or no, you vote for a candidate.' The party proceeded with a vote, even with just one candidate, 'to make sure we're as inclusive as possible,' she said, and to avoid any inference that party leaders were deciding candidates themselves. Alaska will allocate 15 pledged delegates based on Saturday's vote. WYOMING Wyoming's Democrats will hold county caucuses Saturday where polling will determine which presidential candidate gets the state's 17 national delegates. The caucuses will also determine who goes to the state Democratic convention on June 1 in Casper. There, 13 of Wyoming's national convention delegates will be chosen. Wyoming's other four 'automatic' national delegates are the state party chairman, vice chair and two national committee people, who've not yet pledged for Biden or anyone else. The winner of Saturday's presidential poll will get the first-round vote of all 17 Wyoming delegates at the national convention. Should more rounds of voting be needed, the delegates will then be free to vote for whomever they wish. ___ Gruver reported from Cheyenne, Wyoming.

            "excerpt": "An exclusive USA TODAY/Ipsos poll showcases the tough fight ahead for Florida Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell in her campaign against incumbent Republican Sen. Rick Scott.",
            "summary": "Florida Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell may face even tougher odds than previously thought in her bid to unseat Republican Sen. Rick Scott.\nA new USA TODAY/Ipsos poll published Saturday finds that 74% of Florida voters have never heard of Mucarsel-Powell. That includes an overwhelming 61% of the state's Democratic voters and 78% of the independents the Democratic candidate is relying on to narrow her opponents lead in the race.\nScott edged Mucarsel-Powell 36%-26% in the poll, fielded between April 5 through April 7.\nThe results may dampen Democrats' hopes that the Florida Supreme Court's recent abortion ruling would boost Mucarsel-Powell's chances in the conservative-leaning state. In early April, the court upheld Florida's 15-week abortion ban and OK'd a ballot measure that, if passed, would protect access to the procedure in the state.\nAt the time of the ruling, experts suggested that the abortion ballot measure could incentivize liberal-leaning voters to head to the polls in November – which would help Democratic candidates like Mucarsel-Powell.\nBut, with eight months to go until the election, Mucarsel-Powell's low name recognition across the state could prove to be a major barrier in an already difficult-to-win race.\nMucarsel-Powell, 53, represented Florida's 26th District, which includes parts of Miami, for one term in Congress between 2019 and 2021. After leaving office, Murcarsel-Powell joined the gun violence prevention organization Giffords, founded by former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, as a senior adviser. She's previously worked in academic administration, including as an associate dean at Florida International University.\nShe's facing off against Scott, who is a longtime fixture in Florida politics. He served as the state's governor between 2011 and 2019 and went on to beat out Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson to win his Senate seat in 2018.\nA Democratic candidate hasn't won statewide in Florida since 2018.\nIn this year's Senate race, the USA TODAY/Ipsos poll shows that more than 20% of Democrats don't know who they'll vote for yet. But, more Democrats (9%) than Republicans (3%) say they don't plan on casting a ballot in the November Senate race.\nAnd 8% of Democrats surveyed said they were willing to cross party lines to vote for Scott, compared to just 2% of Republicans who were willing to do the same for Mucarsel-Powell.\nThe Florida race could play a pivotal role in the battle for control of the Senate. Democrats currently hold a 51-49 majority in the chamber, but are facing a slate of challenging races in 2024. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin's retirement heavily favors a Republican to take his seat in deep-red West Virginia, and races in Montana, Nevada and Ohio are all considered toss-ups. A Democratic pick-up of Scott's seat in Florida would be a major upset.\nSusan MacManus, a retired political science professor at the University of South Florida, argued that even with abortion on the ballot, Mucarsel-Powell will need name recognition to win the Senate race.\n'It's not impossible to get name ID, but name ID requires money and publicity and news,' MacManus said. 'That's why there's such a big push to get the Biden administration, the DNC and their deep-pocketed Democrats to pour money into Florida.'\nIn 2022, Republicans outspent Democrats in Florida by more than $100 million and GOP candidates, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, outperformed their Democratic competitors. If Democrats want to even the playing field this year, MacManus argued that they'll need to up their investment.\nShe also cautioned that Democrats like Mucarsel-Powell need to do a better job of communicating with young voters, who typically aren't affiliated with a political party.\n'They have to have a high turnout in a fairly cohesive vote among younger voters. In this state to be able to win statewide because the older voters leaned a little bit more Republican and their higher turnout,' she said.\nScott narrowly leads Mucarsel-Powell among independent voters in the state 28% to 25%, according to the USA TODAY/Ipsos survey. More than 20% of those polled said they don't know who they'll support in the race and 12% said they don't plan on voting.\nThe poll has a margin of error of +/-4.1%.",

            "summary": "Florida Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell may face even tougher odds than previously thought in her bid to unseat Republican Sen. Rick Scott.\nA new USA TODAY/Ipsos poll published Saturday finds that 74% of Florida voters have never heard of Mucarsel-Powell. That includes an overwhelming 61% of the state's Democratic voters and 78% of the independents the Democratic candidate is relying on to narrow her opponents lead in the race.\nScott edged Mucarsel-Powell 36%-26% in the poll, fielded between April 5 through April 7.\nThe results may dampen Democrats' hopes that the Florida Supreme Court's recent abortion ruling would boost Mucarsel-Powell's chances in the conservative-leaning state. In early April, the court upheld Florida's 15-week abortion ban and OK'd a ballot measure that, if passed, would protect access to the procedure in the state.\nAt the time of the ruling, experts suggested that the abortion ballot measure could incentivize liberal-leaning voters to head to the polls in November – which would help Democratic candidates like Mucarsel-Powell.\nBut, with eight months to go until the election, Mucarsel-Powell's low name recognition across the state could prove to be a major barrier in an already difficult-to-win race.\nMucarsel-Powell, 53, represented Florida's 26th District, which includes parts of Miami, for one term in Congress between 2019 and 2021. After leaving office, Murcarsel-Powell joined the gun violence prevention organization Giffords, founded by former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, as a senior adviser. She's previously worked in academic administration, including as an associate dean at Florida International University.\nShe's facing off against Scott, who is a longtime fixture in Florida politics. He served as the state's governor between 2011 and 2019 and went on to beat out Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson to win his Senate seat in 2018.\nA Democratic candidate hasn't won statewide in Florida since 2018.\nIn this year's Senate race, the USA TODAY/Ipsos poll shows that more than 20% of Democrats don't know who they'll vote for yet. But, more Democrats (9%) than Republicans (3%) say they don't plan on casting a ballot in the November Senate race.\nAnd 8% of Democrats surveyed said they were willing to cross party lines to vote for Scott, compared to just 2% of Republicans who were willing to do the same for Mucarsel-Powell.\nThe Florida race could play a pivotal role in the battle for control of the Senate. Democrats currently hold a 51-49 majority in the chamber, but are facing a slate of challenging races in 2024. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin's retirement heavily favors a Republican to take his seat in deep-red West Virginia, and races in Montana, Nevada and Ohio are all considered toss-ups. A Democratic pick-up of Scott's seat in Florida would be a major upset.\nSusan MacManus, a retired political science professor at the University of South Florida, argued that even with abortion on the ballot, Mucarsel-Powell will need name recognition to win the Senate race.\n'It's not impossible to get name ID, but name ID requires money and publicity and news,' MacManus said. 'That's why there's such a big push to get the Biden administration, the DNC and their deep-pocketed Democrats to pour money into Florida.'\nIn 2022, Republicans outspent Democrats in Florida by more than $100 million and GOP candidates, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, outperformed their Democratic competitors. If Democrats want to even the playing field this year, MacManus argued that they'll need to up their investment.\nShe also cautioned that Democrats like Mucarsel-Powell need to do a better job of communicating with young voters, who typically aren't affiliated with a political party.\n'They have to have a high turnout in a fairly cohesive vote among younger voters. In this state to be able to win statewide because the older voters leaned a little bit more Republican and their higher turnout,' she said.\nScott narrowly leads Mucarsel-Powell among independent voters in the state 28% to 25%, according to the USA TODAY/Ipsos survey. More than 20% of those polled said they don't know who they'll support in the race and 12% said they don't plan on voting.\nThe poll has a margin of error of +/-4.1%.",

            "summary": "Democrats are somehow routinely shocked when their partisan power grabs are met with GOP retaliation despite the Democratic Party coming out on the worse end of these exchanges several times in the past decade.\nThe GOP retaliation now is taking the form of Ohio and Alabama threatening to exclude President Joe Biden from the ballot in 2024. The later Democratic National Committee nominating convention falls after several state deadlines, which has been the case for both parties for years. Republicans in Ohio and Alabama are threatening to buck the precedent of both parties offering exemptions to each other in these scenarios in order to keep Biden off the ballot.\n\"This has not been something anybody has ever dealt with,' DNC member Elaine Karmarck said. 'No, this has never happened before.' And sure, while this exact method of and justification for keeping a major party candidate off the ballot may not have happened before, we are just one month removed from the Supreme Court having to intervene because Democrats wanted to keep former President Donald Trump off the ballot in several states.\nIn case you need a reminder, the Colorado Supreme Court and Maine's secretary of state both decided that Trump should be barred from the ballot despite Congress not determining that Trump had committed insurrection. In Illinois, a partisan Democratic judge overruled the State Board of Elections to ban Trump from the ballot. State legislators in New York and California's lieutenant governor also wanted to join in on this power grab.\nShould Ohio and Alabama be doing this? Of course not. But are we supposed to be surprised that Republicans would use the letter of the law to retaliate in kind for Democrats ignoring the law to keep their opponent off the ballot?\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\nYou would think Democrats would understand this better than anyone by now. Trump was able to get three justices confirmed to the Supreme Court because Republicans nuked the judicial filibuster in response to Democrats nuking the filibuster for other nominations. House Democrats started removing Republicans from committees over partisan disputes in 2022, and so Republicans responded in kind when they took back the chamber. When Democrats break a norm to grab power, Republicans respond.\nThis was always going to happen, and it is why Democrats should not have allowed this to reach this point in the first place or cheered it on as it happened. This is yet another slippery slope that Democrats have pushed a political norm down, only to be surprised that Republicans would respond as they always have.",

            "summary": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The two parties in Pennsylvania's state House and its congressional delegation are nearly evenly divided, and that won't change once results are in from next week's primary election.\nBut come November, the candidates the parties will select April 23 for hundreds of legislative seats could alter what has been years of policy paralysis in Harrisburg and the similar partisan deadlock in Congress.\nThe state's voters will also cast primary ballots for this year's marquee contests for president and U.S. Senate. Democratic incumbents Joe Biden and Bob Casey and Republican challengers Donald Trump and Dave McCormick are shoo-ins to appear on the fall ballot.\nBoth parties will pick candidates for state attorney general, which was in Republican hands before Democrats went on a winning streak starting in 2012.\nIn the two other statewide 'row office' contests, Republicans Stacy Garrity, the treasurer, and Tim DeFoor, the auditor general, will find out which Democrats will try to unseat them in the fall.\nGENERAL ASSEMBLY\nIt took months and several special elections before Democrats were able to nail down their return to majority control of the state House last year, elevating one of their own to speaker in a chamber where the partisan breakdown is now 102-100. One seat, in a Poconos district where a Republican resigned in February, is vacant and will be filled by special election on primary day.\nWith the entire chamber on the ballot this year, Republicans would love to flip it back, denying Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro legislative leverage in policy and budget battles.\nIn the state Senate, where Republicans hold a 28-22 majority, Democrats would need to flip at least three seats in order for Democratic Lt. Gov. Austin Davis' tie-breaking vote to give them control.\nAmong the 25 Senate seats up this year, nearly half the total, or 12 incumbent senators, face no opponents this year.\nThere are contested Senate primaries in both parties for notable vacancies in a Republican-held seat in the Harrisburg area and a Democratic-held seat in Pittsburgh. The third vacancy is a Republican majority district in northern York County.\nLEGISLATIVE SHAKEUP\nDemocratic Rep. Nick Pisciottano, of Allegheny County, is leaving the House to run, along with two other Democrats and two Republicans, for a state Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Jim Brewster, D-Allegheny.\nRep. Dawn Keefer, R-York, is departing the lower chamber in a run to succeed retiring Sen. Mike Regan, R-York. Another House departure is Rep. Patty Kim, of Dauphin County, facing off against another Democrat for the nomination in the third Senate district involving a retirement, that of Sen. John DiSanto, R-Dauphin. Two Republicans also are vying to succeed DiSanto.\nDiSanto's seat is widely seen as the Senate Democrats' best chance for a pickup. Their longshot bid for the majority also likely would require beating Sen. Dan Laughlin, R-Erie, and Sen. Devlin Robinson, a first-term Republican whose district surrounds the western side of Pittsburgh.\nSen. Dave Argall, of Schuylkill County, who heads the GOP's Senate campaign effort, said a razor-close win for Brewster four years ago makes that a battleground, but their efforts to stay in the majority are wider.\n'There are going to be battles all across the state, but it's still pretty early to predict which ones are going to rise to the top of the list,\" Argall said.\nLawmakers in nearly half of the 203 House seats, and slightly more Democrats than Republicans, have no primary or General Election opponents this year and can plan on serving another term starting in January.\nThere aren't many House vacancies this cycle: just nine seats held by Republicans and four by Democrats. Retiring members include Berks County Rep. Mark Rozzi, who spent a brief but notable time as House speaker early last year before fellow Democrats could muster the votes to elect their first choice to lead the chamber, Speaker Joanna McClinton of Philadelphia.\nReps. Ryan Mackenzie, of Lehigh County, and Rob Mercuri, of Allegheny, are relinquishing House seats to run in Republican primaries for Democratic-held congressional seats. Hedging their bets are Rep. Ryan Bizzarro, of Erie, and Rep. Jared Solomon, of Philadelphia, seeking reelection in the state House and running in Democratic primaries for state treasurer and state attorney general, respectively.\nCONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION\nAll 17 of Pennsylvania's incumbent members of the U.S. House of Representatives are running for another term, each with at least one opponent in the primary or fall elections. Court-ordered redistricting after the 2020 Census produced a 9-8 Democratic edge, and when the incumbents ran for reelection two years ago, all 17 were reelected.\nIn Allegheny County, freshman U.S. Rep. Summer Lee has a Democratic primary opponent, Bhavini Patel, as well as a Republican positioned to take on the Democratic winner in November.\nIn a district Democrats hope to flip, a race north of Philadelphia could signal how much power the abortion issue has in the suburbs. U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a centrist Republican, has a primary opponent whose anti-abortion position would not permit exceptions for rape or incest.\nThere is a three-way GOP primary for the nomination to take on Lehigh Valley Democratic U.S. Rep. Susan Wild in the fall. Wild's previous two wins were by single-digit margins. Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Democrat from the Scranton area who also has been repeatedly targeted in recent years, has no primary opponent, but a Republican looks to challenge him in November.\nSix Democrats are on the primary ballot in a district held by U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, a York County Republican who was deeply involved in efforts by then-President Donald Trump to overturn Trump's 2020 election defeat. Perry's prominent role in the ultra-right Freedom Caucus in Congress and some close reelection contests over the past six years also are making him a target for Democrats this year.\nSTATEWIDE ROW OFFICES\nAfter Shapiro's election as governor two years ago created a vacancy in his former job as state attorney general, he nominated his protege, Michelle Henry, to serve through the end of this year. She is not seeking to stay in the job.\nFive Democrats are running for the nomination: Philadelphia attorney Keir Bradford-Grey, former auditor general and state Rep. Eugene DePasquale, of Allegheny County, former prosecutor and Bucks County solicitor Joe Khan, Philadelphia state Rep. Jared Solomon and Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer.\nTwo Republicans are running: York County District Attorney Dave Sunday and state Rep. Craig Williams, of Delaware County. Sunday received his party's endorsement, while Williams has been helping lead House Republicans' efforts to remove from office progressive Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat.\nFor auditor general, state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, of Philadelphia, and Lehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley are the Democrats seeking to run against DeFoor in November. Kenyatta finished third in the Democratic U.S. Senate primary in 2022 won by John Fetterman.\nGarrity, the state treasurer, has no opposition in the GOP primary. Democratic voters will choose between Bizzarro and Erin McClelland, an addiction recovery and human services professional from Allegheny County.\nNewsletter Success!

            "summary": "House Democrats are engaged in a widespread whip operation aimed at persuading progressive stragglers to sign onto a discharge petition to force a vote on the Senate's Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan aid bill, Axios has learned.\nWhy it matters: Democrats want a display of party unity to strengthen their hand with Republicans ahead of potential votes on Ukraine and Israel aid as soon as next week.\nBut more than a dozen pro-Palestinian progressives have refused to sign on in protest of the military assistance for Israel in the Senate bill.\nWhat we're hearing:\"There is some whipping going on and I know of a couple people who have signed on as a result,\" one House Democrat told Axios.\nThe operation includes \"multiple members who care about Ukraine,\" the lawmaker said, adding that \"leadership has asked us to reach out to our friends within the caucus who haven't signed on yet.\"\nA Democratic leadership source told Axios that \"it's safe to say all hands are on deck.\"\nAmong those involved in the effort are former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), former House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Congressional Ukrainian Caucus co-chair Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio).\nBy the numbers: The discharge petition currently has signatures from 193 of the House's 213 Democrats.\nMost of the holdouts are pro-Palestinian progressives such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.).\nRep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), a centrist co-leading a competing, bipartisan foreign aid discharge petition who has previously spoken out against party-line discharge petitions, has also not signed on.\nZoom in: The discharge petition was launched nearly a month ago, but signatures have continued to trickle in over time.\nJust this week, several Democrats signed on, including Reps. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.) and Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.).\nGomez said he \"wasn't sure how successful a discharge petition would be,\" but he and Pelosi \"discussed the strategy\" and he came away feeling \"confident that it would be successful.\"\nOne senior House Democrat pointed to Pelosi as the discharge petition's most effective salesperson.\nYes, but: Many of the remaining progressive holdouts, incensed at Israel's treatment of human rights in Gaza, are likely un-gettable, sources involved in the whip effort say.\nRep. Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.) said she spoke with leadership. but \"I cannot, in good conscience, give another dollar to the [Israeli] administration.\"\nThe latest: Hoyer and Pelosi, in the House Democrats' whip meeting on Thursday, made the case for progressives to help force a vote even if they plan to oppose the bill itself, according to multiple sources.\nThey argued that the discharge petition should be treated like \"rule\" votes, which authorize debate and votes on legislation. Members of the majority party in past Congresses traditionally supported rules regardless of their feelings on the underlying bill.\nThe argument evokes a stark contrast with House Republicans, who have increasingly struggled to pass such previously routine procedural votes.\nIn an interview with Axios, Hoyer said he argued that Democratic unity on such votes was \"the reason we were so successful in the last Congress.\"\nWhat's next: House Speaker Mike Johnson 's (R-La.) colleagues say they expect him to hold votes on Ukraine and Israel aid in some form next week.\n\"My understanding is we're going to vote on something,\" Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Calif.), the Defense Appropriations subcommittee chair, told Axios.\nBut, much to Democrats' frustration, the Ukraine vote Johnson holds likely won't be on the Senate bill.\nThe bottom line: Asked about Democratic holdouts at a press conference on Thursday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) instead called for \"just a handful of Republicans, 20 or 25 at most ... to join House Democrats.\"\nStill, the senior House Democrat said Democratic unity means \"every single Republican who won't sign is responsible\" for Ukraine aid stalling.\n\"Arguably it's still the case if we're at 200 [signatures], but getting to a better number helps.\"",

It's dividing traditionally progressive groups, including Pittsburgh's sizable Jewish community, in ways that don't always fall neatly along ethnic or cultural lines. But it's an especially potent issue in Lee's district, which is home to the synagogue where a gunman in 2018 killed 11 congregants in the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.\nThe April 23 primary could shed light on whether the war alone is enough to turn a critical mass of Democrats against Lee.\n'It clearly is big enough with a certain group in this district,' said Sam Hens-Greco, the party chair in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. 'Whether it is big enough for the entire populace, we're going to find out.'\nIf Lee is defeated, she would be the first Democratic incumbent in Congress to lose a primary this year. Other progressive Democrats, including Reps.

At Biden's State of the Union speech, Lee donned a kaffiyeh, a checkered scarf that has come to symbolize solidarity with Palestinians.\nPatel, 30, a small-town municipal councilwoman who worked in former Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald's administration, declared her candidacy a few days before Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Patel, who is Hindu and of Indian heritage, has cultivated the Jewish community, opening a campaign office in the Jewish enclave in Squirrel Hill, attended post-Oct. 7 vigils and bussed with community members to a pro-Israel rally in Washington in November.\nMost recently, Patel has hammered Lee for being aligned with backers of the ' uncommitted ' campaign that is encouraging Democrats to protest Biden's handling of the war voting 'uncommitted' in primaries.\nThat, Patel suggested, is dangerous.\n'I would say that every Democrat in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District should take notice that my opponent is equivocating on her support for President Biden and failed to denounce the ‘uncommitted' movement,' Patel said in an interview. 'I think that is the issue that is a big concern for Democrats in this district.\"\nLee defended the 'uncommitted\" movement, saying it's wrong to discourage people from voting and potentially lose a crucial part of the electorate that Democrats want to persuade to support Biden in November's presidential contest. Biden recognizes that, as well, Lee said.\nLee said she has met with people on all sides of the war, including families of hostages and families of Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza, and that her calls for a cease-fire reflect the district's majority.\nLee also accused Patel of aligning herself more with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than with Biden.\n'Joe Biden is now coming more into alignment with us, which means that, no, we were not wrong to come out early and to come out strong, because as we're seeing now this was always where we needed to get,' Lee said in an interview. 'This was always the only pathway to peace.'\nFor now, the sharpest questions about the war have largely been limited to debate exchanges between Lee and Patel.\nThe issue has barely registered on the airwaves, and pro-Israel groups that spent heavily to try to defeat Lee in the 2022 primary — Democratic Majority for Israel and the American Israel Public Affairs committee, better known as AIPAC — haven't waded into the race.\nIn Pennsylvania, one potential boost for Lee could come from college students who, unlike in 2022's primary, will be on campus this time. At the University of Pittsburgh, the war has had a 'commanding presence' on campus, with most students for a cease-fire, said Will Allison, president of Pitt's College Democrats.\nThe group endorsed Lee unanimously, despite the war causing some division among members, and the College Democrats are campaigning for Lee.\nIn one possible sign of shifting politics around the war, the 14th Ward Independent Democratic Club, a nonparty organization based around Squirrel Hill, voted to endorse Patel after backing Lee in 2022.\nSue Berman Kress, a Patel supporter who is Jewish, said she knows some Jewish Democrats who won't vote for Lee again. They feel she's abandoned the Jewish community and that her politics could open the door to a Trump victory and a surge in antisemitism.\n'Those things feel very divisive in a way that's very scary,' Kress said.\n___\nFollow Marc Levy at twitter.com/timelywriter.\nMarc Levy, The Associated Press",

Bob Casey, and a constellation of progressive groups that include both Jewish and Muslim organizations.\nThe first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania, the 36-year-old Lee is a Howard University law school graduate and community activist who began her political career in 2018 with a successful challenge from the left to an entrenched Pittsburgh-area state lawmaker.\nIn this year's campaign, Lee has promoted herself as a hardworking representative who delivers for constituents and speaks in Congress for marginalized communities on issues from fighting inequality to climate change and bigotry, including antisemitism and Islamophobia.\nOn the Israel-Hamas war, Lee has condemned Hamas' attack, but has also accused Israel of committing 'war crimes' in Gaza, demanded an end to U.S. military aid to Israel and called for a cease-fire within days of the war starting as the best way to end the cycle of violence and work toward peace.\nThat set her apart from Biden's stance and that of most House Democrats, although now dozens more have joined her in calling for a cease-fire. At Biden's State of the Union speech, Lee donned a kaffiyeh, a checkered scarf that has come to symbolize solidarity with Palestinians.\nPatel, 30, a small-town municipal councilwoman who worked in former Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald's administration, declared her candidacy a few days before Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Patel, who is Hindu and of Indian heritage, has cultivated the Jewish community, opening a campaign office in the Jewish enclave in Squirrel Hill, attended post-Oct. 7 vigils and bussed with community members to a pro-Israel rally in Washington in November.\nMost recently, Patel has hammered Lee for being aligned with backers of the ' uncommitted ' campaign that is encouraging Democrats to protest Biden's handling of the war voting 'uncommitted' in primaries.\nThat, Patel suggested, is dangerous.\n'I would say that every Democrat in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District should take notice that my opponent is equivocating on her support for President Biden and failed to denounce the ‘uncommitted' movement,' Patel said in an interview. 'I think that is the issue that is a big concern for Democrats in this district.\"\nLee defended the 'uncommitted\" movement, saying it's wrong to discourage people from voting and potentially lose a crucial part of the electorate that Democrats want to persuade to support Biden in November's presidential contest. Biden recognizes that, as well, Lee said.\nLee said she has met with people on all sides of the war, including families of hostages and families of Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza, and that her calls for a cease-fire reflect the district's majority.\nLee also accused Patel of aligning herself more with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than with Biden.\n'Joe Biden is now coming more into alignment with us, which means that, no, we were not wrong to come out early and to come out strong, because as we're seeing now this was always where we needed to get,' Lee said in an interview. 'This was always the only pathway to peace.'\nFor now, the sharpest questions about the war have largely been limited to debate exchanges between Lee and Patel.\nThe issue has barely registered on the airwaves, and pro-Israel groups that spent heavily to try to defeat Lee in the 2022 primary — Democratic Majority for Israel and the American Israel Public Affairs committee, better known as AIPAC — haven't waded into the race.\nIn Pennsylvania, one potential boost for Lee could come from college students who, unlike in 2022's primary, will be on campus this time. At the University of Pittsburgh, the war has had a 'commanding presence' on campus, with most students for a cease-fire, said Will Allison, president of Pitt's College Democrats.\nThe group endorsed Lee unanimously, despite the war causing some division among members, and the College Democrats are campaigning for Lee.\nIn one possible sign of shifting politics around the war, the 14th Ward Independent Democratic Club, a nonparty organization based around Squirrel Hill, voted to endorse Patel after backing Lee in 2022.\nSue Berman Kress, a Patel supporter who is Jewish, said she knows some Jewish Democrats who won't vote for Lee again. They feel she's abandoned the Jewish community and that her politics could open the door to a Trump victory and a surge in antisemitism.\n'Those things feel very divisive in a way that's very scary,' Kress said.",

            "summary": "President Biden has nudged closer to the Democratic nomination for reelection by winning party contests in Wyoming and Alaska.\nAs two of the least populated states, Alaska and Wyoming play minuscule roles in intraparty and general election voting in presidential contests.\nBiden essentially clinched the Democratic nomination March 12 by winning the Georgia primary and is now all but certain to face former President Trump in November.\nAlaska Democrats held a voice vote for their party-run preference poll at in-person and virtual district meetings. The party announced Saturday that Biden won 15 pledged delegates.\nBiden was the lone candidate eligible to receive votes after the other Democrat to qualify, Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, suspended his campaign last month. The vote was held during meetings where other party business was conducted.\nThe polling was delayed a week. Democrats had planned a ranked-vote election by mail April 6, but that changed when only Biden and Phillips qualified for the ballot and Phillips quit the race.\nChanges to the voting procedure were approved by the Democratic National Committee.\nThere were no provisions for write-in or uncommitted voters, said Lindsay Kavanaugh, the Alaska Democratic Party's executive director.\n'There is no option to vote nay,' she said. 'You can abstain. You don't vote yes or no, you vote for a candidate.'\nThe party proceeded with a vote, even with just one candidate, 'to make sure we're as inclusive as possible,' she said, and to avoid any suggestion that party leaders were deciding on candidates themselves.\nIn Wyoming, Biden won polling to determine which candidate got the state's 17 national delegates.\nThe caucuses also decided who goes to the state Democratic convention June 1 in Casper. There, 13 of Wyoming's national convention delegates will be chosen.\nWyoming's other four 'automatic' national delegates are the state party chair, vice chair and two national committee members, who have not yet pledged for Biden or anyone else.\nBohrer and Gruver write for the Associated Press.

            "excerpt": "Trump's seemingly improbable rise as a political novice is thanks to the fracturing of the Democrat Party and a new political realignment.",
            "summary": "A recent Gallup poll showed Democrats' lead over Republicans with black voters 'has shrunk by nearly 20 points over the past three years,' and their lead among Hispanics has dropped 'nearly as much.' Gallup found that 66 percent of non-Hispanic black adults identify as Democrat or lean-Democrat, while 47 percent of Hispanics do. Both are enormous drops from 2020 exit polling, which showed 87 percent of blacks and 65 percent of Hispanics voting for Biden.\nFar bigger than just a loss of support for Biden, these figures point to a significant shift of partisan loyalty within communities that have been overwhelmingly Democratic. In political terms, their shift signals a potential realignment.\nFor over 70 years, America has been in what could be termed a period of dealignment. Starting with Eisenhower's 1952 presidential victory, America's two parties have alternated presidential power with striking regularity. In 18 elections, only once has a party held the White House more than two terms (Republicans winning in 1980, 1984, and 1988), and only twice has a party held it for only a single term (Democrats from 1977-1981 and Republicans from 2017-2021).\nAssuredly, these alternating presidential periods have not equated to total federal power shifts. Democrats' control of Congress extended well beyond its lock on the presidency, and there have been several instances since 1994, when Republicans broke through Democrats' congressional dominance, that presidential and congressional control have conflicted. Nonetheless, for seven decades, America has seen an amazingly consistent alternating of the federal government's primary power: the presidency.\nYet just because this is what we have known for three generations does not mean it is America's historical norm. Rather, historically the norm has been for a single party to control the presidency for relatively long periods. In short: an alignment that gave one party clear political dominance. Such was the case for Democrats in the 19th century up to the Civil War, for Republicans from the Civil War to the Depression, and then Democrats from 1932 to the mid-1960s.\nThe Civil War and the Depression clearly triggered realignments. What could be today's? The left's increasing radicalization and its increasing control of the Democrat Party. It would not be the first time the left has subverted Democrat dominance. In 1968, it broke with the Democrat Party — giving the election to Republican Richard Nixon — and in 1972, it fractured the Democrat Party — driving out the conservatives of the old New Deal coalition.\nJimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama successfully created their own coalitions from the left's remnants of the Democrat coalition. Four years ago, Joe Biden did too; today, Biden's base of support has dwindled to little more than the left itself and Democrats' most partisan faithful. This is manifest in Biden's low poll numbers and most profoundly in its erosion of Democrats' minority base.\nWith his conservative populist approach, Trump is capitalizing on the radical left's fracturing of the Democrat coalition; he did so in 2016. With Trump in the White House in 2020 amid the pandemic, the effectiveness of his populist versus elite strategy was blunted. However, while the 2024 race is once again a clear contest between the populous and the elite, Trump can capitalize on it only to a point. According to RealClearPolitics, Trump's average of national polling of a head-to-head rematch with Biden puts him at 45.5 percent — barely ahead of Biden (45.3 percent), and even behind his 2020 popular vote percentage of 46.9 percent.\nTrump remains a polarizing political figure. Again according to RealClearPolitics' national average, Trump's unfavourability rating of 53.6 percent is only slightly lower than Biden's at 55.3 percent. Trump will not fully realize Republicans' opportunity with conservative populism despite benefitting from it.\nHowever, a Trump victory could set the stage for Republicans to win far more than the White House for four years. Constitutionally barred from serving more than a single term, he must relinquish the populist baton. In the right hands, this could allow Republicans to solidify and magnify disaffected minorities' attachment to their party.\nTrump remains in many ways a political novice. He certainly remains a polarizing figure. But he is also a populist savant. Through the seemingly improbable rise of a political novice and the radical left's imposed role reversal on the Democrat Party, a political realignment may be underway that would ironically restore America's historical norm of alignment domination of presidential politics. If so, it has the potential to be both enduring and self-reinforcing as realigned voters provide critical mass and cover for more of their compatriots to switch.\nJ.T.

            "summary": "HARRISBURG, Pa. — An election this month in Pittsburgh and some of its suburbs is emerging as an early test of whether Israel 's war with Hamas poses political threats to progressive Democrats in Congress who have criticized how the conflict has been handled.\nU.S. Rep. Summer Lee, a first-term lawmaker who has aligned herself with the 'squad,' is facing a primary challenge from Bhavini Patel and the war has become a flashpoint in the race.\nPatel frames Lee's criticism of Israel as part of a broader pattern of left-wing politics that are extreme for the district and potentially damaging to Democratic President Joe Biden in a state crucial to his reelection bid against Republican Donald Trump. Lee counters that she has helped move calls for a cease-fire in Gaza more into the mainstream of the Democratic Party.\nThe war has scrambled Democratic politics across the United States. It's dividing traditionally progressive groups, including Pittsburgh's sizable Jewish community, in ways that don't always fall neatly along ethnic or cultural lines. But it's an especially potent issue in Lee's district, which is home to the synagogue where a gunman in 2018 killed 11 congregants in the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.\nThe April 23 primary could shed light on whether the war alone is enough to turn a critical mass of Democrats against Lee.\n'It clearly is big enough with a certain group in this district,' said Sam Hens-Greco, the party chair in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. 'Whether it is big enough for the entire populace, we're going to find out.'\nIf Lee is defeated, she would be the first Democratic incumbent in Congress to lose a primary this year. Other progressive Democrats, including Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri, Jamaal Bowman of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, face primary challengers this summer.\nLee has raised far more money than Patel and has backing from Pennsylvania's Democratic establishment, including Sen. Bob Casey, and a constellation of progressive groups that include both Jewish and Muslim organizations.\nThe first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania, the 36-year-old Lee is a Howard University law school graduate and community activist who began her political career in 2018 with a successful challenge from the left to an entrenched Pittsburgh-area state lawmaker.\nIn this year's campaign, Lee has promoted herself as a hardworking representative who delivers for constituents and speaks in Congress for marginalized communities on issues from fighting inequality to climate change and bigotry, including antisemitism and Islamophobia.\nOn the Israel -Hamas war, Lee has condemned Hamas' attack, but has also accused Israel of committing 'war crimes' in Gaza, demanded an end to U.S. military aid to Israel and called for a cease-fire within days of the war starting as the best way to end the cycle of violence and work toward peace.\nThat set her apart from Biden's stance and that of most House Democrats, although now dozens more have joined her in calling for a cease-fire. At Biden's State of the Union speech, Lee donned a kaffiyeh, a checkered scarf that has come to symbolize solidarity with Palestinians.\nPatel, 30, a small-town municipal councilwoman who worked in former Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald's administration, declared her candidacy a few days before Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Patel, who is Hindu and of Indian heritage, has cultivated the Jewish community, opening a campaign office in the Jewish enclave in Squirrel Hill, attended post-Oct. 7 vigils and bussed with community members to a pro- Israel rally in Washington in November.\nMost recently, Patel has hammered Lee for being aligned with backers of the 'uncommitted' campaign that is encouraging Democrats to protest Biden's handling of the war voting 'uncommitted' in primaries.\nThat, Patel suggested, is dangerous.\n'I would say that every Democrat in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District should take notice that my opponent is equivocating on her support for President Biden and failed to denounce the ‘uncommitted' movement,' Patel said in an interview. 'I think that is the issue that is a big concern for Democrats in this district.'\nLee defended the 'uncommitted' movement, saying it's wrong to discourage people from voting and potentially lose a crucial part of the electorate that Democrats want to persuade to support Biden in November's presidential contest. Biden recognizes that, as well, Lee said.\nLee said she has met with people on all sides of the war, including families of hostages and families of Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza, and that her calls for a cease-fire reflect the district's majority.\nLee also accused Patel of aligning herself more with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than with Biden.\n'Joe Biden is now coming more into alignment with us, which means that, no, we were not wrong to come out early and to come out strong, because as we're seeing now this was always where we needed to get,' Lee said in an interview. 'This was always the only pathway to peace.'\nFor now, the sharpest questions about the war have largely been limited to debate exchanges between Lee and Patel.\nThe issue has barely registered on the airwaves, and pro- Israel groups that spent heavily to try to defeat Lee in the 2022 primary - Democratic Majority for Israel and the American Israel Public Affairs committee, better known as AIPAC - haven't waded into the race.\nIn Pennsylvania, one potential boost for Lee could come from college students who, unlike in 2022's primary, will be on campus this time. At the University of Pittsburgh, the war has had a 'commanding presence' on campus, with most students for a cease-fire, said Will Allison, president of Pitt's College Democrats.\nThe group endorsed Lee unanimously, despite the war causing some division among members, and the College Democrats are campaigning for Lee.\nIn one possible sign of shifting politics around the war, the 14th Ward Independent Democratic Club, a nonparty organization based around Squirrel Hill, voted to endorse Patel after backing Lee in 2022.\nSue Berman Kress, a Patel supporter who is Jewish, said she knows some Jewish Democrats who won't vote for Lee again. They feel she's abandoned the Jewish community and that her politics could open the door to a Trump victory and a surge in antisemitism.\n'Those things feel very divisive in a way that's very scary,' Kress said.",

            "summary": "Democrats aren't happy with warnings that the dates for their nominating convention aren't aligning with the calendars of two red states' top election officials.\nRepublican secretaries of state in Ohio and Alabama warned Democrats that President Joe Biden may not appear on the ballot in November because the Democratic National Convention is scheduled for after both states' deadlines.\nNow, Democrats are exploring four options to ensure Biden is certified for the ballots in November.\nLetters for the president\nThe first route the Democratic National Committee can take is to send letters confirming Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as its picks for president and vice president. This is the same move Republicans made in Alabama when the party's convention was past the state's deadline in 2020.\nHowever, Wes Allen, Alabama's secretary of state, said Democrats' choice to do a 'provisional' certification, which would notify states before the convention of their choice for Biden as the nominee, will be rebuffed. He said there would be 'no exceptions' to the law setting the Aug. 15 deadline.\nForce an in-state deadline change\nDemocrats are also looking to get the deadline changed through the state legislatures. A bill written by Alabama Democratic state Sen. Merika Coleman was introduced on Thursday and would move the state's deadline to Aug. 23. Coleman has received no indication that the bill won't pass.\nAlabama Democratic Party Chairman Randy Kelley accused Allen of 'partisan gamesmanship,' citing that in the past, the GOP was able to resolve problems with ballot certification.\n'While this issue with convention dates has occurred many times in the past, notably with the Alabama GOP in 2004, 2012, and 2020, it appears to only be a problem this year now that the Democrats' convention is behind the deadline,' Kelley said in a statement.\nLegal action\nDemocrats are also considering taking legal action, given Alabama has made exceptions for GOP candidates for provisional agreements in the past.\nBarry Ragsdale, an attorney representing the Biden campaign, said the court would interpret state laws to ensure constitutional rights are protected.\n'Here, a court would have little difficulty finding that strict application of the eighty-two-day deadline imposes a severe restriction on President Biden and Vice President Harris's access to the ballot,' Ragsdale wrote. 'If strictly enforced, the deadline would prevent one of the two major party presidential candidates from appearing on the general election ballot — an unjust and unconstitutional result.'\nVirtual vote\nDemocrats could also hold a virtual vote ahead of the party's convention to nominate Biden and Harris.\nThe Democratic National Convention in Chicago will happen four days after Alabama's Aug. 15 deadline and 12 days after Ohio's Aug. 7 deadline for parties to submit their nominees. In Ohio, legal counsel suggests the DNC would have to change its deadline for certification or pass a law changing its deadline by May 9. Ohio state laws require that ballot certification occur 90 days before the general election.\nJosh Marcus-Blank, Biden's campaign manager, said he is expecting provisional agreements to be reached in Alabama and Ohio.\n'Joe Biden will be on the ballot in all 50 states,' Marcus-Blank said in a statement. 'State officials have the ability to grant provisional ballot access certification prior to the conclusion of presidential nominating conventions. In 2020 alone, states like Alabama, Illinois, Montana, and Washington all allowed provisional certification for Democratic and Republican nominees.'",

            "excerpt": "What's been coming around for the GOP is unlikely to go around to Democrats.",
            "summary": "•••\nAs former President Donald Trump and his associates face a barrage of questionable legal cases, many naive observers earnestly warn that Democrats will face reciprocal \"lawfare\" campaigns initiated by Republicans. There are, however, structural impediments baked into the federal and state legal systems that make potential Republican forays into lawfare unviable. When it comes to attenuated legal actions by zealous prosecutors in overwhelmingly partisan locales, what has been coming around for the GOP is unlikely to ever go around to Democrats.\nThe first structural barrier to GOP lawfare is the venue rules for federal courts. Without explicating the minutia under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, the upshot is that most federal actions against high federal officials or political operatives will end up venued in the District of Columbia, which voted for Joe Biden over Donald Trump by a margin of 92 to 5 in 2020.\nIn D.C., Democratic defendants do not face juries of their peers so much as juries of their intimates, and a Democratic defendant has a constitutional right to be tried before a jury in the judicial district in which the alleged crime was committed. Republicans, by contrast, face juries of their adversaries in D.C. While it is often said that a grand jury will indict a ham sandwich, a D.C. trial jury will convict a ham sandwich, if it is Republican.\nThe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permit transfer from a judicial district if a defendant cannot get a fair trial there. Watergate figures H.R. Haldeman and Dwight Chapin tried to have their cases transferred due to the anti-GOP bias of the jury pool in D.C., but those attempts were firmly rejected by the federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Those cases remain the law applicable to D.C. federal trial courts.\nThe composition of the Justice Department also would hinder any Republican attempts at lawfare in the federal courts. Even in an administration with a Republican-appointed attorney general, the political composition of career DOJ lawyers is akin to that of the general populace in D.C., and the careerists are capable of slow-walking into the ground an investigation of a Democratic official or associate. Hence, the DOJ allowed crucial statutes of limitations relating to Hunter Biden to expire before concocting a blush-worthy sweetheart plea deal that was rejected by a federal judge.\nState courts do not present substantially better options for any GOP lawfare gambits against Democrats. As an initial matter, there are essentially no state court venues with the Republican equivalent of the monolithically Democratic jury pools that exist in the D.C. (Biden, 92-5) or New York County (Biden, 86-12). Backwater counties composed of rural areas and small towns produce the largest GOP majorities, but the margins do not approach those in urban Democrat strongholds.\nFor example, Joe Biden still managed to get 27% of the vote in Columbiana County, Ohio, where East Palestine is located. Republicans are so few in D.C. or New York County (Manhattan) that a prosecutor likely can weed any out with preemptory challenges, but there is a sufficient critical mass of Democrats in places like East Palestine to assure some representation on a jury. It may take only one or two Democratic members to give voice in the jury room to the weakness of a Republican prosecutor's case or, at least, cause a hung jury.\nIn any event, major political figures of either party typically do little business in the strongest GOP counties, so it would be very difficult to obtain against a national Democratic politician state court venue in a place like Columbiana County. GOP figures, by contrast, will find it difficult to avoid activities that might result in venues in overwhelmingly Democratic counties, like New York County or other major urban locales.\nFinally, while some note that the arguable weakness of cases against GOP figures may leave any convictions susceptible to reversal on appeal, that does not discourage lawfare where such remedies will only be available after an election. Just ask the ghost of the late Alaska GOP Sen. Ted Stevens, who in 2008 was convicted by a D.C. jury on a corruption charge a week before an election, which he then lost, only to have the conviction later thrown out and the prosecutors disciplined for withholding exculpatory evidence.\nIn sum, with monolithically Democratic venues available for cases against Republicans and no equivalent for prosecution of cases against Democrats, and with remedies for abusive prosecutions largely not available until after an election, one can expect lawfare by Democrats against GOP figures to continue but Republicans to be frustrated in any attempts at reciprocation.",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — Democrats are exploring their options to get President Joe Biden on the ballot in Alabama and Ohio after top Republican elections officials warned that he would miss the deadline to be certified as the Democratic nominee in both states.\nThe offices of Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose and Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen have over the past week notified Democrats that their nominating convention this summer occurs too close to the general election for Biden to make their state ballots.\nThe Democratic National Convention will be held from August 19-22. Ohio's certification deadline is August 7 and Alabama's is August 15. The Republican National Convention will be held July 15-18.\nHistorically, when a political party's nominating convention occurs after a state deadline for certifying nominees, states have either enacted laws to push back the deadline – as Ohio did in 2012 and 2020 – or accepted a provisional certification from the party.\nThe Biden campaign has called on Ohio and Alabama officials to follow past precedent. One state is following precedent now: In a letter obtained by CNN, Washington state's director of elections informed the Democratic National Committee that it would accept a provisional certification of the Biden-Harris ticket by August 20.\nThe Biden campaign has insisted that it 'will be on the ballot in all 50 states.'\nIt has proposed several options. Ohio and Alabama could push back their deadlines or accept provisional certifications that would be confirmed after the conventions – as Alabama did in 2020 for Republicans. Each come with their own challenges.\nIn Ohio, LaRose's office advised Democrats to either move their convention or pass legislation, both unlikely.\nChris Redfern, who chaired the Ohio Democratic Party in 2012 when bipartisan legislation to push back the certification deadline was enacted, said he doesn't expect Republicans to reach across the aisle now. 'It certainly won't happen this time,' he said.\nIn Alabama, Democratic lawmakers in the state House and state Senate introduced legislation Thursday to push back the certification deadline to August 23.\n'These two bills will hopefully get bipartisan support since it has happened before to Republican candidates and could happen again,' Democratic former Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama wrote on social media. 'It is in everyone's interest to fix this for this year and the future.'\nJones downplayed concerns that state election officials were plotting against Democrats, saying he appreciated the secretary of state sending his letter 'in plenty of time to remedy the situation.'\nOther options being considered by the Biden campaign include holding a remote version of the convention roll call, when delegates would formally nominate Biden, or pursuing litigation.\nThe campaign hinted at a legal case in an April 10 letter to the Alabama secretary of state's general counsel, Mike Jones. It warned that 'a court would have little difficulty finding that strict application' of the state's deadline would 'impose a severe restriction' on ballot access.\nIn the letter, from Democratic National Committee and Biden campaign lawyer Barry Ragsdale, the campaign argued that provisional certification 'avoids the constitutional problems' of keeping the campaign off the ballot and noted it was the same process Allen's predecessor allowed the Trump campaign to follow in 2020.\nAllen, however, reiterated his stance that state law does not allow for 'provisional certifications.'\n'On January 16, 2023, I took an oath to uphold Alabama law and that is what I am going to do,' he said in a statement. 'My office will accept all certifications that comply with Alabama code section 17-14-31(b).'\nThe latest moves in Ohio and Alabama follow attempts in several Democratic-led states to keep former President Donald Trump, now the presumptive GOP nominee, off the ballot. Proponents argued that Trump's actions on January 6, 2021, left him ineligible for public office under the 14th Amendment's 'insurrectionist' ban.\nThe US Supreme Court ruled last month that the former president could not be removed from the ballot in Colorado or any other state.",

The vote is being held during meetings where other party business is conducted.\nThe polling was delayed a week. Democrats had planned a ranked vote election by mail on April 6 but those plans changed when just two candidates — Biden and Phillips — qualified for the ballot and when Phillips suspended his run.\nChanges to their plan were approved by the Democratic National Committee.\nBiden was the only candidate on the ballot, with no provisions for write-ins or uncommitted, said Lindsay Kavanaugh, the Alaska party's executive director.\n'There is no option to vote nay,' she said. 'You can abstain. You don't vote yes or no, you vote for a candidate.'\nThe party proceeded with a vote, even with just one candidate, 'to make sure we're as inclusive as possible,' she said, and to avoid any inference that party leaders were deciding candidates themselves.\nAlaska will allocate 15 pledged delegates based on Saturday's vote.\nWyoming's Democrats will hold county caucuses Saturday where polling will determine which presidential candidate gets the state's 17 national delegates.\nThe caucuses will also determine who goes to the state Democratic convention on June 1 in Casper. There, 13 of Wyoming's national convention delegates will be chosen.\nWyoming's other four 'automatic' national delegates are the state party chairman, vice chair and two national committee people, who've not yet pledged for Biden or anyone else.\nThe winner of Saturday's presidential poll will get the first-round vote of all 17 Wyoming delegates at the national convention. Should more rounds of voting be needed, the delegates will then be free to vote for whomever they wish.\n___\nGruver reported from Cheyenne, Wyoming.",

            "summary": "How dare those mean Republicans seek to deny our president access to the ballot in Alabama and Ohio? It's never been done in the history of the republic.\nOh, wait. Didn't Colorado, Maine, and California Democrats look to deny Donald Trump a place on the ballot in those states? Why yes. Yes, they did.\nBut Trump is a Republican. And it would be unfair to deny Biden access to a state ballot because his campaign was stupid enough to schedule the party's national convention after the legal deadline for candidates to register in Ohio and Alabama.\n'While this issue with convention dates has occurred many times in the past, notably with the Alabama GOP in 2004, 2012, and 2020, it appears to only be a problem this year now that the Democrats' convention is behind the deadline,' said the chair of the Alabama Democratic Party, Randy Kelley, in a statement.\nKelley just doesn't get it. Two sides can play the lawfare game. And in the case of Biden's ballot access, the law is 100% on the GOP's side.\nIs Kelley actually claiming that it's unfair to deny Biden access to the ballot because Republicans waived the requirement in the past? This isn't a contest for high school president. This is a contest for the presidency of the United States of America. It's a fame that's being played for keeps.\nunfair to deny Biden access to the ballot because Republicans waived the requirement in the past? This isn't a contest for high school president. This is a contest for the presidency of the United States of America. It's a fame that's being played for keeps. Just ask the Democrats.\nWashington Post:\nPublicly, the Biden campaign is expressing confidence that he will appear on the ballot in both states. But the situation has created new headaches for Democrats and stoked distrust with election officials over what has long been considered an apolitical process.\nGod bless the Washington Post. Was trying to deny Trump ballot access in Democratic states \"apolitical\"? Any Post reader above the age of five knows that's a lie.\nThe Alabama GOP Secretary of State, Wes Allen, reminded Alabama Democrats that he 'took an oath to administer Alabama elections in accordance with Alabama law, not to help run the Democratic party.'\nNBC News:\nBut both Alabama and Allen have recent experience with this exact issue. When the GOP was in this situation, in 2020, state Republicans voted to relax this deadline to ensure then-President Donald Trump obtained ballot access.\nThat legislation passed unanimously, with Allen, who was a state legislator at the time, among the 'yes' votes. That year, top officials with both the Republican Party and Democratic Party also sent Merrill's office a 'conditional' certification ahead of the convention stating their intention to nominate Trump and Biden respectively. Those conditional certifications were included in Merrill's 2020 candidate certifications, which are posted on the secretary of state's website.\nIn 2020, Joe Biden was in his \"Can't we all just get along\" mode. Republicans felt compelled to follow along.\nBut now that the Republicans are in a total war with Democrats, there is absolutely no reason that the GOP has to play ball or play \"fair.\"\nOf course, disenfranchising millions of Democrats in Ohio and Alabama might not be the best political play. And the chance for payback will be tempting for Democrats in those states.\nBut Republicans didn't start the fire. And now that lawfare is a two-edged sword, perhaps Democrats would use less of it.",

            "excerpt": "U.S. Rep. Summer Lee, a first-term lawmaker who has aligned herself with the 'squad,' is facing a primary challenge from Bhavini Patel and the war has become a flashpoint in the race",
            "summary": "An election this month in Pittsburgh and some of its suburbs is emerging as an early test of whether Israel's war with Hamas poses political threats to progressive Democrats in Congress, who have criticized how the conflict has been handled.\nU.S. Rep. Summer Lee, a first-term lawmaker who has aligned herself with the 'squad,' is facing a primary challenge from Bhavini Patel and the war has become a flashpoint in the race.\nPatel frames Lee's criticism of Israel as part of a broader pattern of left-wing politics that are extreme for the district and potentially damaging to Democratic President Joe Biden in a state crucial to his reelection bid against Republican Donald Trump. Lee counters that she has helped move calls for a cease-fire in Gaza more into the mainstream of the Democratic Party.\nThe war has scrambled Democratic politics across the United States. It's dividing traditionally progressive groups, including Pittsburgh's sizable Jewish community, in ways that don't always fall neatly along ethnic or cultural lines. But it's an especially potent issue in Lee's district, which is home to the synagogue where a gunman in 2018 killed 11 congregants in the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.\nThe April 23 primary could shed light on whether the war alone is enough to turn a critical mass of Democrats against Lee.\n'It clearly is big enough with a certain group in this district,' said Sam Hens-Greco, the party chair in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. 'Whether it is big enough for the entire populace, we're going to find out.'\nIf Lee is defeated, she would be the first Democratic incumbent in Congress to lose a primary this year. Other progressive Democrats, including Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri, Jamaal Bowman of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, face primary challengers this summer.\nLee has raised far more money than Patel and has backing from Pennsylvania's Democratic establishment, including Sen. Bob Casey, and a constellation of progressive groups that include both Jewish and Muslim organizations.\nThe first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania, the 36-year-old Lee is a Howard University law school graduate and community activist who began her political career in 2018 with a successful challenge from the left to an entrenched Pittsburgh-area state lawmaker.\nIn this year's campaign, Lee has promoted herself as a hardworking representative who delivers for constituents and speaks in Congress for marginalized communities on issues from fighting inequality to climate change and bigotry, including antisemitism and Islamophobia.\nOn the Israel-Hamas war, Lee has condemned Hamas' attack, but has also accused Israel of committing 'war crimes' in Gaza, demanded an end to U.S. military aid to Israel and called for a cease-fire within days of the war starting as the best way to end the cycle of violence and work toward peace.\nThat set her apart from Biden's stance and that of most House Democrats, although now dozens more have joined her in calling for a cease-fire. At Biden's State of the Union speech, Lee donned a kaffiyeh, a checkered scarf that has come to symbolize solidarity with Palestinians.\nPatel, 30, a small-town municipal councilwoman who worked in former Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald's administration, declared her candidacy a few days before Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Patel, who is Hindu and of Indian heritage, has cultivated the Jewish community, opening a campaign office in the Jewish enclave in Squirrel Hill, attended post-Oct. 7 vigils and bussed with community members to a pro-Israel rally in Washington in November.\nMost recently, Patel has hammered Lee for being aligned with backers of the 'uncommitted' campaign that is encouraging Democrats to protest Biden's handling of the war voting 'uncommitted' in primaries.\nThat, Patel suggested, is dangerous.\n'I would say that every Democrat in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District should take notice that my opponent is equivocating on her support for President Biden and failed to denounce the ‘uncommitted' movement,' Patel said in an interview. 'I think that is the issue that is a big concern for Democrats in this district.'\nLee defended the 'uncommitted' movement, saying it's wrong to discourage people from voting and potentially lose a crucial part of the electorate that Democrats want to persuade to support Biden in November's presidential contest. Biden recognizes that, as well, Lee said.\nLee said she has met with people on all sides of the war, including families of hostages and families of Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza, and that her calls for a cease-fire reflect the district's majority.\nLee also accused Patel of aligning herself more with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than with Biden.\n'Joe Biden is now coming more into alignment with us, which means that, no, we were not wrong to come out early and to come out strong, because as we're seeing now this was always where we needed to get,' Lee said in an interview. 'This was always the only pathway to peace.'\nFor now, the sharpest questions about the war have largely been limited to debate exchanges between Lee and Patel.\nThe issue has barely registered on the airwaves, and pro-Israel groups that spent heavily to try to defeat Lee in the 2022 primary — Democratic Majority for Israel and the American Israel Public Affairs committee, better known as AIPAC — haven't waded into the race.\nIn Pennsylvania, one potential boost for Lee could come from college students who, unlike in 2022′s primary, will be on campus this time. At the University of Pittsburgh, the war has had a 'commanding presence' on campus, with most students for a cease-fire, said Will Allison, president of Pitt's College Democrats.\nThe group endorsed Lee unanimously, despite the war causing some division among members, and the College Democrats are campaigning for Lee.\nIn one possible sign of shifting politics around the war, the 14th Ward Independent Democratic Club, a nonparty organization based around Squirrel Hill, voted to endorse Patel after backing Lee in 2022.\nSue Berman Kress, a Patel supporter who is Jewish, said she knows some Jewish Democrats who won't vote for Lee again. They feel she's abandoned the Jewish community and that her politics could open the door to a Trump victory and a surge in antisemitism.\n'Those things feel very divisive in a way that's very scary,' Kress said.\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition",

            "summary": "Voters in Michigan will head to the polls Tuesday for a pair of state House special elections that will determine partisan control of the chamber.\nIn the race for the open seat in the 13th state House District — which encompasses a large part of the city of Warren, within purple Macomb County — Democrat Mai Xiong, a member of the Macomb County Board of Commissioners, is running against Republican Ronald Singer, who ran for the seat unsuccessfully in 2022. The seat, which leans Democratic, became vacant last fall when the incumbent Democrat, Lori Stone, resigned after she won an election to be the mayor of Warren.\nIn the race for the open seat in the 25th state House District — which includes, within Wayne County, some of the western suburbs of Detroit, like Westland and Sheldon — Democrat Peter Herzberg, a Westland City council member, is running against Republican Josh Powell, a U.S. Army veteran. The seat, which also leans Democratic, became vacant last fall when the incumbent Democrat, Kevin Coleman, resigned after winning an election to be the mayor of Westland.\nThe winner of each race will only serve the remainder of their predecessors' two-year terms through the end of 2024.\nPrior to the two lawmakers' resignations, Democrats had held a two-seat advantage in the state House. Their departures created a 54-54 tie in the chamber. Democrats also hold the governorship and the state Senate in Michigan, meaning that a pair of victories would again provide the party with a trifecta in state government.\nBoth districts heavily lean Democratic: In 2022, Stone won her seat with 67% support, while Coleman received 63% of the vote. But the races could still serve as a referendum on the Democratic trifecta — and on the long list of policy moves they made with it. Led by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, over the past two years Michigan Democrats have enacted laws protecting abortion rights, boosting union rights, combatting gun violence and expanding LGBTQ protections.\nFueled by continued success across the country on the issue of abortion, Democrats in the state have largely made the races about reproductive rights.\nXiong and Herzberg have emphasized their support for reproductive rights and the litany of moves made by the Democratic Legislature protecting them. Powell has said he opposes all abortion care 'without exception' and has suggested he'd try to repeal the state's abortion protections, while Singer has focused his campaign on economic issues.\n'It's significant,' Michigan Democratic state House Speaker Joe Tate said, referring to the role abortion rights is playing in both of the special elections. 'It's large — and for good reason.'\n'It's top of mind for voters,' he added.\nThe Democratic candidates have also run heavily on the accomplishments that the party achieved during its trifecta, betting that voters in these two districts within the pivotal presidential battleground will reward that list of progressive policies.\n'Michigan is a shining example of what Democrats do in leadership,' said Abhi Rahman, a spokesperson for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee — the national Democratic Party arm in charge of funding candidates for state legislative races — which invested about $48,000 in the pair of races.\n'Fundamental freedoms are at stake in Michigan,' he said. 'The Democratic trifecta is at stake.'\nDemocrats have enjoyed a solid record in special state legislative elections in recent months.\nIn February, Democrats won a state House special election in Pennsylvania, preserving the party's narrow majority in the closely watched battleground state. And last month, the Democratic candidate in a special election for a state House seat in Alabama won after she made in vitro fertilization and abortion rights central to her campaign.\nAdam Edelman",

The vote is being held during meetings where other party business is conducted.\nThe polling was delayed a week. Democrats had planned a ranked vote election by mail on April 6 but those plans changed when only Mr Biden and Mr Phillips qualified for the ballot, and when Mr Phillips suspended his run.\nChanges to their plan were approved by the Democratic National Committee.\nThere were no provisions for write-ins or uncommitted, said Lindsay Kavanaugh, the Alaska party's executive director.\n'There is no option to vote nay,' she said. 'You can abstain. You don't vote yes or no, you vote for a candidate.'\nThe party proceeded with a vote, even with just one candidate, 'to make sure we're as inclusive as possible', she said, and to avoid any inference that party leaders were deciding candidates themselves.\nAlaska will allocate 15 pledged delegates based on the vote.\nMeanwhile, Mr Biden won in Wyoming, where polling determined which candidate got the state's 17 national delegates.\nThe caucuses also decided who goes to the state Democratic convention on June 1 in Casper. There, 13 of Wyoming's national convention delegates will be chosen.\nWyoming's other four 'automatic' national delegates are the state party chairman, vice chair and two national committee people, who have not yet pledged for Mr Biden or anyone else.",

            "summary": "HARRISBURG, Pa. — An election this month in Pittsburgh and some of its suburbs is emerging as an early test of whether Israel's war with Hamas poses political threats to progressive Democrats in Congress who have criticized how the conflict has been handled.\nU.S. Rep. Summer Lee, a first-term lawmaker who has aligned herself with the ' squad,' is facing a primary challenge from Bhavini Patel and the war has become a flashpoint in the race.\nPatel frames Lee's criticism of Israel as part of a broader pattern of left-wing politics that are extreme for the district and potentially damaging to Democratic President Joe Biden in a state is crucial to his reelection bid against Republican Donald Trump. Lee counters that she has helped move calls for a cease-fire in Gaza more into the mainstream of the Democratic Party.\nAdvertisement\nThe war has scrambled Democratic politics across the United States. It's dividing traditionally progressive groups, including Pittsburgh's sizable Jewish community, in ways that don't always fall neatly along ethnic or cultural lines. But it's an especially potent issue in Lee's district, which is home to the synagogue where a gunman in 2018 killed 11 congregants in the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.\nThe April 23 primary could shed light on whether the war alone is enough to turn a critical mass of Democrats against Lee.\n'It clearly is big enough with a certain group in this district,' said Sam Hens-Greco, the party chair in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. 'Whether it is big enough for the entire populace, we're going to find out.'\nIf Lee is defeated, she would be the first Democratic incumbent in Congress to lose a primary this year. Other progressive Democrats, including Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri, Jamaal Bowman of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, face primary challengers this summer.\nAdvertisement\nLee has raised far more money than Patel and has backing from Pennsylvania's Democratic establishment, including Sen. Bob Casey, and a constellation of progressive groups that include both Jewish and Muslim organizations.\nThe first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania, the 36-year-old Lee is a Howard University law school graduate and community activist who began her political career in 2018 with a successful challenge from the left to an entrenched Pittsburgh-area state lawmaker.\nIn this year's campaign, Lee has promoted herself as a hardworking representative who delivers for constituents and speaks in Congress for marginalized communities on issues from fighting inequality to climate change and bigotry, including antisemitism and Islamophobia.\nOn the Israel-Hamas war, Lee has condemned Hamas' attack, but has also accused Israel of committing 'war crimes' in Gaza, demanded an end to U.S. military aid to Israel and called for a cease-fire within days of the war starting as the best way to end the cycle of violence and work toward peace.\nAdvertisement\nThat set her apart from Biden's stance and that of most House Democrats, although now dozens more have joined her in calling for a cease-fire. At Biden's State of the Union speech, Lee donned a kaffiyeh, a checkered scarf that has come to symbolize solidarity with Palestinians.\nPatel, 30, a small-town municipal councilwoman who worked in former Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald's administration, declared her candidacy a few days before Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Patel, who is Hindu and of Indian heritage, has cultivated the Jewish community, opening a campaign office in the Jewish enclave in Squirrel Hill, attended post-Oct. 7 vigils and bussed with community members to a pro-Israel rally in Washington in November.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nMost recently, Patel has hammered Lee for being aligned with backers of the ' uncommitted ' campaign that is encouraging Democrats to protest Biden's handling of the war voting 'uncommitted' in primaries.\nAdvertisement\nThat, Patel suggested, is dangerous.\n'I would say that every Democrat in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District should take notice that my opponent is equivocating on her support for President Biden and failed to denounce the ‘uncommitted' movement,' Patel said in an interview. 'I think that is the issue that is a big concern for Democrats in this district.'\nLee defended the 'uncommitted' movement, saying it's wrong to discourage people from voting and potentially lose a crucial part of the electorate that Democrats want to persuade to support Biden in November's presidential contest. Biden recognizes that, as well, Lee said.\nLee said she has met with people on all sides of the war, including families of hostages and families of Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza, and that her calls for a cease-fire reflect the district's majority.\nAdvertisement\nLee also accused Patel of aligning herself more with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than with Biden.\n'Joe Biden is now coming more into alignment with us, which means that, no, we were not wrong to come out early and to come out strong, because as we're seeing now this was always where we needed to get,' Lee said in an interview. 'This was always the only pathway to peace.'\nFor now, the sharpest questions about the war have largely been limited to debate exchanges between Lee and Patel.\nThe issue has barely registered on the airwaves, and pro-Israel groups that spent heavily to try to defeat Lee in the 2022 primary — Democratic Majority for Israel and the American Israel Public Affairs committee, better known as AIPAC — haven't waded into the race.\nIn Pennsylvania, one potential boost for Lee could come from college students who, unlike in 2022's primary, will be on campus this time. At the University of Pittsburgh, the war has had a 'commanding presence' on campus, with most students for a cease-fire, said Will Allison, president of Pitt's College Democrats.\nAdvertisement\nThe group endorsed Lee unanimously, despite the war causing some division among members, and the College Democrats are campaigning for Lee.\nIn one possible sign of shifting politics around the war, the 14th Ward Independent Democratic Club, a nonparty organization based around Squirrel Hill, voted to endorse Patel after backing Lee in 2022.\nSue Berman Kress, a Patel supporter who is Jewish, said she knows some Jewish Democrats who won't vote for Lee again. They feel she's abandoned the Jewish community and that her politics could open the door to a Trump victory and a surge in antisemitism.\n'Those things feel very divisive in a way that's very scary,' Kress said.\n___",

            "summary": "HARRISBURG, Pa. — An election this month in Pittsburgh and some of its suburbs is emerging as an early test of whether Israel's war with Hamas poses political threats to progressive Democrats in Congress who have criticized how the conflict has been handled.\nU.S. Rep. Summer Lee, a first-term lawmaker who has aligned herself with the '' squad,'' is facing a primary challenge from Bhavini Patel and the war has become a flashpoint in the race.\nPatel frames Lee's criticism of Israel as part of a broader pattern of left-wing politics that are extreme for the district and potentially damaging to Democratic President Joe Biden in a state crucial to his reelection bid against Republican Donald Trump. Lee counters that she has helped move calls for a cease-fire in Gaza more into the mainstream of the Democratic Party.\nThe war has scrambled Democratic politics across the United States. It's dividing traditionally progressive groups, including Pittsburgh's sizable Jewish community, in ways that don't always fall neatly along ethnic or cultural lines. But it's an especially potent issue in Lee's district, which is home to the synagogue where a gunman in 2018 killed 11 congregants in the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.\nThe April 23 primary could shed light on whether the war alone is enough to turn a critical mass of Democrats against Lee.\n''It clearly is big enough with a certain group in this district,'' said Sam Hens-Greco, the party chair in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. ''Whether it is big enough for the entire populace, we're going to find out.''\nIf Lee is defeated, she would be the first Democratic incumbent in Congress to lose a primary this year. Other progressive Democrats, including Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri, Jamaal Bowman of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, face primary challengers this summer.\nLee has raised far more money than Patel and has backing from Pennsylvania's Democratic establishment, including Sen. Bob Casey, and a constellation of progressive groups that include both Jewish and Muslim organizations.\nThe first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania, the 36-year-old Lee is a Howard University law school graduate and community activist who began her political career in 2018 with a successful challenge from the left to an entrenched Pittsburgh-area state lawmaker.\nIn this year's campaign, Lee has promoted herself as a hardworking representative who delivers for constituents and speaks in Congress for marginalized communities on issues from fighting inequality to climate change and bigotry, including antisemitism and Islamophobia.\nOn the Israel-Hamas war, Lee has condemned Hamas' attack, but has also accused Israel of committing ''war crimes'' in Gaza, demanded an end to U.S. military aid to Israel and called for a cease-fire within days of the war starting as the best way to end the cycle of violence and work toward peace.\nThat set her apart from Biden's stance and that of most House Democrats, although now dozens more have joined her in calling for a cease-fire. At Biden's State of the Union speech, Lee donned a kaffiyeh, a checkered scarf that has come to symbolize solidarity with Palestinians.\nPatel, 30, a small-town municipal councilwoman who worked in former Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald's administration, declared her candidacy a few days before Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Patel, who is Hindu and of Indian heritage, has cultivated the Jewish community, opening a campaign office in the Jewish enclave in Squirrel Hill, attended post-Oct. 7 vigils and bussed with community members to a pro-Israel rally in Washington in November.\nMost recently, Patel has hammered Lee for being aligned with backers of the '' uncommitted '' campaign that is encouraging Democrats to protest Biden's handling of the war voting ''uncommitted'' in primaries.\nThat, Patel suggested, is dangerous.\n''I would say that every Democrat in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District should take notice that my opponent is equivocating on her support for President Biden and failed to denounce the 'uncommitted' movement,'' Patel said in an interview. ''I think that is the issue that is a big concern for Democrats in this district.\"\nLee defended the ''uncommitted\" movement, saying it's wrong to discourage people from voting and potentially lose a crucial part of the electorate that Democrats want to persuade to support Biden in November's presidential contest. Biden recognizes that, as well, Lee said.\nLee said she has met with people on all sides of the war, including families of hostages and families of Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza, and that her calls for a cease-fire reflect the district's majority.\nLee also accused Patel of aligning herself more with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than with Biden.\n''Joe Biden is now coming more into alignment with us, which means that, no, we were not wrong to come out early and to come out strong, because as we're seeing now this was always where we needed to get,'' Lee said in an interview. ''This was always the only pathway to peace.''\nFor now, the sharpest questions about the war have largely been limited to debate exchanges between Lee and Patel.\nThe issue has barely registered on the airwaves, and pro-Israel groups that spent heavily to try to defeat Lee in the 2022 primary — Democratic Majority for Israel and the American Israel Public Affairs committee, better known as AIPAC — haven't waded into the race.\nIn Pennsylvania, one potential boost for Lee could come from college students who, unlike in 2022's primary, will be on campus this time. At the University of Pittsburgh, the war has had a ''commanding presence'' on campus, with most students for a cease-fire, said Will Allison, president of Pitt's College Democrats.\nThe group endorsed Lee unanimously, despite the war causing some division among members, and the College Democrats are campaigning for Lee.\nIn one possible sign of shifting politics around the war, the 14th Ward Independent Democratic Club, a nonparty organization based around Squirrel Hill, voted to endorse Patel after backing Lee in 2022.\nSue Berman Kress, a Patel supporter who is Jewish, said she knows some Jewish Democrats who won't vote for Lee again. They feel she's abandoned the Jewish community and that her politics could open the door to a Trump victory and a surge in antisemitism.\n''Those things feel very divisive in a way that's very scary,'' Kress said.",

The bill, which passed on a 35-27 vote, is now on its way to the Democratic-led state Senate. If it passes there, it could bring Colorado in line with 10 other states — including California, New York and Illinois — that have prohibitions on semiautomatic guns.\nBut even in a state plagued by some of the nation's worst mass shootings, such legislation faces headwinds.\nColorado's political history is purple, shifting blue only recently. The bill's chances of success in the state Senate are lower than they were in the House, where Democrats have a 46-19 majority and a bigger far-left flank. Gov. Jared Polis, also a Democrat, has indicated his wariness over such a ban.\nLast year, a similar bill died in committee, with some Democratic lawmakers citing concerns over the sweep of a ban and promises they made to their constituents to avoid government overreach affecting most gun owners' rights.\nDemocrats last year passed and Polis signed into law four less-expansive gun control bills. Those included raising the age for buying any gun from 18 to 21; establishing a three-day waiting period between the purchase and receipt of a gun; strengthening the state's red flag law; and rolling back some legal protections for the firearms industry, exposing it to lawsuits from the victims of gun violence.\nThose laws were signed months after five people were killed at an LGBTQ+ nightclub in Colorado Springs last year. Soon, the state will mark the 25th anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School shooting that killed 13 people. Other mass shootings in Colorado include 12 people killed in 2012 at an Aurora movie theater and 10 people killed in 2021 at a Boulder supermarket.\n'This is the state where the modern era of the mass shooting began with Columbine,' Democratic Rep. Javier Mabrey said in urging fellow lawmakers to join other states that ban semiautomatic weapons.\nRepublicans decried the legislation as an onerous encroachment on the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment. They argued that mental illness and people who do not value life — not guns — are the issues that should be addressed. People with ill intent can use other weapons, such as knives, to harm others, they argued.\nDemocrats responded that semiautomatic weapons can cause much more damage in a short period of time.\n'In Aurora, when the shooter walked in that theater and opened fire,' Mabrey said, 'and in less than 90 seconds shot up a room full of people. That cannot be done with a knife, that can't be done with a knife.'",

            "summary": "JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — President Joe Biden looks to nudge further ahead in his party's nomination for reelection with Democratic voting Saturday in Wyoming and Alaska.\nAs two of the least populated states, Alaska and Wyoming play minuscule roles in both intraparty and general election voting in presidential election years.\nBiden effectively clinched the Democratic nomination on March 12 with the Georgia primary and is now all but certain to face former President Donald Trump as the Republican nominee in November.\nALASKA\nAlaska Democrats will hold a voice vote for their party-run preference poll at in-person and virtual district meetings Saturday.\nBiden is the only candidate on the ballot after the other Democrat to qualify, Dean Phillips, suspended his campaign last month. The vote is being held during meetings where other party business is conducted.\nThe polling was delayed a week. Democrats had planned a ranked vote election by mail on April 6 but those plans changed when just two candidates — Biden and Phillips — qualified for the ballot and when Phillips suspended his run.\nChanges to their plan were approved by the Democratic National Committee.\nBiden was the only candidate on the ballot, with no provisions for write-ins or uncommitted, said Lindsay Kavanaugh, the Alaska party's executive director.\n'There is no option to vote nay,' she said. 'You can abstain. You don't vote yes or no, you vote for a candidate.'\nThe party proceeded with a vote, even with just one candidate, 'to make sure we're as inclusive as possible,' she said, and to avoid any inference that party leaders were deciding candidates themselves.\nAlaska will allocate 15 pledged delegates based on Saturday's vote.\nWYOMING\nWyoming's Democrats will hold county caucuses Saturday where polling will determine which presidential candidate gets the state's 17 national delegates.\nThe caucuses will also determine who goes to the state Democratic convention on June 1 in Casper. There, 13 of Wyoming's national convention delegates will be chosen.\nWyoming's other four 'automatic' national delegates are the state party chairman, vice chair and two national committee people, who've not yet pledged for Biden or anyone else.\nThe winner of Saturday's presidential poll will get the first-round vote of all 17 Wyoming delegates at the national convention. Should more rounds of voting be needed, the delegates will then be free to vote for whomever they wish.\n___",

            "summary": "Democrats are exploring their options to get President Joe Biden on the ballot in Alabama and Ohio after top Republican elections officials warned that he would miss the deadline to be certified as the Democratic nominee in both states.\nThe offices of Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose and Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen have over the past week notified Democrats that their nominating convention this summer occurs too close to the general election for Biden to make their state ballots.\nThe Democratic National Convention will be held from August 19-22. Ohio's certification deadline is August 7 and Alabama's is August 15. The Republican National Convention will be held July 15-18.\nHistorically, when a political party's nominating convention occurs after a state deadline for certifying nominees, states have either enacted laws to push back the deadline – as Ohio did in 2012 and 2020 – or accepted a provisional certification from the party.\nThe Biden campaign has called on Ohio and Alabama officials to follow past precedent. One state is following precedent now: In a letter obtained by CNN, Washington state's director of elections informed the Democratic National Committee that it would accept a provisional certification of the Biden-Harris ticket by August 20.\nThe Biden campaign has insisted that it 'will be on the ballot in all 50 states.'\nIt has proposed several options. Ohio and Alabama could push back their deadlines or accept provisional certifications that would be confirmed after the conventions – as Alabama did in 2020 for Republicans. Each come with their own challenges.\nIn Ohio, LaRose's office advised Democrats to either move their convention or pass legislation, both unlikely.\nChris Redfern, who chaired the Ohio Democratic Party in 2012 when bipartisan legislation to push back the certification deadline was enacted, said he doesn't expect Republicans to reach across the aisle now. 'It certainly won't happen this time,' he said.\nIn Alabama, Democratic lawmakers in the state House and state Senate introduced legislation Thursday to push back the certification deadline to August 23.\n'These two bills will hopefully get bipartisan support since it has happened before to Republican candidates and could happen again,' Democratic former Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama wrote on social media. 'It is in everyone's interest to fix this for this year and the future.'\nJones downplayed concerns that state election officials were plotting against Democrats, saying he appreciated the secretary of state sending his letter 'in plenty of time to remedy the situation.'\nOther options being considered by the Biden campaign include holding a remote version of the convention roll call, when delegates would formally nominate Biden, or pursuing litigation.\nThe campaign hinted at a legal case in an April 10 letter to the Alabama secretary of state's general counsel, Mike Jones. It warned that 'a court would have little difficulty finding that strict application' of the state's deadline would 'impose a severe restriction' on ballot access.\nIn the letter, from Democratic National Committee and Biden campaign lawyer Barry Ragsdale, the campaign argued that provisional certification 'avoids the constitutional problems' of keeping the campaign off the ballot and noted it was the same process Allen's predecessor allowed the Trump campaign to follow in 2020.\nAllen, however, reiterated his stance that state law does not allow for 'provisional certifications.'\n'On January 16, 2023, I took an oath to uphold Alabama law and that is what I am going to do,' he said in a statement. 'My office will accept all certifications that comply with Alabama code section 17-14-31(b).'\nThe latest moves in Ohio and Alabama follow attempts in several Democratic-led states to keep former President Donald Trump, now the presumptive GOP nominee, off the ballot. Proponents argued that Trump's actions on January 6, 2021, left him ineligible for public office under the 14th Amendment's 'insurrectionist' ban.\nThe US Supreme Court ruled last month that the former president could not be removed from the ballot in Colorado or any other state.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",

            "summary": "By MARK SCOLFORO\nThe Associated Press\nBy MARK SCOLFORO\nThe Associated Press HARRISBURG — The two parties in Pennsylvania's state House and its congressional delegation are nearly evenly divided, and that won't change once results are in from next week's primary election.\nBut come November, the candidates the parties will select April 23 for hundreds of legislative seats could alter what has been years of policy paralysis in Harrisburg and the similar partisan deadlock in Congress.\nThe state's voters will also cast primary ballots for this year's marquee contests for president and U.S. Senate. Democratic incumbents Joe Biden and Bob Casey and Republican challengers Donald Trump and Dave McCormick are shoo-ins to appear on the fall ballot.\nBoth parties will pick candidates for state attorney general, which was in Republican hands before Democrats went on a winning streak starting in 2012.\nIn the two other statewide 'row office' contests, Republicans Stacy Garrity, the treasurer, and Tim DeFoor, the auditor general, will find out which Democrats will try to unseat them in the fall.\nGeneral Assembly It took months and several special elections before Democrats were able to nail down their return to majority control of the state House last year, elevating one of their own to speaker in a chamber where the partisan breakdown is now 102-100. One seat, in a Poconos district where a Republican resigned in February, is vacant and will be filled by special election on primary day.\nWith the entire chamber on the ballot this year, Republicans would love to flip it back, denying Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro legislative leverage in policy and budget battles.\nIn the state Senate, where Republicans hold a 28-22 majority, Democrats would need to flip at least three seats in order for Democratic Lt. Gov. Austin Davis' tie-breaking vote to give them control.\nAmong the 25 Senate seats up this year, nearly half the total, or 12 incumbent senators, face no opponents this year.\nThere are contested Senate primaries in both parties for notable vacancies in a Republican-held seat in the Harrisburg area and a Democratic-held seat in Pittsburgh. The third vacancy is a Republican majority district in northern York County.\nLegislative shakeup Democratic Rep. Nick Pisciottano, of Allegheny County, is leaving the House to run, along with two other Democrats and two Republicans, for a state Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Jim Brewster, D-Allegheny.\nRep. Dawn Keefer, R-York, is departing the lower chamber in a run to succeed retiring Sen. Mike Regan, R-York. Another House departure is Rep. Patty Kim, of Dauphin County, facing off against another Democrat for the nomination in the third Senate district involving a retirement, that of Sen. John DiSanto, R-Dauphin. Two Republicans also are vying to succeed DiSanto.\nDiSanto's seat is widely seen as the Senate Democrats' best chance for a pickup. Their longshot bid for the majority also likely would require beating Sen. Dan Laughlin, R-Erie, and Sen. Devlin Robinson, a first-term Republican whose district surrounds the western side of Pittsburgh.\nSen. Dave Argall, of Schuylkill County, who heads the GOP's Senate campaign effort, said a razor-close win for Brewster four years ago makes that a battleground, but their efforts to stay in the majority are wider.\n'There are going to be battles all across the state, but it's still pretty early to predict which ones are going to rise to the top of the list,' Argall said.\nLawmakers in nearly half of the 203 House seats, and slightly more Democrats than Republicans, have no primary or General Election opponents this year and can plan on serving another term starting in January.\nThere aren't many House vacancies this cycle: just nine seats held by Republicans and four by Democrats. Retiring members include Berks County Rep. Mark Rozzi, who spent a brief but notable time as House speaker early last year before fellow Democrats could muster the votes to elect their first choice to lead the chamber, Speaker Joanna McClinton of Philadelphia.\nReps. Ryan Mackenzie, of Lehigh County, and Rob Mercuri, of Allegheny, are relinquishing House seats to run in Republican primaries for Democratic-held congressional seats. Hedging their bets are Rep. Ryan Bizzarro, of Erie, and Rep. Jared Solomon, of Philadelphia, seeking reelection in the state House and running in Democratic primaries for state treasurer and state attorney general, respectively.\nCongressional delegation All 17 of Pennsylvania's incumbent members of the U.S. House of Representatives are running for another term, each with at least one opponent in the primary or fall elections. Court-ordered redistricting after the 2020 Census produced a 9-8 Democratic edge, and when the incumbents ran for reelection two years ago, all 17 were reelected.\nIn Allegheny County, freshman U.S. Rep. Summer Lee has a Democratic primary opponent, Bhavini Patel, as well as a Republican positioned to take on the Democratic winner in November.\nIn a district Democrats hope to flip, a race north of Philadelphia could signal how much power the abortion issue has in the suburbs. U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a centrist Republican, has a primary opponent whose anti-abortion position would not permit exceptions for rape or incest.\nThere is a three-way GOP primary for the nomination to take on Lehigh Valley Democratic U.S. Rep. Susan Wild in the fall. Wild's previous two wins were by single-digit margins. Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Democrat from the Scranton area who also has been repeatedly targeted in recent years, has no primary opponent, but a Republican looks to challenge him in November.\nSix Democrats are on the primary ballot in a district held by U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, a York County Republican who was deeply involved in efforts by then-President Donald Trump to overturn Trump's 2020 election defeat. Perry's prominent role in the ultra-right Freedom Caucus in Congress and some close reelection contests over the past six years also are making him a target for Democrats this year.\nStatewide row offices After Shapiro's election as governor two years ago created a vacancy in his former job as state attorney general, he nominated his protege, Michelle Henry, to serve through the end of this year. She is not seeking to stay in the job.\nFive Democrats are running for the nomination: Philadelphia attorney Keir Bradford-Grey, former auditor general and state Rep. Eugene DePasquale, of Allegheny County, former prosecutor and Bucks County solicitor Joe Khan, Philadelphia state Rep. Jared Solomon and Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer.\nTwo Republicans are running: York County District Attorney Dave Sunday and state Rep. Craig Williams, of Delaware County. Sunday received his party's endorsement, while Williams has been helping lead House Republicans' efforts to remove from office progressive Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat.\nFor auditor general, state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, of Philadelphia, and Lehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley are the Democrats seeking to run against DeFoor in November. Kenyatta finished third in the Democratic U.S. Senate primary in 2022 won by John Fetterman.\nGarrity, the state treasurer, has no opposition in the GOP primary. Democratic voters will choose between Bizzarro and Erin McClelland, an addiction recovery and human services professional from Allegheny County.",

Lee counters that she has helped move calls for a cease-fire in Gaza more into the mainstream of the Democratic Party.\nThe war has scrambled Democratic politics across the United States. It's dividing traditionally progressive groups, including Pittsburgh's sizable Jewish community, in ways that don't always fall neatly along ethnic or cultural lines. But it's an especially potent issue in Lee's district, which is home to the synagogue where a gunman in 2018 killed 11 congregants in the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.\nThe April 23 primary could shed light on whether the war alone is enough to turn a critical mass of Democrats against Lee.\n'It clearly is big enough with a certain group in this district,' said Sam Hens-Greco, the party chair in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. 'Whether it is big enough for the entire populace, we're going to find out.'\nIf Lee is defeated, she would be the first Democratic incumbent in Congress to lose a primary this year. Other progressive Democrats, including Reps.

Biden recognizes that, as well, Lee said.\nLee said she has met with people on all sides of the war, including families of hostages and families of Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza, and that her calls for a cease-fire reflect the district's majority.\nLee also accused Patel of aligning herself more with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than with Biden.\n'Joe Biden is now coming more into alignment with us, which means that, no, we were not wrong to come out early and to come out strong, because as we're seeing now this was always where we needed to get,' Lee said in an interview. 'This was always the only pathway to peace.'\nFor now, the sharpest questions about the war have largely been limited to debate exchanges between Lee and Patel.\nThe issue has barely registered on the airwaves, and pro-Israel groups that spent heavily to try to defeat Lee in the 2022 primary — Democratic Majority for Israel and the American Israel Public Affairs committee, better known as AIPAC — haven't waded into the race.\nIn Pennsylvania, one potential boost for Lee could come from college students who, unlike in 2022's primary, will be on campus this time.

            "summary": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The two parties in Pennsylvania's state House and its congressional delegation are nearly evenly divided, and that won't change once results are in from next week's primary election.\nBut come November, the candidates the parties will select April 23 for hundreds of legislative seats could alter what has been years of policy paralysis in Harrisburg and the similar partisan deadlock in Congress.\nThe state's voters will also cast primary ballots for this year's marquee contests for president and U.S. Senate. Democratic incumbents Joe Biden and Bob Casey and Republican challengers Donald Trump and Dave McCormick are shoo-ins to appear on the fall ballot.\nBoth parties will pick candidates for state attorney general, which was in Republican hands before Democrats went on a winning streak starting in 2012.\nIn the two other statewide 'row office' contests, Republicans Stacy Garrity, the treasurer, and Tim DeFoor, the auditor general, will find out which Democrats will try to unseat them in the fall.\nGENERAL ASSEMBLY\nGENERAL ASSEMBLY\nIt took months and several special elections before Democrats were able to nail down their return to majority control of the state House last year, elevating one of their own to speaker in a chamber where the partisan breakdown is now 102-100. One seat, in a Poconos district where a Republican resigned in February, is vacant and will be filled by special election on primary day.\nWith the entire chamber on the ballot this year, Republicans would love to flip it back, denying Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro legislative leverage in policy and budget battles.\nIn the state Senate, where Republicans hold a 28-22 majority, Democrats would need to flip at least three seats in order for Democratic Lt. Gov. Austin Davis' tie-breaking vote to give them control.\nAmong the 25 Senate seats up this year, nearly half the total, or 12 incumbent senators, face no opponents this year.\nThere are contested Senate primaries in both parties for notable vacancies in a Republican-held seat in the Harrisburg area and a Democratic-held seat in Pittsburgh. The third vacancy is a Republican majority district in northern York County.\nLEGISLATIVE SHAKEUP\nLEGISLATIVE SHAKEUP\nDemocratic Rep. Nick Pisciottano, of Allegheny County, is leaving the House to run, along with two other Democrats and two Republicans, for a state Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Jim Brewster, D-Allegheny.\nRep. Dawn Keefer, R-York, is departing the lower chamber in a run to succeed retiring Sen. Mike Regan, R-York. Another House departure is Rep. Patty Kim, of Dauphin County, facing off against another Democrat for the nomination in the third Senate district involving a retirement, that of Sen. John DiSanto, R-Dauphin. Two Republicans also are vying to succeed DiSanto.\nDiSanto's seat is widely seen as the Senate Democrats' best chance for a pickup. Their longshot bid for the majority also likely would require beating Sen. Dan Laughlin, R-Erie, and Sen. Devlin Robinson, a first-term Republican whose district surrounds the western side of Pittsburgh.\nSen. Dave Argall, of Schuylkill County, who heads the GOP's Senate campaign effort, said a razor-close win for Brewster four years ago makes that a battleground, but their efforts to stay in the majority are wider.\n'There are going to be battles all across the state, but it's still pretty early to predict which ones are going to rise to the top of the list,\" Argall said.\nLawmakers in nearly half of the 203 House seats, and slightly more Democrats than Republicans, have no primary or General Election opponents this year and can plan on serving another term starting in January.\nThere aren't many House vacancies this cycle: just nine seats held by Republicans and four by Democrats. Retiring members include Berks County Rep. Mark Rozzi, who spent a brief but notable time as House speaker early last year before fellow Democrats could muster the votes to elect their first choice to lead the chamber, Speaker Joanna McClinton of Philadelphia.\nReps. Ryan Mackenzie, of Lehigh County, and Rob Mercuri, of Allegheny, are relinquishing House seats to run in Republican primaries for Democratic-held congressional seats. Hedging their bets are Rep. Ryan Bizzarro, of Erie, and Rep. Jared Solomon, of Philadelphia, seeking reelection in the state House and running in Democratic primaries for state treasurer and state attorney general, respectively.\nCONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION\nCONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION\nAll 17 of Pennsylvania's incumbent members of the U.S. House of Representatives are running for another term, each with at least one opponent in the primary or fall elections. Court-ordered redistricting after the 2020 Census produced a 9-8 Democratic edge, and when the incumbents ran for reelection two years ago, all 17 were reelected.\nIn Allegheny County, freshman U.S. Rep. Summer Lee has a Democratic primary opponent, Bhavini Patel, as well as a Republican positioned to take on the Democratic winner in November.\nIn a district Democrats hope to flip, a race north of Philadelphia could signal how much power the abortion issue has in the suburbs. U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a centrist Republican, has a primary opponent whose anti-abortion position would not permit exceptions for rape or incest.\nThere is a three-way GOP primary for the nomination to take on Lehigh Valley Democratic U.S. Rep. Susan Wild in the fall. Wild's previous two wins were by single-digit margins. Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Democrat from the Scranton area who also has been repeatedly targeted in recent years, has no primary opponent, but a Republican looks to challenge him in November.\nSix Democrats are on the primary ballot in a district held by U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, a York County Republican who was deeply involved in efforts by then-President Donald Trump to overturn Trump's 2020 election defeat. Perry's prominent role in the ultra-right Freedom Caucus in Congress and some close reelection contests over the past six years also are making him a target for Democrats this year.\nSTATEWIDE ROW OFFICES\nSTATEWIDE ROW OFFICES\nAfter Shapiro's election as governor two years ago created a vacancy in his former job as state attorney general, he nominated his protege, Michelle Henry, to serve through the end of this year. She is not seeking to stay in the job.\nFive Democrats are running for the nomination: Philadelphia attorney Keir Bradford-Grey, former auditor general and state Rep. Eugene DePasquale, of Allegheny County, former prosecutor and Bucks County solicitor Joe Khan, Philadelphia state Rep. Jared Solomon and Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer.\nTwo Republicans are running: York County District Attorney Dave Sunday and state Rep. Craig Williams, of Delaware County. Sunday received his party's endorsement, while Williams has been helping lead House Republicans' efforts to remove from office progressive Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat.\nFor auditor general, state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, of Philadelphia, and Lehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley are the Democrats seeking to run against DeFoor in November. Kenyatta finished third in the Democratic U.S. Senate primary in 2022 won by John Fetterman.\nGarrity, the state treasurer, has no opposition in the GOP primary. Democratic voters will choose between Bizzarro and Erin McClelland, an addiction recovery and human services professional from Allegheny County.",

The DNC convention is scheduled for Aug. 19-22 in Chicago. But the letter suggests that office would make an exception for the party if they submitted a provisional certification nominating Biden by Aug. 20.\nOn Tuesday, Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen notified the state and national Democratic parties that the Democratic convention is scheduled to be after the Aug. 15 deadline in Alabama law for political parties to certify their nominees for the Nov. 5 general election. Ohio has an Aug. 7 deadline.\nAn attorney for the Alabama Democratic Party this week sent a letter to the Alabama Secretary of State's Office also asking that Democrats be allowed to submit a provisional certification by the state's deadline. Party attorney Barry Ragsdale noted in the letter that the secretary of state's office allowed the Republican Party to provisionally certify Donald Trump and Mike Pence as its nominees in 2020 and confirm them when the nominations became official.\nOn Thursday, Sen. Merika Coleman of Jefferson County and House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels of Huntsville, both Democrats, introduced identical bills to that change Alabama's deadline for political parties to certify their nominees for president and vice president to a later date.",

            "summary": "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- An election this month in Pittsburgh and some of its suburbs is emerging as an early test of whether Israel's war with Hamas poses political threats to progressive Democrats in Congress who have criticized how the conflict has been handled.\nHARRISBURG, Pa. -- An election this month in Pittsburgh and some of its suburbs is emerging as an early test of whether Israel's war with Hamas poses political threats to progressive Democrats in Congress who have criticized how the conflict has been handled. U.S. Rep. Summer Lee, a first-term lawmaker who has aligned herself with the ' squad,' is facing a primary challenge from Bhavini Patel and the war has become a flashpoint in the race.\nPatel frames Lee's criticism of Israel as part of a broader pattern of left-wing politics that are extreme for the district and potentially damaging to Democratic President Joe Biden in a state is crucial to his reelection bid against Republican Donald Trump. Lee counters that she has helped move calls for a cease-fire in Gaza more into the mainstream of the Democratic Party.\nThe war has scrambled Democratic politics across the United States. It's dividing traditionally progressive groups, including Pittsburgh's sizable Jewish community, in ways that don't always fall neatly along ethnic or cultural lines. But it's an especially potent issue in Lee's district, which is home to the synagogue where a gunman in 2018 killed 11 congregants in the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.\nThe April 23 primary could shed light on whether the war alone is enough to turn a critical mass of Democrats against Lee.\n'It clearly is big enough with a certain group in this district,' said Sam Hens-Greco, the party chair in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. 'Whether it is big enough for the entire populace, we're going to find out.'\nIf Lee is defeated, she would be the first Democratic incumbent in Congress to lose a primary this year. Other progressive Democrats, including Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri, Jamaal Bowman of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, face primary challengers this summer.\nLee has raised far more money than Patel and has backing from Pennsylvania's Democratic establishment, including Sen. Bob Casey, and a constellation of progressive groups that include both Jewish and Muslim organizations.\nThe first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania, the 36-year-old Lee is a Howard University law school graduate and community activist who began her political career in 2018 with a successful challenge from the left to an entrenched Pittsburgh-area state lawmaker.\nIn this year's campaign, Lee has promoted herself as a hardworking representative who delivers for constituents and speaks in Congress for marginalized communities on issues from fighting inequality to climate change and bigotry, including antisemitism and Islamophobia.\nOn the Israel-Hamas war, Lee has condemned Hamas' attack, but has also accused Israel of committing 'war crimes' in Gaza, demanded an end to U.S. military aid to Israel and called for a cease-fire within days of the war starting as the best way to end the cycle of violence and work toward peace.\nThat set her apart from Biden's stance and that of most House Democrats, although now dozens more have joined her in calling for a cease-fire. At Biden's State of the Union speech, Lee donned a kaffiyeh, a checkered scarf that has come to symbolize solidarity with Palestinians.\nPatel, 30, a small-town municipal councilwoman who worked in former Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald's administration, declared her candidacy a few days before Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Patel, who is Hindu and of Indian heritage, has cultivated the Jewish community, opening a campaign office in the Jewish enclave in Squirrel Hill, attended post-Oct. 7 vigils and bussed with community members to a pro-Israel rally in Washington in November.\nMost recently, Patel has hammered Lee for being aligned with backers of the ' uncommitted ' campaign that is encouraging Democrats to protest Biden's handling of the war voting 'uncommitted' in primaries.\nThat, Patel suggested, is dangerous.\n'I would say that every Democrat in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District should take notice that my opponent is equivocating on her support for President Biden and failed to denounce the ‘uncommitted' movement,' Patel said in an interview. 'I think that is the issue that is a big concern for Democrats in this district.\"\nLee defended the 'uncommitted\" movement, saying it's wrong to discourage people from voting and potentially lose a crucial part of the electorate that Democrats want to persuade to support Biden in November's presidential contest.

            "summary": "Democrats are exploring their options to get President Joe Biden on the ballot in Alabama and Ohio after top Republican elections officials warned that he would miss the deadline to be certified as the Democratic nominee in both states.\nThe offices of Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose and Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen have over the past week notified Democrats that their nominating convention this summer occurs too close to the general election for Biden to make their state ballots.\nThe Democratic National Convention will be held from August 19-22. Ohio's certification deadline is August 7 and Alabama's is August 15. The Republican National Convention will be held July 15-18.\nHistorically, when a political party's nominating convention occurs after a state deadline for certifying nominees, states have either enacted laws to push back the deadline – as Ohio did in 2012 and 2020 – or accepted a provisional certification from the party.\nThe Biden campaign has called on Ohio and Alabama officials to follow past precedent. One state is following precedent now: In a letter obtained by CNN, Washington state's director of elections informed the Democratic National Committee that it would accept a provisional certification of the Biden-Harris ticket by August 20.\nThe Biden campaign has insisted that it 'will be on the ballot in all 50 states.'\nIt has proposed several options. Ohio and Alabama could push back their deadlines or accept provisional certifications that would be confirmed after the conventions – as Alabama did in 2020 for Republicans. Each come with their own challenges.\nIn Ohio, LaRose's office advised Democrats to either move their convention or pass legislation, both unlikely.\nChris Redfern, who chaired the Ohio Democratic Party in 2012 when bipartisan legislation to push back the certification deadline was enacted, said he doesn't expect Republicans to reach across the aisle now. 'It certainly won't happen this time,' he said.\nIn Alabama, Democratic lawmakers in the state House and state Senate introduced legislation Thursday to push back the certification deadline to August 23.\n'These two bills will hopefully get bipartisan support since it has happened before to Republican candidates and could happen again,' Democratic former Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama wrote on social media. 'It is in everyone's interest to fix this for this year and the future.'\nJones downplayed concerns that state election officials were plotting against Democrats, saying he appreciated the secretary of state sending his letter 'in plenty of time to remedy the situation.'\nOther options being considered by the Biden campaign include holding a remote version of the convention roll call, when delegates would formally nominate Biden, or pursuing litigation.\nThe campaign hinted at a legal case in an April 10 letter to the Alabama secretary of state's general counsel, Mike Jones. It warned that 'a court would have little difficulty finding that strict application' of the state's deadline would 'impose a severe restriction' on ballot access.\nIn the letter, from Democratic National Committee and Biden campaign lawyer Barry Ragsdale, the campaign argued that provisional certification 'avoids the constitutional problems' of keeping the campaign off the ballot and noted it was the same process Allen's predecessor allowed the Trump campaign to follow in 2020.\nAllen, however, reiterated his stance that state law does not allow for 'provisional certifications.'\n'On January 16, 2023, I took an oath to uphold Alabama law and that is what I am going to do,' he said in a statement. 'My office will accept all certifications that comply with Alabama code section 17-14-31(b).'\nThe latest moves in Ohio and Alabama follow attempts in several Democratic-led states to keep former President Donald Trump, now the presumptive GOP nominee, off the ballot. Proponents argued that Trump's actions on January 6, 2021, left him ineligible for public office under the 14th Amendment's 'insurrectionist' ban.\nThe US Supreme Court ruled last month that the former president could not be removed from the ballot in Colorado or any other state.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",

            "summary": "HARRISBURG, Pa. -\nAn election this month in Pittsburgh and some of its suburbs is emerging as an early test of whether Israel's war with Hamas poses political threats to progressive Democrats in Congress who have criticized how the conflict has been handled.\nU.S. Rep. Summer Lee, a first-term lawmaker who has aligned herself with the ' squad,' is facing a primary challenge from Bhavini Patel and the war has become a flashpoint in the race.\nPatel frames Lee's criticism of Israel as part of a broader pattern of left-wing politics that are extreme for the district and potentially damaging to Democratic President Joe Biden in a state is crucial to his reelection bid against Republican Donald Trump. Lee counters that she has helped move calls for a cease-fire in Gaza more into the mainstream of the Democratic Party.\nThe war has scrambled Democratic politics across the United States. It's dividing traditionally progressive groups, including Pittsburgh's sizable Jewish community, in ways that don't always fall neatly along ethnic or cultural lines. But it's an especially potent issue in Lee's district, which is home to the synagogue where a gunman in 2018 killed 11 congregants in the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.\nThe April 23 primary could shed light on whether the war alone is enough to turn a critical mass of Democrats against Lee.\n'It clearly is big enough with a certain group in this district,' said Sam Hens-Greco, the party chair in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. 'Whether it is big enough for the entire populace, we're going to find out.'\nIf Lee is defeated, she would be the first Democratic incumbent in Congress to lose a primary this year. Other progressive Democrats, including Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri, Jamaal Bowman of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, face primary challengers this summer.\nLee has raised far more money than Patel and has backing from Pennsylvania's Democratic establishment, including Sen. Bob Casey, and a constellation of progressive groups that include both Jewish and Muslim organizations.\nThe first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania, the 36-year-old Lee is a Howard University law school graduate and community activist who began her political career in 2018 with a successful challenge from the left to an entrenched Pittsburgh-area state lawmaker.\nIn this year's campaign, Lee has promoted herself as a hardworking representative who delivers for constituents and speaks in Congress for marginalized communities on issues from fighting inequality to climate change and bigotry, including antisemitism and Islamophobia.\nOn the Israel-Hamas war, Lee has condemned Hamas' attack, but has also accused Israel of committing 'war crimes' in Gaza, demanded an end to U.S. military aid to Israel and called for a cease-fire within days of the war starting as the best way to end the cycle of violence and work toward peace.\nThat set her apart from Biden's stance and that of most House Democrats, although now dozens more have joined her in calling for a cease-fire. At Biden's State of the Union speech, Lee donned a kaffiyeh, a checkered scarf that has come to symbolize solidarity with Palestinians.\nPatel, 30, a small-town municipal councilwoman who worked in former Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald's administration, declared her candidacy a few days before Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Patel, who is Hindu and of Indian heritage, has cultivated the Jewish community, opening a campaign office in the Jewish enclave in Squirrel Hill, attended post-Oct. 7 vigils and bussed with community members to a pro-Israel rally in Washington in November.\nMost recently, Patel has hammered Lee for being aligned with backers of the ' uncommitted ' campaign that is encouraging Democrats to protest Biden's handling of the war voting 'uncommitted' in primaries.\nThat, Patel suggested, is dangerous.\n'I would say that every Democrat in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District should take notice that my opponent is equivocating on her support for President Biden and failed to denounce the ‘uncommitted' movement,' Patel said in an interview. 'I think that is the issue that is a big concern for Democrats in this district.\"\nLee defended the 'uncommitted\" movement, saying it's wrong to discourage people from voting and potentially lose a crucial part of the electorate that Democrats want to persuade to support Biden in November's presidential contest. Biden recognizes that, as well, Lee said.\nLee said she has met with people on all sides of the war, including families of hostages and families of Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza, and that her calls for a cease-fire reflect the district's majority.\nLee also accused Patel of aligning herself more with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than with Biden.\n'Joe Biden is now coming more into alignment with us, which means that, no, we were not wrong to come out early and to come out strong, because as we're seeing now this was always where we needed to get,' Lee said in an interview. 'This was always the only pathway to peace.'\nFor now, the sharpest questions about the war have largely been limited to debate exchanges between Lee and Patel.\nThe issue has barely registered on the airwaves, and pro-Israel groups that spent heavily to try to defeat Lee in the 2022 primary — Democratic Majority for Israel and the American Israel Public Affairs committee, better known as AIPAC — haven't waded into the race.\nIn Pennsylvania, one potential boost for Lee could come from college students who, unlike in 2022's primary, will be on campus this time.

A recent Gallup poll found that 19% of Black adults said they identify as lean Republican or Republican, while 66% identify as Democrat or lean Democrat, the \"smallest Gallup has recorded in its polling, dating back to 1999.\"\nRepublicans have gained ground among Hispanic voters in recent years, tripling affiliation with their base in the demographic over the past two decades from 3% to 9%.\nTHIS is what has Insider & career politician Democrats losing their freaking minds.\n👇👇👇 https://t.co/ihrgebaDKs\n— Mark Pukita (@mpukita) April 9, 2024\nParty affiliation trends from 2020->now (net Rep - Dem):\nOverall: 🟥+4\n• White:🟥+2\n• Black:🟥+9\n• Hispanic:🟥+8\n• Asian:🟥+8 https://t.co/Gv1zguKYOH\n— Spreader of Misinformation (@fake_news_guy_) April 9, 2024\nThe surveys were conducted with over 10,000 registered voters.\nGee, I wonder what could have happened over those years to help shift people to the right?\nLooking at you, Joe Biden (and maybe also COVID tyranny). The quickest way to push people to the right is to see and live the bad experiences that the Democrats bring - including more state control, crushing inflation, and more involvement in foreign wars because of the bad policies that Biden has employed.\nNothing is more convincing than going to fill your gas up and seeing the prices hiked yet again, or trying to juggle what you might have to pay for because of how much more groceries cost. Then on top of that, you have Biden and Democrats essentially telling you, \"Oh, you just don't understand how wonderful the economy is,\" which is just the icing on the cake.",

            "summary": "Donald Trump has asked Democrats to vote for independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr in a bizarre video posted to Truth Social.\nMr Trump called Mr Kennedy Jr 'the most radical left candidate in race' but insisted that he was 'a better man' than his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden.\n'But he's got some nice things about him, I happen to like him,' Mr Trump added, before referencing RFK Jr's one-time support for the so-called 'Green New Scam', a reference to the Democrat-proposed Green New Deal that aimed to tackle climate change.\nMr Trump went on to say that Mr Kennedy Jr should 'take votes away from crooked Joe Biden'.\n'If I were a Democrat, I'd vote for RFK Jr every single time over Biden, because he's frankly more in line with Democrats,' the former president claimed.\nHowever, despite his family's close historical ties to the Democratic party, polls show that far more Republicans than Democrats have a favourable opinion of RFK Jr, according to the Associated Press.\nMr Trump's apparent push for Democrats to vote for Mr Kennedy Jr has come days after the independent candidate's campaign staffer let it slip in an insinuation that she believed the purpose of Mr Kennedy Jr's campaign was to take away votes from Mr Biden.\nRita Palma's contract with the campaign had been terminated for 'misrepresentation', amid controversy that she told GOP voters that her 'number one priority' was to get rid of Mr Biden by driving Democratic votes to Mr Kennedy Jr and encouraging them to volunteer for Mr Trump.\nShe also self-identified as the New York state director of RFK Jr's campaign, yet a spokesperson later clarified that she was just a 'ballot access consultant'.\nThe spokesperson for the campaign also said Ms Palma was not speaking at a campaign event and was talking as a private citizen, with her statements not reflecting the Kennedy campaign.\nIn a further blow, in now-deleted social media posts reviewed by CNN, Ms Palma said she attended the 'Stop the Steal' rally on 6 January 2021, all the while claiming it was non-violent.\nShe had also tweeted that Mr Trump was her 'favourite president' and suggested she would vote for him in 2024.\nThe son of the late US senator Robert F Kennedy initially filed candidacy papers for the Democratic nomination in April but later switched to running as an independent candidate.\nMr Trump claimed in his recent video that he did this because the Democrats 'made it very, very difficult for him, they really went after him viciously, just like they go after me'.\nRFK Jr has previously been accused of amplifying conspiracy theories – most notably about the Covid-19 vaccine.\nHe was accused of making baseless claims that vaccines are linked to brain disorders. He also claimed that the virus which causes Covid-19 was 'ethnically targeted' and was 'targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people'.\nNevertheless, election polls from last year show that Mr Kennedy Jr could take votes away from both Mr Biden and Mr Trump in November.\nThe former president also went on in the bizarre video that the independent presidential candidate would be 'indicted any day now, probably for environmental fraud', saying this without any evidence.\nHowever, it appeared he connected this to Mr Kennedy Jr being Biden's 'political opponent, not mine', and stated, 'Biden can't speak. Biden can't debate. Biden can't put two sentences together, so I guess he's probably going to indict RFK Jr.'",

            "summary": "As RedState previously wrote, the primary process for picking the 2024 presidential nominees for both the Republican and Democrat Parties has started to wind down, after Donald Trump and Joe Biden secured their spots on Mar. 12th.\nTwo states are holding contests on Saturday for the Democrats, though--Wyoming and Alaska. In the morning, Wyoming held its caucuses, which Pres. Biden won with 93.4 percent, according to Decision Desk HQ (43 percent est. reporting)::\nPresident Biden is the winner of the Wyoming Democratic presidential caucus, Decision Desk HQ has projected.\nBiden is already the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party, having mathematically clinched the nomination last month. His win will add at least most of the state's 13 pledged delegates available for the winner to his total.\nHe faced nominal opposition in the contest from author Marianne Williamson and entrepreneur Jason Palmer. Voters could also select an 'uncommitted' option on the ballot as some have done in other states.\nBut Alaska has a different sort of vote planned for later in the day, which the state Democrats had to delay by a week. And there's little suspense on who will garner the state's delegates--since Biden is the only candidate left on the ballot:\nAlaska Democrats are holding a voice vote for their party-run preference poll at in-person and virtual district meetings.\nBiden's is the lone candidate eligible to receive votes after the other Democrat to qualify, Dean Phillips, suspended his campaign last month. The vote is being held during meetings where other party business is conducted.\nThe polling was delayed a week. Democrats had planned a ranked vote election by mail on April 6 but those plans changed when only Biden and Phillips qualified for the ballot and when Phillips suspended his run.\nThis is a developing story. We'll keep you posted.",

            "summary": "HARRISBURG, Pa. —\nThe two parties in Pennsylvania's state House and its congressional delegation are nearly evenly divided, and that won't change once results are in from next week's primary election.\nBut come November, the candidates the parties will select April 23 for hundreds of legislative seats could alter what has been years of policy paralysis in Harrisburg and the similar partisan deadlock in Congress.\nThe state's voters will also cast primary ballots for this year's marquee contests for president and U.S. Senate. Democratic incumbents Joe Biden and Bob Casey and Republican challengers Donald Trump and Dave McCormick are shoo-ins to appear on the fall ballot.\nBoth parties will pick candidates for state attorney general, which was in Republican hands before Democrats went on a winning streak starting in 2012.\nIn the two other statewide 'row office' contests, Republicans Stacy Garrity, the treasurer, and Tim DeFoor, the auditor general, will find out which Democrats will try to unseat them in the fall.\nGENERAL ASSEMBLY\nIt took months and several special elections before Democrats were able to nail down their return to majority control of the state House last year, elevating one of their own to speaker in a chamber where the partisan breakdown is now 102-100. One seat, in a Poconos district where a Republican resigned in February, is vacant and will be filled by special election on primary day.\nWith the entire chamber on the ballot this year, Republicans would love to flip it back, denying Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro legislative leverage in policy and budget battles.\nIn the state Senate, where Republicans hold a 28-22 majority, Democrats would need to flip at least three seats in order for Democratic Lt. Gov. Austin Davis' tie-breaking vote to give them control.\nAmong the 25 Senate seats up this year, nearly half the total, or 12 incumbent senators, face no opponents this year.\nThere are contested Senate primaries in both parties for notable vacancies in a Republican-held seat in the Harrisburg area and a Democratic-held seat in Pittsburgh. The third vacancy is a Republican majority district in northern York County.\nLEGISLATIVE SHAKEUP\nDemocratic Rep. Nick Pisciottano, of Allegheny County, is leaving the House to run, along with two other Democrats and two Republicans, for a state Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Jim Brewster, D-Allegheny.\nRep. Dawn Keefer, R-York, is departing the lower chamber in a run to succeed retiring Sen. Mike Regan, R-York. Another House departure is Rep. Patty Kim, of Dauphin County, facing off against another Democrat for the nomination in the third Senate district involving a retirement, that of Sen. John DiSanto, R-Dauphin. Two Republicans also are vying to succeed DiSanto.\nDiSanto's seat is widely seen as the Senate Democrats' best chance for a pickup. Their longshot bid for the majority also likely would require beating Sen. Dan Laughlin, R-Erie, and Sen. Devlin Robinson, a first-term Republican whose district surrounds the western side of Pittsburgh.\nSen. Dave Argall, of Schuylkill County, who heads the GOP's Senate campaign effort, said a razor-close win for Brewster four years ago makes that a battleground, but their efforts to stay in the majority are wider.\n'There are going to be battles all across the state, but it's still pretty early to predict which ones are going to rise to the top of the list,\" Argall said.\nLawmakers in nearly half of the 203 House seats, and slightly more Democrats than Republicans, have no primary or General Election opponents this year and can plan on serving another term starting in January.\nThere aren't many House vacancies this cycle: just nine seats held by Republicans and four by Democrats. Retiring members include Berks County Rep. Mark Rozzi, who spent a brief but notable time as House speaker early last year before fellow Democrats could muster the votes to elect their first choice to lead the chamber, Speaker Joanna McClinton of Philadelphia.\nReps. Ryan Mackenzie, of Lehigh County, and Rob Mercuri, of Allegheny, are relinquishing House seats to run in Republican primaries for Democratic-held congressional seats. Hedging their bets are Rep. Ryan Bizzarro, of Erie, and Rep. Jared Solomon, of Philadelphia, seeking reelection in the state House and running in Democratic primaries for state treasurer and state attorney general, respectively.\nCONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION\nAll 17 of Pennsylvania's incumbent members of the U.S. House of Representatives are running for another term, each with at least one opponent in the primary or fall elections. Court-ordered redistricting after the 2020 Census produced a 9-8 Democratic edge, and when the incumbents ran for reelection two years ago, all 17 were reelected.\nIn Allegheny County, freshman U.S. Rep. Summer Lee has a Democratic primary opponent, Bhavini Patel, as well as a Republican positioned to take on the Democratic winner in November.\nIn a district Democrats hope to flip, a race north of Philadelphia could signal how much power the abortion issue has in the suburbs. U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a centrist Republican, has a primary opponent whose anti-abortion position would not permit exceptions for rape or incest.\nThere is a three-way GOP primary for the nomination to take on Lehigh Valley Democratic U.S. Rep. Susan Wild in the fall. Wild's previous two wins were by single-digit margins. Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Democrat from the Scranton area who also has been repeatedly targeted in recent years, has no primary opponent, but a Republican looks to challenge him in November.\nSix Democrats are on the primary ballot in a district held by U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, a York County Republican who was deeply involved in efforts by then-President Donald Trump to overturn Trump's 2020 election defeat. Perry's prominent role in the ultra-right Freedom Caucus in Congress and some close reelection contests over the past six years also are making him a target for Democrats this year.\nSTATEWIDE ROW OFFICES\nAfter Shapiro's election as governor two years ago created a vacancy in his former job as state attorney general, he nominated his protege, Michelle Henry, to serve through the end of this year. She is not seeking to stay in the job.\nFive Democrats are running for the nomination: Philadelphia attorney Keir Bradford-Grey, former auditor general and state Rep. Eugene DePasquale, of Allegheny County, former prosecutor and Bucks County solicitor Joe Khan, Philadelphia state Rep. Jared Solomon and Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer.\nTwo Republicans are running: York County District Attorney Dave Sunday and state Rep. Craig Williams, of Delaware County. Sunday received his party's endorsement, while Williams has been helping lead House Republicans' efforts to remove from office progressive Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat.\nFor auditor general, state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, of Philadelphia, and Lehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley are the Democrats seeking to run against DeFoor in November. Kenyatta finished third in the Democratic U.S. Senate primary in 2022 won by John Fetterman.\nGarrity, the state treasurer, has no opposition in the GOP primary. Democratic voters will choose between Bizzarro and Erin McClelland, an addiction recovery and human services professional from Allegheny County.",

            "summary": "HARRISBURG, Pa. — An election this month in Pittsburgh and some of its suburbs is emerging as an early test of whether Israel's war with Hamas poses political threats to progressive Democrats in Congress who have criticized how the conflict has been handled.\nU.S. Rep. Summer Lee, a first-term lawmaker who has aligned herself with the ' squad,' is facing a primary challenge from Bhavini Patel and the war has become a flashpoint in the race.\nPatel frames Lee's criticism of Israel as part of a broader pattern of left-wing politics that are extreme for the district and potentially damaging to Democratic President Joe Biden in a state is crucial to his reelection bid against Republican Donald Trump. Lee counters that she has helped move calls for a cease-fire in Gaza more into the mainstream of the Democratic Party.\nThe war has scrambled Democratic politics across the United States. It's dividing traditionally progressive groups, including Pittsburgh's sizable Jewish community, in ways that don't always fall neatly along ethnic or cultural lines. But it's an especially potent issue in Lee's district, which is home to the synagogue where a gunman in 2018 killed 11 congregants in the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.\nThe April 23 primary could shed light on whether the war alone is enough to turn a critical mass of Democrats against Lee.\nSign up\nBy clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\n'It clearly is big enough with a certain group in this district,' said Sam Hens-Greco, the party chair in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. 'Whether it is big enough for the entire populace, we're going to find out.'\nIf Lee is defeated, she would be the first Democratic incumbent in Congress to lose a primary this year. Other progressive Democrats, including Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri, Jamaal Bowman of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, face primary challengers this summer.\nLee has raised far more money than Patel and has backing from Pennsylvania's Democratic establishment, including Sen. Bob Casey, and a constellation of progressive groups that include both Jewish and Muslim organizations.\nThe first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania, the 36-year-old Lee is a Howard University law school graduate and community activist who began her political career in 2018 with a successful challenge from the left to an entrenched Pittsburgh-area state lawmaker.\nIn this year's campaign, Lee has promoted herself as a hardworking representative who delivers for constituents and speaks in Congress for marginalized communities on issues from fighting inequality to climate change and bigotry, including antisemitism and Islamophobia.\nOn the Israel-Hamas war, Lee has condemned Hamas' attack, but has also accused Israel of committing 'war crimes' in Gaza, demanded an end to U.S. military aid to Israel and called for a cease-fire within days of the war starting as the best way to end the cycle of violence and work toward peace.\nThat set her apart from Biden's stance and that of most House Democrats, although now dozens more have joined her in calling for a cease-fire. At Biden's State of the Union speech, Lee donned a kaffiyeh, a checkered scarf that has come to symbolize solidarity with Palestinians.\nPatel, 30, a small-town municipal councilwoman who worked in former Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald's administration, declared her candidacy a few days before Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Patel, who is Hindu and of Indian heritage, has cultivated the Jewish community, opening a campaign office in the Jewish enclave in Squirrel Hill, attended post-Oct. 7 vigils and bussed with community members to a pro-Israel rally in Washington in November.\nMost recently, Patel has hammered Lee for being aligned with backers of the ' uncommitted ' campaign that is encouraging Democrats to protest Biden's handling of the war voting 'uncommitted' in primaries.\nThat, Patel suggested, is dangerous.\n'I would say that every Democrat in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District should take notice that my opponent is equivocating on her support for President Biden and failed to denounce the ‘uncommitted' movement,' Patel said in an interview. 'I think that is the issue that is a big concern for Democrats in this district.\"\nLee defended the 'uncommitted\" movement, saying it's wrong to discourage people from voting and potentially lose a crucial part of the electorate that Democrats want to persuade to support Biden in November's presidential contest. Biden recognizes that, as well, Lee said.\nLee said she has met with people on all sides of the war, including families of hostages and families of Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza, and that her calls for a cease-fire reflect the district's majority.\nLee also accused Patel of aligning herself more with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than with Biden.\n'Joe Biden is now coming more into alignment with us, which means that, no, we were not wrong to come out early and to come out strong, because as we're seeing now this was always where we needed to get,' Lee said in an interview. 'This was always the only pathway to peace.'\nFor now, the sharpest questions about the war have largely been limited to debate exchanges between Lee and Patel.\nThe issue has barely registered on the airwaves, and pro-Israel groups that spent heavily to try to defeat Lee in the 2022 primary — Democratic Majority for Israel and the American Israel Public Affairs committee, better known as AIPAC — haven't waded into the race.\nIn Pennsylvania, one potential boost for Lee could come from college students who, unlike in 2022's primary, will be on campus this time. At the University of Pittsburgh, the war has had a 'commanding presence' on campus, with most students for a cease-fire, said Will Allison, president of Pitt's College Democrats.\nThe group endorsed Lee unanimously, despite the war causing some division among members, and the College Democrats are campaigning for Lee.\nIn one possible sign of shifting politics around the war, the 14th Ward Independent Democratic Club, a nonparty organization based around Squirrel Hill, voted to endorse Patel after backing Lee in 2022.\nSue Berman Kress, a Patel supporter who is Jewish, said she knows some Jewish Democrats who won't vote for Lee again. They feel she's abandoned the Jewish community and that her politics could open the door to a Trump victory and a surge in antisemitism.\n'Those things feel very divisive in a way that's very scary,' Kress said.",

You don't vote yes or no, you vote for a candidate.'\nThe party proceeded with a vote, even with just one candidate, 'to make sure we're as inclusive as possible,' she said, and to avoid any inference that party leaders were deciding candidates themselves.\nAlaska will allocate 15 pledged delegates based on Saturday's vote.\nWYOMING\nWyoming's Democrats will hold county caucuses Saturday where polling will determine which presidential candidate gets the state's 17 national delegates.\nThe caucuses will also determine who goes to the state Democratic convention on June 1 in Casper. There, 13 of Wyoming's national convention delegates will be chosen.\nWyoming's other four 'automatic' national delegates are the state party chairman, vice chair and two national committee people, who've not yet pledged for Biden or anyone else.\nThe winner of Saturday's presidential poll will get the first-round vote of all 17 Wyoming delegates at the national convention. Should more rounds of voting be needed, the delegates will then be free to vote for whomever they wish.",

            "summary": "Voters in Michigan will head to the polls Tuesday for a pair of state House special elections that will determine partisan control of the chamber.\nIn the race for the open seat in the 13th state House District — which encompasses a large part of the city of Warren, within purple Macomb County — Democrat Mai Xiong, a member of the Macomb County Board of Commissioners, is running against Republican Ronald Singer, who ran for the seat unsuccessfully in 2022. The seat, which leans Democratic, became vacant last fall when the incumbent Democrat, Lori Stone, resigned after she won an election to be the mayor of Warren.\nIn the race for the open seat in the 25th state House District — which includes, within Wayne County, some of the western suburbs of Detroit, like Westland and Sheldon — Democrat Peter Herzberg, a Westland City council member, is running against Republican Josh Powell, a U.S. Army veteran. The seat, which also leans Democratic, became vacant last fall when the incumbent Democrat, Kevin Coleman, resigned after winning an election to be the mayor of Westland.\nThe winner of each race will only serve the remainder of their predecessors' two-year terms through the end of 2024.\nPrior to the two lawmakers' resignations, Democrats had held a two-seat advantage in the state House. Their departures created a 54-54 tie in the chamber. Democrats also hold the governorship and the state Senate in Michigan, meaning that a pair of victories would again provide the party with a trifecta in state government.\nBoth districts heavily lean Democratic: In 2022, Stone won her seat with 67% support, while Coleman received 63% of the vote. But the races could still serve as a referendum on the Democratic trifecta — and on the long list of policy moves they made with it. Led by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, over the past two years Michigan Democrats have enacted laws protecting abortion rights, boosting union rights, combatting gun violence and expanding LGBTQ protections.\nFueled by continued success across the country on the issue of abortion, Democrats in the state have largely made the races about reproductive rights.\nXiong and Herzberg have emphasized their support for reproductive rights and the litany of moves made by the Democratic Legislature protecting them. Powell has said he opposes all abortion care 'without exception' and has suggested he'd try to repeal the state's abortion protections, while Singer has focused his campaign on economic issues.\n'It's significant,' Michigan Democratic state House Speaker Joe Tate said, referring to the role abortion rights is playing in both of the special elections. 'It's large — and for good reason.'\n'It's top of mind for voters,' he added.\nThe Democratic candidates have also run heavily on the accomplishments that the party achieved during its trifecta, betting that voters in these two districts within the pivotal presidential battleground will reward that list of progressive policies.\n'Michigan is a shining example of what Democrats do in leadership,' said Abhi Rahman, a spokesperson for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee — the national Democratic Party arm in charge of funding candidates for state legislative races — which invested about $48,000 in the pair of races.\n'Fundamental freedoms are at stake in Michigan,' he said. 'The Democratic trifecta is at stake.'\nDemocrats have enjoyed a solid record in special state legislative elections in recent months.\nIn February, Democrats won a state House special election in Pennsylvania, preserving the party's narrow majority in the closely watched battleground state. And last month, the Democratic candidate in a special election for a state House seat in Alabama won after she made in vitro fertilization and abortion rights central to her campaign.\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

An election later this month in Pittsburgh and some of its suburbs is emerging as an early test of whether Israels war with Gaza poses political threats to progressive Democrats in Congress who have criticized the war. Lee is facing a primary challenge from Bhavini Patel. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File)\nHARRISBURG, Pa. – An election this month in Pittsburgh and some of its suburbs is emerging as an early test of whether Israel's war with Hamas poses political threats to progressive Democrats in Congress who have criticized how the conflict has been handled.\nHARRISBURG, Pa. – An election this month in Pittsburgh and some of its suburbs is emerging as an early test of whether Israel's war with Hamas poses political threats to progressive Democrats in Congress who have criticized how the conflict has been handled.\nU.S. Rep. Summer Lee, a first-term lawmaker who has aligned herself with the ' squad,' is facing a primary challenge from Bhavini Patel and the war has become a flashpoint in the race.\nRecommended Videos\nPatel frames Lee's criticism of Israel as part of a broader pattern of left-wing politics that are extreme for the district and potentially damaging to Democratic President Joe Biden in a state is crucial to his reelection bid against Republican Donald Trump. Lee counters that she has helped move calls for a cease-fire in Gaza more into the mainstream of the Democratic Party.\nThe war has scrambled Democratic politics across the United States. It's dividing traditionally progressive groups, including Pittsburgh's sizable Jewish community, in ways that don't always fall neatly along ethnic or cultural lines. But it's an especially potent issue in Lee's district, which is home to the synagogue where a gunman in 2018 killed 11 congregants in the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.\nThe April 23 primary could shed light on whether the war alone is enough to turn a critical mass of Democrats against Lee.\n'It clearly is big enough with a certain group in this district,' said Sam Hens-Greco, the party chair in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. 'Whether it is big enough for the entire populace, we're going to find out.'\nIf Lee is defeated, she would be the first Democratic incumbent in Congress to lose a primary this year. Other progressive Democrats, including Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri, Jamaal Bowman of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, face primary challengers this summer.\nLee has raised far more money than Patel and has backing from Pennsylvania's Democratic establishment, including Sen. Bob Casey, and a constellation of progressive groups that include both Jewish and Muslim organizations.\nThe first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania, the 36-year-old Lee is a Howard University law school graduate and community activist who began her political career in 2018 with a successful challenge from the left to an entrenched Pittsburgh-area state lawmaker.\nIn this year's campaign, Lee has promoted herself as a hardworking representative who delivers for constituents and speaks in Congress for marginalized communities on issues from fighting inequality to climate change and bigotry, including antisemitism and Islamophobia.\nOn the Israel-Hamas war, Lee has condemned Hamas' attack, but has also accused Israel of committing 'war crimes' in Gaza, demanded an end to U.S. military aid to Israel and called for a cease-fire within days of the war starting as the best way to end the cycle of violence and work toward peace.\nThat set her apart from Biden's stance and that of most House Democrats, although now dozens more have joined her in calling for a cease-fire. At Biden's State of the Union speech, Lee donned a kaffiyeh, a checkered scarf that has come to symbolize solidarity with Palestinians.\nPatel, 30, a small-town municipal councilwoman who worked in former Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald's administration, declared her candidacy a few days before Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Patel, who is Hindu and of Indian heritage, has cultivated the Jewish community, opening a campaign office in the Jewish enclave in Squirrel Hill, attended post-Oct. 7 vigils and bussed with community members to a pro-Israel rally in Washington in November.\nMost recently, Patel has hammered Lee for being aligned with backers of the ' uncommitted ' campaign that is encouraging Democrats to protest Biden's handling of the war voting 'uncommitted' in primaries.\nThat, Patel suggested, is dangerous.\n'I would say that every Democrat in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District should take notice that my opponent is equivocating on her support for President Biden and failed to denounce the ‘uncommitted' movement,' Patel said in an interview. 'I think that is the issue that is a big concern for Democrats in this district.\"\nLee defended the 'uncommitted\" movement, saying it's wrong to discourage people from voting and potentially lose a crucial part of the electorate that Democrats want to persuade to support Biden in November's presidential contest. Biden recognizes that, as well, Lee said.\nLee said she has met with people on all sides of the war, including families of hostages and families of Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza, and that her calls for a cease-fire reflect the district's majority.\nLee also accused Patel of aligning herself more with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than with Biden.\n'Joe Biden is now coming more into alignment with us, which means that, no, we were not wrong to come out early and to come out strong, because as we're seeing now this was always where we needed to get,' Lee said in an interview. 'This was always the only pathway to peace.'\nFor now, the sharpest questions about the war have largely been limited to debate exchanges between Lee and Patel.\nThe issue has barely registered on the airwaves, and pro-Israel groups that spent heavily to try to defeat Lee in the 2022 primary — Democratic Majority for Israel and the American Israel Public Affairs committee, better known as AIPAC — haven't waded into the race.\nIn Pennsylvania, one potential boost for Lee could come from college students who, unlike in 2022's primary, will be on campus this time. At the University of Pittsburgh, the war has had a 'commanding presence' on campus, with most students for a cease-fire, said Will Allison, president of Pitt's College Democrats.\nThe group endorsed Lee unanimously, despite the war causing some division among members, and the College Democrats are campaigning for Lee.\nIn one possible sign of shifting politics around the war, the 14th Ward Independent Democratic Club, a nonparty organization based around Squirrel Hill, voted to endorse Patel after backing Lee in 2022.\nSue Berman Kress, a Patel supporter who is Jewish, said she knows some Jewish Democrats who won't vote for Lee again. They feel she's abandoned the Jewish community and that her politics could open the door to a Trump victory and a surge in antisemitism.\n'Those things feel very divisive in a way that's very scary,' Kress said.\n___\nFollow Marc Levy at twitter.com/timelywriter.",

            "summary": "Randal Gaines ousted Katie Bernhardt Saturday to become chair of the beleaguered Louisiana Democratic Party.\nGaines was selected as the new chair after a confusing set of procedural moves at a meeting in Baton Rouge ended with him as the only candidate to be nominated for the position.\nA motion to reopen the nominations to include Bernhardt was decisively rejected, leaving Gaines as the only candidate.\n'It is critical that we use this unifying, watershed moment to rebuild, refocus, and recruit the leaders of tomorrow to address the concerns that are top of mind for residents in every corner of our state,' Gaines, a former state representative, said in a statement afterward.\nIn an interview, Bernhardt expressed no ill will at Saturday's result.\n'He should have the support of everyone in the Democratic Party,' Bernhardt said of Gaines. 'There are elections in November, and we need to keep our eye on electing Democrats and not fighting each other.'\nBernhardt, who been chair for the past four years, has been under sharp criticism since last fall's elections, when Jeff Landry was elected governor in the primary and Republicans won a super-majority in both the House and the Senate. Republicans now hold all statewide offices and 73-32 advantage in the House and a 28-11 majority in the Senate.\nTo be sure, the Louisiana Democratic Party's fortunes have steadily worsened over several decades as part of a realignment throughout the Deep South that has put Republicans in control everywhere. But Democrats in Louisiana have not held so few seats in more than 100 years.\nThe Democrats' best hope in the short term is a federal court ruling that the House and Senate maps adopted by the Legislature during a special session on redistricting in 2022 violate the Voting Rights Act. Tossing out those maps could give Democrats extra seats in both chambers.\nGoing into Saturday's election for the chair by members of the Democratic State Central Committee, Bernhardt had the support of U.S. Rep. Troy Carter of New Orleans but faced a slate of newly elected members who wanted her out. Gaines and Bogalusa Mayor Tyrin Truong declared their candidacy against her.\nThe anti-Bernhardt group swung behind Gaines, who was termed out of the House after last year following a 12-year stint representing LaPlace. Gaines, 68, had become known to party activists by spending the past four years as one of the party's two liaisons with the Democratic National Committee.\nIn recent days, Gaines faced questions of whether he filed his state taxes in 2020, 2021 and 2022. Gaines, a trial attorney, said he had filed them on Friday, saying he had been trying to settle a dispute related to the coronavirus pandemic.\nIn an interview, Gaines said he has done well enough professionally that he can afford to devote extensive time to his new position.\n'We're coming from behind,' he said. 'We have to excel in all categories: fundraising, messaging, candidate profiling, training, voter engagement and recruiting volunteers.'",
