Tony Evers' most recent meeting to discuss the spending of $125 million in an effort to combat PFAS chemicals in polluted groundwater.","summary":"Wisconsin Republicans on Tuesday planned to ignore the latest call from Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to spend $125 million to combat so-called forever chemicals.\nEvers invoked a rarely used power and called a meeting of the Republican-led Legislature's budget committee, urging it to release the funding that was previously approved in the state budget. But Republican co-chairs of the Joint Finance Committee said in a response to Evers that they would not meet, calling Evers' move \"blatant political game-playing.\"\nSen. Howard Marklein and Rep. Mark Born, the Republican committee co-chairs, said in the letter delivered to Evers on Friday that although the governor can call a meeting of the budget committee, he can't actually require it to meet or take action. The committee will not meet, they said.\n\"We are disappointed in your disregard for a co-equal branch of government, as well as the legislative process,\" Born and Marklein wrote to Evers.\nDemocratic members of the committee vowed to attend, even if its Republican leaders don't convene a meeting.\nThe moves are the latest twist in the ongoing stalemate between Evers and the Legislature over the best way to combat PFAS chemicals that have polluted groundwater in communities across the state. Evers and Republicans have both said that fighting the chemicals is a priority, but they haven't been able to come together on what to do about it.\nEvers last week vetoed a Republican bill that would have created grants to fight PFAS pollution. He also called on the Legislature's budget committee to give the state Department of Natural Resources the authority to spend the $125 million.\nBut Republicans have said doing what Evers wants would give the DNR a \"slush fund.\"\nPFAS, short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are man-made chemicals that don't easily break down in nature. They are found in a wide range of products, including cookware and stain-resistant clothing, and previously were often used in aviation fire-suppression foam. The chemicals have been linked to health problems including low birth weight, cancer and liver disease, and have been shown to make vaccines less effective.\nMunicipalities across Wisconsin are struggling with PFAS contamination in groundwater, including Marinette, Madison, Wausau and the town of Campbell on French Island. The waters of Green Bay also are contaminated.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Wisconsin-Tony-Evers.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.4881697,"_id":"79240f211c0df2e0f4583bdb3490e94e"},{"title":"Democrats hold major 2024 advantage as House Republicans face further chaos, division","author":"Brandon Gillespie","published_date":"2024-04-21 14:00:49","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-2024-advantage-house-republicans-chaos-division","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Democrats hold a massive cash advantage just over six months from Election Day in the race for which party will control the House of Representatives.","summary":"Democrats continue to hold a major cash advantage in the race for control of the House of Representatives as the narrow Republican majority leading the chamber faces further chaos with intraparty division.\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the organization tasked with winning a majority for Democrats, announced Thursday it had raised $45.4 million in the first three months of 2024, with $21.4 million of that coming in March alone. Both amounts marked new cycle records for the group.\nThose numbers bested the DCCC's GOP counterpart, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), which announced last week it had raised $33.4 million for the first quarter and $16.2 million in March, also a cycle record.\nIn the 2024 election cycle to date, the DCCC has raised $166.7 million to the NRCC's $124.7 million, a vast $42 million difference. That advantage is also reflected in the cash on hand held by both groups just over six months from Election Day. The DCCC holds $71.1 million to the NRCC's $55.9 million.\n\"The public knows that House Republicans have nothing to show from their time in the majority except chaos and dysfunction,\" DCCC chair Suzan DelBene said in a statement. \"That is why supporters from across the country are ensuring the DCCC has the resources and momentum we need to take back the House, make Hakeem Jeffries speaker and get back to work delivering for working families.\"\nA bright spot for Republicans, however, is that the NRCC's current cash-on-hand deficit is smaller than it was at the same point in the 2022 and 2020 election cycles. In March 2022, the DCCC had $18.5 million more cash on hand than the NRCC, but Republicans gained nine seats that November. That difference was a massive $31.9 million in 2020, but Republicans still went on to gain 13 seats.\nAdditionally, the DCCC appears to be burning cash at a higher rate than the NRCC, considering it only holds a $15 million cash-on-hand advantage but has raised $42 million more than the NRCC so far this election cycle.\n\"House Republicans remain in a strong position to grow the majority. Meanwhile, extreme House Democrats continue to support dangerous open borders, pro-crime and pro-inflationary policies that doomed their majority in the first place,\" NRCC spokesman Will Reinert told Fox News Digital when asked about the fundraising gap.\nThe snapshot of Democrats' financial advantage comes as House Republicans continue to battle themselves over controversial foreign aid packages for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, which passed Saturday \u2014 a fight that has led to some GOP members jostling to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson.\nA third Republican lawmaker jumped on board that effort to oust Johnson Friday after the speaker's foreign aid plan \u2014 four bills amounting to $95 billion in spending \u2013 survived a key procedural vote on the House floor with more Democratic support than Republican.\n\"[R]ather than spending the resources to secure our southern border and combating the invasion of 11 million illegals and despite repeated promises there would be no additional money going to Ukraine without first securing our border, the United States House of Representatives, under the direction of the Speaker, is on the verge of sending another $61 billion to further draw America into an endless and purposeless war in Ukraine,\" Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., said in a statement.\nIt's unclear how the tension among House Republicans might be affecting the party's fundraising in the middle of the election year, but what is certain is that the absence of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a fundraising juggernaut who was removed from his post last fall, is already taking a toll on the party's re-election finances.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brandon Gillespie","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/dnc.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.4566627,"_id":"b1abef047b71e0fe74815ae6af105c4e"},{"title":"GOP preps attacks on vulnerable Dem senators over Mayorkas impeachment trial dismissal","author":"Julia Johnson","published_date":"2024-04-21 08:00:39","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-preps-attacks-vulnerable-dem-senators-mayorkas-impeachment-trial-dismissal","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Republicans are already using Democrats' blocking of the Mayorkas impeachment trial against vulnerable incumbents in several states, where the border has become a top issue.","summary":"Republicans are planning to pin Senate Democrats' move to kill the articles of impeachment against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on vulnerable incumbents ahead of the November elections.\nAfter several Democratic senators who face tough re-election battles voted in line with their party on Wednesday in order to deem the House-passed impeachment articles unconstitutional and forego a trial, Republican candidates are already using it to their advantage.\n\"Joe Biden's wide open border is going to be a top issue for voters headed into November,\" National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) spokesperson Maggie Abboud told Fox News Digital in a statement.\n\"You can bet we are going to highlight Senate Democrats' refusal to hold Joe Biden's DHS Secretary accountable on the campaign trail, in advertising, and in every other way possible,\" she added.\nA spokesperson for One Nation, a group aligned with Senate Republican leadership and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., also shared that it would be continuing to hit Democrats hard on immigration in the wake of Senate Democrats' votes to block the impeachment trial of Mayorkas from moving forward.\nRepublican candidates taking on Democrats in competitive races, such as those in Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, were quick to slam their opponents for voting in line with their party and allowing Mayorkas to escape scrutiny.\n\"Everyone should be outraged that Jon Tester does more for illegal immigrants in Washington than he does for legal taxpaying American citizens,\" former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, a Republican Senate candidate in Montana, said in a statement.\nAfter voting with his party, Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., suggested the impeachment was a partisan game, while also urging both Mayorkas and Biden to use their executive branch authorities to help secure the border and pushing his colleagues in Congress to pass a bipartisan border package.\nHis campaign further told Fox News Digital in a statement that while Tester works towards a bipartisan solution on the border, \"Tim Sheehy opposes the bipartisan border security bill endorsed by border patrol agents, and repeatedly called to defund the Department of Homeland Security.\"\nCampaigns for Bernie Moreno, the Republican Senate nominee in Ohio, and David McCormick, Sam Brown and Eric Hovde, expected to be the Republican nominees for Senate in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin, respectively, each made similar criticisms of vulnerable incumbent Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Bob Casey, D-Pa.; Jacky Rosen, D-Nev.; and Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis.\n\"Together, Casey, Biden and Mayorkas have enabled drug cartels to flood Pennsylvania communities with deadly drugs like fentanyl,\" claimed Elizabeth Gregory, a spokesperson for McCormick.\nAs Republicans add the Mayorkas impeachment dismissal to their attacks on Democratic opponents, the incumbent senators are already pushing back.\nIn a statement, Baldwin spokesperson Andrew Mamo said, \"Tammy is focused on solutions, not political games,\" reiterating her support for a \"bipartisan border compromise.\"\n\"Senator Rosen is supporting solutions to increase border security and fix our broken immigration system because she is a bipartisan and independent voice for her state,\" Rosen's campaign said in a statement, criticizing \"the extreme MAGA Republicans running against her\" as \"rubber stamps for Trump.\"\nA Brown campaign spokesperson similarly pointed to the senator's support for the bipartisan package, noting that Moreno vocally opposed it.\nCasey's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesperson Tommy Garcia further claimed, \"Republican Senate candidates lost their message on the border the minute they opposed the border security bill that members of their own party helped write,\" referencing a border package that was negotiated by Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla.; Chris Murphy, D-Conn.; and Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., which quickly lost support following former President Donald Trump's public criticism.\nGarcia remarked that \"the ads write themselves,\" following the Republicans' abandonment of the border package.\nBoth Republicans and Democrats appear to be prepping to wield the border issues against one another, but Republican strategist Doug Heye noted that Democrats \"are massively on defense on the border.\"\nWith this in mind, Heye also said, \"Impeachment of the DHS Secretary was largely a niche issue for the Republican base already well-committed in those races.\"\nUncommitted and swing voters are not likely to have paid attention to it, he said.\nKyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, agreed with Heye's assessment, adding, \"I don't think the specifics of the Mayorkas impeachment matter much if at all \u2014 it just seems like too much of an Inside Washington story to matter.\"\nHowever, he pointed out \"[President] Biden has terrible numbers on immigration.\"\n\"Republicans will of course hammer on the issue, so it is something Democrats need to be prepared to counter,\" he continued.\nRepublican strategist David Kochel called the Mayorkas impeachment a \"lose/lose\" situation for Democrats. While vulnerable incumbents are expressing their support for the bipartisan border package, he noted it wasn't accomplished, and thus it is more difficult for them to use in their favor.\n\"The idea was to kill this thing quickly and hope voters forget about it,\" he said of the Mayorkas impeachment proceedings. Going through with a full trial likely would have looked worse for Democrats, he added.\nFox News Digital reached out to DHS for comment.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Julia Johnson","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/tester-mayorkas-baldwin.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.4430504,"_id":"9f39abcd911ceb8fa8b1642e16ccec34"},{"title":"Inside GOP plan to force as many votes on Mayorkas impeachment trial as possible","author":"Julia Johnson","published_date":"2024-04-17 16:58:27","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-plan-force-votes-mayorkas-impeachment-trial-possible","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Republicans are negotiating a structure with Democrats for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas' impeachment trial that allows them to get as many votes on the record as possible ahead of\u2026","summary":"Senate Republicans are looking to hold as many votes as possible during the initial proceedings of the impeachment trial into Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas before Democrats in the chamber are expected to succeed in dismissing the trial.\nMajority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., explicitly stated his intent to seek a dismissal of the House-passed articles of impeachment during a speech on the Senate floor on Wednesday morning. While he had previously indicated that he wanted to quickly get past the proceedings, he had yet to confirm the Democratic plan to dismiss the trial.\nAccording to five Senate Republican sources familiar with the discussions, the structure of the proceedings is being negotiated with the Democrats.\nThe two parties are looking into a potential agreement for unanimous consent, in which Republicans are allowed to propose eight total points of order against the motions to dismiss. Each point of order, or fact that senators determine whether there is agreement on, will require its own vote. Lengthening the process and requiring Democrats to go on record on several components of the impeachment articles against Mayorkas.\nSchumer noted in his chamber floor speech on Wednesday that he would look to appease Republicans by allowing both points of order and debate time. \"When we convene in trial today to accommodate the wishes of our Republican Senate colleagues, I will seek an agreement for a period of debate time that would allow Republicans to offer a vote on trial resolutions, allow for Republicans to offer points of order and then move to dismiss,\" he said.\nThis agreement will require that no senator objects, and Schumer urged them not to.\nThe unanimous consent agreement which is being sought between the parties would allow 90 minutes of open debate after the senators are sworn in as jurors at 1:00 p.m. Then, two resolutions would receive votes, one from Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, calling for a full Senate trial, and another from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that would refer the matter to a Senate Impeachment Trial committee first.\nRepresentatives for Lee and Cruz did not confirm the unanimous consent agreement discussions before the time of publication.\nOne source noted the GOP was making an effort to use every option possible to require more votes within the impeachment trial process, putting their Democratic colleagues on record as much as possible.\nFollowing the proposal of each point of order and prior to voting, the deal being discussed for unanimous consent would require four minutes of debate ahead of each vote. This time would be equally divided between the parties. One source explained that some Republican senators see this debate time as an opportunity to have the case for Mayorkas's impeachment heard on the floor, even if it is not in the context of a full trial.\nSeveral Senate Republican sources also indicated that the dismissal route, which Schumer revealed he planned to take, was preferable to a motion to table. Tabling the trial has never happened with an impeachment, as GOP senators have noted, and it also does not provide the ability for any arguments from impeachment managers or defense counsel or debate between senators.\nIf agreed to, the Mayorkas impeachment trial is likely to ultimately see dismissal, but Republicans will have several opportunities to put Democrats, particularly vulnerable ones who are up for re-election in pivotal states, on the record on multiple immigration and border related topics.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Julia Johnson","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2148879387-scaled-e1713370695779.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.4252777,"_id":"c152562b921766b84e9326e8cc405235"},{"title":"Governor Doug Burgum Believes Nikki Haley Should Support Donald Trump To Help With Independents In Swing States","author":"Peter Caterina","published_date":"2024-04-22 17:40:37","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://radio.foxnews.com/2024/04/22/governor-doug-burgum-believes-nikki-haley-should-support-donald-trump-to-help-with-independents-in-swing-states","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Governor Doug Burgum joined Brian Kilmeade to discuss the impact of President Biden freezing new natural gas leases and going from running against Donald Trump in the primary to potentially being on\u2026","summary":"Governor Doug Burgum joined Brian Kilmeade to discuss the impact of President Biden freezing new natural gas leases and going from running against Donald Trump in the primary to potentially being on the shortlist for Vice President.

A fourth bill includes national security priorities like the House's recently passed crackdown on TikTok's ownership, as well as the REPO Act, which would liquidate seized Russian assets and give that funding to Ukraine.\nEach is expected to receive a final vote sometime later this afternoon after lawmakers weigh amendments to all but the Israel bill, which House leaders decided must stay as is.\nAmong the amendments up for consideration is one by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., one of the House GOP's fiercest foreign aid skeptics, to strip all funds from the $60 billion Ukraine aid bill. It's not likely to pass, but it could get a significant amount of Republican support with a growing number of right-wing lawmakers opposed to the U.S.' involvement in Kyiv's war with Moscow.\nJohnson's handling of foreign aid and government spending spurred Greene to file a resolution calling for a vote to oust him from power, known as a motion to vacate the chair. Since revealing the details of his plan earlier this week, two more Republicans \u2014 Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. \u2014 have formally backed her effort.\nForeign aid has proven to be one of the most politically fraught fights Johnson has faced in his short tenure as speaker. As has been the case for most complicated issues, he's caught in a two-front battle between the Democrat-controlled Senate and White House, as well as outspoken conservatives in his own conference \u2014 namely the House Freedom Caucus and their allies.\nThe former group had been pressuring Johnson to take up the Senate's $95 billion supplemental aid package as one item, while the latter objected to foreign aid without spending offsets or border security measures.\nTo assuage GOP border concerns, Johnson is also holding a vote on a border security and immigration bill on Saturday \u2014 though it's unlikely to pass. Republican rebels blasted that move as a meaningless display, arguing that Johnson knows it has no chance in the Senate if not paired with foreign aid.\nThe foreign aid proposal passed a key procedural hurdle on Friday morning known as a rule vote, which now allows for debate and passage of the final bills.\nRule votes have traditionally fallen across party lines, with lawmakers on both sides following their leadership to allow for a vote on legislation even if they don't agree with its contents.\nHowever, members of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus have deliberately sunk GOP rule votes several times this Congress in protest of House Republican leadership's decisions.\nIn a stunning turn of events not often seen in modern U.S. politics, Democrats leaped to the foreign aid proposal's rescue and provided more than enough support to counter the 55 Republican defections \u2014 something that further irked Johnson's right-wing critics.\nNot only did Democrats vote for the rule, they outnumbered Republicans in support. It got 165 Democratic \"yes\" votes compared to 151 Republicans, for a total 316 to 94 margin.\n\"We agreed with the objective,\" Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., the former House majority leader, told reporters when asked about the overwhelming Democratic support. \"I think Democrats are going to continue to save the country. And when the speaker proposes something that we think is good for the country, we're not going to arbitrarily oppose it because it happens to be a Republican proposal.\"\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good, R-Va., accused Johnson of dividing the Republican Party but distanced himself from calls for his ouster.\n\"Funding Ukraine divides the country. It divides Republicans tremendously, divides the Republican conference, as evidenced by the vote today, just a moment ago. And so that should not be our starting point, to do what the Democrats want to do,\" Good said.\nRep. Jake Ellzey, R-Texas, one of the House's GOP national security hawks, said he was \"absolutely\" relieved that the bills advanced on Friday but that he was \"confident\" they would.\nUnlike his colleagues who were criticizing the show of bipartisanship, Ellzey said he was glad to see Democrats buck norms to support the rule.\n\"I think that, this is a good thing for us now, for our national security, and the assurance of our friends and allies across the world, that we are a steady partner, and it's bipartisan.

Andy Barr, R-Ky., wrote on X. \"Those so called Republicans killed border security before Schumer could!\"\nHouse Freedom Caucus member Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, shot back, \"Those who wanted to force a Senate vote on border security were betrayed by the surrender of leverage, not by opposition to the rule.\"\n\"If the speaker wanted to keep his own promises on border security, he would have attached border security to the rule. Those opposed would have been forced to accept it, or oppose the rule,\" Davidson responded.\nA rule vote is a procedural hurdle that sets terms for debate and a final vote on one or several pieces of legislation. It's decided by a majority in the House Rules Committee, which is the last test for bills before they reach the House floor.\nConservative foreign aid skeptics were outraged at the decision by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., last week to advance his four foreign aid bills under one rule vote and a fifth border security bill under a separate rule, arguing that it left Republicans with no leverage to force the Senate to take it up.\nIn protest, three of those skeptics joined all Democrats in killing the bill in the Rules Committee, which forced Johnson to bring the bill up for a vote by forgoing the procedural hurdle in exchange for raising the threshold for passage to two-thirds instead of a simple majority.\nPredictably, the bill failed with no Democrats backing the measure.\nRep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., took a veiled shot at GOP rebels after the Saturday vote, accusing them of throwing up roadblocks for media attention, \"Sadly we have some egos outpacing intellects. Could they survive a day [without] a microphone or camera in front of them? We are here TO GOVERN not play to the press.\"\nOn the other side of the argument, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, one of the three Rules Committee Republicans who blocked the border bill from getting a simple majority vote on the House floor, accused GOP leaders of putting it up for \"cover.\"\n\"Ukraine issues aside, our take down of the SEPARATE border\u2026 rule \u2013 they needed desperately to pass as cover \u2013 has enraged them [because] they now can't easily lie that border was attached in a package,\" Roy wrote on X in an unrelated post.\nMeanwhile, Rep. Dan Bishop, R-N.C., piled on Barr's earlier post, \"After each sellout, once the fury of Republican voters sets in, the self-serving lies begin. Leadership NEVER proposed to attach ANY border security measure to this Ukraine package. They set up a separate, cosmetic vote to give cover that the Senate would have been free to ignore.

It was then deemed unconstitutional with a vote of 51-48, with Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, voting present.\nThe second article was deemed unconstitutional as well, with a party line vote of 51-49. This time Murkowski rejoined the process.\n\"The decision by the Senate to reject House Republicans' baseless attacks on Secretary Mayorkas proves definitively that there was no evidence or Constitutional grounds to justify impeachment,\" DHS spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg told Fox News Digital on Thursday.\n\"As he has done throughout more than 20 years of dedicated public service, Secretary Mayorkas will continue working every day to enforce our laws and protect our country. It's time for Congressional Republicans to support the Department's vital mission instead of wasting time playing political games and standing in the way of commonsense, bipartisan border reforms,\" Ehrenberg added.\nAfter the vote, Schumer turned to X to say, \"Impeachment should NEVER be used to settle policy disagreements.\"\n\"If the GOP spent a fraction of the effort they spent on this meritless impeachment towards working with Democrats on border reform, we might have passed the bipartisan border bill,\" he said. \"But Trump told his GOP allies in Congress to kill it. Trump even said: \u2018Please, blame it on me.'\"\nSenate Republicans blocked the Biden-backed border bill earlier this year because they said it didn't address what's fueling the crisis.\n\"They put forward this legislation, ask for more authority, more funds, and frankly, more flexibility \u2014 and they say if we don't go for it, Republicans are now responsible for the crisis at the southern border. It's preposterous,\" Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., said back in February.\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt fired back in a statement to Fox News Digital, saying, \"Crooked Joe Biden and Secretary Mayorkas reversed President Trump's effective border policies have allowed a border invasion of more than 14 million illegal criminals, murderers, rapists, and even known terrorists into our country. They must be held accountable. In November, President Trump will fire Crooked Joe Biden and Mayorkas and secure the southern border on day one.\"\nWhen it came to Trump's impeachment in 2021, Schumer sang a different tune.\nThe House impeached Trump for a second time in January 2021 after 10 Republicans abandoned the former president and joined Democrats.\nSchumer said at the time, \"I regret to say for 45 Republican senators to vote for a spurious constitutional objection to the coming impeachment trial was deeply, deeply irresponsible.\"\nDuring the Trump impeachment trial, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., broke from Schumer and said he believed the Senate had a responsibility to hold an impeachment trial but that it was an open question of whether the trial was constitutional.\nBut on the matter of Mayorkas, Murphy called the impeachment \"bs.\"\n\"Republicans only see the border as a campaign issue,\" Murphy posted on X. \"They don't want to solve the problem.

Alabama has one of the earliest candidate certification deadlines in the country which has caused difficulties for whichever political party has the later convention date that year.\n\"We want to make sure every citizen in the state of Alabama has the opportunity to vote for the candidate of his or her choice,\" Democratic Sen. Merika Coleman, the sponsor of the Senate bill, told the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nThe issue of Biden's ballot access has arisen in Alabama and Ohio as Republican secretaries of state warned that certification deadlines fall before the Democratic National Convention is set to begin on Aug. 19. The Biden campaign has asked the two states to accept provisional certification, arguing that has been done in past elections. The Republican election chiefs have refused, arguing they don't have authority, and will enforce the deadlines.\nDemocrats proposed the two Alabama bills, but the legislation moved out of committee with support from Republicans who hold a lopsided majority in the Alabama Legislature. The bills were approved with little discussion. However, two Republicans who spoke in favor of the bill called it an issue of fairness.\nRepublican Rep. Bob Fincher, chairman of the committee that heard the House bill, said this is \"not the first time we've run into this problem\" and the state made allowances.\n\"I'd like to think that if the shoe was on the other foot, that this would be taken care of. And I think that Alabamians have a deep sense of fairness when it comes to politics and elections,\" Republican Sen. Sam Givhan said during the committee meeting.\nTrump faced the same issue in Alabama in 2020. The Republican-controlled Alabama Legislature in 2020 passed legislation to change the certification deadline for the 2020 election. The bill stated that the change was made \"to accommodate the dates of the 2020 Republican National Convention.\" However, an attorney representing the Biden campaign and DNC, wrote in a letter to Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen that it was provisional certification that allowed Trump on the ballot in 2020, because there were still problems with the GOP date even with the new 2020 deadline.\nAllen has maintained he does not have the authority to accept provisional certification.\nSimilarly, in Ohio, Attorney General Dave Yost and Secretary of State Frank LaRose, both Republicans, rejected a request from Democrats to waive the state's ballot deadline administratively by accepting a \"provisional certification\" for Biden.\nIn a letter Monday, Yost's office told LaRose that Ohio law does not allow the procedure. LaRose's office conveyed that information, in turn, in a letter to Democratic lawyer Don McTigue. LaRose's chief legal counsel, Paul Disantis, noted it was a Democrats who championed the state's ballot deadline, one of the earliest in the nation, 15 years ago. It falls 90 days before the general election, which this year is Aug. 7.\nOhio Senate Democratic Leader Nickie Antonio said she is waiting to hear from the Democratic National Committee on how to proceed. One of her members, state Sen. Bill DiMora, said he has legislation for either a short- or long-term fix ready to go when the time comes.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/2022-04-11T050034Z_1346383322_RC2SDT9MFSWO_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-USA-OIL.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.212435,"_id":"054f8d1bfdd220113c44b2bdbfe822c7"},{"title":"'Definition of insanity': Frustrated House Republicans blast GOP rebels' threat to oust Johnson","author":"Elizabeth Elkind","published_date":"2024-04-16 22:01:04","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/definition-of-insanity-frustrated-house-republicans-blast-gop-rebels-threat-oust-johnson","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"House Republicans are distancing themselves from the effort by two GOP lawmakers to oust Speaker Mike Johnson.","summary":"House Republicans were left frustrated on Tuesday after two of their colleagues threatened to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., over his plan on foreign aid.\n\"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results,\" Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., told Fox News Digital. \"So, you do it again, you're going to end up with the same results.\"\nThose GOP lawmakers are worried about repeating the three weeks of chaos that followed the ouster of ex-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., by a group of eight Republicans and all House Democrats. Most would not go so far as to say it could cost them the election in November, but they suggested it weakened the Republican position in the House while already dealing with just a razor-thin majority and a Democrat-controlled Senate and White House.\n\"The new speaker will have to play the same hand that this speaker is playing. The results are going to be the same,\" Gimenez said, adding that it \"could\" hurt the GOP in November.\nDuring a closed-door conference meeting on Tuesday morning, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., urged Johnson to step down or face a possible vote to vacate the speaker's chair. He's now signed onto a resolution introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., last month to oust Johnson over his actions on government spending and foreign aid.\nJohnson, for his part, told reporters he would not step down and called the threats \"absurd.\"\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus who ran for speaker after McCarthy's ouster, called vacating Johnson a \"bad idea.\"\n\"We don't need that. No way, no way. We don't. We don't want that. We shouldn't go through that again,\" Jordan told reporters.\nEven an ally of Greene and Massie, Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., said it was a \"mistake.\"\n\"Marjorie is my friend but she made a huge mistake there,\" Higgins said of Greene initiating the move. \"Mike is amazing man, a deeply principled Republican. And that's a very good starting point for a leader of our conference, and he was like thrust into an impossible job out of precarious moment with the slimmest majority in the history of Congress.\"\nMeanwhile Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good, R-Va., one of the eight Republicans who ousted McCarthy and who has been critical of Johnson for working with Democrats on critical legislation, suggested he had no appetite to follow the same path again right now.\n\"I don't have any comment on motion to vacate. You can ask the two members who are talking about doing that. I don't hear other members talking about doing that,\" Good told reporters. \"But I didn't go around cavalierly, flippantly throwing motion to vacate around.\"\nRep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., a leadership ally, called the three weeks Republicans spent without a speaker last year \"wasted time.\"\n\"I think it's an unwanted distraction,\" he said.\nAnd Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., who was close to McCarthy when he was speaker but has a noticeably more distant relationship with Johnson, said it was not in the House GOP's interest to oust his fellow Louisianan.\n\"I think we have a number of people here that, they don't think past step one, which is why we have so many problems here right now,\" he said of the vacate push.\nMassie said he would sign onto Greene's existing resolution to vacate Johnson. But unless they file it as a privileged motion, as was the case with McCarthy, there is nothing compelling House Republican leadership to hold a vote. If they do file it as privileged, however, the House will be forced to act on it within two legislative days.\nNeither Massie nor Greene were part of the eight Republicans to oust McCarthy in October, and criticized the people who did so.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Elizabeth Elkind","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/greene-massie-vacate.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.2068744,"_id":"15960eb59f7092adb51250b6f6202485"},{"title":"Trump's loan proposal for Ukraine aid may be common ground for comprehensive foreign aid package","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-15 20:42:27","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-ukraine-loan-dems-gop-aid-package","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Trump's proposed loan idea for Ukraine aid is being considered by Democrats, who may be amenable to it if it means quickly passing aid to both Ukraine and Israel.","summary":"Former President Trump's plan for Ukraine aid to be granted as a loan could be the determining factor that pushes a supplemental aid package across the finish line in Congress.\nSeveral congressional aides on both sides of the aisle noted potential support for Trump's idea for assistance to the country \u2013 which is in an ongoing war with Russia \u2013 in the form of a zero interest loan with an unlimited lifespan. The likelihood of support for such a measure is especially high if it is determined to be the only way to pass an aid package to Ukraine and Israel.\nIn the wake of an Iranian drone attack on Israel over the weekend, a renewed sense of urgency was placed on lobbying attempts for aid in Congress, which were already underway.\nThe Senate passed a $95.3 billion foreign aid package that included Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan in February. Despite passing the upper chamber, it managed to split the Republican conference, several of whom had been critical of continued aid to Ukraine. A number of Republican senators were also unhappy that the package didn't address the southern border.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has yet to bring the supplemental package to the House floor for a vote, despite many House Republicans having urged him to do so. The package would likely pass, but with significant Republican opposition.\nWith a path forward on foreign aid still unclear, House Republican leaders are set to meet Monday evening to discuss potential ways to address both Israel and Ukraine.\nAccording to several Democratic congressional aides, the attack on Iran isn't likely to make Senate Democrats more amenable to a stand-alone bill for Israel. This is partially because Ukraine aid would have more difficulty passing without being tied to Israel. One Democratic aide even suggested stand-alone Israel aid would face trouble passing without the alottment for Ukraine.\nWhat the attack on Israel at the hands of Iran is more likely to prompt from Democrats is an even harder push for the House to take up the Senate-passed supplemental bill, per one Congressional aide.\nWhile Senate Democrats still prefer the supplemental bill and believe it is the fastest way to get aid to Israel, they aren't completely opposed to other ways of obtaining it.\nTwo aides told Fox News Digital that numerous Senate Democrats are open to advancing a package that combines aid for Ukraine and Israel, with the provision that assistance to Ukraine is extended as a loan, aligning with Trump's proposal.\nThis is especially true if it presents a faster opportunity to get aid to both countries.\nRepublicans are similarly interested in the idea of the aid as a loan, per two GOP aides.\nA Senate Republican aide indicated that the appetite for the supplemental package, which was passed but severely divided Republicans, likely remains the same. Instead, the recent attack on Israel renewed desires to pass Israel aid apart from Ukraine and Taiwan, which Democrats have largely rejected.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/4032d4bb-Rectangle-Inset-right.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.2050886,"_id":"f04718204f2d9db1014125c06bf0c83f"},{"title":"Murphy slams Republicans on Mayorkas vote in response to Trump Jr.: \u2018Republicans are full of s\u2011\u2011\u2011'","author":"Haley Chi-Sing","published_date":"2024-04-20 14:24:10","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/murphy-slams-republicans-mayorkas-vote-response-trump-jr-republicans-full","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Sen.

While the district includes Democratic strongholds in the state capital of Topeka and northern Kansas City, they're offset by rural areas that heavily favored former President Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020.\nLaTurner, 36, has put on hold what seemed a promising long-term political career, saying also that he wouldn't seek any office in 2026. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly is term-limited and Republicans had mentioned LaTurner as a possible candidate for the job that year.\nHe worked for U.S. Rep.

Instead, he said, serving in Congress has taken a toll on him, his wife, Suzanne, and their children.\n\"I am hopeful that in another season of life, with new experiences and perspectives, I can contribute in some small way and advocate for the issues I care most about,\" his statement Thursday said.\nWhile Republicans have represented the 2nd District in 27 of the past 30 years, Democrats have waged aggressive campaigns since Jenkins decided not to seek reelection in 2018. One Democrat, former teacher Eli Woody IV, has filed to run in November.\nIn the 2020 primary, LaTurner handily defeated Republican Steve Watkins and won the November election by almost 15 percentage points. In 2022, LaTurner won his general election race by a slightly wider margin.\nIn June 2022, the congressman beefed up security at his home and Topeka office out of concern for his family's safety after a man left a threatening voicemail after hours that said, \"I will kill you.\"\nThe man, Chase Neill, is now serving a sentence of nearly four years in prison after being convicted in federal court of one count of threating a U.S. official.

And I think both of those in the same week is really a bad week for the Constitution.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Fox News Staff","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1950952430-scaled.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.108192,"_id":"d4d1dc38085512a634d489af5d23f7f4"},{"title":"Kevin McCarthy: Matt Gaetz broke the Republican majority","author":"Fox News Staff","published_date":"2024-04-21 17:19:48","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/kevin-mccarthy-matt-gaetz-broke-republican-majority","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy blamed Republican division on Rep.

Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., started has broken the Republican majority.\nKEVIN MCCARTHY: I think they're in disarray, but it stems from those eight [Republicans] working with all the Democrats. If there's no consequence... The Gaetz eight. But they work with all the Democrats to decide who could be speaker; and since then, what has transpired? So the conference is broken because they never dealt with those eight, and until they do, it would stay broken. But to Marjorie [Taylor Greene's] point is, Marjorie didn't do what Matt Gaetz did. She didn't make this privilege. She's making it an issue for a debate. Now, I think they should keep it internal. They should have their discussion. Look, being speaker is not easy. Otherwise, maybe I'd still be there.\n\u2026\nWhat Matt Gaetz did has broken the Republican majority. He's now created \"Lord of the Flies.\" Ask anybody inside our conference; they actually know it.\nTensions flared in the House of Representatives on Thursday when a group of conservatives confronted Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., over his foreign aid plan, leading to another Republican trading barbs with the group of rebels.\nA group of lawmakers that included Reps. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.; Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.; Tim Burchett, R-Tenn.; and others could be seen huddled with Johnson on the House floor after morning votes.\nThe discussion appeared to be interrupted a short while later when Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., confronted the group, and wound up in a particularly heated back-and-forth with Gaetz. Van Orden later told Fox News Digital that he called Gaetz \"tubby\" and dared the GOP rebels to trigger a vote for Johnson's ouster \u2014 a threat he's facing from Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who were not in the group.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Fox News Staff","media":"https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/7feff853-e582-4952-b478-5a002c13198c/3a4cfb3e-6cce-4036-b0ae-cd71392266e2/1280x720/match/image.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.06168,"_id":"bb29a56e1f05056489c030b5cb4d35e6"},{"title":"Surging GOP Senate candidate unfazed by personal war chest of millionaire Dem in key blue state battle","author":"Paul Steinhauser","published_date":"2024-04-17 21:37:23","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republican-hogan-vows-hell-be-outspent-not-outworked-multi-millionaire-dem-key-senate-race","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, who's aiming to flip a Democrat-controlled open Senate seat in blue Maryland, showcases his grassroots fundraising versus multi-millionaire self-funder David Trone.","summary":"Former two-term Republican Gov. Larry Hogan \u2014 who's aiming to flip a Democrat-controlled open Senate seat in his heavily blue home state of Maryland \u2014 is spotlighting his grassroots fundraising as he works to paint a stark contrast with the multi-millionaire front-runner for the Democratic nomination.\nHogan, considered the overwhelming front-runner for the GOP nomination in next month's primary, is running in the contest to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin in a race that is one of a handful that may determine if the Republicans win back the Senate majority.\nThe former governor, a vocal GOP critic of former President Donald Trump, may face off in November against Rep. David Trone, the polling front-runner in a crowded field of Democrats vying for their party's Senate nomination. The Democratic field also includes Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, who is second in public opinion surveys.\nTrone, the founder and co-owner along with his brother of the alcohol retailer Total Wine and More, is one of the wealthiest members of Congress and is largely self-funding his Senate bid.\nThe congressman has loaned his campaign nearly $42 million since launching his bid in May of last year, according to federal campaign finance records. That makes him the largest self-funder of a Senate primary in American history, according to Federal Election Commission filings.\nHogan's campaign, along with two aligned political action committees, hauled in over $3.1 million in fundraising since the former governor declared his Senate candidacy in mid-February.\nHis campaign, asked about Trone's self-funding, spotlighted an upcoming May 4 fundraising barbecue, where those attending are asked to contribute small-dollar donations.\n\"Following Governor Hogan's bus tour directly reaching voters in every region of the state, we are excited to host a grassroots family BBQ with hundreds of supporters with tickets starting at $50 and kids under 12 for free,\" the campaign told Fox News.\nHis team, pointing to the likelihood of a Hogan-Trone faceoff in November, vowed that their candidate \"may be outspent, but not be outworked in this campaign.\"\nTrone's campaign told Fox News that their candidate \"has been crystal clear that he's prepared to do whatever it takes to beat Larry Hogan in November and protect the Democratic Senate majority.\"\n\"With national Republicans and right-wing donors flooding Maryland with contributions to Hogan, there has never been a more important time to take the fight directly to Mitch McConnell, Larry Hogan and Donald Trump. David Trone is the best candidate to do that,\" they argued in a statement.\nThe latest polls indicate Hogan topping either Trone or Alsobrooks in general election matchups in Maryland, a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a two-to-one margin.\n\"I would not put a lot of stock in polls right now. We've got a lot to do. We have not elected a Republican senator from Maryland since 1980, when Ronald Reagan was elected president,\" Hogan cautioned in a Fox News Digital interview last month.\nHe noted that \"it's a tough state \u2014 the bluest state in America. But I think if we work hard, we have the ability to get people to vote their hearts and vote for the person they think can do the job and not just vote straight party line.\"\nA successful business leader before entering politics, Hogan seriously mulled a run for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination and made numerous trips in 2022 to New Hampshire, the state that holds the first primary on the GOP nominating calendar.\nBut in March of last year, Hogan announced he wouldn't seek his party's presidential nomination.\nDuring his last year as governor, Republican leaders in the nation's capital and in Maryland heavily courted Hogan to run for the Senate in the 2022 midterm elections against Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen. But Hogan declined to run.\nLast month, Hogan told Fox News a main reason he's now running for the Senate is to \"bring some sanity back to the divisiveness and dysfunction\" in the nation's capital. He's also touting his ability during his tenure as governor to work with a Democratic-dominated legislature to reach consensus.\nAnd in a new nearly $1 million ad blitz launched on Wednesday, Hogan takes aim at the \"partisan BS\" in Washington. In the spot, Hogan vows \"to be a voice of common sense\" and \"get stuff done\" in the Senate.\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign arm of the Senate GOP which heavily courted Hogan to run, is footing half the bill for running the spot on TV, digital, and streaming services.\nHogan's entry into the Senate race in Maryland is giving Democrats more headaches.\nDemocrats currently control the U.S. Senate with a 51-49 majority, but Republicans are looking at a favorable Senate map this year, with Democrats defending 23 of the 34 seats up for grabs.\nThree of those seats are in red states that Trump carried in 2020 \u2014 Ohio, Montana and West Virginia, where Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin is not running for re-election.

The looming question remains over what Democrats \u2013 who are in the majority in the upper chamber \u2013 will look to do after being sworn in as jurors on Wednesday.\nSenate Republicans are turning up the pressure on their Democrat counterparts as they warn that Democrats will look to use a procedural maneuver to quickly table a trial against Mayorkas, effectively killing it.\nImpeachment managers for the House are going to physically walk the House-passed articles over to the Senate and deliver them to Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday, Speaker Mike Johnson's office told Fox News Digital.\nFollowing the article delivery, several Republicans, including Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, will hold a press conference with some of the selected House impeachment managers.\nThe process was initially planned to begin with delivery on Wednesday last week, but GOP senators convinced Johnson to hold off on sending the articles in order to set a trial in motion earlier in the week and not ahead of a weekend when lawmakers would be eager to fly home.\nThe articles passed through the House in February, and as Republican senators waited for their arrival in the upper chamber, it's given them time to pressure their Democrat colleagues, particularly those up for reelection who face competitive races in November. With the border becoming a top issue in states across the country, several vulnerable Democrats find themselves in a difficult position when it comes to entertaining a full impeachment trial against Mayorkas.\nAll eyes are on Sens. Bob Casey, D-Pa., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and Jon Tester, D-Mont., ahead of any potential motions to table or otherwise dismiss the impeachment trial after senators are sworn in on Wednesday. Aside from Rosen, who said she would like to see the articles dismissed, the other Democrats didn't say what they would do if such a motion was under consideration.\nIt's also unclear whether Sens. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, will go along with the largely united GOP's quest to see a full trial through. Most recently, Romney questioned whether there were any high crimes or misdemeanors committed, suggesting a policy difference didn't warrant impeachment.\nThese few senators will ultimately decide what happens upon swearing in, as the Senate's party split is narrow at 49-51.\nIn an effort to force senators to allow a full trial, a number of Senate Republicans are planning to potentially halt all legislative business in the upper chamber by objecting to regular proceedings. With many noting that unanimous consent is necessary to keep the Senate moving, Republicans are preparing to object to traditionally uncontested actions that are taken to expedite Senate action and avoid wasting time.\nIn a floor speech on Monday, Senate Democrat Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., urged dismissal of the impeachment articles.\n\"Instead of doing their job and working to find legislative solutions to complex, challenging problems, too many Republicans have decided that impeachment of a Cabinet official for actually doing his job is a better exercise of time,\" he said.\nHe pleaded with his fellow senators to \"quickly dispose of these unjustifiable articles of impeachment.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Julia Johnson Elizabeth Elkind,Elizabeth Elkind,Julia Johnson","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Left-Half-Right-Quarters-Center-Inset.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.0139728,"_id":"43a3791ca5dff71dbb1baead4e928266"},{"title":"Shock poll: Trump edges past Biden in key state, potential sign of cracks in Dems blue wall","author":"Paul Steinhauser","published_date":"2024-04-17 22:51:11","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-edging-biden-presidential-showdown-crucial-midwestern-battleground-poll","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Former President Donald Trump holds a two-point edge over President Biden in Wisconsin, according to a new poll in their 2024 presidential election rematch.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump holds a two-point edge over President Biden in Wisconsin, according to a new poll on their 2024 presidential election rematch.\nTrump stands at 51% support among registered voters in the crucial Midwestern battleground, with Biden at 49%, according to a Marquette Law School Poll released on Wednesday.\nAccording to the survey, which was conducted April 3-10, the former president holds the same 51%-49% edge over his White House successor among the smaller pool of likely voters.\nWhen third-party and independent candidates are included, Trump grabs 41% among registered voters, with Biden at 40%, Democrat turned independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at 13%, Green Party candidate Jill Stein at 3% and independent progressive Cornell West at 2%.\nAmong likely voters, it's Trump 42%, Biden 41%, Kennedy 12%, Stein 3% and West 1%.\nWisconsin \u2014 which Democrats carried in presidential elections from 1988 through 2012 \u2014 was part of the party's so-called \u2018blue wall.'\nBut eight years ago, Trump topped Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by a razor-thin margin to win the state.

Kim Reynolds, a Republican, told Fox News Digital in a statement.\nImmigration surpassed all other issues in a poll by Gallup in February, as more Americans agreed it was \"the most important problem facing this country today.\" The number of respondents to say so jumped eight points from January, to 28%. The previous issue cited as most important by Americans was \"government,\" followed by immigration, inflation and the economy in general. While immigration concerns managed to climb, government, inflation and economic worries remained relatively steady.\nThe issue ranked as the most important for the first time since 2019, prior to President Biden taking office and during former President Trump's administration. This was the year Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border following congressional refusal to grant him requested funds for border wall construction.\n\"The federal government's inaction at our nation's borders has led to a crisis with direct impacts upon all fifty states,\" New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu told Fox News Digital in a statement.\nIn the state, which is more than 2,000 miles from the U.S. southern border, 83% of residents said they consider illegal immigration a serious issue for the country. Among those residents, 58% said it is \"very serious,\" according to a March University of New Hampshire Survey Center (UNHSC) poll.\nAndrew Smith, director of the UNHSC, noted that the percentage of those who agree that illegal immigration is a \"very serious\" issue nationally has remained steady for more than a decade.\nJulie Kirchner, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), told Fox News Digital in a statement, \"Americans are not only seeing total chaos at the borders, where foreign nationals are literally tearing down barriers and assaulting border agents, they are witnessing first-hand how the crisis impacts every aspect of society.\"\nAt the same time, the March polling revealed that support for the construction of a border wall has surged since 2017, when opposition among New Hampshire residents was at more than half. Now, 52% in the state are in favor of the border wall, while 39% are against it.\n\"Every state, including New Hampshire, has experienced firsthand the economic and emotional toll associated with the federal government's failed response,\" said Sununu.\nReynolds claimed, \"It's clear to Iowans, and the American people, that the only way this chaos and crisis at the border can be fixed is at the ballot box,\" crediting Biden with the widespread effects of illegal immigration.\nDemocratic strategist Eric Koch pushed back on the idea the surging concern over immigration is Biden's fault, however. He noted that Republicans and Democrats in the Senate had been negotiating a border package \"that President Biden said he would have signed.\" The deal was ultimately sunk after former President Trump came out against it and Republican lawmakers followed suit.\n\"Trump and Republicans don't actually want to solve problems and walking away from the bipartisan border deal only confirms that,\" Koch added.\nA White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement, \"The Administration spent months negotiating in good faith to deliver the toughest and fairest bipartisan border security bill in decades because we need Congress to make significant policy reforms and to provide additional funding to secure our border and fix our broken immigration system.\"\nThe statement accused Republicans of placing \"partisan politics ahead of our national security\" in rejecting the border deal.\n\"Even without significant action from Congress, DHS is maximizing its enforcement operations,\" the spokesperson said.\nIn South Carolina's recent Republican presidential primary, 37% of voters pointed to immigration as the issue that was of the most significance to them ahead of casting their vote, according to a Reuters exit poll.\nThe economy came in second at 33% in the state, which is similarly more than 1,000 miles from the southern border.\n\"Every state is a border state because the Biden administration policies are to allow hundreds of thousands of aliens to illegally enter the United States and then be transported by federally funded NGO's to wherever they choose,\" said James Massa, CEO of NumbersUSA.\n\"A reason those non-border state voters are so focused on this is because of the right-wing media obsession with the issue,\" claimed Democratic strategist Kaivan Shroff, who chalked some of the concern up to a tactic to rally the Republican base.\n\"The irony here is Biden and Democrats have put forth a bipartisan border deal that would address many of the cited concerns Republicans have been focused on, and the deal was killed because of Trump,\" he added, echoing both the White House and fellow strategist Koch.\nAs Massa pointed out, non-governmental organizations are involved in the transportation of illegal immigrants to various locations within the U.S., and many of these NGOs also receive federal reimbursement and advance payments from the Department of Homeland Security for providing shelter or other eligible services to migrants released by DHS.\n\"The border crisis is funded with taxpayer dollars, regardless of state,\" he claimed.\nHe further said that illegal immigrants are choosing to travel further into the U.S. once being paroled by DHS, opting to settle in states \"that have sanctuary policies and/or benefit programs.\"\nIllegal immigrants have also been transported by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's administration to locations that have touted \"sanctuary\" policies for illegal immigrants, which some have pointed to as a trigger for concerns about the border across the country.\n\"Since launching the border transportation mission in April 2022, Texas has transported over 112,000 migrants to self-declared sanctuary cities to provide much-needed relief to our overrun and overwhelmed border communities as the Biden administration leaves thousands of migrants in Texas border towns,\" said Renae Eze, Abbott spokesperson.\nRepublican strategist Doug Heye noted that \"complaints from Democratic politicians that they can't handle this crisis on their own\" lend some credence to the claim that every state is now effectively a border state.\nLeaders of cities such as Chicago and New York, among others, have been overwhelmed by the illegal immigrants pouring in, prompting them to request assistance from Biden and the White House and plead with Abbott to halt his busing program.\n\"The sheer hypocrisy of these Democrat mayors knows no bounds, going to extreme lengths to avoid fulfilling their self-declared sanctuary city promises, yet they remain silent as President Biden transports migrants all around the country and oftentimes in the cover of night,\" added Eze.\nIowa GOP strategist David Kochel suggested the \"squealing of [Democratic] mayors \u2026 is definitely related to the busing.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Julia Johnson","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Right-Half-left-Quarters-vertical-Inset-1.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.935552,"_id":"4536a02b5ffd4a1eefff755d05380642"},{"title":"Republican aims to break decades long Senate election losing streak in this blue state","author":"Paul Steinhauser","published_date":"2024-04-20 08:00:42","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republican-aims-to-break-52-year-long-senate-election-losing-streak-in-blue-state","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Republican candidate Curtis Bashaw of New Jersey is optimistic the GOP in 2024 can break a nearly half century long losing streak in Senate elections in the Garden State","summary":"EXCLUSIVE - It's been over a half century since a Republican won a Senate election in blue state New Jersey.\nBut real estate developer and hotelier Curtis Bashaw is optimistic about his party's prospects in November's elections to end the decades-long losing streak.\nBashaw, one of the two leading contenders in a multi-candidate field in June's GOP Senate primary in New Jersey, emphasized \"I believe this is a once in a generation opportunity.\"\n\"I can't wait to see how we prove to the rest of the country that New Jersey is a lot more purple than people realize,\" he added in a national digital exclusive interview with Fox News.\nA major reason for Bashaw's optimism is the prospect of a three-way race in New Jersey. Longtime Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who was indicted last year on federal corruption charges, is not running for re-election as a Democrat and instead is mulling an independent bid, which polls indicate would potentially take votes away from likely Democratic Senate nominee Rep. Andy Kim.\nBashaw, an entrepreneur and historic preservationist who is recognized in the Garden State for leading the restorations of the historic Congress Hall and the Virginia Hotel in Cape May, at the southern tip of the Jersey shore, is a first time politician.\n\"I'm a political outsider,\" Bashaw emphasized. \"I'm a business guy. I built a business over 35 years restoring landmark abandoned hotels.\"\nAnd he highlighted that he grew his business from 25 to 1,000 employees.\n\"I'm in it because I want to unshackle small business from over regulation,\" he said.\nBashaw's chief rival for the GOP nomination is Christine Serrano Glassner, who's served for four years as mayor of Mendham Borough, in the northern part of the state.\nBashaw holds a formidable fundraising advantage in the Republican race - thanks in part to a large self-investment in his campaign.\nHe also enjoys an advantage on the primary ballot, as he has the county line in two-thirds of the state's 21 counties.\nNew Jersey has long allowed counties to print ballots that include a prominent party line, which are widely viewed as helping candidates with establishment backing. Kim sued in federal court to overturn the county lines in the Democratic Primary. But the GOP county lines were upheld.\n\"New Jersey is made up of thousands and thousands and thousands of small businesspeople. We are going to get to them really quickly and our name ID will go up really fast,\" Bashaw said.\nAnd pointing to a busy schedule on the campaign trail ahead of the primary, Bashaw showcased that \"I go to six coffees a day. I go talk to every single county in our state. I put a lot of miles on the car.\"\nAsked about former President Donald Trump, who is the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee, Bashaw told Fox News \"I'm supporting this ticket top to bottom.\"\nIt's been 36 years since a Republican carried New Jersey in a White House race, but Trump is planning a campaign stop in the state next month.\n\"Donald Trump thinks New Jersey's in play. I agree with him. Trump believes he can flip the country from blue to red. I believe we can flip this Senate seat from blue to red,\" Bashaw said.\nHe argued that \"there's a massive opportunity to pull\" New Jersey's large pool of unaffiliated voters \"to the Republican tent\u2026. We are going to pull those unaffiliated voters our way this fall.\"\nNational Republicans to date have not made any investments in the Senate race in the Garden State.\nBut National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director Mike Berg said \"we're keeping a close eye on New Jersey.\"\nA national Democratic Senate campaign aide, asked about the contest, told Fox News that \"Democrats have won every New Jersey Senate race since 1978 and 2024 will be no different.\"\nBashaw, in his interview, spotlighted a couple of key issues, including crime.\n\"New Jerseyans are not feeling safe and secure in their homes,\" he argued.\nOn immigration and border security, another key issue Republicans are spotlighting, he charged that New Jersey \"is now a border state. There are illegals coming into all of our counties.\"\n\"The woke ideology has permeated through our culture and we now have in our state, schools keeping secrets from parents about very, very, personal decisions,\" he claimed, as he defended parental rights in public education.\nOn the issue of abortion, which Democrats are spotlighting, Bashaw pointed to the two-year-old blockbuster decision by the Supreme Court's conservative majority that overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which for a half century had legalized abortion nationwide.\n\"I believe that the Dobbs decision was the correct decision,\" Bashaw said.\nBut he added that \"I don't support a federal ban,\" which some in his party are backing.\nThe Dobbs decision moved the fight over abortion back to the states, and in New Jersey abortion is legal in all stages of pregnancy.\n\"New Jersey's decided it,\" Bashaw said, before charging that \"the Democrats are the extremists on this issue, passing legislation allowing abortions up until the day of birth.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Paul Steinhauser","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Curtis-Bashaw-Cape-May-NJ-April-10-2024-scaled.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.934175,"_id":"938ed8733fa038d13fe7365d089522a4"},{"title":"New Louisiana congressional district 'textbook racial gerrymandering,' detractors say","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-18 11:00:55","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-louisiana-congressional-district-textbook-racial-gerrymandering-detractors-say","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Debate rages over whether LA's new congressional district map is racially or politically motivated after a judge ruled the previous map violated the Voting Rights Act.","summary":"Politics and race are both factors in a pending court challenge of Louisiana's new congressional maps. How much weight each carries is a major question before three federal judges whose ruling could affect the balance of power in the next Congress.\nAt issue is a congressional map that was approved this year with the backing of the state's new governor, Jeff Landry \u2014 to the consternation of at least some of his fellow Republicans.\nThe map creates a new mostly Black congressional district in Louisiana, at the expense of a white Republican incumbent, Rep. Garret Graves, who backed another Republican in the governor's election last fall. Given voting patterns in Louisiana, a mostly Black district would be more likely to send a Democrat to Congress.\nTwelve self-described non-African American voters argued in a lawsuit that the new mostly Black district constitutes illegal \"textbook racial gerrymandering.\"\nNot so, argue the new map's backers. Politics, they argue, was the major influence in drawing the new district boundary lines. They say the new map protects most incumbents and draws together Black populations in a way that will comply with the federal Voting Rights Act, giving Louisiana, which is roughly one-third Black, a second majority Black district among six.\nThey also pointed to Republican backers of the plan, who said during legislative debates in January that they wanted to safeguard four GOP-held House districts, including those of House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise.\nThat the new map put Graves in political peril by placing him in the new mostly Black district is further evidence race wasn't the sole motivating factor, the map's backers said in briefs and in testimony last week at a hearing in Shreveport.\n\"We all know that one of the main reasons it was drawn the way it was, was because Gov. Jeff Landry wants to get rid of Congressman Graves,\" state Rep. Mandie Landry, a New Orleans Democrat who testified at the hearing, said in a social media post. Landry is no relation to the governor.\nState Sen. Cleo Fields, a Black Democrat from the Baton Rouge area who served in Congress in the 1990s, has already declared his candidacy in the newly configured district.\nWhatever the three judges decide will likely be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. It's unclear when the judges will rule, but time is growing short. State election officials say they need to know the configuration of the districts by May 15 to prepare for the fall elections.\nThe controversy in Louisiana, as in other states, arose because new government district boundary lines are redrawn by legislatures every 10 years to account for population shifts reflected in census data. Louisiana's Republican-dominated Legislature drew a new map in 2022 that, despite some boundary shifts, was favorable to all six current incumbents: five white Republicans and a Black Democrat. Then-Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, vetoed the map but the majority-Republican Legislature overrode the veto, leading to a court challenge filed in Baton Rouge.\nIn June 2022, Baton Rouge-based U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick issued an injunction against the map, saying challengers would likely win their suit claiming it violated the Voting Rights Act. As the case was appealed, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an unexpected ruling in June that favored Black voters in a congressional redistricting case in Alabama.\nDick sided with challengers who said the 2022 map packed a significant number of voters in one district \u2014 District 2 which stretches from New Orleans to the Baton Rouge area \u2014 while \"cracking\" the remaining Black population by apportioning it to other mostly white districts.\nIn November, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals gave the state a January deadline for drawing a new congressional district. Landry, who was the state's attorney general when he was elected to succeed the term-limited Edwards, called a special session to redraw the map, saying the Legislature should do it rather than a federal judge.\nThe new map does not resemble the sample maps that supporters of a new majority Black district had suggested earlier, which would have created a new district largely covering the northeastern part of the state.\nThe new mostly Black district crosses the state diagonally, linking Shreveport in the northwest to parts of the Baton Rouge area in the southeast. And while its backers hail the creation of a new majority Black district, the plaintiffs say it results in \"explicit, racial segregation of voters.\"\nThe judges hearing the case are U.S. District Judges David Joseph and Robert Summerhays, both nominated to the court by former President Donald Trump; and Judge Carl Stewart of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, nominated by former Democratic President Bill Clinton.\nThe judges have given no indication when they will rule. \"We're going to have to know soon,\" Mandie Landry said, citing the upcoming elections.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Louisiana-Congressional-Districts.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.9046316,"_id":"e19a66299b76793c27dcaedfbb5c1118"},{"title":"Senators to be sworn in for Mayorkas impeachment trial ahead of expected dismissal","author":"Julia Johnson","published_date":"2024-04-17 15:26:36","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senators-sworn-in-mayorkas-impeachment-trial-expected-dismissal","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"After House impeachment managers delivered articles of impeachment to Schumer on Tuesday, all senators are set to be sworn in as jurors to consider the impeachment of DHS Secretary Mayorkas.","summary":"Senators are set to be sworn in as jurors at 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday to begin consideration of the House-passed articles of impeachment against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, a process that Republicans have warned that their Democratic colleagues will try to quickly end.\nHouse impeachment managers officially delivered the articles of impeachment, which passed the lower chamber in February, to Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Tuesday on the Senate floor.\nThe long-awaited delivery set into motion a procedure in the Senate, requiring that lawmakers be sworn in as jurors the following day to address the articles.\nHowever, Republicans have spent the last few weeks speculating that their Democratic counterparts will look to off-ramp the impeachment trial before arguments begin. This was confirmed by Schumer on the Senate floor on Wednesday morning, with the majority leader saying in remarks, \"For the sake of the Senate's integrity, and to protect impeachment for those rare cases we truly need it, senators should dismiss today's charges.\"\nSeveral Democratic senators have voiced support for dismissing the articles in the lead up to the trial's consideration, including Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., in a recent speech on the chamber floor.\nSchumer had previously stated his plans to \"expeditiously\" deal with the impeachment trial proceedings, without indicating the specific route the caucus was planning to take.\nRepublicans have expressed outrage at the likely refusal of their colleagues to allow a full impeachment trial against Mayorkas to play out. They have even threatened to shut down the Senate by making constant objections to requests for unanimous consent on regular business if a trial isn't seen all the way through.\nAt a press conference following the article delivery on Tuesday, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, previewed that \"we're going to see Chuck Schumer throw out 200 years of history [and] ignore the Constitution,\" referencing the fact that an impeachment trial has never been tabled by the Senate.\n\"He does not want these [House impeachment] managers to present the evidence of the people dying because of their policies,\" he added.\nSeveral vulnerable Democratic senators were expected to be the deciding factors on whether a trial was allowed to play out. But in recent days, multiple Democrats in highly competitive races in battleground states have revealed they want to see the trial dismissed.\nCasey expressed his opinion for the first time on Tuesday, telling CNN, \"I think we should move on and get to work on a bipartisan border security deal.\"\nThere have also been multiple Republicans whose planned votes were considered a mystery. Sens. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, are concerns on the right, despite the conference being largely united. This unity was evidenced by 43 Republicans signing onto a letter last week calling on Schumer to allow the trial to be seen all the way through.\nWith a narrow split in the upper chamber, agreement among the parties can be easily disrupted by just a few senators. Democrats hold the majority with just 51-49 over Republicans.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Julia Johnson","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2148857710-scaled-e1713365605499.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.899398,"_id":"56180001efbff0b4152cba85963121c8"},{"title":"Minnesota Dems disavow endorsement of candidate accused of stalking opponent","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-16 22:43:56","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/minnesota-dems-disavow-endorsement-candidate-accused-stalking-opponent","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Minnesota Democrats have disavowed a local party chapter's backing of Judd Hoff, a state House candidate with a violent criminal history.","summary":"Minnesota Democrats have disavowed a local party chapter's endorsement of a state House candidate who has a violent criminal history and is accused of stalking and harassing the Republican lawmaker he is challenging.\nJudd Hoff was endorsed this month by Democrats in District 12 to run for a central Minnesota seat that has been represented by Republican Rep. Mary Franson of Alexandria since 2011. Republicans were quick Monday to demand that Democrats rescind their backing of Hoff.\n\"Democrats must withdraw their endorsement of this repeat criminal,\" GOP Rep. Josh Heintzeman, of Nisswa, said in a statement. \"For years he has harassed and stalked Rep. Franson by digging through her trash, publishing her address and contact information, filming her at her private residence, and relentlessly sending rude and threatening messages online.\"\nFranson's district is heavily Republican and is not considered competitive. She won reelection in 2022 with nearly 70% of the vote. She tweeted that she considered Hoff to be dangerous and asked, \"Why is this the guy they want as a candidate?\"\nKen Martin, chairman of Minnesota's Democratic Party, said in statement later Monday that the party \"strongly disavows this endorsement,\" and he asked the local party unit to withdraw its endorsement immediately. He said the state party won't spend any of its resources to support Hoff.\n\"We all have a responsibility, regardless of party or ideology, to reject violence in our politics \u2014 we can and should expect better from candidates for elected office,\" the Democratic leader said.\nHoff's criminal history includes a felony second-degree assault conviction for wielding a 23-inch machete during an argument in 2020. He was sentenced to 13 months and spent about eight months in jail. Court records show the judge gave him a break over the prosecution's objections because the victim was the initial aggressor.\nIn a video posted to YouTube, first surfaced by former GOP operative Michael Brodkorb, Hoff admitted to digging through Franson's garbage and acknowledged moving into a home across the street from Franson.\nThe chair of the district and county party committee, Bonnie Bina, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that Hoff was the only candidate who came forward to run for the seat. She acknowledged that it's hard to recruit Democratic candidates to take on incumbents in such a heavily Republican area.\nBina also acknowledged that delegates knew that Hoff had a criminal record and had spent time in prison. But she said he told them he was past that and had become active in the community. She declined to comment on whether they were aware of the allegations that he harassed Franson.\nThe local party committee will decide its next steps after getting more information from the state party office and reviewing party rules, she said, adding that she didn't know how long that would take.\nHoff did not immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/03/MN2.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.8928623,"_id":"909aa024082ea8a0facaf295a6db6cdb"},{"title":"Pentagon says Iran's attack was met with 'unprecedented coalition' to protect Israel","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-16 15:23:20","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6351036069112","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Pentagon Deputy Spokeswoman Sabrina Singh responds to questions about Iran's attack on Israel and whether the U.S. will be more involved.","summary":"All times eastern Your World with Neil Cavuto The Evening Edit with Elizabeth Macdonald FOX News Radio Live Channel Coverage WATCH LIVE: House Republicans deliver Mayorkas articles of impeachment to the Senate\nAll times eastern Your World with Neil Cavuto The Evening Edit with Elizabeth Macdonald FOX News Radio Live Channel Coverage WATCH LIVE: House Republicans deliver Mayorkas articles of impeachment to the Senate","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/80075e02-28f9-4187-9531-4cca91adc9ce/4ce608a4-00af-46ad-8c1a-18b131a4f7c7/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.8771496,"_id":"77dbfc5860a0464f621f0b2ac90a3b1d"},{"title":"Tennessee school voucher program plans come to an end after Gov.

Bill Lee's plans to expand school vouchers and allow families to access public funds for private schooling has come to an end as legislative leaders do not reach an agreement.","summary":"Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee conceded defeat Monday in his push to enact universal school vouchers this year, acknowledging there was \"not a pathway for the bill\" after months of Republican infighting.\n\"I am extremely disappointed for the families who will have to wait yet another year for the freedom to choose the right education for their child, especially when there is broad agreement that now is the time to bring universal school choice to Tennessee,\" Lee, a Republican, said in a statement.\nLee first unveiled his plans last fall to allow families to access public money for private schooling, regardless of income. At the time, he was surrounded by national school choice advocates, the state's top Republican legislative leaders and even Arkansas GOP Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who had signed into law a voucher proposal just that year and used the event to tout that a conservative education revolution was happening around the country.\nYet despite the initial support, Lee's vision was always considered ambitious in a state where rural GOP lawmakers have remained skeptical of losing limited public school money in their own districts.\nFor months, Tennessee's GOP-dominant General Assembly has been deeply divided on the details surrounding how such a statewide plan would work. Differing versions advanced in the House and Senate but ultimately stalled as legislative leaders worked behind the scenes to come up with a deal.\nBut as of last week, the tone inside the Tennessee Capitol had noticeably shifted as lawmakers entered into the final weeks of session and hopes of a deal began to plummet. As of last week, no one would publicly declare the bill dead, instead saying that ultimately that call had to come from Lee.\nLee has since promised to renew the school voucher talks next session, though it's unclear how much more successful that attempt will fare, as some members won't be returning next year because of retirement and others are facing opponents in this year's election.\nNotably, both House and Senate budget writers still set aside $144 million for the voucher expansion in their spending proposals. That means that money will sit idly for nearly a year until school voucher talks can resume next January.\n\"Many initiatives need multiple years, or even multiple general assemblies, before they are ripe for passage,\" said Senate Speaker Randy McNally. \"This is not an end, but a new beginning. Conversations will continue over the summer and fall, and we will revisit the issue next session with renewed purpose.\"\nLee first asked lawmakers to consider expanding school vouchers back in 2019, when the plan was to allow parents of students in certain low-income districts with three or more schools ranked in the bottom 10% to receive $7,300 from a government-authorized account to pay for approved expenses.\nAfter much editing, Republicans just barely passed a program that applied only to Democratic strongholds in Davidson and Shelby counties, which encompass Nashville and Memphis.

Janel Brandtjen as was recommended by the bipartisan Wisconsin Ethics Commission.\nShe is the fourth county prosecutor to decide against filing charges against former President Donald Trump's fundraising committee, Brandtjen and others involved in the effort to unseat Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos.\nUltimately, the state attorney general, Democrat Josh Kaul, could be asked to prosecute the cases.\nThe ethics commission alleges that Trump's fundraising committee and Brandtjen, a Trump ally, conspired in a scheme to evade campaign finance laws to support the Republican primary challenger to Vos in 2022. It forwarded recommendations for filing felony charges to prosecutors in six counties.\nVos angered Trump by firing a former state Supreme Court justice Vos had hired to investigate Trump's discredited allegations of fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Vos launched the probe under pressure from Trump, but eventually distanced himself from Trump's effort to overturn President Joe Biden's win in Wisconsin.\nTrump and Brandtjen then tried to unseat Vos by backing a GOP primary opponent, Adam Steen. Trump called Steen a \"motivated patriot\" when endorsing him shortly before the 2022 primary. Vos, the longest-serving Assembly speaker in Wisconsin history, defeated Steen by just 260 votes.\nThe ethics commission alleges that Trump's Save America political action committee, Brandtjen, Republican Party officials in three counties and Steen's campaign conspired to avoid state fundraising limits as they steered at least $40,000 into the effort to defeat Vos.\nOpper said her decision did not \"clear Rep.

On Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 5th District Court of Appeals said Paxton can be sanctioned by the committee because the lawsuit seeks to punish him in his personal capacity as an attorney and not as a public official.\n\"The focus of the Commission's allegations is squarely on Paxton's alleged misconduct \u2014 not that of the State,\" Judge Erin Nowell, an elected Democrat, wrote in the 2-1 opinion.\nThe lone Republican on the panel, Judge Emily Miskel, was in dissent.\nA similar lawsuit was also brought against one of Paxton's top deputies. Earlier this week, a coalition of state Republican attorneys general urged the Texas Supreme Court to reject efforts by the bar to impose discipline. All nine members of the state's highest civil court are Republicans.\n\"As in that case, we will appeal this ruling and we have full confidence the Supreme Court of Texas will not allow false claims by the State Bar and partisan political revenge to affect professional licensure of the state's lawyers,\" Paxton spokeswoman Paige Willey said in a statement.\nA spokeswoman for the State Bar of Texas and the committee accusing Paxton declined to comment on the ruling.\nPaxton is among the highest-profile attorneys to face a threat of sanctions for aiding in efforts led by former President Donald Trump to throw into question Trump's defeat.\nThe state bar's disciplinary group's punishments against an attorney can range from a written admonition to a suspension or disbarment. The disciplinary process resembles a trial and could include both sides eliciting testimony and obtaining records through discovery.\nPaxton is not required to have bar membership in order to serve as attorney general.\nState bar officials began investigating complaints over Paxton's election lawsuit in 2021.

Kennedy, Jr. getting 9%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 2% each. In January, it was Trump who was up by 3 points over Biden, with Kennedy at 7%.\nKennedy receives a bit more of his backing from those who favor Trump (9%) in the 2-way ballot than from Biden (5%).\nBiden won Wisconsin in 2020 by 20,682 votes, less than one percentage point. Trump's 2016 victory was also by less than a point (22,748 votes).\nMore voters trust Trump to do a better job handling immigration (by 13 points) and the economy (+9). Biden is preferred over Trump on abortion (+9), health care (+7), and election integrity (+7). They are rated more evenly on foreign policy (Trump +2) and energy policy (even).\nOn the Middle East, equal numbers think the Biden administration is too supportive of the Israelis (25%) and the Palestinians (24%). Yet the largest share says Biden's support of each is about right (38%) \u2014 and they favor him over Trump by 38 points.\nOverall, Wisconsinites feel somewhat positive about their personal finances, as 6 in 10 say their situation is either holding steady (45%) or improving (14%). Both of those groups largely favor Biden, while the 4 in 10 who are falling behind financially go for Trump by a wide margin.\nIn the Congressional ballot test, 46% go for the Democratic candidate in their district and 45% for the Republican. Neither Biden nor Trump is a drain on his party, as 94% of those backing the Congressional Democrat favor Biden and 93% of those supporting the Republican go for Trump.\n\"Data from the 2022 election suggests MAGA candidates ran three to four points worse than non-MAGA Republicans,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts Fox News polls with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"But we're not seeing that \u2018Trump tax' so far in the 2024 numbers. Neither are we seeing Biden underperforming other Democrats. It looks like partisans are behaving like partisans.\"\nBy a 5-point margin, more voters think Trump (48%) has the mental soundness to serve effectively as president than Biden (43%). Most Republicans (89%) say Trump has it and most Democrats say Biden does (85%), but independents are 17 points more likely to say Trump is mentally fit.\nThe survey finds 44% approve of Biden's job performance and 55% disapprove \u2014 unchanged since January (44-56%). His 48% support in the 2-way race is higher than his approval because 10% of those disapproving of the job he's doing still pick him over Trump.\nNearly two-thirds think Biden was legitimately elected in 2020, and they back him over Trump by 53 points and are twice as likely to approve of the job he's doing (67% approve, 32% disapprove). Among the one-third who say Biden was not legitimately elected, 98% favor Trump in the 2-way race and 98% disapprove of Biden's job performance.\nWisconsin voters are unified when it comes to having a negative opinion of both Biden and Trump. Views of each are net negative by a 10-point margin, as they both receive the same rating: 44% favorable vs 54% unfavorable.\nKennedy's ratings are negative by 13 points, 35% favorable vs. 48% unfavorable. He's viewed much more positively by Republicans (49%) and independents (44%) than Democrats (19%).\nAmong the small segment of so-called double haters (those viewing both Biden and Trump unfavorably), the vote preference splits: Biden 38% vs. Trump 39% % in the two-way ballot test. When third-party candidates are included, they back Kennedy (34%), followed by Biden (21%), Trump (13%), West (10%), and Stein (9%).\nConducted April 11-16, 2024 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,198 Wisconsin registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file.

Adam Smith, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, told reporters, \"I think it's unlikely I would support vacating him. We'll see.\"\n\"The big thing is, I want a vote on Ukraine. More to the point, I want Ukraine to get the aid. We waited months longer than we should have for highly questionable reasons. Now we're down to the last minute, Ukraine's hanging on by their fingernails,\" Smith said.\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., became the second GOP lawmaker after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., to threaten to file a motion to vacate against Johnson, which would trigger a vote on his ouster. Massie told Johnson in a closed-door Tuesday House GOP meeting that Johnson should step aside after a vote happens on his recently announced foreign aid plan or face the threat of losing his gavel.\nDemocrats do not necessarily have to vote against ousting Johnson \u2013 any vote on vacating him would likely be preceded by a vote to table the motion, which would effectively kill it. Likewise, simply not showing up to vote on a motion to vacate would make the margins more favorable for Johnson.\nThe Louisiana Republican is leader of a razor-thin House GOP majority of just two seats. While that means that just a small amount of dissent can cost him the job, it also means he would likely only need a few Democrats to help him keep it.\n\"I think Democrats are very open to a deal, but that has to come from Republicans,\" Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., said on Tuesday.\nAsked if Johnson would have to reach out to Democrats to initiate that deal, Moulton said, \"Of course, he's the Speaker of the House. It's his f---ing job.\"\nMoulton, however, said passing aid to Ukraine would not be enough in exchange for the Democrats' help. \"The bar's been pathetically low for the Republican Party for a long time. But no, in my personal opinion, simply doing his job and allowing a democratic vote on legislation is not enough for a deal,\" he said, though he did not elaborate on what a deal should entail.\nRep. Don Beyer, D-Va., told Fox News Digital that Jeffries signaled there is a way forward for Johnson to make a deal with Democrats.\n\"Hakeem Jeffries has made that clear a number of times. You know, I've said same thing \u2013 I hate the idea of punishing Mike Johnson for doing the right thing,\" Beyer, a progressive, told Fox News Digital in regard to a foreign aid plan. \"The one I think most of us care the most about is Ukraine aid, and then secondarily, some kind of Israel-Gaza package.\"\nBeyer would not say if Johnson's proposal on foreign aid would be enough for Democrats to help him, given the lack of legislative text, but did not rule it out, either. Meanwhile, Johnson has faced bipartisan pressure to take up the Senate's $95 billion supplemental aid package for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and Gaza.\n\"Hopefully he's found a way to manage his disruptive caucus by breaking it into pieces\u2026without having to put the whole Senate bill on the floor, which is apparently not a winning strategy from his perspective,\" Beyer said.\nRep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., said he would consider voting to table a motion to oust Johnson if he put foreign aid up for a vote \u2013 if only not to empower the right wing of the Republican conference.\n\"At the end of the day, if my job is to make sure that we can continue the world order, and that my job is to make sure that we get our allies the aid that they need so that our allies don't look at the U.S. as a non-functioning body anymore, and turn to China and turn to Russia, if the idea is voting for a motion to table or letting [Massie and Greene] take this all down, yeah, I would vote for motion to table,\" Moskowitz said.\nBut Republicans were skeptical about that being a permanent safety net.\n\"I don't think that works,\" Massie told reporters on Tuesday. \"I think for every Democrat that comes to save him he'll lose at least two or three more in our conference, and that makes it toxic.\"\nAnother GOP lawmaker who spoke with Fox News Digital suggested Johnson would lose control of the House GOP conference if Democrats saved him during a vacate vote.\n\"I think it's a different conference then,\" the GOP lawmaker said. \"If I'm the Democrats and I get asked to do that, the quid pro quo on that would make it enormously difficult to lead the conference.

Eric Swalwell, sent out mailers to Pennsylvania voters to slam GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick and say he is not conservative enough, in essence boosting his primary opponent, Mark Houck, Politico first reported this week.\nFox News Digital obtained some of those mailers that framed Fitzpatrick as a \"RINO\" (\"Republican in name only\") and implied he wasn't conservative enough for the base that supports former President Trump.\n\"MAGA is ready to bag the biggest RINO in Congress,\" reads one of the mailers along with a photo of Fitzpatrick photoshopped onto a rhinoceros body. \"We sent Brian Fitzpatrick to D.C. to represent our values, instead, he became best friends with Kamala Harris and the Democrats,\" another mailer said.\nFEC records show True Patriots PA spent roughly $26,000 on the mailer.\nMeagan Olson is listed as treasurer for both True Patriots PA and the Swalwell campaign.\n\"I consider Brian a friend and someone who has bravely defied his party to help secure Ukraine aid,\" Rep. Swalwell told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"I have never heard of his primary opponent and am not involved or support any effort to defeat Brian in the primary.

Suzan DelBene said her group no longer supports the strategy of propping up \"far-right\" candidates in swing districts.\n\"It should come as no surprise that a group connected to Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat who is so dumb that he was tricked into sleeping with a Chinese spy, would be propping up self-described chronic masturbator Mark Houck in the Republican Primary against Brian Fitzpatrick,\" Defending America PAC's Chris Pack told Fox News Digital.\n\"Even Democrats as intellectually challenged as Eric Swalwell know that their best chance at flipping the one seat needed to take back Democrat control of the House of Representatives is if Mark Houck beats Brian Fitzpatrick in the primary next Tuesday.\"\nHouck, a pro-life activist, has made previous acknowledgments that he \"had a pornography problem\" as a young man and spoke openly at a church conference about talking to his son about masturbation and erections.\n\"I struggled with pornography, and of course that leads to sexual sin, masturbation and stuff. That was a chronic habit,\" Houck said in a 2010 interview, which Defending America PAC included in an ad titled \"Beat it.\"\nIn a recent statement, Houck said he \"fell victim to the dehumanizing effects of the pornography industry\" over \"two decades ago.\" He also defended the conversation about his son, saying the clips circulating online \"seizes on de-contextualized comments I made with my son present in public pursuit of this transformative ministry\" meant to steer people away from pornography.\nThe Democrat group boosting Houck is the latest example of a recent trend in which liberal funds have been used to back Republican challengers in an effort to sink candidates who support or are supported by former President Trump.\nPACs linked to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have spent millions meddling in GOP primaries this cycle, including in swing state Senate races in Ohio and Montana.\nDuty and Country PAC, affiliated with Schumer, ran ads during the Ohio GOP Senate primary that accused Trump-backed businessman Bernie Moreno of being \"too conservative for Ohio.\" That effort proved unsuccessful in the primary as Moreno won every county in the Buckeye State, beating his nearest challenger by almost 20 points.\nIn 2022, Democrats spent more than $40 million to boost six pro-Trump candidates in Republican primaries, and all six of those Republicans lost their general election races to Democrats.\nFitzpatrick, who has so far declined to say if he will endorse Trump, voted against impeaching Trump twice and won re-election in 2022 by almost 10 points, despite Biden carrying the 1st Congressional district.\n\"After years of brutal losses, the far-left has finally figured out they have no chance of beating Congressman Fitzpatrick, so they've now tagged California left-wing extremists to meddle in his primary using the same violent political rhetoric they claim to stand against,\" Fitzpatrick campaign spokesperson Ben Trundy told Fox News Digital in statement.\n\"This lame attempt to prop up Mark Houck, an admitted porn addict and serial grifter who believes in complete abortion bans with no exceptions, shows just how desperate they are to force their extreme policies on Bucks and Montgomery County voters.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Andrew Miller","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-2056532467.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.8097496,"_id":"ffe496120a24f35d876a79b29fa022d5"},{"title":"Massie threatens to oust Speaker Johnson if he doesn't step down over foreign aid plan","author":"Elizabeth Elkind","published_date":"2024-04-16 14:57:19","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/massie-threatens-oust-speaker-johnson-if-he-doesnt-step-down-over-foreign-aid-plan","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Speaker Mike Johnson is facing another threat to oust him from leadership as he struggles to navigate a fractured and unruly conference.","summary":"Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is facing renewed motion to vacate threats a day after he introduced a plan to pass foreign aid.\nRep.

Chip Roy, R-Texas, wrote on X after the meeting imploded.\nHe's one of three Republican foreign aid hawks on the House Rules Committee, which is the final barrier before a piece of legislation hits the House floor.\nIt comes as conservative rebels in the House GOP conference criticize the speaker's decision not to link border security measures to his $95 billion foreign aid plan.\nJohnson told lawmakers on Wednesday that the House would consider separate foreign aid bills on Ukraine, Israel, the Indo-Pacific and a fourth bill including various foreign policy provisions. If passed, they would be sent to the Senate in a combined package.\nTo appease Republicans concerned about not using it as an opportunity to crack down on the border crisis, he also unveiled a separate bill similar to H.R.2, the comprehensive immigration and border enforcement bill House Republicans passed last year but which the Democrat-controlled Senate refused to take up. He said that bill would go through procedural hurdles parallel to the foreign aid bills, rather than alongside them.\nIn a remarkable moment toward the end of the meeting, Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., the top Democrat on the committee, acknowledged that the bill has no support from Democrats and likely no future in Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's Senate. He also pointed out that the three conservative rebels on the panel would likely vote against the bill as well \u2013 meaning it would not even survive their committee.\n\"We've been here. We've done this already. We know what the Senate is going to do. And my three colleagues, who I know have been expressing some discontent about what's going on here, I mean, maybe we can end this hearing.

Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., if they planned to vote in favor of advancing the bill.\nMassie and Roy would not say, with Roy adding, \"I think I'm pretty well publicly not in favor of what's going here.\" Norman said he would oppose the bill.\nThe hearing soon recessed without a conclusion.\nForeign aid and aid to Ukraine, specifically, have proven to be politically fraught topics for Johnson as he navigates a historically slim House majority and new threats from fellow Republicans to trigger a vote on his ouster.\nJohnson has argued that tying U.S. border measures to foreign aid, especially Ukraine, would kill its chances of passing .\"We want the border to be part of every single thing we do here,\" he told reporters on Thursday morning, adding, \"We don't have the votes.

Republicans were not unanimous in their approval of the measure, with 101 voting in favor of the aid package, and 112 voting against it.\nSpeaker Johnson, R-La., unveiled the foreign aid plan earlier in the week, though a lack of any border security measures prompted allies to be wary of letting the bills move forward.\nA meeting to advance the package ended Wednesday night without a vote because it provided funding for Ukraine and not U.S. border security.\nOne of those Republican foreign aid hawks on the House Rules Committee was Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas. The House Rules Committee is the final barrier before a piece of legislation moves to the House floor for a vote.\nAfter the vote, Roy and others turned to the social media platform X to express their discontent of the foreign aid package.\n\"Today, I voted no... These bills were brought forward under a contrived process to achieve a pre-determined outcome \u2014 a $100 billion, unpaid-for foreign aid package while failing to secure the border,\" Roy wrote. \"For months, House Republicans \u2014 specifically, Speaker Mike Johnson \u2014 have been unequivocal that we would not send billions in additional aid to Ukraine without securing our own border first. This package represents a complete reversal of a position that previously unified the Republican conference, despite the clear & present danger the southern border represents to U.S. national security.\"\nRoy said he supported Ukraine's effort to defeat Putin, but added he cannot support sending $60 billion in additional funding without the U.S. having a \"clear mission\" and \"policy changes necessary\" to secure its own border.\nLike Roy, Rep. Ben Cline, R-Va., voted against the package because of \"urgent problems\" happening in the U.S.\n\"States and cities across our nation are grappling with the consequences of Biden's border crisis, inflation continues to squeeze the budgets of every American household, and our country is over $34 trillion in debt,\" Cline said. \"As I continue fighting for the people of Virginia's Sixth District, I urge my colleagues in Congress and the Biden Administration to listen to the American people and put their concerns first.\"\nHouse Freedom Caucus member Rep. Eric Burlison also weighed in.\n\"Republicans have control of the House, and we should be leveraging it to secure our border, unfortunately the Uniparty is working to secure the borders of Ukraine instead of our own border,\" he said. \"This has to stop, we should be putting AMERICA FIRST!\"\nBurlison, Cline, and Roy could not be reached for comment on the matter.\nAccording to U.S. Customs and Border Protection sources, there were over 7,000 encounters at the southern border on Friday, following two days in a row of about 6,500. During prior weeks, the number of encounters had been in the 4,000s and 5,000s.\n\"We are beyond disappointed that the House would give aid to secure the borders of foreign countries but gave nothing to allow the Border Patrol to secure the safety of the United States,\" Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, told Fox News. \"There's nothing more backwards.

Traditionally, the closed-door election to pick a new party leader takes place sometime that month following an election.\nThe Virginia Republican was one of eight House GOP lawmakers who voted with Democrats to oust Johnson's predecessor, ex-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., in October 2023.\n\"I think there's a lot of dissatisfaction within the Republican Party. I think the speaker guarantees himself that there will be a contest for the speaker, I hope, in November. I think that's the wise course when you're sitting at a 216 to 213 margin,\" Good said.\nGood has been among the most vocal critics of Johnson's leadership, particularly when the speaker has had to reach across the aisle to pass critical legislation. But his wariness of embracing calls for Johnson's ouster shows the overall wariness of members of Johnson's right flank to undergo the same three weeks of chaos they did last year.\nWhen asked to clarify whether he would not support if his fellow Republicans triggered a vote for Johnson's ouster \u2013 known as a motion to vacate \u2013 Good said, \"I only know of members who have said they support a motion to vacate. I certainly have not said that.\"\n\"I think the appropriate time to have that contest would be in November,\" he said.\nHe reasoned that House Republicans are dealing with a slimmer majority than in October when GOP rebels ousted McCarthy, and that there were longstanding issues some members had with the former speaker and his leadership, compared to Johnson's relative newcomer status.\nIt comes after Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., threatened to trigger a vote for Johnson's ouster over his foreign aid plan earlier this week if he did not willingly step aside. He's now co-sponsoring an earlier motion to vacate resolution filed by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a fierce critic of Johnson's leadership.\nGood, who does not have a close relationship with Greene since her ouster from the Freedom Caucus and her criticism of the Republicans who forced out McCarthy, would not say whether he thought Greene's attack against Johnson was misguided.\n\"I'll just point out that the\u2026two members who signed on to that are members who were very critical of holding the previous speaker accountable,\" Good said. \"And so I think it's a conversation for them on what's different today, versus the actions that they were critical of a year ago.\"\nHe continued, \"I would point out that the margin is so much more narrow that when they were saying a year ago that, \u2018Oh, they might elected Democrat speaker,' that was just dishonesty\u2026It's a much more precarious position to pursue that now.\"\nMeanwhile, Johnson put out a statement Thursday afternoon saying he had no intention of supporting efforts to change the motion to vacate rule.\n\"Since the beginning of the 118th Congress, the House rule allowing a Motion to Vacate from a single member has harmed this office and our House majority,\" he said. \"Recently, many members have encouraged me to endorse a new rule to raise this threshold.

Susan Wild in the state's 7th Congressional District, which is one of the most evenly divided House districts in the country.\nIn flipping the seat in 2018 and in her 2020 and 2022 re-elections, Wild's races have come down to the wire. But Wild, in anticipation of another bruising re-election bid, has assembled a formidable campaign war chest, far ahead of her GOP challengers.\nThe GOP congressional primary is a three-way race between state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, National Guard veteran Kevin Dellicker and attorney Maria Montero.\n\"Both national parties are almost guaranteed to invest in this race,\" Covey emphasized. \"But the GOP candidates' anemic fundraising has made some national GOP strategists less bullish on flipping this seat, and other Democratic-held swing seats could take priority in November.\"\nRepublicans are also taking aim at Democratic Rep. Matt Carwright in northeastern Pennsylvania's 8th Congressional District. And across the state, in the Pittsburgh-based 17th District, Rep. Chris Deluzio is being targeted by the GOP.\nBut neither district is expected to have competitive Republican primaries on Tuesday.\nWealthy construction company CEO Rob Bresnahan is considered the presumptive nominee in the 8th District, while state Rep. Rob Mercuri doesn't face any major rivals in the primary in the 17th.\nWhile they play plenty of defense in Pennsylvania, Democrats are also eyeing an opportunity to flip a red seat. That opportunity is in the 10th District \u2014 anchored by the state capital Harrisburg in the central part of the state \u2014 where former Freedom Caucus Chair Scott Perry is up for re-election.\nRepublicans control the House 218-213, with vacant seats in three red districts and one in a blue district. The Cook Report rates 22 races as toss-ups, evenly split between the Democrats and Republicans.\nRepublicans controlled the House majority for eight years before the Democrats won back the chamber in the 2018 midterms. In the 2020 elections, the GOP defied expectations and took a big bite out of the Democrats' majority.

Roger Marshall of Kansas and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee will look to force votes on two different versions of a stand-alone Israel aid measure in the Senate on Monday night.\nFollowing Iran's drone attack on Israel over the weekend, the two Republicans are planning to ask for unanimous consent to force votes on both Israel aid bills \u2013 one that is for $14.3 billion and includes cuts to Biden's $80 billion expansion of the Internal Revenue Service under the Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 and another for $17.6 billion that does not include a mechanism to pay for it. The former will be led by Marshall while Blackburn tries to force a vote on the latter.\nIn prepared remarks, Marshall is expected to tell his fellow senators: \"Time and time again, I see members, even the Democrat Majority Leader this weekend, say he stands with Israel.\"\nWith his unanimous consent to vote on the stand-alone Israel bill, Marshall said in a prepared statement: \"My message today to my colleagues is that actions speak louder than words. We are tired of hearing the pro-Israel lip service while you simultaneously block every effort to help Israel in its time of need. History will not forget this; let's do the right thing.\"\n\"Democrats say they support Israel, but their actions since October 7 to repeatedly block urgent standalone aid have told a different story,\" Blackburn told Fox News Digital in a statement.\n\"Senator Marshall and I will once again request the Senate swiftly and unanimously give Israel the resources they need to continue their fight against terrorism. In light of Iran's historic attack this weekend, I hope our Democratic colleagues will put politics aside and join us in support of our Jewish friends.\"\nA Democratic senator is likely to object to the request, as the caucus has maintained its desire to tie Israel aid to Ukraine aid.\nMarshall previously tried to force a vote on the same measure late last year, but his request for unanimous consent was objected to by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who argued on the chamber floor, \"Ukraine can no more afford a delay than our allies in Israel.\"\nThe bill for aid to Israel only, and not Ukraine or Taiwan, passed the House earlier last year, by a largely party-line vote of 226 to 196. Two Republicans defected from their conference, while 12 Democrats voted with Republicans. The measure's IRS funding cut was a particularly controversial point of the bill, as it took funds allocated within Biden's much-touted IRA law. While Republicans claimed the additional money for the IRS would mean auditing more Americans, Democrats claimed it would instead prevent wealthy individuals from getting away with not paying taxes.\nThe White House renewed its threat on Monday to veto aid to Israel that was not tied to other foreign aid. At a White House press briefing, Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre claimed, \"We will not accept a stand alone.\"\n\"Stand-alone would actually not help Israel and Ukraine,\" she said.\nNational security communications spokesperson John Kirby reiterated the White House's opposition at the same briefing, telling reporters, \"We are opposed to a standalone bill that would just work on Israel.\"\nMarshall and Blackburn each voted against the $95.3 billion supplemental foreign aid package that included Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan in February. Arguing against the aid, Marshall told his colleagues that voting against the measure was putting U.S. \"national security first by securing the border first.\"\n\"Up here in DC, my friends across the aisle, the White House, they continue to put Ukraine funding as their priority,\" he said.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Julia Johnson","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Double-Rectangle-Inset-3.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.710613,"_id":"47ece44e2d393d2a0f1b7f7a69d6fbac"},{"title":"Fetterman endorses Romney taking over Harvard to reform antisemitism: 'Recalibrate from far-left orthodoxy'","author":"Brian Flood","published_date":"2024-04-22 20:08:03","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/fetterman-endorses-romney-taking-over-harvard-reform-antisemitism-recalibrate-far-left-orthodoxy","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Harvard University is a \"mess\" and Sen.

This former Governor of Massachusetts doesn't need a paycheck, but Harvard and its academic peers need to recalibrate from far-left orthodoxy.\"\nRosen said he was a lifelong Democrat who didn't vote for Romney when he ran for president, but made the suggestion \"in the sincere and robust hope that he is someone who can navigate the university through painful but necessary reform and drive back the antisemitism that is tarnishing the institution's credibility.\n\"As the grandson of Holocaust survivors and president of the American Jewish Congress, I find it devastating that Harvard has failed to vigorously address the unchecked antisemitism on campus,\" he wrote.\nRosen wrote that anyone who studied at Harvard can attest it is \"not an antisemitic institution\" despite recent events that indicate otherwise.\n\"I never for a moment felt oppressed or marginalized as a student on the Harvard campus. But to my dismay, recent years have seen an unconscionable spike in \u2014 and even worse, an administrative tolerance of \u2014 hate speech directed at Jews, including targeting Jewish students. The university's response has thus far been ramshackle and unproductive, to put it mildly,\" Rosen wrote.\nRosen reminded readers of \"the disastrous congressional testimony of then-President Claudine Gay,\" in which she famously failed to say that calls for intifada or the genocide of Jews on campus violated Harvard's code of conduct or policy against bullying and harassment.\nAfter her congressional testimony, Gay issued an apology and the university's board initially decided to stick by her despite widespread calls from donors and members of Congress for her ouster. However, she stepped down shortly afterward after being hit with significant plagiarism allegations.\n\"The university president must be the flag-bearer of our values. There is no doubt that there are other Americans of similar standing and stature, but Romney's unique bridge-building character is precisely what Harvard needs in an age of toxic polarization,\" Rosen wrote, praising him for working with Democrats on issues like \"gun safety reform\" and voting to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.\nRomney, who has stood out among Senate Republicans with his opposition to former President Trump, has said he will not seek re-election in the Senate in 2024. He voted to convict Trump in both his impeachment trials, the only Republican to do so, and has not supported him in any of his White House bids.\nBuoyed in part by his successful overseeing of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Romney served one term as Massachusetts governor from 2003 to 2007. He later made a failed bid for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination. He won the Republican nomination in 2012 \u2013 the last candidate other than Trump to do so \u2013 and lost the general election to President Obama.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brian Flood","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/FETTERMAN-ROMNEY-SPLIT.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.6646442,"_id":"62e2720981ae67e33714bc38cb9caca9"},{"title":"Republicans express deep concern over Iraqi PM visit to White House, connections to terrorist orgs","author":"Greg Wehner","published_date":"2024-04-15 20:46:18","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-express-deep-concern-iraqi-pm-visit-white-house-connections-terrorist-orgs","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Republican lawmakers questioned the White House on its decision to host Iraqi Prime Minister Shia Al-Sudani on April 15, after Iraq was connected to Iran's attack on Israel.","summary":"Ahead of Iraqi Prime Minister Shia Al-Sudani's visit to the White House, members of the Republican Party expressed their concerns over the hundreds of billions of dollars sent to the country, and its ties to groups on the list of U.S.-designated terrorist groups in a letter to President Biden.\nThe letter, which was signed by RNC National Security Task Force Chair Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., and Republican Study Committee Chair Kevin Hearn, was sent to Biden on Monday.\n\"As members of the Republican Study Committee, we write to express our deep concern with your decision to host Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani to the White House and your overall Iraqi policy,\" the letter reads. \"Despite hundreds of billions of dollars spent in Iraq over two decades and countless American treasure, Iraq is now solidly in Iran's hands.\"\nThe letter notes that Iraq joined Iran in the attack on Israel on Saturday, adding that Al-Sudani leads a government that funds Iran-backed militias with about $2.7 billion a year.\nThree of the militias were designated by the U.S. as terrorist groups, Wilson and Hearn explained, and those groups have attacked Americans at least 180 times since Hamas-led terrorists invaded Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing three Americans and injuring over 100 others.\n\"The Iraqi federal budget last year also passed massive funding for the Iranian-backed militias' financial arm, the Muhandis General Company, which gives the IRGC and Iraqi militias almost unlimited access to terrorist threat funding and land grants \u2013 the last one of which was half the size of Lebanon, in the exact area from which the same militias launched drones at Saudi Arabia,\" the letter read. \"The [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp's] influence is also now extending to Iraq's judiciary which has spearheaded the campaign against American interests, most notably in the Kurdistan Region.\"\nMembers of the terrorist groups, according to the Republican lawmakers, are members of Iraq's parliament and the Finance Committee, which authorizes funding for the U.S.-designated terrorist groups while also blocking the funding for the Kurdistan Regional Government, which is an ally with the U.S.\nThe letter to Biden claimed Al-Sudani's cabinet supports terrorism and the country's security forces have been infiltrated by IRGC-backed militias, which include members of designated terrorist groups.\nAdditionally, Hearn and Wilson told the president that the U.S. Treasury Department continues to allow U.S. money to go to Iraq's Central Bank, which is ultimately funneled to the terrorist groups and Iranian-backed militias.\nAlso, the minister of oil oversees the second-largest OPEC producer in the world, and the oil that comes out of Iraq is largely controlled by the militias. The oil is then exported by Iran as unsanctioned Iraqi oil, the two told the president.\n\"These are the officials you have determined are worthy to visit the White House. Furthermore, China and Russia have exploited U.S. investments in Iraq, such that China now operates more than 50% of Iraq's oil fields and the Iraqi Oil Ministry now turns to Russian and China for the bulk of its sales and investments,\" the letter reads. \"In essence, the US has effectively overseen China, Russia and Iran dominate Iraq, despite our overwhelming financial and human commitment to Iraq's latest chapter.\"\nTo make matters worse, the added, Iraq, which is supported by Iran, has turned on the Kurds and refuses to allocate the Kurdistan Region its full Constitutional Budget.\nAhead of the meeting, the lawmakers requested answers to several questions, including whether the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury can certify that no U.S. money is transferring to Iraq's Central Bank and being used to fund Iran or its proxies in Iraq.\nWilson and Hearn also asked why the Treasury Department continues to support money transfers to Iraq when the funds are used by U.S.-designated terrorist groups, and how the State Department is addressing the Iraqi government's blockade on U.S. Congress appropriated military equipment to the Kurdistan Region.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on the letter.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Greg Wehner","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2147834413.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.6404614,"_id":"fa1ed89d2a43d9c318b4ac8cbb3c4c1e"},{"title":"Mike Johnson: The wartime Speaker battling on multiple fronts","author":"Chad Pergram","published_date":"2024-04-18 23:50:54","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mike-johnson-wartime-speaker-battling-multiple-fronts","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Republicans again are considering ousting the Speaker of the House of Representatives; will the House GOP successfully remove Mike Johnson from his title?","summary":"\"I regard myself as a wartime Speaker,\" declared House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.\nOnly, we're not sure if Johnson was referring to the internecine war among Republicans over whether he should keep his job.\nMany members wear pocket squares with their suits.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.\n\"The motion (to remove Johnson) will get called. And then he's going to lose more votes than (former House Speaker) Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., And I told him this in private, like two weeks ago,\" said Massie.\nA reporter asked Massie about what that meant, not having a leader \u2013 again \u2013 for the second time in less than a year.\n\"Some would say we'd be rudderless. But we have a rudder. We're steering everything toward (Senate Majority Leader) Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.,\" replied Massie. \"There has not been a change. I mean, if the country likes Chuck Schumer, then they should like what Speaker Johnson's accomplished in the House.\"\nThere's strength in numbers \u2013 even if the numbers are low. After all, it's about the math. It matters even more in a House which is currently split at 218 Republicans to 213 Democrats. That meager Republican majority shrivels to 217-213 after Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wisc., quits. Gallagher was supposed to leave Friday. But Fox is told that the Wisconsin Republican will at least hang around until Saturday as the House tries to approve the international aid supplemental package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan.\nGreene beamed at the support from Massie for her effort to remove Johnson.\n\"It was significant,\" said Greene of Massie's backing. \"It also lets people know this is a lot more serious than people realized.\"\nGreene echoed Massie, suggesting \"there'll be more\" Republicans who might vote to remove Johnson \"than were against Kevin McCarthy.\"\nHere's the problem for Greene. She doesn't have someone who could win a Speaker's vote on the floor. That's why the House burned 22 days on the calendar last October and thrashed through three nominees for Speaker before finally settling on Johnson. If the House approved a \"motion to vacate the chair\" (a \"MTV,\" which removes the Speaker), there's no telling how long it would take the get a successor this time.\n\"I don't think that the threat is really real at this point, just because you don't have an alternative,\" said Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., who was a top lieutenant to McCarthy. \"We saw what happened last fall when this all went down. There's not an alternative.\"\nGraves said a number of conservatives who were mad at Johnson \"don't think past step one. Which is why we have so many problems here right now.\"\nGraves asserted that the \"painful scars\" of the McCarthy debacle would be \"a major disincentive for folks who actually pull the trigger on a motion to vacate.\"\nThere was significant blowback from conservatives after Johnson announced a four-pronged approach to grapple with the Middle East. Especially after the House plotted a course for the week of 17 bills dealing either with Israel or Iran. Johnson tailored his pitch on the foreign aid measure. He planned one bill for Israel. One for Ukraine. One for Taiwan. The final bill would include a plan to repossess Russian assets and grant some of the assistance to Ukraine as a \"lease.\" That's an option endorsed by former President Trump. But the sweetener to the fourth bill would be a measure to curb the use of TikTok in the U.S.\nThe House would then package the four bills together and send them to the Senate.\n\"It's got a chance of passing,\" said Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, Tuesday morning. But if you \"MIRV\" them together and pretend that they were really separate votes, but at the end of the day, it has the effect of being one vote. I mean, that's all smoke and mirrors.\"\nDavidson characterized the TikTok provisions as \"camouflage for defending America.\"\n\"\u2018MIRV' them together?\"\n\"MIRV\" is a Capitol vocabulary term you're going to hear about as the House tries to advance the four separate foreign aid bills - and then blend them into one for efficiency purposes before sending the package to the Senate.\nIt's pronounced \"merve.\" A \"MIRV\" is a vestige of the Cold War and missile counts between the United States and Soviet Union. It stands for \"Multiple Independently-Targetable Re-Entry Vehicle.\" Each MIRV had multiple nuclear warheads or \"MIRVs\" attached. This was an issue of contention between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. Was a MIRV counted as one missile or four or five?\nThe idea is that the House would vote on each individual bill - then blend them together as one for the Senate.\nA parliamentary MIRV!\nHence why conservatives are upset about the plan by Johnson. It's four bills. Or is it one?\nJohnson defended the MIRV maneuver.\n\"I'm concerned that Israel might not pass through the Senate right now if it's not included in the package,\" said Johnson. \"If you separate them, then none of our priorities will be reflected, I'm afraid.\"\nConservatives have also implored Johnson to attach border security to the plan. But that might not be feasible.\n\"We don't have the votes. If you put Ukraine in any package, you can't also do the border because I lose Republican votes on that rule. My friends don't get it,\" replied Johnson.\n\"Are they still your friends?\" asked yours truly.\n\"They're all my friends,\" said Johnson. \"I love everybody in this building.\"\nJohnson made his decision on Monday against taking the streamlined Senate aid bill approved in February and instead traveled his own route. Initial information about the plan was scant.\n\"What are they doing over there?\" asked Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., of your reporter on Monday night as we both exited the Capitol.\nThe \"what\" was the House's approach on an international aid package. But \"over there\" referred to the U.S. House of Representatives, that hostile, untamed, political wilderness which lies beyond the boundaries of the Capitol Rotunda.\nThe Senate isn't exactly a peaceful place. But considering the contretemps in the House, the Senate is practically Xanadu. Especially as Republicans skirmish with one another over foreign aid, leadership and a wartime Speaker.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Chad Pergram","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/marjorie-taylor-greene-thomas-massie-mike-johnson-israel-war.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.6288424,"_id":"99574706792bf8b1e7606d9855b3bdc6"},{"title":"Former Wisconsin Democratic Rep.

Bryan Steil, who is seeking a fourth term. Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District, previously represented by former House Speaker Paul Ryan, leans Republican but was made more competitive under new boundary lines adopted in 2022.\nThe seat is a target for Democrats nationally as they attempt to regain majority control of the House. It is one of only two congressional districts in Wisconsin that are viewed as competitive. The other is western Wisconsin's 3rd Congressional District held by Republican U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden.\nRepublicans hold six of Wisconsin's eight congressional seats.\nBarca, 68, previously held the 1st Congressional District seat from 1993 to 1995. He had previously considered running again for the seat after Ryan stepped down in 2018.\nBarca is the first well-known Democrat to get into the race. National Democrats are expected to back Barca's campaign. The primary is Aug. 13.\nBarca, in a statement announcing his campaign, said his long record of public service showed that he was a fighter for working families and contrasted himself with a \"do-nothing, dysfunctional Congress.\"\n\"We need someone to step up and start going to bat for our families again,\" he said.\nThe Steil campaign said in a statement that Barca has \"put his political career ahead of Wisconsin families\" over the past 40 years. The campaign also faulted Barca for opposing a 2016 bill that would have banned sanctuary cities and for voting in 1993 for a budget bill in Congress that raised the gas tax.\nNational Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Mike Marinella branded Barca as a \"sacrificial lamb\" who has \"put his out of touch policies ahead of Wisconsinites.\"\nSteil was elected in 2018 by 12 percentage points, and won reelection by 19 points in 2020 and 9 points in 2022.\nBarca was elected to serve in the state Assembly from 1985 until 1993 when he resigned after winning a special election to Congress. After he lost in 1995, former President Bill Clinton appointed him to serve as Midwest regional administrator to the U.S. Small Business Administration.\nHe was elected again to the Assembly in 2008 and served as Democratic minority leader from 2011 to 2017.\nBarca was leader of Democrats in 2011 during the fight over collective bargaining rights. While his Democratic colleagues in the Senate fled to Illinois in an attempt to block passage of a bill that effectively ended collective bargaining for public workers, Barca helped organize a filibuster in the Assembly that lasted more than 60 hours.\nBarca stepped down as minority leader, in part over grumbling from fellow Democrats over his support for a $3 billion incentive package for Foxconn, the Taiwanese manufacturing company that had planned to locate a massive facility in his district.\nBarca left the Assembly in 2019 when Gov. Tony Evers tapped him to be secretary of the state Department of Revenue. He resigned last month.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Peter-Barca.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.5821886,"_id":"26a38d754fcabab62ecc4c1a0bdb6618"},{"title":"Democrats join Republicans in condemning antisemitism at Columbia University","author":"Julia Johnson","published_date":"2024-04-22 15:04:21","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-republicans-denounce-antisemitism-columbia-university","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Democrats joined their Republican counterparts in condemning anti-semitic protests at Columbia University as the party grapples with a growing divide over support for Israel.","summary":"A number of Democrats in the Senate have joined their Republican colleagues in denouncing discrimination against Jewish students at the prestigious Ivy League Columbia University, where an anti-Israel solidarity encampment persists on campus, prompting the institution to move classes online on Monday.\n\"Every American has a right to protest,\" Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement. \"But when protests shift to antisemitism, verbal abuse, intimidation, or glorification of Oct. 7 violence against Jewish people, that crosses the line.\"\n\"Campuses must remain safe for all students.\"\nSchumer, who represents New York City, where Columbia is located, is the first Jewish majority leader in the Senate and also the highest ranking Jewish elected official in U.S. history.\nLast week, the anti-Israel demonstration sprang up on Columbia's campus, with students camping out in tents and demanding that the university divest from all companies with ties to Israel. Since then, the protest has grown in size and presented a safety threat to Jewish students. This has mushroomed into such a concern that an Orthodox rabbi at the school advised Jewish students to leave campus because \"Columbia University's Public Safety and the NYPD cannot guarantee Jewish students' safety.\"\nNew York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, another Democrat, also denounced the display of antisemitism at the university, saying she was \"appalled.\"\n\"Threats of violence against Jewish students and the Jewish community are horrible, despicable and wholly unacceptable,\" she said. \"Using the rhetoric of terrorists has no place in New York, where we pride ourselves on tolerance and the right of every group to practice their religion in peace.\"\nOthers who joined their party members in addressing the encampment were Sens. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., and John Fetterman, D-Penn.\n\"I'm outraged by the vile displays of antisemitism at Columbia University, including threats of violence,\" read a post on X, formerly Twitter, from Rosen, who faces a tough re-election battle in November in swing state Nevada.\nFetterman, who has emerged as one of Israel's strongest supporters in his party, compared the demonstration to \"Charlottesville for these Jewish students.\" Fetterman referenced the 2017 \"Unite the Right\" rally in Virginia that drew hundreds of white supremacists and ultimately turned violent, resulting in the death of one woman.\n\"President Minouche Shafik: do your job or resign, so Columbia can find someone who will,\" Fetterman added.\nWhile a number of Democrats have chosen to make public statements on the events unfolding at Columbia, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., blamed the party for allowing it to happen in the first place. \"The radical anti-Israel protestors have always been part of the Democratic Party's base,\" he wrote on X. \"Now Joe Biden is using them as an excuse to undermine Israel and appease Iran.\"\nWhite House spokesperson Andrew Bates said the administration condemns \"echoing the rhetoric of terrorist organizations\" in the \"strongest terms.\"\nRepublicans in the Senate were quick to condemn the encampment at Columbia, and Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., even suggested, \"Any student on a visa that is arrested for supporting Hamas needs to be deported immediately.\"\nMany GOP members in the upper chamber have reinforced their support for Israel and the Jewish people frequently throughout the war between Israel and terrorist group Hamas in Gaza. Democrats have been more measured and careful with their commentary on the war and Israel as the party's divide on the issue expands, making the statements from them regarding Columbia particularly significant.\nPresident Biden and Democrats have faced criticism from their Republican counterparts for pulling back from Israel, a major U.S. ally in the Middle East. Biden recently warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that U.S. policy in support of the country could change depending on the actions it takes to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza.And in the wake of Iran's recent direct attack on Israel, Republicans quickly blamed Biden and other Democrats, accusing them of emboldening Israel's adversary to undertake such an audacious attack.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Julia Johnson","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/schumer-gillibrand-columbia-antisemitism.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.5647135,"_id":"1bac3e92abbed919354ef01e359bd3d3"},{"title":"Vulnerable Dem who demanded 'fair' Trump Senate trial changes tune on Mayorkas impeachment","author":"Emma Colton","published_date":"2024-04-22 16:45:26","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vulnerable-dem-who-demanded-fair-trump-senate-trial-changes-tune-mayorkas-impeachment","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., voted against holding an impeachment trial for DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, but was once vocal about the importance of trying President Trump.","summary":"Longtime Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey voted to kill the impeachment trial of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas last week, but has a long track record of supporting impeachment proceedings when former President Trump was in the hot seat with Democrats.\nThe Senate voted against two articles of impeachment Mayorkas faced last week, including one that charged Mayorkas with \"willful and systemic refusal to comply\" regarding immigration law, and a second article that charged him with a \"breach of trust\" after saying the border was secure. The Senate voted 51-48 and 51-49 against the articles.\nThe votes were largely along party lines, with Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska serving as the only Republican who voted \"present\" when asked about dismissing the first article, and voted against dismissing the second article.\nRepublicans were pushing for a trial of Mayorkas for \"willfully\" refusing to enforce immigration laws, while millions of illegal immigrants have poured across the border into the U.S. since he was sworn in as the Biden administration's secretary of Homeland Security in 2021.\nCasey was among the Democrats who voted to kill the impeachment trial of Mayorkas, but had largely been tight-lipped ahead of the vote. Fox News Digital reported last week ahead of the Senate vote that Casey had not yet revealed his plans, while Politico reported on April 10 that Casey \"did not directly answer a question on whether or not he'd support a motion to dismiss the trial.\"\nHe did tell the outlet at the time that \"the Senate should be spending time passing the bipartisan border deal\" and that he has \"no doubt at all\" that Republicans would use the impeachment trial against him and other vulnerable Senate Democrats ahead of the election.\nSenate Democrats quashing impeachment proceedings against Mayorkas was historically significant, as he is still serving in his role in public office. It marks a first for an impeachment trial to be dismissed, tabled or effectively tossed without the accused official first exiting their role, Fox Digital previously reported.\n\"The Senate has no constitutional authority to rule that the articles approved by the House do not state impeachable offenses,\" Andrew McCarthy, a former chief assistant United States attorney in the Southern District of New York and a senior fellow at the National Review Institute, said last week.\nMcCarthy added that the House has the sole power to determine impeachable offenses, and the Senate deeming the articles of impeachment unconstitutional and killing the potential trial, \"essentially nullifies the House's important role in the impeachment process.\"\nThe Senate voting against carrying through with the trial of Mayorkas comes after Casey repeatedly publicly supported impeachment proceedings against Trump when he was president.\n\"There can be no justice without accountability for those involved in the insurrection against the federal government. As a Nation, we cannot advance our shared democratic values without consequences for those who have betrayed those values. Those who stormed the Capitol should face charges. President Trump should be impeached and removed from office because he betrayed his oath to the Constitution and incited a mob to violence,\" Casey said in 2021, following protesters breaching the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 of that year.\nIn 2020, when Democrats accused Trump of soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 election, Casey said, \"Americans deserve a fair trial\" when touting articles of impeachment against the 45th president.\n\"Soon the Senate will take a critical vote on whether we should hear from relevant witnesses like John Bolton. Americans deserve a fair trial. Anything less is a cover-up,\" he said on X at the time.\nThat same month, he also called for \"answers, under oath, in full view of the American people,\" as part of Trump's first impeachment.\nHe added in 2019 of the Trump impeachment that failing to pursue proceedings against Trump would be \"an insult to our Constitution and to our values.\"\n\"Our Constitution indicates that impeachment is for \u2018treason, bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.' A failure by Congress to pursue impeachment in the face of grave offenses by the President is an insult to our Constitution and to our values.\"\nTrump was ultimately impeached twice, an historical first for a president, and acquitted on all counts by the Senate.\nCasey has served in the Senate since 2007, and is anticipated to have one of the most closely watched elections this year as he gears up for a campaign against anticipated Republican challenger Dave McCormick. Pennsylvania holds its primaries Tuesday, which will solidify the expected race between Casey and McCormick.\nThe Pennsylvania Democrat and fellow vulnerable Senate members have now come under greater focus from the Republican Party following the Mayorkas vote, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) previously telling Fox Digital that their votes against proceeding with the trial will become a focal point of election season.\n\"Joe Biden's wide open border is going to be a top issue for voters headed into November,\" NRSC spokesperson Maggie Abboud told Fox News Digital in a statement last week.\n\"You can bet we are going to highlight Senate Democrats' refusal to hold Joe Biden's DHS Secretary accountable on the campaign trail, in advertising, and in every other way possible,\" she continued.\nFox News Digital reached out to the Casey campaign for comment on the Mayorkas vote and his previous remarks on Trump's impeachment proceedings, but did not immediately receive replies.\n\"Together, Casey, Biden and Mayorkas have enabled drug cartels to flood Pennsylvania communities with deadly drugs like fentanyl,\" Elizabeth Gregory, a spokesperson for McCormick, said last week.\nImmigration has become a top concern for voters ahead of November, alongside other concerns such as inflation, the economy and crime. Nearly 7.3 million migrants entered the U.S. between President Biden taking office and February 2024, a Fox News Digital analysis previously reported. The figure is more than the population of 36 individual states.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Emma Colton","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/trumpsplit.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.5553713,"_id":"a11c73216295ad40a822972f465dcb8d"},{"title":"'Die MAGA die': Dem congressional candidate in hot water for X post after Ukraine vote","author":"Emma Colton","published_date":"2024-04-21 17:02:27","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-congressional-candidate-hot-water-declaring-die-maga-die-ukraine-vote-you-lose","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"New York Democratic congressional candidate Nate McMurray has come under fire for a post saying \"Die MAGA die\" after the House approved a bill to fund Ukraine.","summary":"A New York Democratic congressional candidate celebrated the House passing a $60 billion bill to fund Ukraine while hoping for the death of the MAGA movement, a message posted to X shows.\n\"Slava Ukraine,\" New York congressional candidate Nate McMurray posted to X Saturday afternoon.\n\"Die MAGA die. You lose,\" he added of former President Trump's supporters and those who agree with the \"Make America Great Again\" platform.\nMcMurray's tweet followed the U.S. House passing a bill Saturday that provides $60 billion to Ukraine amid the nation's ongoing war against Russia. The aid package passed 311 to 112, with more Republicans voting against the bill, at 112, than Republicans who voted for it, at 101.\nMcMurray is running to represent New York's 26th Congressional District, which includes parts of Erie and Niagara counties in the western area of the state, after previously serving as the town supervisor of the Town of Grand Island and as an attorney.\nSome conservatives have railed against continuing to fund Ukraine while the U.S. is coping with a border crisis, and some voted against the bill for its failure to include funding to secure the U.S. border.\n\"Today, I voted no... These bills were brought forward under a contrived process to achieve a pre-determined outcome \u2013 a $100 billion, unpaid-for foreign aid package while failing to secure the border,\" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said.\n\"For months, House Republicans \u2013 specifically, Speaker Mike Johnson \u2013 have been unequivocal that we would not send billions in additional aid to Ukraine without securing our own border first. This package represents a complete reversal of a position that previously unified the Republican conference, despite the clear & present danger the southern border represents to U.S. national security.\"\n\"States and cities across our nation are grappling with the consequences of Biden's border crisis, inflation continues to squeeze the budgets of every American household and our country is over $34 trillion in debt,\" Rep. Ben Cline, R-Va, said Saturday. \"As I continue fighting for the people of Virginia's 6th District, I urge my colleagues in Congress and the Biden administration to listen to the American people and put their concerns first.\"\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a Trump supporter, has railed against Speaker Johnson, R-La., for championing the bill's passage, calling him a \"traitor to our country.\" Greene is also leading an effort to oust Johnson as speaker.\n\"Zelensky thanks Speaker Mike Johnson (D-Ukraine) for sending $61 BILLION of your hard-earned tax dollars to fuel a foreign war. Johnson once again passed a bill with the help of Democrats while the majority of the Republican majority voted against it. Not only is Mike Johnson a traitor to our conference, he's a traitor to our country,\" Greene tweeted Saturday.\nMcMurray came under fire on social media for his comment \"Die MAGA die,\" including from those who said it appears he's hoping for the deaths of MAGA movement voters. Others said they reported McMurray to X for inciting violence.\nMcMurray posted a follow-up message Saturday directed at Trump supporters, saying the MAGA movement should \"expire,\" \"fade\" or \"disintegrate.\"\n\"Dear MAGA: Send your regards to MAGA Mike, not me.

Tim Kennedy, who asked a state court last week to remove McMurray's name from the Democratic primary ballot. The state senator's suit claims more than 1,000 signatures collected for McMurray's electoral petition are invalid, either due to circumstances \"constituting fraud\" or were collected by an ineligible canvasser, WBFO reported.\nMcMurray has denied the claims.\nThe 26th District was previously represented by Democrat Brian Higgins, who officially stepped down from the position in February. A special election will be held on April 30 to replace Higgins for the remaining months of his term.

A fourth bill would combine miscellaneous national security priorities, including the House's recently passed bill that could pave the way to a TikTok ban and the REPO Act, a bipartisan measure to liquefy seized Russian assets and send that money to Ukraine.\nA lack of any border security measures, however, has prompted even reliable leadership allies to be wary of letting the bills move forward.\n\"I'm thinking of voting against the rule,\" Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital. \"Unless we vote to send something to the Senate the same day that addresses the border, requires the president to take action on his executive orders. Or we can put something with the underlying legislation that would actually do a couple of things \u2013 we can stop money from going to NGOs that are transporting individuals, we can stop Homeland Security from releasing criminals into the interior.\"\nWhile the four bills are designed to get separate House floor votes, they will first have to pass a procedural hurdle known as a rule vote, a House-wide measure that if passed will allow for debate and eventual votes on the four individual pieces.\nRule votes traditionally fall along party lines, and with Johnson's razor-thin majority, he can only afford to lose two Republicans on any party-line vote \u2013 and it's becoming increasingly likely that he might, meaning Democrats will need to break precedent to help get the bills over the line.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., whose disagreements with Johnson have led her to threaten his leadership role, said on Tuesday morning that she would vote against the rule unless the Democrat-controlled Senate took up the House GOP's comprehensive border security bill known as H.R.2 \u2013 which Democrats have panned as a nonstarter.\n\"NO, I am NOT voting for the rule on Johnson's bundle of funding bills for billions more to Ukraine and other foreign wars.

Nick Langworthy, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital.\nRep. Anthony D'Esposito, R-N.Y., urged his colleagues to remember that they had already passed H.R.2 and have furiously been pushing for Democrats to take it up. He also told Fox News Digital that there were \"conversations\" about including border provisions before the text is released.\n\"I think we're in a critical time that, obviously, our allies need our support more than ever, and I hope that there's a way that we could include more border security into these packages,\" D'Esposito said. \"But I think we need to remind ourselves that we've as House Republicans done our job.

Students across an array of communities have conveyed fears for their safety and we have announced additional actions we are taking to address security concerns.

(AP) \u2014 Pennsylvania House Democrats on Thursday proposed a process to determine if state representatives are \"incapacitated\" and to sanction or expel them, moving in the wake of intense criticism after one of their members voted remotely this week while being sought on charges he violated a restraining order.\nThe resolution introduced by Majority Leader Matt Bradford of Montgomery County would establish a new group consisting of five House leaders to determine if a representative is impaired physically or mentally so that they are not able to perform their duties.\nHis proposed rules change is a response to voting during this week's legislative session by state Rep. Kevin Boyle, a Philadelphia Democrat who faces an arrest warrant on allegations he violated a restraining order. Details about the warrant have not been released, and Boyle has not responded to phone messages seeking comment left Thursday and earlier this week.\nA Philadelphia Police spokeswoman, Officer Tanya Little, said Thursday afternoon Boyle is not in custody.\nBoyle lost his committee chairmanship and Capitol access privileges in February after a videotaped episode at a Montgomery County bar where he was aggressively rude to the staff and appeared intoxicated.\nBoyle's status carries significant implications for the power balance in the 203-member House, currently with a 102\u2014100 Democratic majority and a special election next week for the vacancy, a Republican-leaning district in the Pocono Mountains.\nRepublican leaders have decried Boyle's ability to vote remotely, telling reporters Wednesday that House Democrats should have simply put Boyle on leave and accusing their Democratic counterparts of allowing Boyle to vote remotely to preserve their thin majority.\nMinority Leader Bryan Cutler, a Lancaster County Republican, called Bradford's proposal a complicated answer to a simple problem. He asked Democrats to stop Boyle from voting \"until this issue is finally resolved.\"\n\"Pennsylvania House Democrats continue to use this tragedy to further the tyranny of their majority and that is shameful,\" Cutler said in a statement. The House returns to session April 29.\nA Republican from Fayette County, Rep. Charity Grimm Krupa, announced on Wednesday she was working on a proposal to change House rules to prevent anyone from voting remotely if they are incarcerated or facing an active arrest warrant. And the only Republican in the House from Philadelphia, Rep. Martina White, said her office has been fielding calls from Boyle's constituents because his nearby district office hasn't been responding.\nBoyle, 44, is currently facing a primary opponent as he seeks an eighth term in the House. His brother is U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle, a Democrat from a Philadelphia district.\nKevin Boyle was charged three years ago with harassment and violation of a protection from abuse order after showing up at his wife's house, charges that were subsequently dropped. His attorney at the time described it as a \"domestic issue\" that did not involve allegations of violence. Kevin Boyle later said he was treated at a mental health facility.\nBradford's proposal would allow targeted lawmakers to participate, with a lawyer, in the inquiry that would be done by the speaker, minority and majority leaders, and minority and majority caucus chairpersons. The group would meet in secret and could direct that the lawmaker whose status is in question be examined by doctors or psychologists. It would have subpoena power.\nIf the group would deem a House member to be incapacitated and unable to perform their duties, it would be up to a vote of the full House to decide whether to limit their powers and privileges, suspend them without pay or expel them. If the lawmaker hasn't been expelled and has completed treatment, they could ask to get their powers or status back.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/ALL_CUSTOM_FS_LOCAL_NEWS_PA_GENERAL.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.5036445,"_id":"5752de2cb1213f9a2fc42b5a2312f888"},{"title":"Trump's hush money payment gets underway as jury selection begins","author":"Anders Hagstrom","published_date":"2024-04-15 10:11:46","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/april-15-trump-hush-money-trial-jury-selection","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Former President Donald Trump's trial for alleged hush money payments to Stormy Daniels officially got underway on Monday as jury selection began.

That 6-point difference is just inside the poll's margin of error.\nBiden's movement can be attributed to modest gains among Black voters (76% now vs. 71% in January) and voters under age 35 (49% vs. 43%), as well as a notable shift among the small subgroup of independents. In January, Trump had the advantage by 20 points (51% to 31% Biden), while the two presumptive candidates are tied today (42% each).\nTrump's coalition has held relatively steady, with some of his best groups being White evangelical Christians (83%), White men without a degree (75%), rural voters (67%), and voters ages 65 and over (58%).\n\"Trump stalled at 49% in 2020 and GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker was at 48-49% in 2022,\" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican Daron Shaw. \"If Georgia voters have soured on Democrats even a little bit, the state is a major pickup opportunity for Trump.\"\nIn a hypothetical five-way race, Trump has a 7-point lead over Biden (46% to 39%), with third-party candidates Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (7%), Cornel West (2%), and Jill Stein (1%) in single digits. This is about where the race stood in January.\n\"Georgia may be the weakest state from Biden's 2020 coalition,\" says Shaw. \"On the plus side, if he can rally African Americans and younger voters, he might be able to recreate his 2020 victory. On the minus side, he might have maxed out that vote in 2020 and it's unclear how compelling his message is to these voters in 2024. I'm in the minority on this point, but it seems North Carolina might be a more promising target this time around.\"\nOn specific issues, Georgia continues to favor Trump, as he is seen as better able to handle \u2014 mostly by double-digits \u2014 five out of seven issues.\nNotably, Trump has the advantage on the two issues that have been dominating the campaign: immigration (Trump preferred by 23 points) and the economy (+22). He is also favored on foreign policy (+15) and energy policy (+8).\nOn other issues, neither candidate has a significant advantage: Trump has the edge on abortion (+2), whereas Biden is narrowly ahead on health care (+2) and election integrity (+3).\nForty-four percent of voters feel they are falling behind financially vs. 41% who are holding steady and 15% who are getting ahead. Voters saying they are falling behind go for Trump by 54 points, while those getting ahead/holding steady go for Biden by 31 points.\nVoters view Trump more favorably than Biden and see the former president as more mentally fit for the job than the incumbent.\nBy a 2-point margin, Georgians view Trump favorably (50% favorable vs. 48% unfavorable), a reversal from July 2022 when he was viewed negatively by 11 points (43% vs. 54%). They also see Trump as having the mental soundness to serve effectively as president (54% has mental soundness vs. 44% does not).\nBiden's favorable rating is underwater by 15 points (42% favorable vs. 57% unfavorable), and more say he lacks the mental soundness to serve by 22 points (38% mentally sound vs. 60% not).\nBiden's job approval rating is also upside down: 42% approve vs. 58% disapprove, which is about where it was in January.\nA few more things\u2026\n\u2014 Views on Kennedy are split, with 39% rating him favorably, 39% unfavorably, and 22% unable to rate him. Democrats are more likely to view him negatively (31% favorable, 46% unfavorable), while Republicans are the opposite (45% favorable, 36% unfavorable). Independents are somewhat split (38% favorable, 33% unfavorable).\n\u2014 By a 6-point margin, Georgia voters think the Biden administration is too supportive of the Palestinians (27%) rather than too supportive of the Israelis (21%) in the war in the Middle East. Still, 4 in 10 think Biden's support of each is about right (39%). Democrats are almost 7 times more likely than Republicans to think there's too much support for the Israelis, while Republicans are 4 times more likely to think there's too much support for the Palestinians.\n\u2014 In a hypothetical U.S. House race, Georgians prefer the Republican candidate by 8 points (50% to 42% for the Democrat).\nConducted April 11-16 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,128 Georgia registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (150) and cellphones (699) or completed the survey online after receiving a text message (279).

Today, they prefer Trump by 3 points.\nA new Fox News survey of Michigan registered voters finds President Biden receives 46% support to former President Trump's 49%. That's within the margin of sampling error. In February, it was 45% Biden \u2014 47% Trump. In April 2020, Biden was at 49% to Trump's 41%.\nTrump's advantage is mainly due to a 19-point lead among men. He is also the favorite among White men without a college degree (by 33 points), rural voters (+23), voters under age 35 (+16), and White voters (+13). Plus, he is helped by a 4-point edge among independents as well as garnering a bit more support among Republicans (94%) than Biden gets among Democrats (92%).\nBiden's best groups include Black voters (+56), urban voters (+27), suburban women (+21), and voters ages 65 and over (+14).\nSince February, Trump is up 5 points among men, and while Biden has made similar gains among Black voters (+7), his 75% support among Blacks is about 20 points below where it was when he won Michigan in 2020.\nVoters living in union households go for Biden by 12 points, while the much larger non-union segment backs Trump by 7.\nTrump retains more of his 2020 voters, with 95% still supporting him compared to 90% of Biden's 2020 voters backing him.\nIn a potential 5-way race, Trump is ahead of Biden by 42%-40%, with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. receiving 9%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 2% each. It was announced Thursday that Kennedy will appear on the ballot in Michigan in November.\nBiden won Michigan by less than three percentage points in 2020. Ninety-six percent of Democrats voted for him, but fewer of them today, 83%, approve of the job he is doing.\nThe president's overall job rating stands at 43% approve and 56% disapprove. Some 11% of those disapproving of Biden's job performance still prefer him over Trump in the matchup.\nMichiganders have mixed views of Biden's approach to the Israel and Hamas war in Gaza, with 24% saying he is too supportive of the Israelis, 21% too supportive of the Palestinians, and 40% about right. Democrats (33%) and independents (22%) are more likely than Republicans (15%) to think Biden is too supportive of the Israelis -- and that shows up in the presidential vote preference. More than one-third of those saying Biden is too close to Israel back Trump (35%), the highest of the four battleground states where Fox News conducted surveys this week (Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin).\nJust over half of Michigan voters are either getting ahead financially or holding steady and those voters choose Biden, while just under half are falling behind and they go big for Trump.\nMore voters trust Trump by wide margins on some of the major issues of the campaign \u2014 immigration (+15 points), the economy (+11 points), and foreign policy (+8), while Biden is more narrowly preferred on election integrity (+6), health care (+6), and abortion (+5). The two are trusted about evenly on energy policy (Trump +2).\nBy a 9-point margin, more think Trump (49%) has the mental fitness to serve effectively as president than Biden (40%). Some 22% of Democrats think Biden lacks the metal soundness to serve. That's more than twice the number of Republicans who say the same about Trump (10%).\nMajorities of voters under age 35 disapprove of Biden (63%), think he lacks the mental fitness to serve (68%), trust Trump to handle the economy (61%), and favor Trump in the head-to-head ballot (+16 points).\nOverall, more voters view Biden negatively than positively by 16 points (41% favorable, 57% unfavorable). Trump's personal rating is also in negative territory but by a narrower 8 points (45-53%). Kennedy is underwater by 3 (39-42%), with one in five unable to rate him (19%).\nForty-six percent of voters say they would back the Republican candidate for Congress in their district, while 43% prefer the Democrat. Almost all of those backing the Democratic candidate go for Biden (92%) and most of those favoring the Republican candidate back Trump (93%).\nConducted April 11-16, 2024 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,126 Michigan registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file.

Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., and signed by 16 fellow Republican lawmakers.\nThe group of 17 lawmakers wrote to NCAA President Charlie Baker after the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) announced last week that it was banning transgender athletes from competing in women's sports, though they can still participate in team practices and non-competition activities.\nThe NAIA is a collegiate athletic league made up of smaller and private universities that governs roughly 83,000 student athletes, which is smaller than the over 500,000 student athletes across the NCAA's three divisions.\n\"This policy appropriately recognizes the natural advantages that biological men have in certain athletic competitions. A 2022 study entitled \u2018Transwoman Elite Athletes: Their Extra Percentage Relative to Female Physiology' concluded that 'many anatomical sex differences driven by testosterone are not reversible,'\" the GOP letter said.\n\"Further, this study found that given that \u2018estrogen therapy will not reverse most athletic performance parameters, it follows that transgender women will enter the female division with an inherent advantage because of their prior male physiology.' The NCAA's current transgender policy fails to take these scientific facts into consideration.\"\nThe lawmakers also took issue with recent comments by University of South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley, when she said any student athlete who considers themselves a woman should be able to play on women's NCAA teams.\n\"This statement ignores the biological facts and would harm female athletes throughout NCAA-affiliated schools,\" they wrote. \"It is simply unfair for biological males to be allowed to compete against biological females. On top of that, allowing biological males to participate in women's sports erodes critical Title IX protections for women.\"\n\"As such, we urge the NCAA to reconsider its current policy that allows biological males to deprive women of a fair opportunity to compete and achieve athletic success. All women in NCAA-affiliated schools should not fear having their athletic accomplishments minimized by biological males.\"\nThey cited the 2022 swimming competition where University of Pennsylvania athlete Lia Thomas, who is transgender, beat a biologically female swimmer.\n\"This cannot be allowed to ever happen again.

Another activist displayed an image of Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini while other crowd signs had messages like, \"The Zionist entity has no right to exist.\"\nThe Anti-Defamation League further reported that similar events were held in New York City on Al-Quds Day and, like the Dearborn rally, attracted large crowds and included the use of \"violent\" rhetoric by speakers and attendees.\n\"We urge you to take decisive action to prosecute those calling for \u2018Death to America' and to uphold the principles of justice and freedom that define our nation by defending it,\" the letter to Garland concluded. \"Now is the time to take action to ensure the safety and security of all Americans.\"\nThe DOJ didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBoth the White House and the Biden campaign have condemned Bazzi's comments.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Thomas Catenacci","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Garland_Dearborn-activists.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.3857627,"_id":"a554e3c04b22edd2217072956043d3e1"},{"title":"GOP bill would bring back Trump-era migrant policy nixed by Biden: 'Statement of resolve'","author":"Adam Shaw","published_date":"2024-04-18 22:03:20","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/statement-of-resolve-gop-bill-would-restore-trump-era-migrant-agreements-snuffed-out-by-biden","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"New legislation introduced Thursday would reinstate Trump-era agreements with Central American countries to stop migrants from claiming asylum.","summary":"FIRST ON FOX: Legislation introduced Thursday by Republican lawmakers would move to reinstate agreements with three Central American countries penned by the Trump administration to prevent migrants from coming to the U.S. border that were shut down by the Biden administration.\nThe Northern Triangle Asylum Cooperative Agreement Reimplementation Act, introduced by Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., would aim to re-establish the asylum agreements entered into by the Trump administration with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The bill would withhold aid to those countries until the agreements were resurrected.\nThe agreements allowed the U.S. to send migrants to those countries to claim asylum if they passed through them on the way to the U.S. They also required migrants who cross through those countries to seek protection there instead of at the U.S. border.\nTransfers under the Guatemala agreement had been paused since mid-March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the agreements with El Salvador and Honduras were never implemented. The Biden administration terminated the agreements in 2021.\n\"The Biden administration believes there are more suitable ways to work with our partner governments to manage migration across the region,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at the time. \"The United States will build on our strong relationships and support these governments' efforts to address forced displacement without placing undue burden on them, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\nBut Republicans have blamed the rollback of Trump-era policies by the Biden administration for the ongoing crisis at the southern border, which is now into its fourth year and has seen record numbers of migrant encounters.\nMace's bill, co-sponsored by Reps. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., and Lance Gooden, R-Texas, would condition assistance to the countries, require certifications for the agreements and demand regular recertifications every six months.\n\"The 'Northern Triangle Asylum Cooperative Agreement Reimplementation Act' is a statement of resolve to secure our borders and uphold the integrity of our asylum system and remedy one of the many failed border policies brought by this administration,\" Mace said in a statement.\n\"If a country is not willing to help us protect our sovereignty, American taxpayers should not be funding their prosperity,\" Rosendale said. \"When the ACAs were originally written as immigration-restricting measures, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras agreed to assist us in managing our border crisis. Now that Biden has shredded these agreements, the aid promised should not continue to be delivered.\"\nIt comes amid an ongoing face-off between Republicans and the administration over how to handle the crisis.

A fourth House GOP aide also confirmed they will discuss Iran's attack.\nHouse lawmakers on both sides of the aisle normally meet with their respective parties the morning after they begin their weekly legislative session, giving them time to arrive back in Washington from around the country.\nBut the tense state of international affairs prompted Johnson to call House Republicans together for 5:30 p.m. on Monday.\nIran launched a barrage of missiles toward Israel over the weekend, the vast majority of which were intercepted.\nLeaders in the White House and Senate used the attack to put renewed pressure on Johnson to pass the Senate's $95 billion supplemental funding bill with aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Johnson has passed two standalone Israel aid bills so far, neither of which was taken up by the Democrat-controlled Senate.\nBut Ukraine is a politically fraught issue for Johnson as he navigates a razor-thin two-seat House majority, and a growing number of Ukraine aid skeptics in his conference.\nOne of those skeptics is Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who has previously suggested ousting Johnson from power if he put that funding package on the House floor.\nOne of the three senior House GOP aides who spoke with Fox News Digital said Johnson received pushback from members over the weekend regarding the idea of combining funding for Ukraine and Israel this week.\nNevertheless, Johnson has been circulating ideas on Ukraine aid that have gotten bipartisan support, including a lend-lease option that former President Trump, the de facto leader of the Republican Party, signaled he could support.\n\"We're looking at it right now, and they're talking about it, and we're thinking about making it in the form of a loan instead of just a gift,\" Trump said of Ukraine aid during a press conference with Johnson at Mar-a-Lago on Friday. His support would be a powerful insulator for Johnson against Ukraine critics, the vast majority of whom support the ex-president.\nThe other proposal is a bipartisan measure that would liquidate seized Russian assets and then use those funds as aid to Ukraine. It's being called the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity (REPO) for Ukrainians Act.\nTiming on a possible vote this week is not immediately clear. Two of the four House GOP aides who spoke with Fox News Digital said they expect at least Israel funding to get a vote this week. One of those two anticipated a vote on some kind of Israel and Ukraine combined package that would be different from the Senate's $95 billion bill.\nThe House Majority Whip's office did not list any Israel or Ukraine funding bills on its expected schedule on Monday morning, but advised lawmakers that \"additional legislative items related to security supplemental appropriations are possible.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to Johnson's office for comment.\nSpeaking on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" this past weekend, Johnson suggested he wants the House to take up Israel aid this week for a third time.\n\"The details of that package are being put together right now,\" he said. \"We're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues.\"\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner, R-Ohio, meanwhile, told NBC's \"Meet The Press\" that Johnson \"made it clear\" that he wants a House vote this week on some kind of aid funding for Israel and Ukraine.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Elizabeth Elkind","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/mike-johnson-funding.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.357278,"_id":"7ac9d9364fb5900e10820b63deb33b7c"},{"title":"Louisiana Democratic Party selects new chairman","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-15 21:55:58","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/louisiana-democratic-party-selects-new-chairman","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Randal Gaines, a 68-year-old former Louisiana state representative, was selected Saturday as the next head of the deep-red Pelican State's Democratic Party.","summary":"The Louisiana Democratic Party has new leadership.\nRandal Gaines, a former state representative, was selected Saturday as the political group's new chair after a set of procedural moves ended with him being the only candidate nominated for the position.

A fourth bill includes national security priorities like the House's recently passed crackdown on TikTok's ownership as well as the REPO Act, which would liquidate seized Russian assets and give that funding to Ukraine.\nDemocrats had to help bail the GOP-led proposals on Thursday night in the face of conservative opposition. The Rules Committee, the final barrier before legislation traditionally gets a House-wide vote, spent all day considering the bills before advancing their \"rules\" package in a 9-3 vote.\nIt's highly unusual for Democrats, or any opposition party, to cross the aisle on a Rules Committee vote as well as a House-wide rule vote. But it underscores the urgency that lawmakers on both sides feel about sending aid to foreign allies.\nThe three conservatives on the panel \u2014 Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. \u2014 all voted against the measure; an equally unusual move that's become common in the 118th Congress, where members of the House Freedom Caucus and their allies have wielded outsized influence in Republicans' thin majority by blocking procedural hurdles such as this.Democrats' support will be critical for the rule vote and potentially even final passage of the bills.\nJohnson has faced furious pushback from the right flank of his conference over most of his plan, particularly loaning $60 billion to Ukraine, which has become a politically fraught topic for much of the GOP.\nThose same foreign aid hawks have objected to some of the Israel funding being aimed at humanitarian aid in Gaza, though its inclusion was critical to winning Democratic support. In a victory for Republicans, however, it prevents any of the Israel-Gaza funding from going toward the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), a Palestinian refugee agency alleged to have ties to Hamas.\nConservative rebels also decried House GOP leaders' decision to combine the four bills into one before sending it to the Senate, arguing it amounted to the same $95 billion foreign aid package the Democrat-majority chamber passed earlier this year and which House Republicans oppose. Johnson has argued that packaging them together for the Senate would prevent them from neglecting the Israel bill at a time when the issue has divided the Democratic Party.\nEarlier this week Massie threatened he'd move to oust Johnson from the speakership if he did not step aside after having the House vote on his foreign aid plans. One GOP lawmaker who was present at the closed-door meeting where it happened told Fox News Digital on Tuesday that Johnson challenged him to do so.\nMassie is now signed onto Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to vacate resolution, which if deemed \"privileged\" by Greene would force the House to begin voting on Johnson's potential ouster within two legislative days.\nSome discussion over whether to raise the threshold needed to call a motion to vacate \u2014 currently just one member can call for it \u2014 ended with Johnson backing off of the controversial move after it enraged GOP rebels and spurred new ouster threats.\nMajority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., suggested to reporters earlier that a wide swath of rank-and-file Republicans supported the idea; but Johnson denied having such conversations earlier on Thursday when asked by Fox News Digital.\n\"Recently, many members have encouraged me to endorse a new rule to raise this threshold. While I understand the importance of that idea, any rule change requires a majority of the full House, which we do not have.

The whole hearing is about that.\"\n\"What I found interesting is the leadership's response to that. And you saw Representative Stefanik really follow up with that,\" Rep. Brandon Williams, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital of the exchange. \"They are in deep denial that they cover with these clever phrases \u2026 just because everything inside the protest was antisemitic, well, it wasn't an antisemitic protest because it wasn't labeled as such. Now that's absurd. You know, I think a third grader would be able to discern, you know, the deception. But, but evidently that's hard for, you know, the professors and the leadership at Columbia.\"\nAs the hearing was underway, protesters could be heard yelling outside demanding entry to the Capitol proceeding. Back at Columbia University's campus in New York City, hundreds of anti-Israel agitators staged an \"occupation\" protest calling for the Ivy League school to \"divest\" from Israel. Video captured demonstrators lighting flares after nightfall, and the New York City Police Department arrested at least four people Thursday morning when crowds defied the school's order to cease the \"encampment,\" which included tents set up on a campus lawn.\n\"I think it's very important that the Jewish students know that this committee has their back, that we will continue to fight with them against antisemitism,\" Foxx told Fox News Digital. \"And that's my commitment to them. I think they understand that commitment. They've seen the other hearings that we've had. They've heard the things that we've said. And I think it's important that they know they're not alone on that campus, that we are going to be with them, whether we're there physically with them, we're there, mentally, psychologically and morally with them.\"\nFoxx and other House Republicans hosted a group of Jewish students at the Capitol, offering them the opportunity to speak at a press conference before hearing kicked off Wednesday morning.\nOne of those students, Eden Yadegar, the daughter of Iranian immigrants, described recent instances of antisemitism on campus, including how a tenured Columbia professor allegedly told students that Jews who regularly attend temple are \"indoctrinated,\" a Jewish student having a Star of David necklace ripped from her neck, and on several occasions Jewish students being accosted by other students at the law school or in the kosher section of the dining hall yelling, \"F--- the Jews.\"\nShe said Jewish students have grown fearful of reporting instances of discrimination and harassment because \"of how little faith they have that the university will take the necessary steps to protect them,\" arguing the \"university's action has left Jewish students abandoned\" after months of silence from the school leadership.\nAnother student who spoke at the press conference, Yola Ashkenazi, described how Columbia has recognized clubs that say things like, \"Zionists not invited,\" and, \"the Holocaust wasn't that special.\" She cited how swastikas have been drawn in campus buildings and said, \"Columbia permits hate rallies on our campus that call for violence and eradication of the Jewish state\" and call for \"intifada revolution.\"\nAshkenazi described how on Feb. 2, when one of her friends was physically held outside the wall of the campus fitness center by demonstrators, Columbia public safety officers told him afterward to \"not wear anything identifying him as Jewish when tensions are high.\"\nSpeaking with Fox News Digital ahead of the hearing, Yadegar said she was not surprised by the anti-Israel demonstrations happening again back on campus.\n\"I think that we've gotten to a point where these student demonstrators feel that anything is fair game because they have not been disciplined adequately, and so I'm hoping that this hearing will shift us away from that direction,\" Yadegar said outside the committee room.\n\"We've been isolated on campus in certain organizations, in the classroom. It's been incredibly difficult, but the Jewish people are incredibly resilient, and as Americans, as Jews, it's our duty to continue to participate in these spaces that we've worked so hard to get to,\" she said. \"I do have a little bit of faith left in their leadership, and I do hope that they will follow through. They claim that antisemitism is abhorrent and that it has no space in our university, and our campus. The action over the past five months doesn't coincide with that rhetoric, however the actions taken over the past couple of weeks are edging in that direction.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Danielle Wallace","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Ilhan-omar-columbia-university.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.2948294,"_id":"64d029b3ccb7b0d67eb65fd0a1dc1d88"},{"title":"Trump says Biden 'should be in jail' and 'on trial,' while blasting NY case: 'The whole world is watching'","author":"Brooke Singman","published_date":"2024-04-18 21:25:57","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-biden-should-be-in-jail-on-trial-while-blasting-ny-case-whole-world-is-watching","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Former President Trump declared it is President Joe Biden who 'should be in jail\" and 'be on trial,\" while blasting the case against him and saying 'the whole world is watching this New York scandal,\"\u2026","summary":"Former President Trump declared it is President Joe Biden who \"should be in jail\" and \"be on trial,\" while blasting the case against him and saying \"the whole world is watching this New York scandal,\" as he left court after the third day of his historic and unprecedented criminal trial.\nThe former president, shortly after a full jury was selected to hear arguments from his defense attorneys and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg as he seeks to make his case, stood in the hallway of the courthouse and addressed the press.\nTrump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, held a thick stack of news articles from a range of different news outlets and media organizations.\nTrump said \"every one of them\" knows the case is \"very unfair\" and a \"very bad thing.\"\n\"The whole world is watching this New York scandal,\" he said, calling it a \"spectacle.\"\n\"It is political and it is a shame\u2014it is a shame,\" he said. \"And I am sitting here for days now from morning until night in that freezing room\u2014everybody was freezing in there\u2014and all for this.\"\nThe former president blasted Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg as \"out of control\" and said Judge Juan Merchan who is presiding over the case is \"highly conflicted.\"\n\"The whole thing is a mess,\" he said.\n\"Joe Biden\u2014he's the one that should be in jail,\" Trump said. \"He's a crook.

Just one House Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., voted against the bill. Fox News Digital reached out to Massie for comment.\nHe was joined by 13 Democrats, including \"Squad\" member Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.; Cori Bush, D-Mo.; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y.; and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was also among those opposing the bill.\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., the No. 3 House GOP leader, tore into the Democrats who voted against condemning Iran in a statement to Fox News Digital after the vote.\n\"House Democrats' hatred for Israel runs so deep they would rather defend terrorists than support our strongest ally in the Middle East. Vote after vote, the Democrat Party continues to cement their position as the pro-terrorist party,\" Emmer said.\nIran fired a barrage of rockets at Israel over the weekend, 99% of which were intercepted, in retaliation for an Israeli attack on an Iranian diplomatic facility in Syria. It's a marked escalation of tensions in the region as the first attack on Israel directly from Iranian soil.\nThe 13 progressives who voted against the measure are among a growing faction of the Democratic Party who are critical of the U.S.'s strong ties to Israel, particularly in the wake of Israel's invasion of Gaza.\nIsrael's war on Hamas began after militants from the pro-Palestinian terror group invaded southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 and killed more than 1,000 people. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians, has said over 30,000 Palestinians have died in the months since.\nHouse Republicans have seized on the Democratic divides over Israel, distancing themselves from that fight by standing firm with the longstanding relationship. In response to the Iran attack, House GOP leadership lined up 17 bills for a vote this week affirming U.S. support for Israel and against Iran.\nOcasio-Cortez criticized that effort earlier this week in a statement, \"Following last weekend's unprecedented response by Iran to Israel's attack on its consulate, the Republican Majority is explicitly leveraging a series of bills to further escalate tensions in the Middle East.\"\n\"This is a blatant attempt to distract from their own incompetence. The country and the world need real leadership from the House of Representatives in this moment, not resolutions designed purposefully to increase the likelihood of a deadly regional war or worse. I will oppose any cynical effort to further inflame tensions, destroy a path to peace in the region, and further divide the American people,\" she said.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Elizabeth Elkind","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/10/Squad.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.2826095,"_id":"0fb20e6d7709a1ed38ae44b730ddbf31"},{"title":"Rep.

Advertising throughout the new campaign will be done through a mixture of independent expenditures and coordinated campaign buys.\nIn a statement provided to Fox News Digital, Christie Roberts, DSCC executive director said, \"Senate Republicans' roster of unvetted, unpopular candidates bring disqualifying personal flaws and toxic policy positions to their races \u2013 when general election voters learn about them, they'll see why they should be nowhere near the U.S. Senate.\"\n\"This advertising campaign will make the choice in each Senate race clear, enables the DSCC to communicate with voters in the most effective way and ensures we protect Democrats' Senate majority,\" she continued.\nInitial ad reservations in the DSCC's new campaign will be made in key electoral battlegrounds, including Arizona, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Reservations will also be made in Texas and Florida as Democrats look to flip the seats of Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rick Scott, R-Fla. Each of the planned buys is expected to be for multimillion-dollar sums.\nIn Michigan, Democrats face concerns in November amid Israel's war in Gaza, which has prompted criticism from the state's significant Muslim and Arab populations. The DSCC had made an initial reservation of more than $11 million in TV ads in the state, as outgoing Sen. Debbie Stabenow's retiring deprives the Democrats of any incumbency advantage.\nA $10 million television reservation was similarly announced for Wisconsin, where Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin is expected to brave a significant challenge in the swing state.\nAn additional $8 million reservation was made for television ads in Pennsylvania, as Republicans work to unseat incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in another key battleground that could decide the presidential election.\nTogether with the Majority Leader Chuck Schumer-aligned Senate Majority PAC's previously announced $239 million in ad reservations to protect vulnerable Senate Democrats, total ad reservations boosting Democratic candidates now tops $300 million.\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director Mike Berg said, \"It's going to be very expensive for Democrats to try to convince voters that they didn't open our border, unleash 40-year high inflation, and cause a crime epidemic in our country.\"\nEach of the Senate races considered competitive in November are for seats that are currently held by lawmakers who caucus with Democrats, putting the party at a significant disadvantage.

For this, Democrats will \"take a political hit,\" he continued.\nHowever, McCarthy described that Senate Democrats made a political calculation, ultimately determining that \"it would be better to be criticized for not conducting a trial than to hold a trial,\" placing President Biden's border policies at the forefront and Democratic senators on record acquitting Mayorkas.\nThis, he said, would look like the Democrats \"endorsing Biden's non-enforcement policies.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Julia Johnson","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/schumer-mayorkas-impeachment-constitutional.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.194126,"_id":"f01c03c36da3b3febfcda022209a5a4b"},{"title":"Biden dismantles Trump-era Title IX rules, sidesteps issue of trans athletes in girls' sports","author":"Michael Dorgan","published_date":"2024-04-19 12:25:14","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-dismantles-trump-era-title-ix-rules-sidesteps-issue-trans-athletes-girls-sports","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The new provisions are part of a revised Title IX regulation issued by the Education Department, fulfilling a campaign pledge by President Biden","summary":"The Biden administration has unveiled new rules to safeguard LGBTQ+ students and change the ways in which sexual harassment and assault claims are adjudicated on campus.\nThe new provisions are part of a revised Title IX regulation issued by the Education Department, fulfilling a campaign pledge by President Biden to revamp those issued during the Trump administration.\nMissing from the new rule, however, is a policy forbidding schools from enacting outright bans on transgender athletes competing against biological females.\nThe Biden administration was widely expected to bring in such a policy but has instead put the provision on hold.

The House erupted in cheers as the gavel came down.\nHouse lawmakers are in session on a rare Saturday working to pass Johnson's foreign aid plan, which also includes aid bills for Israel and the Indo-Pacific, as well as a bill with other national security measures.\nThe close margins within the GOP alone show what a divisive topic Ukraine funding has become for the right.\nA growing number of fiscal conservatives have been skeptical about the U.S.'s continued financial involvement with Ukraine, while others have raised questions about corruption within Kyiv's government.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's proposal to strip all funding related to Ukraine from the Ukraine funding bill predictably failed Saturday in a 71 to 351 vote.\nMore traditional Republicans and national security hawks warn that Ukraine's victory is critical to preventing a wider conflict between NATO and Russia, warning that its President Vladimir Putin is rapidly forming a second \"axis of evil\" with Iran and China.\nJohnson, who like his conservative colleagues was skeptical of Ukraine aid before becoming speaker, gave a sober warning earlier this week. \"I really do believe the intel and the briefings that we've gotten that I believe [Chinese President Xi Jinpimg] and Vladimir Putin and Iran really are an axis of evil. And I think they're in coordination on this. I think that Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed. I think he might go to the Balkans next. I think he might have a showdown with Poland or one of our NATO allies,\" he told reporters. \"To put it bluntly, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,\" he said.\nBut his support for foreign aid, particularly Ukraine, is also threatening to cut short his tenure as House speaker.

Mike Parson. If signed, it would offer up to $6,375 per child for expenses including tuition, textbooks, tutoring, transportation, extracurriculars and summer school.\nThe bill's passage is a victory for advocates who have struggled for years to expand access to charter schools, virtual schools and private schools in Missouri. Worries about taking away resources from traditional kindergarten-12th grade public schools have been bipartisan.\nThe heart of the legislation is the expansion of Missouri Empowerment Scholarships Accounts, which low-income families can draw from. The money will come from private donors, who in return get tax credits.\n\"This is a victory for parents who want more control over their children's education and for students who will now have more avenues to achieve their full potential,\" Republican Rep. Phil Christofanelli said in a statement.\nThe current scholarship program limits recipients to residents of the state's largest cities and to families who make less than 200% of the federal poverty level, which works out to $62,400 a year for a family of four.\nThe bill passed Thursday would raise the cap to 300%, or $93,600 for a family of four. Public school students who need extra help through individualized education plans would get some additional scholarship money under the new law.\nThe legislation increases the cap on tax credits for the private donations from $50 million to $75 million per year, to help pay for a possible influx of students.\nTo gain support from lawmakers focused on helping traditional public schools, senators included money to raise minimum teacher salaries to $40,000 a year and adjusted the state's formula for funding public schools, a change expected to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars more to public education over time.\nSeveral House Democrats cautioned that the state might not have enough revenue in future years to provide the massive influx in funding to public schools that the bill commits to.\n\"While the voucher expansion is essentially guaranteed, the promises to public schools depend on additional funding the state isn't expected to have and future lawmakers aren't required to provide,\" House Democratic Minority Leader Crystal Quade said in a statement.\nAnother provision would allow charter schools in Boone County, where Senate President Pro Tem Caleb Rowden lives. The bill also would require public votes to approve a school district's switch to four-day school weeks and incentivize schools that maintain five-day weeks.\nThis issue supporters call \"school choice\" has divided lawmakers beyond typical Republican-Democrat lines in Missouri.\nGOP legislators from rural districts have opposed allowing charter schools in their areas for years, fearing they could draw students away from traditional public schools seen as the backbone of their communities. Some Democrats, meanwhile, want students in underperforming urban schools to have more options.\nAnd some conservatives lobbied against more regulations for homeschoolers and private schools.

Democrats hope to flip the seat in November.","summary":"Alabama voters decided primary runoffs on Tuesday for the state's newly redrawn 2nd Congressional District, setting up a potentially historic November race that could play a part in the battle for control of the U.S. House of Representatives.\nShomari Figures, a former top aide to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, defeated state House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels to win the Democratic nomination. Attorney and political newcomer Caroleene Dobson defeated former state Sen. Dick Brewbaker to win the Republican nomination. Dobson and Figures will face off in November in the closely watched general election.\nDemocrats are aiming to flip the seat after the district was redrawn by a federal court to boost the voting power of Black residents. If Figures is elected, it will be the first time in history that Alabama, which is about 27% Black, has two Black members in its congressional delegation.\n\"I'm enormously grateful for the confidence and the trust and the faith that the voters of this newly drawn district have placed in me to represent the Democratic Party in November,\" Figures said as he addressed supporters Tuesday night. \"That is something that I do not take lightly.\"\nFigures, an attorney, also served as an aide to former President Barack Obama, serving as domestic director of the Presidential Personnel Office. He is the son of two prominent Alabama legislators: longtime state Sen. Vivian Davis Figures and the late Senate President Pro Tem Michael Figures. He moved home to Mobile from Washington D.C. to run for the congressional seat.\nThe non-partisan Cook Political Report rated the district as \"likely Democrat,\" meaning that it favors the Democratic candidate in November but isn't considered a sure thing. Republicans believe they will be competitive in November and have a chance to keep the seat under GOP control.\nDobson, a real estate attorney and member of the Alabama Forestry Commission, harnessed support in rural areas to defeat Brewbaker, who had led in the March 5 primary. Dobson was raised in Monroe County and lived and practiced law in Texas before returning to Alabama and joining the Maynard Nexsen law firm in 2019.\n\"Thank you to each and every Republican voter in the Second District of Alabama. I am humbled by your outpouring of support and eagerness to join us in fighting for Alabama families,\" Dobson said in a written statement. \"Because you believed in me and in my vision for our district, we are one step closer to saving our country.\"\nThe new district came after a lengthy court battle in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Black Alabamians who had challenged the state's existing congressional districts.\nFederal judges approved new district lines in October after ruling that Alabama's previous map \u2014 which had only one majority-Black district out of seven \u2014 was racially gerrymandered to limit the influence of the state's Black voters. The three-judge panel said Alabama should have a second district where Black voters make up a substantial portion of the voting age population and have a reasonable opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice.\n\"Following tonight's runoff election, Alabama voters now stand on the cusp of making history in November, when Black Alabamians could \u2014 for the first time \u2014 elect two members of Congress who truly reflect their political desires,\" former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, chairman of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said.\nThe new district spans the width of the state and includes Montgomery, parts of Mobile and rural counties in the state's Black Belt.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Election-2024-Decision-Notes-Alabama.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.116435,"_id":"39e76e63240568b7d81c816df9e2167c"},{"title":"The rot runs deep at NPR.

Why should American taxpayers, who lean conservative, support the organization with their money?","summary":"Imagine if the Federal Highway Administration spent just 11% of its congressional funding on roads in red states and 67% of its funding on roads in blue states. Would that last long?\nOf course, not--Republicans and moderates in Congress would put an end to it immediately. It would be clearly unfair to taxpayers and a dysfunctional way to operate a federally funded highway system.\nBut that's how things work at the nation's largest public radio news organization, and that's why I am introducing the Defund NPR Act.\nNational Public Radio (NPR) has 87 registered Democrats and zero registered Republicans working in its Washington, D.C.. newsroom, and they've been preaching to the choir. Over two-thirds of NPR listeners are liberals and barely more than one out of every ten leans conservative.\nBut the U.S. taxpayers -- who are sending NPR nearly $100 million dollars a year in federal funding\u2014i.e. the American people\u2014lean conservative.\nWhy should they pay for a radio station that they don't like to listen to? Their money doesn't go to a conservative alternative to NPR, which is fine, but we shouldn't make an exception for far-left radio.\nOf course, the problem isn't just that NPR doesn't appeal to conservative Americans\u2014it's far worse than that. The heart of the issue is that NPR despises Republicans and their values.\nJust listen to their new CEO, Katherine Maher, who said that the \"the number one challenge here [to censoring Americans] that we see is, of course, the First Amendment in the United States.\"\nMaher believes that \"our reverence for the truth might be a distraction that's getting in the way of finding common ground and getting things done.\" Maher, who is expected to take in about $600,000 a year from American taxpayers, is openly contemptuous of our Constitution and objective journalism, and advocates for suppressing speech she disagrees with. Of course, according to Maher, \"Donald Trump is a racist.\" I'm sure she feels the same way about his supporters.\nUnfortunately, the rot runs deep at NPR and there's no easy fix. Firing Maher won't save the station, though it's still the right thing to do.\nNPR has a massive DEI staff that ensures that everything the outlet publishes is sufficiently woke. According to Uri Berliner, a 25-year NPR veteran who recently resigned, these partisan administrators monitor reporters' interviewees, run \"unconscious bias\" training sessions, and host employee affinity groups, including a \"Marginalized Genders and Intersex People of Color mentorship program\" and a group for \"Women, Gender-Expansive, and Transgender People in Technology Throughout Public Media.\"\nNPR has been a liberal propaganda machine for years.\nThe last and final time I went on NPR was during the first hoax impeachment of President Trump in 2019. I pointed out that Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who was leading the impeachment hoax, had lied about his relationship with the supposed Ukraine \"whistleblower,\" a man we now know to be Eric Ciaramella. The New York Times published a report confirming my statement the same day as my interview. But NPR still published a ridiculous \"correction\" accusing me of \"misinformation\" and apologizing to their listeners for airing the interview. Of course, NPR invited Schiff on to spread lies about the Russia hoax 25 times.\nThe fact is that NPR is just as biased, if not more biased, than left-wing outlets like CNN or MSNBC. Activists at NPR like Katherine Maher aren't hiding it anymore: Their mission is to boost Democrat politicians and indoctrinate the American public.\nCongress shouldn't give NPR another dime.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Rep.

Wouldn't it benefit the county then?\"\nThe Uplift Harris program passed by a vote of 4-1 in Harris County Commissioners Court last year. Uplift Harris is a guaranteed income pilot that would allow participating households to receive $500 per month for 18 months. The program began on January 12, 2024, and is available to 1,924 applicants.\nPaxton's lawsuit sought an \"immediate ruling to block Uplift Harris from beginning to make payments under the program.\"\nHarris County Attorney Christian Menefee who is the defendant in the case, said that he expects Paxton to appeal directly to the Texas Supreme Court.\n\"Given what we've seen from that court and Republican politics, I am skeptical that we will get a fair shake. But I plan to do everything I can to protect this program,\" Menefee said in a statement.\n\"Today's decision is a big win for Harris County residents. Families in Harris County are being attacked by Republican state officials. Plain and simple. It's shameful. Thankfully, today a court backed Harris County and refused to block Uplift Harris,\" Menefee said.\n\"Helping families in need is a proper use of government funds. Giving people the tools they need to lift themselves out of poverty is both morally sound and good public policy. It's ridiculous that politicians in Austin would be traveling to Harris County just to block us from helping people,\" he added.\nThe program received over 59,000 applications, a local FOX affiliate reported in January. The applicants were selected \"randomly\" through a lottery process, according to the county website.\nCounty officials will fund the program with the $20.5 million received through the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, which was intended to be used for COVID-19 relief initiatives.\nBut those who receive the funds will receive them with \"no strings attached,\" according to Paxton.\n\"This scheme is plainly unconstitutional,\" Paxton said in a press release. \"Taxpayer money must be spent lawfully and used to advance the public interest, not merely redistributed with no accountability or reasonable expectation of a general benefit. I am suing to stop officials in Harris County from abusing public funds for political gain.\"\nFox News Digital previously interviewed Republican State Sen.

Tim Walberg, R-Mich., condemned what he called the \"perverse\" statements by a tenured Columbia professor, Joseph Massad, who is listed as the chair of the School of Arts and Sciences Academic Review Committee.\nIn the aftermath of Oct. 7, Massad penned an article praising \"the innovative Palestinian Resistance\" and Hamas militants for attacking Israel and glorifying Hamas's slaughter of nearly 1200 Jews. He described the terror attack on southern Israel as \"awesome,\" \"astonishing,\" \"astounding,\" and \"incredible.\"\n\"Professor Massad has also been known to have called Israelis, quote, \u2018cruel and bloodthirsty colonizers,' end quote.

Can you imagine free speech diversity on campus?\"\nWalberg blasted how, as chair of the School of Arts and Sciences Academic Review Committee, Massad oversees the periodic review of all departments, centers and institutes and in the school. The congressman asked Shafik if Massad had faced any consequences for his words.\n\"He has been spoken to,\" Shafik replied.\nWhen pressed about whether Massad had faced any further consequences, Shafik said he had been removed as chair of the committee. Later on, House Republican Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., stated that Massad was still listed as chair on the school's website. Shafik said she would have to confirm whether he was still serving in that role. Stefanik pressed Shafik on whether she would remove him from that role if he was indeed still in that position, and she ultimately said, \"Yes.\"\nWalberg noted that Massad is a tenured professor, and asked Columbia Board of Trustees co-chairs Claire Shipman and David Greenwald if they would approve tenure for him if they could make that decision today. Both said they would not.\nStefanik also pressed Shafik on another professor, Dr. Mohamed Abdou, a visiting professor in Modern Arab Studies. According to the congresswoman, Abdou was hired after the Oct. 7 terrorist attack in Israel, and on Oct. 11, posted \"Yes, I'm with Hamas and Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad.\" Stefanik said the professor also \"decried false reports accusing Arabs and Muslims of decapitating the head, decapitating the heads of children and being rapists.\"\n\"We know that there were decapitations of babies, of innocent Israeli citizens, of seniors of women. There were rapes. And yet Columbia hired this individual as a professor. How did that hiring process work? Were you aware of those statements before the hiring?\" Stefanik demanded to know.\nUnder pressure, Shafik confirmed that Abdou will not be returning after this semester, and he \"will never work at Columbia again.\"\nThe House GOP chair questioned the presidents of Harvard, UPenn and MIT in December on whether calls for the genocide of Jews violated rules against bullying and harassment of their schools' codes of conduct. Unlike the presidents of those three universities, the Columbia president and board of trustee co-chairs all answered definitively \"Yes\" when asked the same question by Democratic Rep.

However, Grenell said that \"means absolutely nothing in terms of special treatment.\"\n\"It simply means that the American dream is alive and well \u2014 if you work hard and have a little bit of luck and God's grace, you can do anything you want in America regardless of your skin color, socio-economic situation, or sexual orientation,\" Grenell told Fox News Digital. \"We want what every American wants, to be treated equally not differently.\"\nGrenell told Fox News Digital that the Republican Party has grown \"increasingly welcoming of gay conservatives over the last 20 years.\"\n\"But we made the most progress when Donald Trump and Melania Trump moved into the White House,\" Grenell told Fox News Digital.\nGrenell said that, \"Gays and lesbians are no longer reflexively leftist.\"\n\"They realize they have incredible liberties in America and that they are not opposed,\" he explained, noting there are more than 80 Log Cabin chapters across the country that have seen an \"explosion of membership.\"\n\"The gay left continues to try and convince America's gays and lesbians that they don't have personal freedoms \u2014 it's absurd,\" Grenell said.\nHe added, \"Gays and lesbians around the world are literally dying to come to America. We live in the greatest country in the world and Log Cabin members are proud to say it.\"\nGrenell told Fox News Digital that the 2024 election is \"about the elites in D.C. versus the rest of America.\" He told Fox News Digital that the media and Democrats are \"shamelessly defining support for trans kids as a litmus test for supporting gay rights, and it infuriates gay conservatives.\"\nAs for unity, Grenell said it is Democrats and far-left activists who are to blame for separating Americans.\n\"Gay, Inc, and the far-Left activists who control Gay, Inc are spending millions of dollars to separate gays in America,\" Grenell said. \"They tell young people they must step away from the rest of society because they are oppressed in America. They work hard to make gays angry, weird, separated, and fringe. They want separate flags, pronouns, bakeries, and bathrooms. It's crazy.\"\nGrenell said the left \"won't admit that the equality fight is largely over in America but just beginning in the 69 countries around the world that criminalize gays.\"\n\"But gay conservatives know this is the greatest country in the world to be who you are \u2014 We are welcomed in every community,\" he said. \"We aren't oppressed in America.\"\nThe former first lady told Fox News Digital that the Log Cabin Republicans' overarching mission is \"important\" and \"rooted in respect.\"\n\"Based on this central value, people thrive and exist together in a world where all are honored and celebrated,\" she said.\nThe former first lady was given the Lincoln Award at a Log Cabin event at Mar-a-Lago in 2021.\nMeanwhile, Fox News Digital asked the former first lady what her plans would be for a second term in the White House, should her husband, former President Trump, win the 2024 election.\n\"The safety and well-being of American families remains my top priority,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"Our children are our future leaders, tomorrow's innovators.\"\nShe told Fox News Digital that it is \"essential we provide the highest level of care to our next generation; to insure they not only thrive but reach their full potential.\"\n\"In turn, our nation will sustain for generations,\" she said.\nDuring her time as first lady, Trump hosted virtual roundtables on foster care as part of her \"Be Best\" initiative, and focused on strengthening the child welfare system. She worked with members of Congress on legislation that secured funding for grants awarded to youth and young adults currently or formerly in foster care to help pay for college, career school or training. The bill ultimately was signed by then-President Trump in December 2020.\nSince leaving the White House, the former first lady has also created special edition Non-Fungible Tokens. A portion of those proceeds went toward her initiative \"Fostering the Future\" to secure educational opportunities and scholarships for children in the foster care community.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brooke Singman","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/thumbnail_DB370368-94F8-403A-BBC7-56C3869E15C1.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.0998373,"_id":"79cc2bea097148844d6b108886b3a36a"},{"title":"Fox News Poll: Biden, Trump in dead heat in 2024 Pennsylvania rematch","author":"Victoria Balara","published_date":"2024-04-18 22:00:08","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-biden-trump-2024-pennsylvania-rematch","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"President Biden and former President Trump in a dead heat in the latest Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters","summary":"The Keystone State looks headed for another tight race as President Biden and former President Trump are in a dead heat in the latest Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters, a state Trump won by less than a point in 2016 and Biden reclaimed by just over a point in 2020.\nThe survey of registered voters, released Thursday, finds the former and current presidents tied at 48% each, a slight improvement for Biden who was down by 2 percentage points in March.\nBiden saw modest gains among nonwhite voters (+5), suburban voters (+5) and voters under age 35 (+9), while Trump's coalition, such as conservatives, White evangelicals, White men without a degree, and rural voters, held relatively steady. What's more, Trump kept the advantage he had among independents: He was ahead among them by 7 points in March and maintains an 8-point edge now.\nBiden won union households by 5 points in 2020. Today, he holds the small subgroup by 2 points (49% Biden, 47% Trump). Non-union households split 48% each.\nIn a potential five-way race that includes third-party candidates, Trump comes out on top by 2 points: Trump 44%, Biden 42%, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. 8%, Jill Stein 2%, and Cornel West 1%. In this scenario, 8% of two-way Trump supporters break for Kennedy (none for Stein or West), while 10% of Biden supporters go for Kennedy (6%), Stein (3%), and West (1%).\nBiden is in the Keystone State this week, focusing on the economy and advocating for higher taxes on the wealthy as he visits several cities, including his hometown of Scranton.\nOver 4 in 10 voters feel they are falling behind financially (44%). Almost as many (41%) say they are holding steady, while just 14% say they are getting ahead. Trump leads among those who feel they are falling behind by 53 points, while Biden is ahead by 42 points among those saying getting ahead/holding steady.\nThe March Fox News Poll identified the economy as the top issue for Pennsylvanians, when voters surveyed felt Trump would better handle the issue. Trump's advantage on the issue (+12 points) held steady in the April poll.\nTrump also has a 16-point lead on another top issue: immigration and border security, while voters favor him on foreign policy by 4 points.\nBiden is seen as better at handling abortion (+10), election integrity (+6), and health care (+6).\nThe two major candidates are nearly tied on energy policy (Biden +1), despite concerns among some Democrats that Biden's opposition to fracking might be unpopular, especially after the administration paused new exports of U.S. natural gas earlier this year. A House Oversight Committee hearing on Thursday saw Republicans question the impact the pause would have on the U.S., especially internationally.\nVoters split over the Biden administration's handling of the conflict in the Middle East: 24% think he's too supportive of the Israelis vs. 23% say he's too supportive of the Palestinians. The largest number, 40%, says Biden's approach is about right.\nDemocrats are more likely to think the White House is too supportive of the Israelis, while Republicans are more likely to think it is too supportive of the Palestinians.\nBiden's job approval rating is nearly identical to his personal favorability rating: 45% approve of the job he's doing and 44% have a favorable opinion of him, while 55% disapprove of his job performance and have an unfavorable view of him.\nTrump is perceived slightly better than Biden on his favorable rating, but still underwater by 5 points (47% favorable vs. 52% unfavorable), while Kennedy is underwater by 6 points (40% favorable, 46% unfavorable, 15% can't rate).\nThe candidates' mental soundness has been a topic of debate and Pennsylvania voters are more likely to think Trump has the mental fitness to serve effectively as president (49%) than say the same of Biden (43%). At least half think they both don't have the mental soundness to perform the duties of president (50% Trump does not, 55% Biden does not).\nThe Pennsylvania congressional race is tight as well: 47% say they would vote for the Democratic candidate in their district while 46% support the GOP candidate. That's a reversal from March when Republicans were up by 3 points.\n\"The liabilities Biden has nationally are present in Pennsylvania, but they're muted,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"His standing with core Democratic constituencies is a little stronger, and he does a little better on issues like abortion, health care, and election integrity. It's the difference between being down a few points versus being tied.\"\nConducted April 11-16 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,141 Pennsylvania registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (211) and cellphones (628) or completed the survey online after receiving a text (302). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of \u00b13 percentage points. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics of respondents are representative of the registered voter population.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Victoria Balara","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/03/Biden-Trump-1-1.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.0899754,"_id":"5ebbe5d03aef295670116545faf89014"},{"title":"Latest Woke Newsroom Battle: NPR Editor Resigns After Ripping Network for Liberal Activism","author":"John Toldi","published_date":"2024-04-18 16:06:08","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://radio.foxnews.com/2024/04/18/latest-woke-newsroom-battle-npr-editor-resigns-after-ripping-network-for-liberal-activism","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Howie Kurtz on a NPR editor resigning after blasting the network for bias, GOP rejecting aid to Ukraine and Arizona Republicans again blocking abortion ban repeal.

But Iran escalated way beyond what it has ever hitherto dared to do. Biden urged Israel to stand down. Astonishing.\nYesterday's column laid out the origins of the Biden appeasement policy. At this writing Israel has not responded. I hope by the time this column posts that Israel will have done so. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Israel is very close to unleashing a response.\nWe have also learned that nine missiles from Iran did manage to evade interception and strike the IAF's Nevatim Air Base in southern Israel along with another nearby IAF base, and that 120 ballistic missiles were launched during the Iran attack, as well as 200 plus cruise missiles and drones. That's not a symbolic attack. It is a \"mostly failed\" massive attack. It wasn't intended to be a show. It was a strategic attack on the Jewish State. Iran wanted to kill and destroy.\nSo Biden's \"Don't!\" didn't work again. One poster on X quipped that every time he says \"Don't,\" they do. Commentary's Seth Mandel pointed out in a memorable Commentary podcast that Biden's has met the \"foreign policy fiasco\" measure of former President Obama's \"red line\" erasure. John Podhoretz noted in same podcast that Biden \"hasn't said anything\" at all after Saturday night's bombardment. \"His policy toward Iran is shredded. There is no policy towards Iran anymore.\"\nBoth are right, as are Abe Greenwald, Christine Rosen and Matthew Continetti who are also on this memorable pod. There is a bet amongst them now on whether Israel both responds to Iran and enters Rafah to finish off Hamas.\nThe United Kingdom's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Foreign Minister David Cameron have joined the Neville Chamberlain club anchored at the White House. If Israel acts it will do so despite their allies in the defense of the Jewish State asking them not to go on offense. But as former Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren bluntly stated on Monday's radio show: \"Defense is not deterrence.\" He's right too. The willingness to take a punch, or many punches, doesn't deter the enemy. It encourages the enemy to try another assault.\nThis isn't the sort of thing one has to learn from the Melian Dialogue in Thucydides (though it is indeed found there.) You get the same lesson from Ralphie in a Christmas Story when he finally snaps: Bullies have to be stopped. They don't evolve into your friends. Not on a playground. Not in the realm of national security.\nWhat does Hamas's Sinwar think at that point? Is he going to continue to reject Israel's cease-fire offers because he's a religious fanatic or because he expects to emerge from the tunnels as the terrorist equivalent of Churchill at the close of the worst part of the Battle of Britain because the United States forces Israel to stay out of Rafah and thus not to destroy those tunnels?\nWhat does Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah see happening here? And how about \"MBS\" and \"MBZ\" \u2014the rulers of our allies, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates?\nAnd what do the triumvirs \"Supreme Leader\" of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei, Russia's dictator Vladimir Putin and the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping conclude if the United States succeeds in obliging Israel to accept this unprecedented attack on the Jewish State? Nothing good. Many things bad. For Israel, for Ukraine, for Taiwan. And for the United States.\nIran has funded and controlled its proxies to the north and south of Israel for decades. Iran never dared such an attack until now. Khamenei has taken the measure of Team Biden. Israel's War Cabinet must persuade him that it is not the measure of the Jewish State.\nWe know Israel killed many Iranians with its strike on the Damascus headquarters of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps. We know that apologists for Tehran's mullahs are suggesting, and sometimes asserting, that Israel's strikes provoked this off-the-charts escalation from Tehran, as if there was some unspoken deal between Iran and Israel that Israel would not tag out Iran's commanders in the field if they could get back to a base.\nIt's up to Israel now to reset the understandings Iran has developed as well as the mullahs' reliance on President Biden to always take and advise the wrong course on national security. Hopefully by the time you read this, Prime Minister Netanyahu and the War Cabinet have done just that.\nHugh Hewitt is one of the country's leading journalists of the center-right.

Marsha Blackburn is renewing her effort to address NPR's federal funding amid a whistleblower scandal putting the outlet's ideological uniformity on full display.","summary":"FIRST ON FOX: Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., is planning to propose new legislative action that would threaten to cut National Public Radio's (NPR) federal funding if passed, prompted by the news that it suspended an editor who went viral for exposing the outlet's partisan uniformity in its newsroom.\nThe Tennessee Republican is weighing a variety of legislative options to take on federal funding that goes to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which provides funding to NPR in the form of grants. She is specifically looking to prevent NPR from benefiting from public funds, due to what her office characterized as left-wing bias.\n\"The mainstream media has become obsessed with doing the Left's bidding and taking down strong conservatives \u2014 and NPR has led the pack,\" Blackburn said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"It makes no sense that the American people are forced to fund a propagandist left-wing outlet that refuses to represent the voices of half the country. NPR should not receive our tax dollars'.\"\nBlackburn previously looked to sever the government's funding to NPR in 2011 when she was serving in the House of Representatives. At the time, the Republican-controlled House passed a measure that sought to cut $50 million from CPB.\n\"The time has come for us to claw back this money,\" Blackburn reportedly said at the time.\nCPB is \"fully funded by the federal government,\" per the nonprofit's website. The organization provides funding in the form of grants to both NPR and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The grants to NPR are used for its international bureaus and distribution infrastructure that provides content to all public radio stations.\nNPR veteran editor Uri Berliner was recently suspended without pay from NPR following his public criticism of his employer. The suspension was made public on Tuesday but began last Friday, according to NPR media reporter David Folkenflik. The organization reportedly told Berliner on Thursday that his punishment was a final warning, and that if he violated NPR's policy on employees seeking approval to do work for other news outlet, he would be fired.\n\"I love NPR and feel it's a national trust,\" Berliner said in an interview with Folkenflik. \"We have great journalists here.

The spending package also includes billions for Ukraine and Taiwan.\nJohnson, R-La., is facing immense political pressure to clear through his chamber a $95 billion supplemental package that would send support to the U.S. allies, as well as provide humanitarian aid for civilians in Ukraine and Gaza and funding to replenish U.S. weapons provided to Taiwan. However, the GOP maintains only a slim majority in the chamber and Republicans are divided on whether to continue supporting Kyiv, who is defending itself from Russia's invasion.\nIran's attack on Israel late Saturday further increased the pressure on Johnson, but it could have given him an outlet to underline the urgency in approving the aid. Johnson told Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures\" that Republicans \"understand the necessity of standing with Israel.\"\n\"The details of that package are being put together right now,\" Johnson said Sunday, adding that he would try to advance the aid bill this week. \"We're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues.\"\nThe White House and Senate members are urging Johnson to put a bill already approved by the Senate onto the House floor. The Republican leader could also start fresh with a new bill that has spending levels more favorable to certain members, in an effort to win over their support.\nThe speaker has expressed support for legislation that would structure some of the funding for Kyiv as loans, pave the way for the U.S. to tap frozen Russian central bank assets and include other policy changes. Johnson has pushed for the Biden administration to lift a pause on approvals for Liquefied Natural Gas exports and has demanded policy changes to secure the U.S.-Mexico border.\nIt is not immediately clear how Johnson would proceed.\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise said in a statement Saturday that the House would change its legislative schedule this week to \"consider legislation that supports our ally Israel and holds Iran and its terrorist proxies accountable,\" but did not provide additional details on which path Johnson may take.\nJohnson's legislative push this week comes after he traveled to Florida on Friday for an event with former President Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\nFollowing the meeting, Trump expressed support for Johnson and said he has a \"very good relationship\" with him.\n\"He and I are 100% united on these big agenda items,\" Johnson added. \"When you talk about aid to Ukraine, he's introduced the loan-lease concept, which is a really important one, and I think has a lot of consensus.\"\nJohnson's push for aid comes amid pressure from Biden's White House and the Democrat-controlled Senate.\nOn Sunday, Biden called congressional leaders and urged them to act quickly to send aid to both Israel and Ukraine.\nFollowing the call, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said there was \"consensus\" among the participants.\n\"The best way to help Israel rebuild its anti-missile and anti-drone capacity is by passing that supplemental immediately. As I said, Israel expended about over a billion dollars in defending itself and the security supplemental would replenish the kind of anti-missile and anti-drone defenses that are in the Arrow, in the David's Sling, and in the Iron Dome,\" Schumer said at a news conference in New York, ABC News reported.\nHe added: \"It's vital for the future of Ukraine, for Israel and the West.\"\nThe Senate previously passed a bill that includes roughly $60 billion for Ukraine and $14 billion for Israel.\nThe White House said on Sunday's call, Biden \"discussed the urgent need for the House of Representatives to pass the national security supplemental as soon as possible.\"\n\"We didn't need any reminders in terms of what's going on in Ukraine,\" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on NBC. \"But last night certainly underscores significantly the threat that Israel faces in a very, very tough neighborhood.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Lawrence Richard","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/AP24103768011281.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.9491167,"_id":"58a8418df6bb0ff10dcfa324b62da4c5"},{"title":"Over 140 House lawmakers condemn 'brutal' Iranian regime after Israel strike","author":"Elizabeth Elkind","published_date":"2024-04-15 22:24:28","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/over-140-house-lawmakers-condemn-brutal-iranian-regime-after-israel-strike","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Rep.

Tony Evers.","summary":"MADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Wisconsin Supreme Court justices questioned Wednesday how much power legislative committees should wield, in a case that Democratic Gov. Tony Evers brought against the Republican-controlled Legislature and that could have a major impact on how state government functions.\nA ruling in favor of Evers would upend decades-old practices in the Legislature and make it easier to approve projects in a land stewardship program. But justices echoed concerns raised by Republicans that the case could have far broader impacts on the separation of power between the executive and legislative branches.\nSiding with Evers would \"overturn how our state government has functioned for almost a century,\" Misha Tseytlin, a lawyer for the Legislature, told the court.\nBut liberal Justice Jill Karofsky, in deflecting arguments that the court should not overturn such established practices, said \"Maybe they've been wrong for the last century and we shouldn't double down on how wrong this is.\"\nEvers argues that the Legislature's powerful budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, which is controlled 12-4 by Republicans, is exceeding its constitutional lawmaking authority and effectively acting as a fourth branch of government. The Legislature counters that the committee's powers, including the approval of certain state conservation projects, are well established in state law and court precedent.\nKarofsky questioned whether the budget committee had too much power.\n\"There doesn't seem to me to be any limits whatsoever,\" she said. \"There are zero guardrails here.\"\nIf the court sides with Evers, then numerous other functions of the budget committee, the state building commission and other legislative committees that have been in place for a century would also be unconstitutional, Tseytlin said.\nConservative Justice Rebecca Bradley questioned whether the court's ruling would apply across a myriad of legislative committees and their powers.\n\"You're asking us to make a big shift,\" she said, adding that the court can't \"slice and dice separation of powers\" between the executive and legislative branches.\n\"Either we're going to apply it strictly or we're not,\" she said.\nLiberal Justice Ann Walsh Bradley echoed some concerns raised by conservative justices.\n\"Your position seems to be black and white: Once the Legislature has passed a bill, hands off,\" she said to Evers' attorney. \"Isn't there any nuance to the position, some kind of limitations on your black-and-white argument? It seems to me there should be.\"\nEvers' attorney Colin Roth said the constitution is clear that once the Legislature passes a law, it is up to the executive branch to carry it out. The Legislature is overreaching its authority when committees can veto actions such as the approval of stewardship projects, he said.\nEvers, speaking about the case on Tuesday, said the state Supreme Court needs to recognize that the Legislature's budget committee has been acting as a fourth branch of government and should be reined in.\n\"The idea that somehow they have the ability to essentially work as a fourth arm of our state is just wrong,\" Evers told reporters.\nThe lawsuit cites the committee's rejection of dozens of conservation projects selected by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program.\nThe Legislature created the stewardship program in 1989. It provides funding primarily to local governments, conservation groups and the DNR to purchase blocks of land to preserve natural areas and wildlife habitat, protect water quality and fisheries, and expand outdoor recreational opportunities. Supporters herald it as a way to further protect natural areas from development.\nRepublicans have been trying for years to scale back stewardship purchases, complaining that they take too much land off the tax rolls, rob northern Wisconsin municipalities of revenue and drive up state debt.\nLegislative oversight of the program increased as concerns grew about the scope and cost of the stewardship program.\nThe Legislature did its job when it passed laws creating and funding the program, attorneys for Evers argue in court filings. But the budget committee's ability to block approval of stewardship projects, essentially vetoing decisions of the executive branch, is an unconstitutional separation of powers violation, they say.\nConservative Chief Justice Annette Ziegler questioned whether the case should be put on hold so the court could gather more facts and take a broader look at legislative and executive powers.\n\"Why rush this case?\" she asked.\nThe court will issue a ruling in the next several weeks or months.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Wisconsin-Governor-Sues-Legislature.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.877097,"_id":"c920cec15d2794c63df4bb37bbd472fa"},{"title":"Former President Trump Turns Trial Into Bodega Gold","author":"Kaitlyn Miller","published_date":"2024-04-18 02:41:24","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://radio.foxnews.com/2024/04/17/former-president-trump-turns-trial-into-bodega-gold","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"As former President Trump's hush money trial kicks off in New York City, he refuses to let the time-consuming case take his eyes off the campaign trail - and the dedication seems to be paying off, as\u2026","summary":"As former President Trump's hush money trial kicks off in New York City, he refuses to let the time-consuming case take his eyes off the campaign trail \u2013 and the dedication seems to be paying off, as more polls show people of color and young voters are leaning red this election cycle.\nSean & Rachel weigh in on how the former President is being treated during his trial and why they believe traditionally democratic voters are aligning with the Republican Party.\nFollow Sean & Rachel on Twitter: @SeanDuffyWI & @RCamposDuffy\nFollow Sean & Rachel on Twitter: @SeanDuffyWI & @RCamposDuffy","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Kaitlyn Miller","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/radio.foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/12/HEADER_BANNER_FROM_THE_KITCHEN_TABLE.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":5.875202,"_id":"f59de77b2955ce8695ff2dc1a9257e31"},{"title":"Morning Glory: Now or never time for Israel?","author":"Hugh Hewitt","published_date":"2024-04-18 09:00:27","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-now-never-time-israel","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"If Israel allows itself to be cowed now, will it ever regain the optimism and sense of security it enjoyed on 10/6?","summary":"As of this writing Israel has not responded to Iran's massive attack against it Saturday night. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron relayed, after meeting with Israeli officials on Wednesday that it was \"clear the Israelis are making a decision to act.\"\n\"We hope they do so in a way that does as little to escalate this as possible,\" Cameron added in his best impersonation of Lord Halifax in 1938, and that Israel is \"smart as well as tough.\"\nRear Admiral (USN, Ret.) Mark Montgomery reviewed with me on Wednesday morning all the ways the Jewish State could strike directly at Iran They are many and varied. Israel possesses ballistic missiles just as Iran does. It has a fleet of F-35 fighter planes which are not only stealth aircraft but may also be able to reach the known nuclear facilities and which may possibly be fitted to carry payloads robust enough to damage significantly those nuclear facilities. (Admiral Montgomery added that it is widely believed that Israel also possesses submarines with the capability to launch cruise missiles.)\nThe target list is long, from those nuclear sites both known to the public and those only known to intelligence agencies and to every system that could be crippled by Israel's robust cyber warfare capacities. There are the headquarters and barracks of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, and of course oil refineries and power grid facilities. Montgomery's 30 minute Q-and-A explains that what Israel strikes depends entirely on what goal it wants to achieve. There are different sorts of deterrence the long-time grand strategist opined. We don't yet know which if any Prime Minister Netanyahu and his colleagues have settled on, or if they have settled on any at all. The weather and the phase of the moon, Montgomery added, are more variables to figure into this incredibly complex calculation.\nVery few media professionals have any serious idea what even is possible or what Iran might do in response. The leaks and counter-leaks to the media in Israel and the United States have created the proverbial \"wilderness of mirrors.\" For a civilian, much less anyone not in the Israeli War Cabinet meetings, to predict anything is absurd.\nBut long time observers of the undeclared (until Saturday) Israel-Iran War can say with some certainty that it hard to imagine any circumstance in which Israel would strike directly at the nuclear program if not now. Certainly not after Iran achieves nuclear weapon \"break out.\"\nThe mullahs escalated Saturday night to a massive direct attack on Israel. They intended savage harm. Some of the attack was directed at Israel's nuclear site at Dimona. Some asset at the Knesset was targeted too. The comprehensive defense of the Jewish State mounted by it and its allies frustrated every projectile, and prevented terrible destruction and casualties but if Iran had developed a nuke, would they have used it? Can Israel ever tolerate even the near approach to \"break out\" after Iran dashed all the illusions of the \"Iran just wants to be acknowledged as a leader in the region\" crowd?\nIran is a theocracy led by fanatics. That it did not unleash Hezbollah's 150,000 rockets and missiles on Israel could mean that Iran wanted the message to be clear that the state actor with the upper hand when it came to escalation was in fact Iran, and it was confident of its superiority to Israel if escalation occurred. Alternatively Iran could have acted as it did to prevent the ground invasion of Lebanon for which Israel has been preparing for the six months since 10/7. It is hard to \"think like a religious fanatic.\" We don't know. And no American safe within our country can fully judge what Israel's leaders must weigh in their deliberations and do so with their country's long term interests in mind.\nThe \"clarity window\" for the West is, however, wide open right now. Israel has absolute justice on its side \u2014now and for a few more days or perhaps a couple of weeks (at best) because the world moves on quickly and forgets even faster. Once \"stability\" returns the pressure on Israel to de-escalate will grow and grow by actors who just want to get \"back to normal,\" as though that is actually possible.\nIf Israel does not strike back now, it seems very likely it won't strike back until it is either too late to do so or at least do so confident that a large portion of its friends in the West will applaud and, if not applaud, at least grudgingly acknowledge that it was obliged to do so.\nThe other new factor: The faith in the ability of high-tech intelligence capabilities to warn Israel of deadly attacks and thus to allow it to preempt those attacks is gone after the surprise of 10/7. Yes, warning was given this past weekend. Will it be the next time? Could Iran achieve strategic surprise in the way Hamas achieved tactical surprise on 10/7?\nWhat is clear beyond any doubt that an Israel that does not respond soon with a devastating counter-strike is an Israel that will have forfeited deterrence against attacks of at least equal intensity. At a moment when the United States and the United Kingdom are both led by very weak governments beset by electoral considerations, Israel has to decide for itself: Will it be cowed?\nIf so, it is hard to imagine circumstances when the Israel of 10/6 can be regained.\nHugh Hewitt is one of the country's leading journalists of the center-right.

Janet Mills, a Democrat.\nThe bicameral Legislature is made up of the Senate, with 22 Democrats and 13 Republicans, and the House, which has 80 Democratic members and 68 Republicans.\nDespite Democrats holding majorities, their effort is not immune to resistance as the state has a strong hunting tradition and vocal advocates for gun owner rights.\nOne bill that failed was a proposal to let gun violence victims sue weapon manufacturers.\nSo far, neither chamber has voted on a proposal for a red flag law.\nAnd, a separate measure sponsored by House Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross to fund a range of mental health and violence prevention initiatives does not yet have money in the final budget.\nThe Oct. 25, 2023 shooting that killed 18 people and injured 13 others in Lewiston prompted lawmakers to act. They specifically argued that constituents were demanding they do something that could prevent future attacks.\nOne initiative, the red flag proposal, would allow family members to petition a judge to remove guns from someone's home. The proposal differs from the state's current yellow flag law that puts law enforcement officers \u2014 not the individual's parents, siblings or children \u2014 in the lead of the process.\nThe initiative was proposed as police were warned by family members of the shooter, an Army reservist who took his own life after the deadly rampage.\nFamily members warned the eventual shooter was becoming paranoid and losing his grip on reality before the attack. He was hospitalized last summer while training with his Army Reserve unit.\nOn Sept. 15, his best friend, a fellow reservist, warned that the man was going \"to snap and do a mass shooting.\"\nSix weeks later, he carried out the deadliest shooting in Maine history.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Lawrence Richard","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1746139269.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.7998476,"_id":"646224ab432840c08c0fafc3b9490a65"}],"user_input":{"q":"Republican","search_in":["title_summary_en"],"lang":["en"],"not_lang":null,"countries":null,"not_countries":null,"from":"2024-04-15 00:00:00","to":null,"ranked_only":"True","from_rank":null,"to_rank":null,"sort_by":"relevancy","page":1,"size":100,"sources":["foxnews.com"],"not_sources":[],"topic":null,"published_date_precision":null}}
