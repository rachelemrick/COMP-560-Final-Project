One day you may come in and it may be a plank from a 4,000-year-old boat, the next day it might be a tiny statue from ancient Egypt. So I think one of the things that is great is that people can see the exhibition change, they can see the different work over time.\"\n\"The Stories We Keep\" also features several modern-day objects and their ancient counterparts.\n\"The idea is, we are asking visitors to think about what stories your objects tell,\" said Crawford. \"We have a child's bracelet from thousands of years ago, next to a modern one. So, what we are really thinking about is what people leave behind.

Genetic diversity can improve a species' ability to adapt and survive despite disease outbreaks and changing environmental conditions.\nThis photo provided by Revive & Restore shows a cloned black-footed ferret named Noreen, Feb. 19, 2024, at the National Black-Footed Ferret Conservation Center in Carr, Colo.\nKika Tuff / AP\n\"More diversity is better. Then, you're more prepared for things like change, climate and otherwise,\" Dr. Della Garelle, a FWS veterinarian who works with the ferrets, told CBS \"Sunday Mornings\" in 2023.\nEnergetic and curious, black-footed ferrets are a nocturnal type of weasel with dark eye markings resembling a robber's mask. Their prey is prairie dogs, and the ferrets hunt the rodents in often vast burrow colonies on the plains.\nBlack-footed ferrets are now a conservation success story - after being all but wiped out in the wild, thousands of them have been bred in captivity and reintroduced at dozens of sites in the western U.S., Canada and Mexico since the 1990s.\nBecause they feed exclusively on prairie dogs, they have been victims of farmer and rancher efforts to poison and shoot the land-churning rodents - so much so that they were thought to be extinct until a ranch dog named Shep brought a dead one home in western Wyoming in 1981. Conservationists then managed to capture seven more and establish a breeding program.\nBut their gene pool is small - all known black-footed ferrets today are descendants of those seven animals - so diversifying the species is critically important.\nNoreen and Antonia, like Elizabeth Ann, are genetically identical to Willa, one of the original seven. Willa's remains -- frozen back in the 1980s and kept at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance's Frozen Zoo -- could help conservation efforts because her genes contain roughly three times more unique variations than are currently found among black-footed ferrets, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.\nThere are more than 10,000 samples at the Frozen Zoo, everything from skin to feathers, CBS News' Jonathan Vigliotti reported last year.\n\"When I was freezing cells from the northern white rhino, there were 50 living. And then now, there's two left,\" Curator Marlys Houck told Vigliotti.\nBarbara Durrant, the director of reproductive sciences at the Frozen Zoo, said their bank of cells could help save an estimated one million species at risk of extinction, mostly because of humans.\nAnd in some cases, a species' depleted population might only be corrected by science. Durrant said, \"If we disappeared, a lot of things would grow back. But some populations are so small, or don't even exist except here, that they would not be able to regenerate without us.\"\nElizabeth Ann still lives at the National Black-footed Ferret Conservation Center in Fort Collins, Colorado, but she's been unable to breed, due to a reproductive organ issue that isn't a result of being cloned, the Fish and Wildlife Service said in a statement.\nBiologists plan to try to breed Noreen and Antonia after they reach maturity later this year.\nThe ferrets were born at the ferret conservation center last May. The Fish and Wildlife Service waited almost a year to announce the births amid ongoing scientific work, other black-footed ferret breeding efforts and the agency's other priorities, Fish and Wildlife Service spokesman Joe Szuszwalak said by email.\n\"Science takes time and does not happen instantaneously,\" Szuszwalak wrote.\nCloning makes a new plant or animal by copying the genes of an existing animal. To clone these three ferrets, the Fish and Wildlife Service worked with zoo and conservation organizations and ViaGen Pets & Equine, a Texas business that clones horses for $85,000 and pet dogs for $50,000.\nThe company also has cloned a Przewalski's wild horse, a species from Mongolia.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"science","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/18/9a031b29-0fb4-4a3c-97a8-a71f773a1ff9/thumbnail/1200x630/7093ec3fab21f259b867edf0c98158b7/ap24108675042413.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSNews","_score":7.1880636,"_id":"a5b1ef460a83ee40cc1dd169f3ce4770"},{"title":"Johnson could risk speakership with foreign aid votes","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-18 17:04:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/johnson-could-risk-speakership-with-foreign-aid-votes","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"House Speaker Mike Johnson may get support from Democrats to push various foreign aid bills forward, but the move may jeopardize his leadership position among conservative Republicans.

The aquarium strives to ensure enough emphasis goes toward the water as well as the land. Exhibits inside the aquarium cover the effects of climate change, the harm from plastic pollution in the oceans, and the loss of natural habitats.\n\"This environment actually immerses you straight into the oceans and you begin to appreciate the incredible biodiversity that exists in the San Francisco Bay and beyond,\" he told KPIX while giving a tour through the underground tunnels.\nThe origin of Earth Day is in the ocean and with the annual event often comes a local call to action to have a global impact.

One of the major focuses of this year's Earth Day is limiting the use of plastics; Jacob also suggests changes to your diet, less consumption of products overall, and finding more recyclable items.\n\"Understanding the diversity, the biodiversity, and the habitat requirement makes us sensitive to why we should keep the oceans pristine,\" he said.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Shawn Chitnis","media":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/22/0543b1e9-a688-47d6-a031-aa9191275fbb/thumbnail/1200x630/89fc940569fc4f248bcb4a3e873c5e10/snapshot.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@KPIXTV","_score":6.0977535,"_id":"f1cbe7dea0edcb5f7dbd20e599cee1c0"},{"title":"Property tax relief coming for millions of Pennsylvanians","author":"Lauren Linder","published_date":"2024-04-17 09:04:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/property-tax-relief-coming-for-millions-of-pennsylvanians","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"The state's Department of Education will notify each local school district of its property tax allocation by May 1.","summary":"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- Property tax relief is coming for millions of Pennsylvanians.\nGovernor Shapiro says that $900 million will be available for property tax relief across the state for at least the next five years.\nIt's a record increase of $150 million and Governor Shapiro says this is thanks to revenues and conservative projections from the budget office,\nLocal school districts will be required to pass this funding onto local taxpayers.\nThis is usually done by increasing homestead exemptions that lower property taxes by reducing the taxable assessed value of the home.\nAs a result, homeowners have a smaller tax burden and are required to pay less in property taxes.\nThe state's Department of Education will notify each local school district of its property tax allocation by May 1.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Lauren Linder","media":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/09/05/482a7280-94c0-44b2-9c81-b14c9eed6e84/thumbnail/1200x630/49d70870bfae1aa9c068f83025d48a72/gettyimages-1063016728.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@KDKA","_score":6.0860825,"_id":"a86c484e9c5820b98913f3b846edf0ce"},{"title":"Eastern hellbender's absence from Pennsylvania's waterways is warning sign of bigger problems","author":"Ray Petelin","published_date":"2024-04-17 21:22:57","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/eastern-hellbenders-disappearing-pennsylvania-rivers-streams-climate-change","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Despite being the official state amphibian, hellbenders aren't exactly overflowing in Pennsylvania's waterways these days.","summary":"Scientists researching animals threatened with extinction from climate change\nScientists researching animals threatened with extinction from climate change\nScientists researching animals threatened with extinction from climate change\n03:49\nPITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- To look at the wide, flat, slimy face of a hellbender with its beady eyes and goofy grin, you might not think it's sending us a message.\n(Photo Credit: KDKA)\nHowever, the hellbender's absence from a river or a stream in Pennsylvania is a warning sign that things are not right.\n\"Some people think they're not the most attractive little guys,\" Heather Berkey, the Volunteer Services Manager and an educator at the Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium.\n\"But how could you not fall in love with that little face?\" added Pittsburgh Zoo Aquarist Shanna Gay.\nDespite being the official state amphibian, hellbenders aren't exactly overflowing in Pennsylvania's waterways these days or any waterway for that matter.\n\"We estimate there's only about 2,000 hellbenders left in the wild,\" said Jeff Briggler, the Chief Herpetologist with the Missouri Department of Conservation.\nThe largest salamander in the Americas, at anywhere from 12 to 29 inches, the eastern hellbender should live in rivers and streams throughout Pennsylvania and Appalachia.\nHowever, hellbenders currently face many obstacles.\nIf a hellbender can survive to adulthood, dodging fish, otters and other hellbenders, it then faces another set of problems caused all by one thing - people.\nAmong those problems: habitat destruction and degradation, pharmaceuticals, heavy metals, toxins and other pollutants dumped into the water, agricultural runoff, having fracking wastewater injected into the ground from the oil and gas industry, road or dam construction, and people stealing the animals illegally from the wild.\n\"Humans are the hellbender's number one predator,\" said Gay.\nThe eastern hellbender's cousin, the Ozark hellbender, went through the same thing but has been rescued from the brink, thanks to more than a decade of conservation work.\n\"We knew this animal was probably going extinct, and we had maybe a 10- to 12-year window to try to reverse that,\" said Briggler.\nHe and other scientists with Missouri's Conservation Department built a captive breeding program, collecting Ozark hellbender eggs in the wild to hatch and grow in the safety of the Saint Louis Zoo.\n\"That resulted in a lot of little, baby hellbenders to release in the future,\" Briggler said. \"And a couple of years ago, we reached our 10,000th hellbender released into the wild.\"\nBut that hasn't solved everything. There's still one more increasing risk to hellbenders.\n\"We had a 500 to 750 year flood event, and it devastated the habitat. We lost over half of our population of hellbenders,\" said Briggler.\nClimate change means massive floods that were supposed to happen once a century or even once a millennia are becoming more common.\n\"So if we're going to be having 100 or 200 year floods every 20 years instead, are the hellbenders going to have time to rebound within those systems?\" asked Briggler.\n(Photo Credit: KDKA)\nHe says breeding hellbenders to be released back into the wild needs to be paired with active protection of their habitats. He says that includes things like planting trees along waterways to block runoff and filter out toxins from homes and industries.\n\"The more you can filter that, the more we can limit the damage to the systems,\" Briggler said.\nMeanwhile, experts at the Pittsburgh Zoo say documenting hellbender sightings in western Pennsylvania's creeks and rivers isn't an arduous task. They say it's something anyone who's out fishing can do.\n\"The Kiskiminetas River has been known to be extremely dirty with industry runoff, and I think a year or two ago a fisherman found a hellbender. And from that, it spurred other people to look at water quality and safety measures. And that's now affecting our water. Our water's getting cleaner,\" said Gay.\nShe says just knowing a hellbender is living in any particular waterway can give conservationists an idea of how things are improving in the whole environment of that area.\nGay added, \"We're doing survey work and looking for populations of hellbenders to make sure the environment as a whole stays healthy. So we're helping all the animals and plants that live in that environment.\"\nBut while the Ozark hellbender population is growing at the Saint Louis Zoo, and captive breeding is also underway at other zoos, including the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Ohio and the Good Zoo at Oglebay in Wheeling, West Virginia, the Pittsburgh Zoo's one and only hellbender is still swimming solo.\nMore Earth Day content on KDKA.com.\n\"Captive breeding of hellbenders is still kind of new and the kinks are still being worked out, so the Pittsburgh Zoo does not have plans at this time to start a captive breeding program. But, hopefully, we will someday,\" said Gay.\nSo at this rate, it'll take years of work for Pennsylvania's hellbenders to start to recover like their Ozark relatives. But at least now, there's hope.\nBriggler said, \"We owe it to each one of these animals to give them a voice.\"\nIf you see a hellbender in the wild, you can document it with Penn State Outreach through this link.\nKDKA Investigative Producer Tory Wegerski and Special Projects Manager Corey Martin contributed to this story.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"In Western Pa Since January Of,Ray Petelin","media":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/17/edb5ce9b-493d-43c2-9999-59f664c7d42d/thumbnail/1200x630/9e2a508a1f78926867ee6923e0641769/hellbender-pittsburgh-zoo.png?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@KDKA","_score":5.974532,"_id":"f712a69f05b1b2ba52f3ab65c8a536c3"},{"title":"House Republicans unveil aid bills for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan as Johnson pushes forward","author":"Caitlin Yilek","published_date":"2024-04-17 16:54:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/house-republicans-ukraine-israel-taiwan-aid-package","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"House Republican leadership on Wednesday unveiled three bills that are part of a complicated plan by Speaker Mike Johnson to approve more foreign aid.","summary":"Washington \u2014 House Republican leadership on Wednesday unveiled the legislative text for three bills that are part of a complicated plan by Speaker Mike Johnson to get aid to U.S. allies while addressing concerns from conservatives.\nThe three bills would provide $26.4 billion to support Israel, $60.8 bill to bolster Ukraine and $8.1 billion to counter China in the Indo-Pacific, including billions for Taiwan.\nThe fourth bill, which is set to be released later in the day, is geared toward addressing other GOP foreign policy priorities. That measure would allow the sale of frozen assets of Russian oligarchs, potentially force the sale of TikTok and authorize stricter sanctions on Russia, China and Iran. House Republicans are also expected to release a border security bill that would be considered separately.\nJohnson said he would give lawmakers 72 hours to review the legislation, teeing up a vote as soon as Saturday.\nThe Louisiana Republican announced the proposal on Monday amid mounting pressure from members in both parties to hold a vote on a bipartisan Senate package that includes support for the U.S. allies. The $95 billion supplemental funding package that passed the Senate in February has stagnated for months in the House as Johnson has debated a path forward.\n\"We won't be voting on the Senate supplemental in its current form, but we will vote on each of these measures separately in four different pieces,\" Johnson told reporters after unveiling his plan to House Republicans on Monday.\nThe divide over foreign aid\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson speaks during a news conference in the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Tuesday, April 16, 2024.\nBill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\nLawmakers expressed new urgency around approving the funds for Israel after it faced unprecedented airstrikes by Iran over the weekend, which came in retaliation for an Israeli strike on an Iranian consulate in Syria. And while Senate leaders and the White House had insisted that the House approving the Senate-passed package would be the most effective way to move forward, Johnson has resisted that pressure in the face of threats from the right flank of his party to oust him.\nForeign aid has highlighted the growing divide within the Republican Party, particularly in the House, where conservatives oppose additional funding to Ukraine.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, has threatened to trigger a vote on ousting Johnson over Ukraine aid. Her effort lacked the public support of any of her GOP colleagues until Tuesday, when Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie signed onto the resolution to remove the speaker, known as a motion to vacate.\nJohnson said he is \"not resigning,\" calling it \"an absurd notion\" that someone would bring a motion to vacate \"when we are simply here trying to do our jobs.\"\nThe conservative House Freedom Caucus on Wednesday accused Johnson of \"surrendering the last opportunity we have to combat the border crisis.\"\nBefore the bills' text was released, a handful of Republican committee chairs backed Johnson's plan and called for the legislation to be passed this week.\n\"There is nothing our adversaries would love more than if Congress were to fail to pass critical national security aid,\" the group said in a statement.\nWith such a narrow majority, Democrats would have to step in to save Johnson if Greene or Massie follow through with forcing a vote. Republicans can afford to lose just two votes if all members are present and voting. Beginning next week, after Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin resigns, Republicans can spare a single vote.\nDemocrats have kept the door open to backing Johnson's plan, as long as it includes aid to the three U.S. allies and humanitarian assistance. House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California said Tuesday they were \"more concerned about the substance\" of the legislation \"than we are the process.\"\n\"If Speaker Johnson's version is missing one of these components, it's highly unlikely Democrats would support it,\" said Rep. Ted Lieu of California, the caucus' vice chair.\nHouse Democratic Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts called Johnson's indecisiveness \"a threat to global security,\" adding that Johnson's effort to pacify his detractors is futile.\n\"How many appearances has he made saying 'I am bringing up Ukraine funding next week'? Here we are. There is no appeasing the Marjorie Taylor Greene's of this conference,\" Clark told reporters Wednesday.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Tuesday morning he is \"reserving judgment\" on the proposal until more details are released, while again calling on the House to vote on the Senate bill.\nThe White House has said it does not support a standalone Israel bill, and two previous efforts to provide aid to Israel since the Oct. 7 terrorist attack by Hamas have failed in Congress. On Tuesday afternoon, White House spokesman John Kirby said administration officials were waiting to see more details on Johnson's plan, but \"it does appear at first blush, that the speaker's proposals will, in fact, help us get aid to Ukraine, aid to Israel and needed resources to the Indo-Pacific.\"\nEllis Kim, Nikole Killion, Cristina Corujo and Gabrielle Ake contributed reporting.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":",Kaia Hubbard,Caitlin Yilek,Was A Member,D.C.

Their pollination is the foundation of Colorado's ecosystem and the magic behind the state's beautiful wildflowers.\nBut each year, researchers are seeing less of certain pollinators.\n\"We used to have many more hummingbirds here. I've been feeding hummingbirds here for 21 years now,\" said Arvind Panjabi, senior research scientist at the Bird Conservancy of the Rockies.\nCBS\nPanjabi still hasn't spotted a hummingbird in his Fort Collins yard. It's the latest he's ever waited for one.\n\"Sadly, this hummingbird feeder has not been used yet this spring. We're still waiting for the first hummingbird. So, I don't know if that's a sign of things to come here,\" said Panjabi.\nPanjabi manages a database tracking North American bird populations, including trends, threats and distribution. He's seen big changes in the state's hummingbird species.\n\"The broad-tailed hummingbird has unfortunately been going through decline,\" Panjabi said. \"It's lost nearly 50% of its population since 1970. On the other hand, the black-chinned hummingbird has been increasing over the last 50 years and moving north.\"\nThe black-chinned birds do well in desert environments, while broad-tailed hummingbirds are suited to cooler climates and higher elevations. They've seen a 30% population decline in the last decade alone.\nAccording to a 2019 Audubon Society report, broad-tailed hummingbirds are one of the birds most vulnerable to climate change in Colorado, with a projected 69% range loss if temperatures warm by three degrees Celsius.\n\"Could we see broad-tails becoming extinct in Colorado at some point?\" asked CBS Colorado's Olivia Young.\n\"That's really hard to say,\" Panjabi answered. \"One thing we could see is their disappearance from the lower elevations. If things get hotter and drier down here, they'll be forced to move up.\"\nIt's a problem another Colorado pollinator is facing with even greater urgency.\n\"Because bumblebees are adapted to those cool, high-elevation environments, as the climate warms, there's only so much more up you can go,\" said Dr. John Mola, CSU professor and bee researcher .\nCBS\nMola took part in a study on the health of native pollinating insects, commissioned by state lawmakers in 2022, which found that one in five Colorado bumblebee species are at risk.\n\"In the next 50 years or so, we could see substantial declines in these species,\" Mola.\nThe researchers are now petitioning for those bees to receive protection under the Endangered Species Act. Right now, only two bumblebee species nationwide make that list. Mola says the western bumblebee, in particular, should be included, as it could be near extinction before the end of the century.\nBut it's not just climate change threatening the pollinators. Non-native species, pathogens, loss of habitat and pesticides might be contributing to declines in population for both the birds and the bees.\nIt begs the question: What would a Colorado without these pollinators look like?\nExperts say the ecosystem could be disrupted.\n\"Hummingbirds play an important role in the food chain. They both eat insects in addition to drinking nectar and are food for other birds and other carnivores,\" Panjabi said.\nColorado's agriculture and tourism industries could also take a hit.\n\"The prices of crops that rely on bumblebee population going up in price or even becoming scarce or lower in their nutritional quality,\" Mola said.\nIt's why researchers want to take steps now to protect the pollinators who put the color in Colorado.\n\"If you love wildflower displays in Colorado, then you really love that bee diversity that enables those displays,\" Mola said.\n\"It sure would be sad to lose such a charismatic bird that is so approachable and lives in such symbiosis with our people here in Colorado,\" Panjabi said.\nMola says some actions that might help bumble populations include restoring habitat, supporting forest ecosystems and increasing floral resources.\nFor both kinds of pollinators, there's a lot even the experts don't know. They say more research on them will be crucial in conserving them. The Recovering Americas Wildlife Act, currently pending in U.S. Congress, would devote $1.4 billion dollars a year to support research and conservation of non-game species.\nColoradans can take small steps in their own backyards to support pollinators:\nPanjabi says feeding hummingbirds can help their populations, especially in drought years when there are less flowers for them to feed on. Panjabi recommends boiling one part sugar with four parts water, cooling it, then filling a hummingbird feeder and hanging it in a shady spot outside. There's no need to use red dye or buy a solution.\nBe sure to replace the nectar every couple days and keep feeders clean. Panjabi does not recommend feeding birds if you have outdoor cats. He also recommends putting reflective stickers or other deterrents on windows to prevent birds flying into them and dying.\nAs for bees, Mola recommends planting flowers or getting a native bee hotel. However, he does not recommend keeping honeybees. Honeybees are not native to Colorado, and they may have negative effects on native bees.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Olivia Young","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/17/ab20d50f-9fb5-4b8a-8957-cd634bba17d4/thumbnail/1200x630/35bff82590e61a2d6aeb566743a75288/cover-vo-hummingbirds-frame-162.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@https://twitter.com/OliviaYoungTV","_score":5.968399,"_id":"a6af31e851eb7f9035462490c0c8024e"},{"title":"Brookfield Zoo hosting Earth Day themed events over the weekend","author":"Jeramie Bizzle","published_date":"2024-04-19 14:39:48","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/brookfield-zoo-hosting-earth-day-themed-events","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"On Saturday, the zoo will host its annual Party for the Planet recycling event, followed by the Earth Day Run on Sunday.","summary":"CHICAGO (CBS)\u2014 In honor of Earth Day, the Brookfield Zoo will host two events over the weekend.\nCHICAGO (CBS)\u2014 In honor of Earth Day, the Brookfield Zoo will host two events over the weekend.\nOn Saturday, they will be holding their annual Party for the Planet recycling event.\nAnyone can drop off items, including textiles, electronics, plastic appliances, and books.\nThe event will take place from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the zoo's main parking lot, which is located at 8400 31st Street.\nThen on Sunday, families and runners will partake in the zoo's Earth Day Run.\nBrookfield Zoo Earth Day Run.\nBrookfield Zoo\nThe 2.2-mile, non-competitive run will kick off at 8 a.m. and takes place inside the park.\nAll participants will receive an Earth Day Run commemorative medal and a packet of wildflower seeds to help start their own gardens.\nEntry fee for the race is $35 per person and includes full-day admission to the Zoo.\nTo register, visit the Brookfield Zoo's website.\nProceeds from the run benefit Brookfield Zoo Chicago's Animal Care and Conservation Fund, which supports research and education efforts at the zoo and around the world.\nEarth Day is on Monday, April 22.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jeramie Bizzle,Oakpark.Com","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/19/78da8cd1-27e4-4811-9294-c56a22c94a81/thumbnail/1200x630/497d518c335fd092afab3139b0af3660/bfz-recycling-event.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSchicago","_score":5.677697,"_id":"70f4a7d2a84807de90af6f31a9d0e7b4"},{"title":"Trump Media launching Truth Social streaming service, where it says creators \"won't be cancelled\"","author":"Aimee Picchi","published_date":"2024-04-16 18:04:14","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-media-djt-stock-down-truth-social-streaming","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"The former president's media company announced plans to air news, religious channels and other content.","summary":"Trump Media & Technology Group on Tuesday announced plans to start a streaming TV platform to air news, film and other content the company claims other media outlets refuse to show.\nThe announcement comes three weeks after Trump Media began trading on the Nasdaq stock market, briefly valuing the company at $10.8 billion. After reaching peaking at $79.38 per share on March 26, the stock \u2014 which trades under the ticker DJT, the initials of former President Donald Trump \u2014 has plunged by almost 70%.\nThe slide continued on Tuesday, with Trump Media shares slipping $3.29, or 12.4%, to $23.32 in early afternoon trading. Its market value now stands at about $3.1 billion.\nTrump Media's primary asset is Truth Social, the social media service that Trump created in 2022 after he was booted from major platforms following the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. From its founding, the company aimed to create what it called a \"media powerhouse\" with multiple platforms, including social media and digital streaming. Until now, however, the company had only introduced Truth Social.\nGoing public has helped bolster the money-losing company's coffers, with Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes telling Fox Business earlier this month that it has \"$200 million in the bank\" to fund its plans.\nKey to building a major media company will be building an audience, which in turn could convince advertisers to open their wallets. Although Trump Media doesn't disclose its user numbers, the service had an estimated 494,000 monthly active users in February, compared with 142 million for Facebook and 75 million for X (formerly known as Twitter), according to web data company Similarweb.\nThat may explain why Trump Media's revenue last year was $4.1 million, or about half the annual sales booked by an average single Chick-fil-A location, while it lost $58 million. Recent advertisers on Truth Social include groups like Patriots for America, a group hawking Trump hats, and USA Gear, selling American flag hoodies.\nTrump Media didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTrump's streaming plans\nTrump Media said its streaming TV platform will first unveil on the Truth Social app before eventually making its way to home TV streaming. The company didn't provide a timeline for the rollout.\n\"There is a lot of great content that simply can't find an audience for unjust reasons, and we want to let these creators know they'll soon have a guaranteed platform where they won't be cancelled [sic],\" Nunes, a former Republican congressman from California, said.\nThe company added that its TV content will include \"news networks, religious channels, family-friendly content including films and documentaries; and other content that has been cancelled, is at risk of cancellation, or is being suppressed on other platforms and services.\"\nTo be sure, conservative-leaning TV networks already exist, including One America News Network (OANN) and Christian Broadcast Network, which produces the 700 Club. And conservative commentator Tucker Carlson debuted his Tucker Carlson Network after parting ways with Fox News last year.\nSliding stock price\nMeanwhile, one of Trump Media's main assets \u2014 its publicly traded stock \u2014 is continuing to lose value. That's noteworthy because one route for a publicly traded company to raise additional capital is through secondary stock sales.

After the storm, there was only one survivor.\n\"I'll admit that a couple of times I just cried,\" said Tom White, a biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who's been working for 30 years to re-establish a wild Puerto Rican parrot population at El Yunque.\nThe parrot is one of the most critically endangered birds in the world, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.\nAbout 60 years ago, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the parrot as an endangered species, a legal status that has resulted in a continuous and challenging effort to rebuild a healthy population of birds in the wild that continues today.\n\"If human beings have caused it, it is basically incumbent upon us to fix it,\" White said.\nThe Puerto Rican parrot is one of the most critically endangered birds in the world, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.\nJose Sanchez / CBS News\nBut the Puerto Rican parrot is also one of the many species whose habitat and survival is threatened by hurricanes, which are becoming more and more destructive due to climate change.\nHurricane Maria killed almost 3,000 people, causing historic floods and landslides. Researchers found Maria's extreme rainfall was 5 times more likely because of climate change.\nBattered by 175 mph wind speeds, White and his wife rode out the storm inside a hurricane shelter with 120 captive, breeding pairs of parrots, protecting them from the storm. Afterwards, they went outside to survey the damage.\n\"We were speechless,\" he said. \"It went from being green and lush to brown and defoliated in a question of hours.\"\nAll the captive birds White had in the hurricane shelter survived the storm. But because of heavy debris, crews could not reach the 56 wild birds that had previously been released and were living in remote areas of the forest.\nWhile some of those wild parrots were killed by hurricane winds, many more died of starvation after the storm, with the island's forests stripped bare of vegetation.\n\"There was nothing for them to eat,\" said Marisel L\u00f3pez Flores, leader of the Parrot Recovery Program.\nBirds in crisis\nAround the world, birds are in crisis \u2014 and not just exotic ones. Over the last 400 years, nine bird species in North America have gone extinct, according to the National Audubon Society. Within this century, the group estimates 314 species are threatened with extinction.\nSome of the largest declines, according to a landmark study from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, are happening in the most common types of birds. The study looked at population decline between 1970 and 2019 and found major losses of:\nWood thrushes, found across the eastern U.S.; 60% of them are gone.\nBaltimore orioles, also an eastern bird; two-fifths have been lost.\nWestern meadowlarks, prevalent in the central and western U.S.; three-fourths have disappeared.\nSome of the major threats to birds come from habitat loss and global temperature rise. But more intense hurricanes also play a role.\nWhile many birds are adapted to survive major storms, they may struggle to overcome damage to their habitats that are needed to nest, forage and roost \u2014 which is what happened to many Puerto Rican parrots.\nWhite explained that protecting the habitats of the parrots can also protect the habitats of thousands of other species.\n\"By doing so, you protect the world for many others at the same time,\" he said.\nGiving the birds a better chance\nSince Hurricane Maria, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is successfully reestablishing a wild population of parrots, now with a new twist.\nBefore the hurricane, the birds were released into remote corners of El Yunque. Now, scientists and staff use behavioral techniques that encourage the birds to stay close to the aviary complex.\nEssentially, this combines wild and captive birds into a single community at the aviary. In future disasters, this may give the birds a better chance of being rescued and fed when the forest is impassable.\nBiologists developed this technique at a sister parrot aviary in Puerto Rico, at Rio Abajo State Forest, where, after Maria, they were able to feed 90 birds and save their lives. The techniques developed in Puerto Rico have since also been successfully used in the release of endangered macaws in Brazil.\nTom White, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologist, said birds survive better with larger flock sizes.\n\"Flocks defend against predators and also to better find food resources,\" White said.\nIn January, the aviary in El Yunque released 22 birds from captivity. Between three aviary locations across Puerto Rico, today there are about 300 parrots living in the wild, a sign that the parrot recovery efforts here are working.\n\"When I'm old and I die, I can say I did something for my country. This is the way I think I'm contributing to my island,\" said L\u00f3pez Flores.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David Schechter,Haley Rush,Grace Manthey,Tracy J.

Brad Little, a Republican, signed a bill into law last year that prohibits gender-affirming medical treatments for transgender minors.","summary":"Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to allow Idaho officials enforce a ban on gender-affirming medical care for nearly all transgender minors statewide, granting a request from state officials to narrow the scope of a lower court's order that blocked the law from taking effect.\nThe court's conservative majority granted the state's request for a stay over the objections of the three liberals, Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. The stay does not apply to the two transgender teenage plaintiffs in the case and the care they are seeking, but blocks the more expansive portions of the lower court's decision.\n\"The district court's order promised to run for the life of this lawsuit, thus preventing Idaho from executing any aspect of its law for years. Meanwhile, the plaintiffs face no harm from the partial stay the State requests,\" Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in an opinion that was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.\nThe Idaho case\nThe legal battle involves Idaho's Vulnerable Child Protection Act, or H.B. 71, which was signed into law by GOP Gov. Brad Little last year. The measure bars health care providers in the state from providing certain medications or surgeries \"for the purpose of attempting to alter the appearance of or affirm the child's perception of the child's sex if that perception is inconsistent with the child's biological sex.\" Among the restricted treatments are puberty blocking-drugs, hormone therapy and surgeries. Violators of the law may face up to 10 years in prison and fines.\nParents to two transgender girls sued the state over the law, arguing it violates the Constitution. The two, identified in court filings by the pseudonyms Pam Poe and Jane Doe, were diagnosed with gender dysphoria and have taken puberty blockers and estrogen therapy. In addition to challenging the constitutionality of the law, the families asked a federal district court to block enforcement of the law while their case proceeds.\nThe district court granted their request in December 2023, finding in part that the law is likely unconstitutional. The lower court also ruled that prohibiting gender-affirming care would have \"serious consequences\" for Pam Poe and Jane Doe, including \"severe psychological distress.\"\n\"Transgender children should receive equal treatment under the law,\" U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill wrote in his decision. \"Parents should have the right to make the most fundamental decisions about how to care for their children.\"\nThe injunction reached statewide, in part because Winmill found that because Pam Poe and Jane Doe used pseudonyms, it would be difficult to provide them relief without compromising their anonymity. The judge also said that if the injunction applied only to the plaintiffs, there would likely be follow-on lawsuits, which would \"create needless and repetitive litigation.\"\nState officials asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit to pause the district court's order or narrow its scope to cover just Pam Poe and Jane Doe, but the request was denied. Idaho then sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court while the 9th Circuit considers the appeal, asking the justices to limit the injunction to apply only to Pam Poe and Jane Doe. The high court agreed in its order on Monday.\nIn their request to the justices, Idaho officials, represented by the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, criticized the scope of the district court's injunction as \"exorbitant\" and said it reached too far by blocking enforcement of the law \"in all circumstances against all parties.\"\nRelief specific to the teenagers involved in the case was \"easy to conceive,\" they said, as an injunction could prohibit enforcement against those who provided Pam Poe and Jane Doe with the treatments they've sought.\n\"Plaintiffs only seek estrogen hormone therapies, yet the district court issued a universal injunction against the law in its entirety, stopping enforcement even in situations where Plaintiffs' experts agree medical intervention is not appropriate,\" Idaho officials wrote. \"Those applications involve the most extreme surgical treatments and the most vulnerable minors, who will lose the protections of Idaho's law and will instead be governed by an injunction obtained by others who do not and cannot speak for them.\"\nThey went on to claim that the \"overbroad\" injunction would allow doctors to experiment on minors with \"dangerous\" surgeries, such as mastectomies for patients with gender dysphoria.\nBut the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the family, warned the Supreme Court that allowing the state to enforce the law would cause severe harm to Pam Poe and Jane Doe.\nGranting the request from Idaho officials would jeopardize \"their ability to continue receiving the medical care that they, their parents, and their doctors all agree is medically necessary for their health and well-being\" and require them to \"give up their anonymity as transgender plaintiffs in this case to try to access that care,\" ACLU lawyers wrote in a filing.\nThey also noted that because the law imposes criminal penalties on doctors and pharmacists who provide gender-affirming care to minors, harm to Pam Poe and Jane Doe cannot be remedied without an injunction shielding health care providers from prosecution so they can continue treating them.\nAdditionally, because Pam Poe and Jane Doe are receiving ongoing medicare care, Idaho's ban would disrupt that treatment, and a narrowed injunction would jeopardize their access to care.\n\"The preliminary injunction maintains the status quo \u2014 that the decision about whether to pursue gender-affirming medical care for adolescents with gender dysphoria is made by their parents, in consultation with the children's doctor,\" the ACLU lawyers wrote. \"With the advice of their doctors, parents weigh the risks and benefits of treatment just as they do for other medical decisions.\"\nMore than 20 states have imposed bans on gender-affirming medical care for minors, though laws in some states have been blocked by courts, according to the Human Rights Campaign.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Melissa Quinn,Daily Signal,Federal Courts.","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/03/05/acdbb20c-bfba-4351-a49d-be5cbf2f1a12/thumbnail/1200x630g2/75de69c575b56d1d46b00ed1240bb6ae/gettyimages-2049056964.jpg?v=6450b1292090ace5f47bbb23ced2a4e3","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSPolitics","_score":5.0600877,"_id":"f1e8f4d1a08c1c0db9baeb659bfb34d8"},{"title":"Uri Berliner, NPR editor who criticized the network of liberal bias, says he's resigning","author":"Aimee Picchi","published_date":"2024-04-17 16:21:22","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/npr-uri-berliner-editor-liberal-bias-resigns","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"NPR had suspended Berliner after he claimed in an essay that the network had \"lost America's trust\" pushing progressive views.","summary":"Study examines partisan bias and ability to distinguish fact from opinion\nStudy examines partisan bias and ability to distinguish fact from opinion\nStudy examines partisan bias and ability to distinguish fact from opinion\n05:23\nUri Berliner, a senior editor at National Public Radio who had been suspended from his job after claiming the network had \"lost America's trust\" by pushing progressive views while suppressing dissenting opinions, said he is resigning from the broadcaster.\n\"I am resigning from NPR, a great American institution where I have worked for 25 years,\" Berliner wrote in his resignation letter to NPR CEO Katherine Maher, and which he posted in part on X, the former Twitter. \"I cannot work in a newsroom where I am disparaged by a new CEO whose divisive views confirm the very problems at NPR I cite in my Free Press essay.\"\nMy resignation letter to NPR CEO @krmaher pic.twitter.com/0hafVbcZAK\n\u2014 Uri Berliner (@uberliner) April 17, 2024\nBerliner's resignation comes eight days after he published an essay in the Free Press that caused a firestorm of debate with his allegations that NPR was suppressing dissenting voices.

They all play vital roles in each other, their ecosystems, and the planet's overall health and they make up what is known as biological diversity.\nBut what exactly is biodiversity? It's a shortened version of two scientific terms \u2013 biological diversity. Essentially, all it means is having a variety of living things. There are three main levels of biodiversity scientists typically refer to, according to the Smithsonian, including species, genetic and ecosystem diversity. Under these categories, researchers are looking to identify how many and what kind of species are around, what the genetic makeup of those individual species are and passing down to generations and what species populations are in various environments, such as waterways and forests.\n\"These levels cannot be separated,\" the Smithsonian says. \"Each is important, interacting with and influencing others. Changes at one changes at other levels.\"\nWhy is biodiversity important?\nA species' ability to thrive isn't only essential for its survival, but in many cases, for the survival of others as well. One of the clearest examples of this is bumblebees. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there are 49 species of bumblebees across the U.S., and they all will go flower-to-flower, picking up nectar and pollen as they go. Not only does that help feed individual bees, but the transporting of the nectar and pollen also helps plant species thrive.\nHowever, studies have found that climate change is threatening their survival, with researchers finding the likelihood of a bumblebee population surviving has declined by an average of 30% within a single generation of humans.\nHoneybees also serve a vital role in biodiversity. The USDA says they pollinate $15 billion worth of crops every year, helping support life for more than 130 agricultural products. The honey they produce, which humans have grown to love and enjoy, is also worth millions.\nWhat is biodiversity loss?\nAs important as biodiversity is, it's come under significant threat. In 2019, a United Nations report found that roughly 1 million plant and animal species could be threatened with extinction, while a newer report found an even more dire state \u2013 up to 6 million species extinct over the next 50 years.\n\"Major direct threats to biodiversity include habitat loss and fragmentation, unsustainable resource use, invasive species, pollution, and global climate change,\" the American Museum of Natural History says. \"The underlying causes of biodiversity loss, such as a growing human population and overconsumption are often complex and stem from many interrelated factors.\"\nHow many species are there?\nScientists estimate that there are roughly 8.7 million species of plants, animals, fungi, and other organisms on Earth, including roughly 2.2 million species that live in the world's oceans. But even that number is low for the true amount of life on the planet.\n\"In spite of 250 years of taxonomic classification and over 1.2 million species already catalogued in a central database, our results suggest that some 86% of existing species on Earth and 91% of species in the ocean still await description,\" researchers said in a 2011 study. \"Renewed interest in further exploration and taxonomy is required if this significant gap in our knowledge of life on Earth is to be closed.\"\nBut new species are constantly being discovered. In 2023, scientists at London's Natural History Museum say they've uncovered 815 new species, from geckos to algae to swamp eels. And that's just one group of scientists.\nThousands of other species have been discovered since Earth Day 2023, including more than 5,500 species in a single area, the Clarion-Clipperton Zone between Hawaii and Mexico. Researchers have also found new species of hedgehogs, a deepwater catshark, an \"electrical\" blue tarantula, and a deep-sea octopus.\n\"The bad news, however, is that biodiversity is declining,\" says the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUNC) Red List, the world's most comprehensive list of species conservation status.\nThe Red List holds more than 157,100 species, including 44,000 the group says are threatened with extinction \u2013 more than a quarter of all the species the IUCN has assessed.\nHow to help and protect biodiversity\nEven though species decline continues to be a serious ongoing issue, there are things that everyone can do to help what's happening in their own backyard.\nIf you have a garden, for example, opting for native plants and wildflowers can be a huge boost for the local ecosystem. Native plants, which are those that grow naturally in a region, are vital to an area's biological web, help reduce the amount of needed fertilizers and pesticides and provide ample pollinating opportunities. According to the National Audobon Society, they also require less water to maintain and can help store greenhouse gases, which are a key driver of climate change when they are in the atmosphere.\nIf you enjoy hiking or spending time outdoors, it's also key to respect nature. Sticking to walking paths and trails isn't just for your safety but for that of the species around you. Constantly disrupting habitats or walking on plant life can tarnish an ecosystem.\nReducing and reusing materials is also key, as landfills and pollution can be detrimental to life on Earth, especially marine life. Consider buying items second-hand and instead of throwing away old clothes or things around the house, find a way to repurpose them, sell them or donate them.\nEssentially, it's all about taking care of the home outside of your home.\n\"It is within our power to change our actions to help ensure the survival of species and the health and integrity of ecological systems,\" the American Museum of Natural History says. \"...While we might not be able to prevent all negative human impacts on biodiversity, with knowledge we can work to change the direction and shape of our effects on the rest of life on Earth.\"","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Li Cohen,Trending Content Writer","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/21/a6eef727-a0b7-4a8f-b104-77e1f8a502df/thumbnail/1200x630/9064889fd1879f2a01d6355a5f083aaf/gettyimages-1334442670.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSNews","_score":4.938684,"_id":"f59c4111f3052ba5a871c9a3479fc618"},{"title":"North America's largest swing set is here in Philadelphia","author":"Jan Carabeo","published_date":"2024-04-19 15:13:12","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/swings-anna-verna-playground-fdr-park","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"The swing set at Anna Verna Playground in FDR Park is the largest in North America.

Sure. But the point is, he's gotten a lot done. I think people admire him. They genuinely like him.\"\nThe Louisiana Republican has faced pushback in recent weeks for his handling of the government funding process, prompting Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, to file a motion to vacate, threatening to bring up a vote for his ouster. That frustration was bolstered by his shepherding of a foreign aid package that the House approved on Saturday, which some conservatives also opposed. And though Greene has yet to commit to a timeline for bringing up a vote on Johnson's removal, she's gained some backers in recent days.\nThe effort to oust Johnson now has three public Republican supporters: Greene, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona, who announced his support for the effort on Friday.

Despite their importance, oceans are increasingly threatened by global warming and human activity, with rising temperatures impacting fragile marine ecosystems.\nMore than 100 nations, including the United States, have agreed to protect 30% of the world's oceans by 2030, through an initiative known as \"30 by 30.\" This goal involves establishing Marine Protected Areas, or MPAs, where human activities are limited or prohibited to preserve marine life.\nIn the Bahamas, all waters are considered a shark sanctuary. On top of that, the island nation has also designated many Marine Protected Areas, all thought to be aiding the recovery of shark populations, which are critical to coral reef health.\nMany of these areas are part of an ongoing global shark census called FinPrint. In 2018, that study revealed a 63% decline in the five main species of reef sharks, with overfishing and the shark meat industry partly to blame.\nCandace Fields works with FinPrint and is using innovative technology to collect new data to see if these protected areas help reef shark populations rebound.\n\"These MPAs might be the way to kind of help these sharks come back from the brink a little bit,\" she said.\nThere are more than 18,000 MPAs covering about 8% of the ocean's surface, according to United Nations data. However, conservation groups claim most are just lines on a map because about two-thirds of them have little to no enforcement.\nThe Bahamas has strictly enforced no-fishing zones and actively patrols its waters with the Royal Bahamas Defence Force. During the patrols, officials ensure compliance with local laws, deterring illegal fishing activities, especially from foreign vessels. Their rigorous approach is supported by advanced technology, including artificial intelligence and vessel tracking.\n\"We are there 24/7 and if you come we're gonna catch you,\" said Senior Commander William Sturrup, who oversees many of the operations.\n\"We are there on the front lines as a military. That's how important it is to our government to protect our marine resources,\" he said.\nTechnology plays a significant role in these efforts, according to Gregg Casad of WildAid, who illustrated the advanced tools used to monitor and protect the ocean.\n\"This is a big chunk of ocean, right? So we're using this technology to help focus those patrol efforts,\" said Casad.\nAs the world grapples with the warming climate, oceans play a critical role in regulating Earth's temperature by absorbing 90% of the excess heat generated by climate change. Their protection is not only essential for marine biodiversity, but also for mitigating broader environmental impacts.\n\"There's just tons and tons of reasons that we should work towards keeping the oceans as healthy as possible,\" said Fields.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Cbs Sunday Morning.,Ben Tracy,Analisa Novak,Cbs Mornings,Including The","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/22/387766ec-d0a3-4b92-b592-0898ce723710/thumbnail/1200x630/150dc0d9c790fab0615f9c07ba5dd864/0422-cmo-bahamasmarineprotection-tracy-east-2853761-640x360.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@https://twitter.com/benstracy","_score":4.6130176,"_id":"b6ffbb6794036fcab13dc5161056179f"},{"title":"Climate change is putting gray whales on the brink of possible extinction","author":"Marina Jurica","published_date":"2024-04-19 04:12:51","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/climate-change-is-putting-gray-whales-on-the-brink-of-possible-extinction","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Gray whales migrate more than 10,000 miles a year, swimming from the chilly waters of the Arctic to their warm breeding rounds in Baja California.

Gray whales have started migrating later and are often malnourished, causing them to sometimes give birth in unprotected areas further north than Baja California.\nWith an increasing lack of prey in their usual hunting grounds, orcas \u2014 or killer whales \u2014 are now showing up off the Southern California coastline, intersecting with the gray whales and their calves with deadly results.\n\"There's not a lot of things big enough to take down a gray whale, and orcas are one of them that have figured it out,\" Deming said.\nExperts are working to study and understand how warming ocean temperatures are impacting the movements of animals, and they believe that migration pattern changes for orcas and grey whales is just the beginning.\n\"Our environment is so connected, and the ecosystem really has these kind of butterfly effects where one little thing happens, and that can really result in significant impacts down the road,\" Deming said.\nOver the last 50 years, oceans have absorbed about 90% of the Earth's increased heat energy and experts say recent years have had an even larger toll. Prolonged periods of unusually high temperatures, also known as marine heatwaves, have occurred across the globe, creating devastating effects on the marine ecosystem.\n\"It's normal for environments to change, but when the change happens quickly, it doesn't give that opportunity for animals to react and change their behavior,\" said Deming.\nClimatologists say that time is of the essence as climate change restructures the delicate equilibrium for all living organisms on Earth.\n\"Education is really the key for turning this around ... this is a collective effort,\" said Kirsten Donald, VP of Education and Ocean Advocacy at the Pacific Marine Mammal Center. \"We all have to be a part of the solution. Climate change is one of the number one problems facing us today and that is going to impact ourselves as well.\"\nEnvironmentalists suggest that making simple changes can help make a big difference.

The new cups, announced ahead of Earth Day, are made with up to 20% less plastic and will require less water to make, but come amid a new report that found plastic production continues to pose a major problem, producing more emissions than even the aviation industry.\nThe company's Seattle-based innovation lab developed the new cups, which will be used for cold drink purchases. The cups will require 10% to 20% less plastic to make, depending on the size, when compared to previous cold drink cups.\n\"They're not only made with less plastic than previous cold cups, they are also projected to reduce emissions and conserve water in the production process,\" the company said in its announcement. \"... And they cost less to make.\"\nThese are the first single-use cups designed in the innovation lab to specifically be more sustainable. It was done in an effort to meet the company's goal of slashing its carbon, water and waste footprints in half within the next six years. The company says it estimates redesign will help reduce emissions the equivalent of 5,200 cars and will save roughly 2,800 Olympic-sized swimming pools of water. They will also take 13.5 million pounds of plastic out of landfills annually, the company said.\nThe cups are also made to be more accessible to those who are visually impaired. Starbucks said they feature raised dots to help differentiate the sizes and that the printed fill lines on the cups that indicate measurements were made black and white to allow for better contrast.\nMinimizing plastic usage is essential in addressing the climate crisis, researchers say. A new report from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory details that researchers found plastic production emits as much carbon pollution as 600 coal-fired plants every year and accounts for roughly 12% of the global oil demand.\nIn 2019, global plastic production generated 2.24 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, far more than the 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions generated by the aviation industry that same year, according to the report.\nAnd those emissions could triple by 2050, researchers said, even as experts continue to warn that minimizing emissions is essential to reduce global warming. Greenhouse gases are what work to trap heat in the atmosphere, increasing global temperatures that then fuel extreme weather conditions, sea level rise and more.\n\"Even in scenarios where global power grids are decarbonized, this could increase the plastic industry's share of the global carbon budget from a little more than 5% today to more than 20%, assuming even the most modest estimates for industry growth,\" a press release from the lab says. \"Industry analysts expect plastic production to at least double by 2050.\"\nHeather McTeer Toney, executive director of Beyond Petrochemicals, said in a statement that the continued growth of the plastics industry \"is undermining the world's efforts to address climate change.\"\n\"Plastic pollution has become an increasing threat to natural ecosystems, human health and climate,\" an executive summary of the report says. \"... Alternative materials used also need to be recyclable in a sustainable and climate-friendly manner.

Mary Gay Scanlon, Colorado Rep. Joe Neguse and New Mexico Rep. Teresa Leger Fern\u00e1ndez.\nThe conservative Republican hardliners on the committee \u2014 Reps. Tom Massie of Kentucky, Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Chip Roy of Texas \u2014 all voted against the rule, because border security was not being paired with foreign aid. However, the speaker is putting what he said is an \"aggressive\" border bill to a vote Friday morning. It failed to pass out of the Rules Committee, but the House will consider it under a suspension of the rule, which means it will require two-thirds support to pass.\nThe House is expected to vote on final passage of the foreign aid package this weekend.\nThe three foreign aid bills would provide $26.4 billion to support Israel, $60.8 billion to bolster Ukraine and $8.1 billion to counter China in the Indo-Pacific, including billions for Taiwan. The Israel bill also includes more than $9.1 billion to address humanitarian needs, which Democrats said was necessary for their support.\nA fourth bill is geared toward addressing other GOP foreign policy priorities. In particular, it would allow the sale of frozen assets of Russian oligarchs and potentially force the sale of TikTok and authorize stricter sanctions on Russia, China and Iran.\nPresident Biden said he would sign the package into law and has called on the House to pass it this week and the Senate to quickly follow. Both chambers are scheduled to be in recess next week.\nJohnson, a Louisiana Republican, announced the proposal on Monday amid mounting pressure from members in both parties to hold a vote on a bipartisan Senate package that includes support for the U.S. allies. The $95 billion supplemental funding package that passed the Senate in February has stagnated for months in the House as Johnson has debated a path forward.\nForeign aid has sown deep divisions among House Republicans \u2014 some on the far right have threatened to oust Johnson from the speakership over additional funding to Ukraine, which they oppose.\nJohnson defended his decision Wednesday and said providing Ukraine with lethal aid was \"critically important.\"\n\"If I operated out of fear over a motion to vacate, I would never be able to do my job,\" Johnson told reporters.\n\"Look, history judges us for what we do,\" he said, adding, \"This is a critical time right now critical time on the world stage.

The controversial Tobacco and Vapes Bill is now one step closer to becoming law after clearing its first hurdle in parliament.\nThe bill would make it illegal to sell tobacco to anyone born after January 1, 2009, with the legal age for the purchase of tobacco products increasing by one year every year until it eventually covers the entire population.\nBackers of the legislation, including Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who has made it a key policy of his government, say the aim is to create the U.K.'s \"first smoke-free generation.\"\nIf enacted, it would be one of the toughest national anti-smoking measures in the world.\nUnder current law, it is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to buy tobacco products in the U.K., but under the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, children who are turning 15 this year, or anyone younger, would never be able to legally buy tobacco in Britain.\nThe proposed legislation would not criminalize smoking, but rather the sale of tobacco depending on a customer's age, and it would ensure that anyone who's currently allowed to buy tobacco products will never be prevented from doing so.\nBut despite praise from some health experts and the broad backing of parliament, the bill has generated controversy \u2014 even sparked rebellion \u2014 within Sunak's own Conservative Party.\nThe legislation was debated Tuesday in the House of Commons, where some more libertarian-minded Members of Parliament argued that it would limit personal freedoms and branded it \"unconservative.\"\nThe legislation was debated Tuesday in the House of Commons, where some more libertarian-minded Members of Parliament argued that it would limit personal freedoms and branded it \"unconservative.\"\nLiz Truss, who served very briefly as U.K. prime minister in 2022, called the proposal a \"virtue-signaling piece of legislation about protecting adults from themselves in the future.\"\nAnother former Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, said it was \"mad\" that the party of Winston Churchill, Britain's famously cigar-loving World War II leader, was considering \"banning cigars.\"\nAnother former Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, said it was \"mad\" that the party of Winston Churchill, Britain's famously cigar-loving World War II leader, was considering \"banning cigars.\"\nConservative Member of Parliament Simon Clarke told CBS News partner network BBC News that the ban would be counterproductive.\n\"I think it actually risks making smoking cooler,\" he said. \"It certainly risks creating a black market, and it also risks creating an unmanageable challenge for the authorities.\"\nWhile the number of people who smoke in Britain has been falling for years, the Action on Smoking and Health campaign group says it remains the primary cause of preventable illness and premature death in England, accounting for approximately 74,600 deaths every year.\nThe proposed bill would also attempt to reduce the number of young people taking up vaping. It would ban the sale of the inexpensive, disposable vapes often seen in the hands of minors, and restrict the variety of vape flavors available in a bid to reduce uptake by children.\nA similar smoking ban was proposed by New Zealand's former Prime Minister Jacinda Arden, but it was scrapped earlier this year by the country's new coalition government.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Duarte Dias","media":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/07/12/5211e9db-84e8-4c8a-b99e-2010ab8ca44d/thumbnail/1200x630/8748886ea860319cde5cc3e15a103e50/gettyimages-960895000-1.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSNews","_score":4.5886517,"_id":"18c73371b5f426ff9e75978c6773f6b6"},{"title":"Newsom launches Alabama ad campaign focused on abortion travel bans","author":"Dave Pehling","published_date":"2024-04-22 19:49:33","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/newsom-launches-alabama-ad-campaign-focused-on-abortion-travel-bans","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Governor Gavin Newsom is taking aim at states considering abortion travel bans with the launch of a new ad campaign.","summary":"Governor Gavin Newsom is taking aim at states considering abortion travel bans by launching a new ad campaign.\nNewsom's Campaign for Democracy ad is set to air in Alabama starting Monday.

He also signed more than a dozen new abortion laws protecting women's reproductive rights and ordered the state to end its contract with Walgreens after the pharmacy giant indicated it would not sell an abortion pill by mail in some conservative-led states.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Producer,Dave Pehling,Editor","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/22/f266de7f-1df6-48af-a0e0-e5e786ebab77/thumbnail/1200x630/1e3d9e0f26cb4789b58b58ccdf927b55/abortion-travel-ad.jpg?v=57e8fa9efcf044a821348136ff26ed69","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@KPIXTV","_score":4.578508,"_id":"cad5d8b5194cd5b6890cd7e6873d55a5"},{"title":"Melania Trump is set to make a return to her husband's campaign with a rare political appearance","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-20 16:00:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/melania-trump-long-absent-from-campaign-will-appear-at-a-log-cabin-republicans-event-in-mar-a-lago","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Former first lady Melania Trump is making a return to her husband's presidential campaign with a rare political appearance after months of being absent from Donald Trump's latest run for the White\u2026","summary":"Former first lady Melania Trump is making a return to her husband's presidential campaign with a rare political appearance after months of being absent from Donald Trump's latest run for the White House.\nShe plans to attend a fundraiser Saturday for the Log Cabin Republicans, an advocacy group for LGBTQ+ members of the GOP. The event at the Palm Beach, Florida, estate that she shares with the former president is scheduled to take place behind closed doors. It will be the first major political event for her this year.\nMelania Trump had for months not appeared at her husband's campaign events, notably being absent at his victory party on Super Tuesday. Her attendance at the fundraiser \u2014 for a group she has previously supported \u2014 could be a sign that she will ramp up her schedule with several months left before the November election.\nBoth Trumps went together to cast their ballots in the Florida primary last month. When a reporter asked if she would return to the campaign trail, she responded with a smile, \"Stay tuned.\"\nThe former first lady then attended a high-profile fundraiser at hedge-fund billionaire John Paulson's house in Palm Beach, where she was photographed with her husband in front of the mansion facing the ocean.\nThe Log Cabin Republicans group describes itself on its website as the county's \"largest organization representing LGBT conservatives and straight allies who support fairness, freedom, and equality for all Americans.\" Melania Trump was a special guest and award recipient of the organization's Spirit of Lincoln award in 2021 at a dinner hosted at Mar-a-Lago.\nThe Log Cabin Republicans on Friday posted on X thanking Melania Trump for her message in a Fox News Digital interview.\n\"We must unite in our effort to establish a society where equality is the everyday experience of every American,\" Melania Trump said in the interview.\nIn a 2020 endorsement of the former president for his reelection bid, the Log Cabin Republicans described Trump as having a \"commitment to govern from a place of inclusion.\" In this endorsement, the group praised Trump for his \"commitment to end the spread of HIV/AIDS\" and his initiative to \"end the criminalization of homosexuality internationally.\"\nYet critics often criticize Trump's record on LGBTQ+ issues. During his presidency, he nominated judges for the U.S. Supreme Court, including Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, who were criticized by liberal advocates for LGBTQ+ people.\nTrump also faced national criticism in 2017 when he announced transgender people were barred from military service, when about 15,000 transgender people were enlisted at the time. In 2019, he barred U.S. embassies from displaying the rainbow or pride flag during Pride Month.\nThroughout his campaign, Trump has repeatedly mocked transgender people using language of gender identity that LGBTQ+ critics call harmful. He has acted out a young athlete struggling to lift heavy barbells compared with other competitors \"who transitioned.\"\nIn campaign speeches he has touted his promise to cut federal funding on schools pushing what he calls \"transgender insanity.\"\nSome additional promises Trump has made in his rallies include prohibiting federal money going to hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to minors, or ending any program that promotes sex or gender transition. He has also promised that he'd push Congress to ban chemical or surgical interventions on minors.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/07/28469bef-4ff1-482d-98f7-f06dc84a1287/thumbnail/1200x630/650c7134dd7eced043b5539fab8ea6e5/ap-20342573995693.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSMiami","_score":4.4952927,"_id":"2af8d4be67f60e5299f10f49d8ac6dca"},{"title":"Mike Johnson faces growing pressure over Israel, Ukraine aid: \"A Churchill or Chamberlain moment\"","author":"Caitlin Yilek","published_date":"2024-04-15 19:46:28","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-johnson-israel-ukraine-aid-house-vote","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Iran's attack on Israel has renewed urgency in getting a Senate-passed bill through the House. But the bill also threatens Johnson's speakership.","summary":"Washington \u2014 Iran's large-scale attack on Israel has turned up the pressure on House Speaker Mike Johnson to hold a vote soon on a foreign aid package that also includes funding for Ukraine and Taiwan.\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Monday criticized Johnson for failing to bring up a $95 billion package for a vote after it was approved by the Senate months ago, in February. Since then, it has languished in the House amid fractures among Republicans over aid to Ukraine.\n\"The gravely serious events of this past weekend in the Middle East and Eastern Europe underscore the need for Congress to act immediately,\" the New York Democrat wrote in a dear colleague letter on Monday. \"We must take up the bipartisan and comprehensive national security bill passed by the Senate forthwith.\"\nJeffries added that \"this is a Churchill or Chamberlain moment,\" referring to the British prime ministers during World War II. Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister from 1937-1940, is best known for the policy of appeasement that failed to stop Adolf Hitler from starting the war.\nHouse Democratic Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts also called on Johnson to hold an immediate vote on the Senate bill. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, have also pushed for a House vote on the bill.\nJohnson, a Louisiana Republican, told Fox News on Sunday that the House would \"try again this week\" to pass wartime aid for Israel in response to Iran's drone-and-missile attack over the weekend that was in retaliation for a strike on an Iranian consulate in Syria earlier this month. But it's unclear whether that will ultimately include aid for Ukraine and Taiwan.\n\"The details of that package are being put together now. We're looking at the options and all the supplemental issues,\" Johnson said.\nFor months, the speaker has faced pressure from defense hawks in both parties to pass the foreign aid legislation to deliver on the U.S. promise to continue to assist Ukraine in its war against Russia amid repeated warnings that Kyiv is running out of ammunition. Johnson has instead considered other ways of delivering the funding, including through a loan, but has yet to unveil a plan.\nThe attack on Israel has renewed urgency in getting the Senate bill over the finish line in the House, but it also threatens Johnson's leadership role as he faces pushback from the right wing of his party, who oppose sending any more aid to Ukraine. If Johnson tries to pass a standalone bill on Israel, he is likely to lose Democratic votes.\nThe conservative House Freedom Caucus warned Johnson against using the situation in Israel to pass Ukraine aid.\n\"The House Freedom Caucus stands unequivocally with Israel. Congress should provide aid to Israel,\" the group said in a statement. \"Under no circumstances will the House Freedom Caucus abide using the emergency situation in Israel as a bogus justification to ram through Ukraine aid with no offset and no security for our own wide-open borders.\"\nWhite House spokesman John Kirby said the White House opposes a standalone Israel bill.\n\"You got two good friends here \u2014 Israel and Ukraine \u2014 very different fights to be sure, but active fights for their sovereignty and for their safety and security,\" Kirby told reporters during the daily press briefing. \"And time is not on anyone's side here in either case, so they need to move quickly on this, and the best way to get that aid into the hands of the IDF and into the hands of the Ukrainian soldiers is to pass that bipartisan bill that the Senate passed.\"\nNikole Killion and Kaia Hubbard contributed reporting.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":",The Hill,Was A Member,D.C.

A formal rebuke from NPR said Berliner had violated its policy of securing prior approval to write for other news outlets, and warned that he would be fired if he breached those guidelines in future, Folkenflik reported.\nNPR declined to comment to CBS News. \"NPR does not comment on individual personnel matters, including discipline,\" a spokesperson said.\nBerliner's essay in the Free Press caused a firestorm of debate, with some conservatives, including former President Donald Trump, calling on the government to \"defund\" the organization. Some of Berliner's NPR colleagues also took issue with the essay, with \"Morning Edition\" host Steve Inskeep writing on his Substack that the article was \"filled with errors and omissions.\"\n\"The errors do make NPR look bad, because it's embarrassing that an NPR journalist would make so many,\" Inskeep wrote.\nIn the essay, Berliner wrote that NPR has always had a liberal bent, but that for most of his 25 year tenure it had retained an open-minded, curious culture. \"In recent years, however, that has changed,\" he wrote. \"Today, those who listen to NPR or read its coverage online find something different: the distilled worldview of a very small segment of the U.S. population.\"\nBerliner added, \"[W]hat's notable is the extent to which people at every level of NPR have comfortably coalesced around the progressive worldview. The \"absence of viewpoint diversity\" is \"is the most damaging development at NPR,\" he wrote.\nAfter the essay's publication, NPR's top editor, Edith Chapin, said she strongly disagrees with Berliner's conclusions and is proud to stand behind NPR's work.\nCOVID coverage, DEI initiatives\nBerliner criticized coverage of major events at NPR, singling out its reporting on COVID and Hunter Biden as problematic. With the first topic, he wrote that the network didn't cover a theory that COVID-19 had been created in a Chinese lab, a theory he claimed NPR staffers \"dismissed as racist or a right-wing conspiracy.\"\nHe also took NPR for task for what he said was failing to report developments related to Hunter Biden's laptop. \"With the election only weeks away, NPR turned a blind eye,\" Berliner wrote.\nBerliner also criticized NPR for its internal management, citing what he claims is a growing focus on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI.\n\"Race and identity became paramount in nearly every aspect of the workplace,\" Berliner wrote. \"A growing DEI staff offered regular meetings imploring us to 'start talking about race'.\"\nInskeep said Berliner's essay left out the context that many other news organizations didn't report on Hunter Biden's laptop over questions about its authenticity. He also disputed Berliner's characterization that NPR editors and reporters don't debate story ideas.\n\"The story is written in a way that is probably satisfying to the people who already believe it, and unpersuasive to anyone else \u2014 a mirror image of his critique of NPR,\" Inskeep wrote.\n\u2014With reporting by the Associated Press.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Where She Covers Business,Consumer Reports.,Alain Sherter,Has Written,Aimee Picchi","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2021/05/01/c9f34cd8-88d1-44c8-81c1-43737e5a6ac8/thumbnail/1200x630/6c6e87fa12dbb31fa0d4a98d8afc3be0/npr-sign-1920.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@@aimeepicchi","_score":4.474939,"_id":"acc66b674dbcc55c62ac8f28a7a5b6d0"},{"title":"CBS News poll finds big majority of Americans support U.S. taking steps to reduce climate change","author":"Jennifer De Pinto","published_date":"2024-04-21 13:00:18","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-reduce-climate-change-extreme-weather-04-21-2024","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"People who have experienced extreme weather are especially likely to say climate change needs to be addressed right away.","summary":"Record heat, hurricanes, wildfires all have been making news in recent years. And while not everyone agrees events like these are the direct result of climate change, they do connect to peoples' opinions about it: a big majority of Americans feel the U.S. needs to address climate change, with those who report experiencing extreme weather more likely to say we should do so right now.\nViews on climate change have long been associated with partisanship, and they still are, but age is a factor, too. Younger Americans, including younger Republicans, are even more likely to say the U.S. needs to take steps to at least try to slow it.\nThere's a sense of urgency from many in the public, too. A large majority think it needs to be addressed at least in the next few years, including half who think it needs to be addressed right now.\nThere's the sense that we should address climate change, and there's also some belief that we can.\nThat extends down to the personal level, too. Most Americans believe humans can do something to at least slow the effects of climate change, and those who think so feel they personally have a responsibility to do something about it.\nExtreme weather and climate change\nPeople who report having experienced extreme weather in their area in recent years \u2014 which is half the country \u2014 are more inclined than those who haven't to believe climate change is a major factor contributing to extreme weather, and more of them see the issue as one that needs to be addressed right away.\nAnd even if people don't experience the extreme weather themselves, such events can spark concern. When people hear about the earth experiencing the warmest temperatures on record, more than half say it makes them more concerned about climate change. Those who don't see climate change as a factor in extreme weather are less persuaded by this, including some who don't believe that the earth's temperature is rising.\nYounger people and the political divides on climate change\nMajorities across all age groups favor the U.S. taking steps to address climate change, but it's people under age 45 \u2014 many who say they were taught about climate change in school \u2014 who are especially likely to be in support of the country taking action.\nThere have long been political divisions on addressing climate change, with Democrats expressing more concern than Republicans. These continue today, to some extent. Democrats are more than twice as likely as Republicans to say climate change needs to be addressed right now. And Democrats overwhelmingly support the U.S. taking steps to reduce climate change, but Republicans are divided on that.\nDivisions in the GOP on climate?\nThe divides within the rank and file GOP we see are along age and ideological lines. Most younger Republicans \u2014 those under age 45 \u2014 support the U.S. taking steps slow or stop climate change, while most older Republicans do not\nMore moderate Republicans also see climate change as more pressing than those who are more conservative.\nAnd like the public overall, Republicans who report having experienced extreme weather in their local area are more likely to think climate change needs to be addressed.\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,230 U.S. adult residents interviewed between April 16-19, 2024. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as past vote.

He takes over for Mark Jefferson, who left in February to serve as executive director of the Tavern League of Wisconsin.\nIverson, a graduate of Wisconsin Lutheran College, most recently worked as regional political director for the Republican National Committee. He previously worked on campaigns in Wisconsin for U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil. In 2020, Iverson was the state director for Trump Victory, a joint operation of the Trump campaign and the RNC.\nIt was in that role following Trump's narrow loss in Wisconsin in 2020 that Iverson told other operatives two days after the election to support claims that Trump had actually won. His comments came as Trump's campaign was suing in other battleground states and preparing to request a recount of the two largest Democratic counties in Wisconsin.\nBiden defeated Trump by nearly 21,000 votes in Wisconsin in 2020, a result that has withstood independent and partisan audits and reviews, as well as lawsuits and the recounts Trump requested.\n\"Here's the drill: Comms is going to continue to fan the flame and get the word out about Democrats trying to steal this election. We'll do whatever they need (inaudible) help with. Just be on standby in case there's any stunts we need to pull,\" Iverson said in the recording of a meeting two days after the November election that was obtained by The Associated Press.\nWisconsin was a big part of Trump's victory in 2016, when he smashed through the Democrats' \"Blue Wall\" in the Upper Midwest, and his campaign fought hard to keep the swing state in his column four years later before his loss to Biden. Wisconsin is one of a few battleground states this year that could go either way in the rematch between Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\"At the end of the day, this operation received more votes than any other Republican in Wisconsin history,\" Iverson said in the 2020 recording. \"Say what you want, our operation turned out Republican or DJT supporters. Democrats just got 20,000 more than us, out of Dane County and other shenanigans in Milwaukee, Green Bay and Dane. There's a lot that people can learn from this campaign.\"\nIverson's comments came after Trump sued in other states and before be brought a case in Wisconsin seeking to overturn his loss. The Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected that case in December 2020.\n\"My earnest assessment of each party's performance in the 2020 election was unfortunately misconstrued due to both a poor choice of words on my part\" and a lack of context, Iverson said in a statement Monday. He said that his comments should be viewed in light of the fact that they \"came two days after the election and before any recount had begun in Wisconsin.\"\nWisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming said in a statement that he was \"thrilled\" with the hiring of Iverson.\n\"His wide breadth of experience and ability will prove crucial for us winning in November,\" Schimming said in a statement. \"Wisconsin will decide the 2024 race. Andrew Iverson is the right man for the job in this pivotal election.\"\nIn addition to the presidential race, Wisconsin has a high-profile U.S. Senate race pitting Democratic incumbent Sen. Tammy Baldwin against Republican businessman Eric Hovde.\n\"Wisconsin is the cornerstone of the Republican Party's chances this November,\" Iverson said in a statement. \"I am eager to get to work on behalf of all of our candidates to take back the White House and usher in a new era of conservative leadership.\"","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/15/f968e248-8703-423a-a706-3eabbef012b9/thumbnail/1200x630g2/ecf61095bb783b67b4e3a68f1f92a98c/gettyimages-2112642645.jpg?v=6450b1292090ace5f47bbb23ced2a4e3","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@wcco","_score":4.3682046,"_id":"9ff6069e4cbd225bbcb2b42eed046523"},{"title":"House approves aid bills for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan","author":"Caitlin Yilek","published_date":"2024-04-20 11:21:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/house-vote-aid-bill-ukraine-israel-taiwan","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"The foreign aid bills' passage marked a pivotal moment for House Speaker Mike Johnson.","summary":"House votes set for foreign aid, TikTok\nHouse votes set for foreign aid, TikTok\nHouse votes set for foreign aid bills, TikTok forced sale\n03:49\nWashington \u2014 The House approved a $95 billion foreign aid package Saturday, in a pivotal moment for House Speaker Mike Johnson as he tries to stave off a right-wing rebellion.\nThe package consists of four bills that were voted on separately and will be combined into one before being sent to the Senate.\nThe first three bills include $60.8 billion to help Ukraine in its war with Russia; $26.4 billion to support Israel, which is fighting Hamas and Iran; and $8.1 billion to counter China in the Indo-Pacific. Humanitarian aid for Gaza, which Democrats said was necessary for their support, is also included.\nThe first three bills include $60.8 billion to help Ukraine in its war with Russia; $26.4 billion to support Israel, which is fighting Hamas and Iran; and $8.1 billion to counter China in the Indo-Pacific. Humanitarian aid for Gaza, which Democrats said was necessary for their support, is also included.\nThe fourth bill would allow the sale of frozen assets of Russian oligarchs to help fund future aid to Ukraine, potentially force the sale of TikTok and authorize stricter sanctions on Russia, China and Iran. The House approved the fourth bill Saturday in a 360 to 58 vote.\nThe House voted overwhelmingly to approve the aid bill for allies in the Indo-Pacific in a 385 to 34 vote, with one member voting present, along with the aid for Israel, with a 366 to 58 vote. More contentious was the vote on Ukraine aid, which came after months of infighting among House Republicans. But lawmakers voted 311 to 112 with one member voting present to approve the aid, despite the steep pushback from some House conservatives.\nThe speaker said separating the bills would allow members to vote their \"conscience\" on each one.\nJohnson, a Louisiana Republican, unveiled the package earlier this week amid increasing pressure from other congressional leaders and the White House to hold a vote on a similar $95 billion package that passed the Senate in February. The Senate package has sat idle in the House for months as the speaker debated a path forward, and as he has faced threats from a small number of Republicans, who oppose sending more aid to Ukraine and want border measures, to hold a vote on dethroning him.\n\"This is the best possible product that we can get under these circumstances, to take care of these really important obligations,\" Johnson said Friday.\nHe said that if he hadn't moved forward with his plan, an effort to bypass him and force a vote on the Senate bill would have gained more support. House Democrats tried to use a rarely successful legislative maneuver known as a discharge petition to do just that, but are short of the 218 signatures needed.\n\"We would have had to eat the Senate supplemental bill,\" Johnson said.\nThe effort to oust Johnson had three Republican backers as of Friday afternoon: Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona. Gosar announced his support after more Democrats than Republicans on Friday voted to advance the package, setting it up for final passage on Saturday.\nThe rebellion puts Johnson's job at risk if Democrats don't step in to save him if the group of hardliners forces a vote. But Greene hasn't given a timeline for if and when she plans to force a vote.\nJohnson has stood behind his decision to bring up Ukraine aid for a vote. Citing classified briefings he's received, Johnson called the aid \"critically important\" in pushing back on Russian aggression.\n\"If I operated out of fear over a motion to vacate, I would never be able to do my job,\" Johnson said earlier this week.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Friday the upper chamber would \"move expeditiously\" to send the package to President Biden, who has said he will sign it.\nJaala Brown and Ellis Kim contributed reporting.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":",The Hill,D.C.

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\nWith the price of gold rapidly rising it may make sense to add gold to your retirement nest egg now.\nGetty Images/iStockphoto\nAccording to a recent study, Americans believe they need a lot of money to retire.\nHow much, exactly? Based on the April 2 study from Northwestern Mutual, Americans say they need $1.46 million in the bank to retire comfortably. That's up 15% from the same survey conducted in 2023. While that number will vary widely based on each person's goals and retirement savings, it's never too early to start planning for your golden years. And with inflation persistent and borrowing costs high right now, it may be beneficial to consider alternative ways to grow and protect your money.\nOne such way can be through gold. By adding a gold individual retirement account (IRA) to your retirement portfolio, you can secure multiple advantages that other, more volatile assets simply cannot provide. But the timing here is key. And right now is a great time for many to add gold to their retirement plan. Below, we'll detail three reasons why you may want to act now.\nStart by exploring your top gold IRA options online today.\nWhy you should add gold to your retirement plan now\nHere are three smart reasons why you should add gold to your retirement plan now.\nIt can help with inflation\nHope that the latest inflation cycle was cooling was high at the start of 2024 but that optimism has waned following three consecutive reports showing inflation running hotter than expected. With inflation problematic for much of the last two years, many have turned to gold for help. Gold can often be an effective hedge against inflation by maintaining its value and even rising in price when inflation is high. And that's been emphasized in recent weeks as the price of the precious metal has hit numerous record highs.\nIt makes sense, then, to add gold to your retirement plan now to offset the negative impact inflation has on other, more volatile asset classes. And with inflation sticky, it can behoove investors to act aggressively by adding the protection a gold investment offers now.\nGet started with gold here now.\nIt can diversify your portfolio\nDuring any market, it's smart to have a diversified portfolio to better offset losses. But that's especially true today. Fortunately, gold can help do just that. While it's not quite the incoming-producer stocks and bonds can be (although, lately, it can be), it can be a smart way to diversify your portfolio, particularly as you head toward retirement and need to be more conservative with your funds. Big losses could jeopardize your retirement plans, so it's important to protect against those with a diversified portfolio in which gold plays a role.\nThat said, that role will be different for each investor. But, in general, most experts recommend limiting the presence of the precious metal to 10% or less of your overall portfolio.\nThere's a growing demand\nThe numerous record prices gold has surpassed since March 1 underline the growing demand for the metal. That's an advantage for any retirement asset, since you can sell it more easily should you want to adjust your retirement plan. And while not a traditional income producer, the rapidly rising price of the metal could turn a profit for investors who buy low and sell high. And even if the current trend ultimately cools, unlike stocks, bonds and real estate, there will always remain a strong demand for gold and silver. That will give your retirement portfolio an edge no matter how long you plan on remaining in the workforce.\nThe bottom line\nGold has historically been a smart addition to any diversified retirement portfolio. But recent developments have arguably made it a critical addition. Thanks to the hedge against inflation and portfolio diversification it provides - and a rapidly rising price right now - many could benefit by adding the shiny, yellow metal to their retirement plans. Just make sure to thoroughly consider the pros and cons of this unique investment opportunity so that you can truly maximize the benefits it offers today.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Angelica Leicht,Matt Richardson","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/19/d5e2689a-7b35-460f-88b7-79cf125febec/thumbnail/1200x630/b926001ae649c697366809ee023ec329/gettyimages-177332821.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@MRichardson713","_score":4.18822,"_id":"74e124e4e1a7c1852917386841b4c4c8"},{"title":"Fighting erosion on Long Island with low-tech solutions inspired by nature.

His company, Coastal Technology Corp. develops dune guards, oyster stacking devices and cliff stabilizers. Thatos believes the best defense against erosion - an overwhelming problem on Long Island - is simple, and low-tech.\nWhy plants may be better than sea walls to prevent erosion\n\"Native grass species have actually evolved over millions of years to stabilize their environment,\" Thatos said.\nAt Sands Point preserve, Thatos is working to bring them back. As manmade concrete walls crumble, Thatos says there's better natural protection, including dune grasses, bayberry, beach plum, beach rose.\n\"They specifically evolved to grab onto sediments, glue them together with their root systems,\" Thatos said.\nThe plants reduce runoff, making Long Island Sound ideal for his experimental oyster reefs.\n\"These devices are not just for erosion. They are to help integrate human technology with nature,\" he said.\nProfessor Christopher Gobler studies coastal waters and harmful algae at Stony Brook's Marine Sciences Laboratory\n\"When they get like this dense, and then they collapse, that can lead to loss of oxygen in the water,\" Gobler said.\nGobler and his students track the warming water, and coastal changes. That includes rescued tropical fish and seahorses that have been stranded after swimming up from the gulf. They study climate change on clams, oysters, snails, conch and sea urchins, and build oyster reefs to lower nitrogen levels.\nEnvironmentalist calls for \"strategic retreat\" inland\nAdrienne Esposito of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment, says there are ways to overcome the doom and gloom.\n\"We must make a strategic retreat,\" Esposito said.\nShe suggests a regional approach - moving inland to higher ground.\n\"There's a lot of infrastructure we might not be able to move, but we can fortify it and prepare for the floods,\" Esposito said.\n\"Long Island will look really different by the end of this century,\" Alison Branco, climate director for the Nature Conservancy, said.\nBranco predicts six feet or more of vertical sea level rise, changing the shape of Long Island.\nConcern for Fire Island due to climate change\nFire Island, N.Y.: Erosion on the sand dune is seen on the Atlantic Ocean side of the beach at Davis Park, looking west, on Fire Island, New York, on October 3, 2023.\nSteve Pfost/Newsday RM via Getty Images\n\"Fire Island is really a difficult situation because of sea level rise,\" Branco said. \"What it really is is a big sandbar. So over time, the sandbar should overwash, migrate north towards the mainland. But we have houses, and stores and whole communities there. So we need to figure out some solutions to help those folks relocate to a safe spot, so that we continue to enjoy the beaches of Fire Island which are some of the most important, both culturally ad economically for Long Island.\"\n\"The good news is there's a ton of funding available to do some of these really important projects,\" she added.\nThose funds and projects would include helping raise power grids, securing sewage treatment plants, upgrading culverts where roads cross streams, and transitioning to renewable energies.\n\"New innovation is needed desperately now, more than ever before.

We would be contacted frequently by animal care professionals, veterinarians and even the general public who credit her for instilling their passion for these gentle sea cows,\" stated Dr. Cythnia Stringfield, ZooTampa's senior vice president of animal health, conservation and education. \"Our thoughts are with the entire manatee community and the teams who for more than six decades have cared for her.\"\nZooTampa added that a necropsy will be performed to confirm the manatee's exact cause of death.\nJuliet was one of three manatees that were relocated to ZooTampa and another facility in Orlando after one of several inspection reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture cited the Seaquarium for insufficient animal care and neglect, one of which involved how Juliet and the other two sea cows lacked adequate veterinary care and lived in poor living environments.\n\"For more than four months, Juliet had successfully adapted to her new environment in the Zoo's rehabilitation pools and was socializing with other manatees,\" Stringfield added.\nHowever, Stringfield noted that there were \"many aspects\" of Juliet's overall health that were unknown and that she was an \"unusually large\" sea cow, weighing 3,045 lbs., and was estimated to be over 65 years old, making her one of the oldest known manatees.\nAccording to ZooTampa, Juliet and her Seaquarium tankmate Romeo had been \"gradually acclimating\" to their new homes at the facility back in December despite the aspects of their overall health being relatively unknown at the time.\nThough she did not die at the Seaquarium, Juliet is the fourth animal in nearly a year that had died in correlation with the Miami facility's poor living condition.\nLolita the orca died from old age and multiple chronic illnesses on Aug. 18, 2023, after being held at the Seaquarium for over 50 years. She was the first marine mammal to have died and bring mass attention to the facility's controversies, as The Dolphin Company -- the Seaquarium's owner -- had announced in March 2023 to relocate her to a natural sea pen in the Pacific Northwest but failed to do so in time.\nThen in December 2023, Seaquarium officials announced the death of Sundance the dolphin, who had lived at the facility for over 30 years and died after \"precursors of illness.\" Then in March of this year, Bud the sea lion was euthanized by the Seaquarium allegedly one day after Miami-Dade County officials saw the animal's \"lethargic condition\" during their onsite inspection.\nThe Miami Seaquarium has been at the ire of both county and federal governments, along with local and national animal rights activists over the past several years, but frustration with the facility has grown even more over the past several months. In separate USDA inspection reports, the agency has cited the South Florida aquarium with multiple violations, including inadequate veterinary care and facility conditions, along with poor animal handling, sheltering and sanitation.\nIn one of the most shocking inspections, the USDA found another sea lion refusing to eat because of untreated cataracts and a dolphin with a two-inch nail in its throat.\nMS Leisure Company, Inc., along with the Dolphin Company \u2014 who manages the Seaquarium \u2014 issued the eviction notice after Miami-Dade County officials cited numerous and significant violations of its leasing agreement relating to the animal and facility neglect allegations it faced.\nDespite calls for permanent closure, the Seaquarium has remained afloat and continues operations, despite expected to leave its premises on Sunday, April 21.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"National Outlets,Pop Culture.,Hunter Geisel,Current Events To Politics","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/21/19579fa8-f64f-4314-a6cb-9dc378d8b401/thumbnail/1200x630/17dc7e70727ea51bdaed6733b1216fbe/juliet-2.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSMiami","_score":4.1028824,"_id":"3455a9d8b74cb426592f4afdc3f05241"},{"title":"North Texans fight mass extinction crisis in crowded urban landscape, saving native birds","author":"Jeff Ray","published_date":"2024-04-22 18:17:04","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/north-texans-fight-mass-extinction-crisis-in-crowded-urban-landscape","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"A 600-acre nature habitat in Cedar Hill is bringing native birds back to North Texas despite a growing metro area.","summary":"CEDAR HILL, TX \u2014 In the middle of Dallas County sits the Cedar Ridge Preserve, a green space larger than 450 football fields dedicated to protecting the land and its native plants and wildlife. Inside, a sanctuary for more than 60 species of birds.\nThe Preserve is one of the most visited nature areas in the state of Texas. The 600-acre natural habitat also offers up nine miles of hiking trails. \"Many people live with either a very small yard or they live in apartments,\" says David Hurt with Wild Birds Unlimited. \"This is a huge backyard for a lot of people.\" But as more homes, apartments and buildings go up, space for birds disappear. Hurt says the U.S. has lost a third its bird population since the 70s. The main culprit: habitat loss. Climate change is starting to play an even bigger role, reducing living space as drought and wildfires shrink forests and rising seas take marshland. Rapidly changing weather patterns affect the timing of food supply along migratory paths, adding even more stress to the bird population.\nA sixth mass extinction\nIn a study from the University of Helsinki and Aarhus University in Denmark, it is estimated 14% of the world's bird species are currently on a path toward extinction. This is part of a larger picture, a loss of animal and plant species at a current rate that rivals major extinction events in our geological past. We are not only losing birds, but we are also losing a wide range of mammals, reptiles, fish, insects, amphibians, and plants. Author Elizabeth Kolbert refers to it as the sixth extinction, the latest mass extinction event the planet has witnessed over the last half billion years. The last extinction event wiped out most dinosaurs. Birds, a direct descendant of dinosaurs, however, survived and thrived. That is until the industrial age of man. Birds eat insects that destroy crops and spread seeds to help plants colonize new areas. \"Birds are a wonderful indicator species for habitat health,\" says Jake Poinsett with Trinity River Audubon Center. \"These plants are good for carbon sequestration from absorbing potential pollutants from the atmosphere. So, loss of habitat can be a contributing factor to the impacts of climate change.\"\nBut mankind is doing its part: a consortium of non-profits, local municipalities and citizens are working to slow the demise of birds. In the Dallas-Fort Worth Area the Dallas Audubon Society, a non-profit dedicated to birds' conservation, operates two nature centers to preserve bird habitat, the Preserve and Trinity River Audubon Center. Both green spaces are surrounded by urban and suburban sprawl yet are home to over a hundred species of birds, including several with a growing population, particularly in the Preserve. For example, the Golden-cheeked Warbler, a songbird, nests exclusively in Texas. After 60 years, it has returned to the area, driving home the point that a protected green space can help heal a stressed bird population.\nBird City\nCedar Ridge Preserve sits along a limestone escarpment inside the incorporated area of the city of Cedar Hill. This is a geological-unique, hilly terrain surrounded by an expanding Metroplex with more than 8 million people. The city has a deep commitment to green space that goes back to the founding of the area back before the Civil War. Now, as one of ten Texas citied dubbed a \"Bird City,\" Cedar Hill maintains it is commitment to protecting the ecosystem from overdevelopment. They are hoping to designate 25% of their city to green space, linking parks and bike trails to preserve green corridors to help wildlife. Many of the visitors to Cedar Hill Preserve are city residents and have become vocal advocates to keeping the land protected. \"What they are looking for is a very unique balance of development and nice places to live and play, but also this natural open space stuff that attracted them in the first place\" says Porter.\nWhile not every city has 600 acres of protected habitat for birds, there is a backyard approach that can help: plant a more bird-friendly yard. Texas A&M Agrilife offers suggestions, which include putting in native plants, and seeds that provide food not only for birds, but bees and butterflies as well. A plant healthy for birds, is a plant healthy for us.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jeff Ray,Jeff Joined Cbs","media":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/22/29f8f67f-0d1b-4aff-9caf-701ffb31f7f3/thumbnail/1200x630/e9c42a15e82d8b47ac1c3daee1e8a52a/gettyimages-1838929607.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSNewsTexas","_score":4.08501,"_id":"1eebc977be6c84a7c6a1699fc93addcc"},{"title":"House GOP's aid bills for Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan advance \u2014 with Democrats' help","author":"Jaala Brown","published_date":"2024-04-19 04:58:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/house-rules-ukraine-israel-taiwan-aid-package","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"The bills are part of a complicated plan by Speaker Mike Johnson to get badly needed lethal aid to Ukraine, as well as security funding for Israel and Taiwan.","summary":"Foreign aid legislation advances\nForeign aid legislation advances\nForeign aid legislation advances, but could cost Speaker Mike Johnson\n02:11\nWashington \u2014 The House cleared a procedural hurdle to advance legislation to provide billions of dollars in stalled security funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan on Friday, steering the measures closer toward passage this weekend.\nThe full House voted to approve the rule for debate on the legislative package with broad bipartisan support, 316 to 94. Democrats ultimately delivered more votes than Republicans \u2014 165 Democrats voted in favor, while 39 opposed it, and 151 Republicans voted in favor, and 55 opposed.\nAfter the procedural vote, House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters he was \"happy the rule passed,\" and said if it hadn't, the House would have been forced by a discharge petition to pass the Senate version of the bill, which he referred to as a \"blank check for foreign aid.\"\n\"Even though it's not the perfect legislation, it's not the legislation that we worked, [that] we would write if Republicans were in charge of the House, the Senate and the White House, this is the best possible product that we can get under these circumstances, to take care of these really important obligations,\" he said.\nThe House will vote on final passage Saturday afternoon, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer asked senators to be prepared to stay the weekend to vote on the measure. President Biden has said he will sign it into law.\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson walks towards the House chamber at the Capitol on April 19, 2024.\nAndrew Harnik / Getty Images\nThe House Rules Committee reconvened late Thursday night and advanced the rule for the package on a 9-3 vote, thanks to the votes of all four Democrats who sit on the committee: Ranking Member Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, Pennsylvania Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, Colorado Rep. Joe Neguse and New Mexico Rep. Teresa Leger Fern\u00e1ndez.\nThe conservative Republican hardliners on the committee \u2014 Reps. Tom Massie of Kentucky, Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Chip Roy of Texas \u2014 all voted against the rule, because border security was not being paired with foreign aid. However, the speaker said he would put an \"aggressive\" border bill to a vote on Friday. It failed to advance out of the Rules Committee, but the House will consider it under a suspension of the rules, which means it will require two-thirds support to pass.\nThe three foreign aid bills would provide $26.4 billion to support Israel, $60.8 billion to bolster Ukraine and $8.1 billion to counter China in the Indo-Pacific, including billions for Taiwan. The Israel measure also includes more than $9.1 billion to address Palestinian humanitarian needs, which Democrats said was necessary for their support.\nA fourth bill is geared toward addressing other GOP foreign policy priorities. In particular, it would allow the sale of frozen assets of Russian oligarchs to help fund future aid to Ukraine, potentially force the sale of TikTok and authorize stricter sanctions on Russia, China and Iran.\nIf all the bills pass the House, they will be combined into one package before being sent to the Senate, according to the rule.\nPresident Biden said he would sign the package into law and called on the House to pass it this week and the Senate to quickly follow. Both chambers are scheduled to be in recess next week.\nJohnson, a Louisiana Republican, announced the proposal on Monday amid mounting pressure from members in both parties to hold a vote on a bipartisan Senate package that includes support for the U.S. allies. The $95 billion supplemental funding package that passed the Senate in February has stagnated for months in the House as Johnson has debated a path forward.\nForeign aid has sown deep divisions among House Republicans. Some on the far right have threatened to oust Johnson from the speakership over additional funding to Ukraine, which they oppose. The effort, led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, so far has two other backers \u2014 Massie and Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona.\nJohnson defended his decision Wednesday and said providing Ukraine with lethal aid was \"critically important.\"\n\"If I operated out of fear over a motion to vacate, I would never be able to do my job,\" Johnson told reporters.\n\"Look, history judges us for what we do,\" he said, adding, \"This is a critical time right now critical time on the world stage.

It is the largest of the lower Keys and is also home to the Key Deer.\nMIAMI - Traveling through the lower Florida Keys it is hard to miss Big Pine Key. It is the largest of the lower Keys and is also home to the Key Deer.\nIt's hard to miss the signs as you slowly drive through the neighborhoods here with homemade signs reminding you along the way to stay alert as deer are in the area.\nThey are only about two to three feet tall and can be seen everywhere in and around the Key. Backyards to roadsides to their natural habitat, pine rockland.\nThe problem is that habitat continues to shrink as seas rise and transition to a saltwater habitat. This means less food and water for the deer.\nIt's a problem that those in the Keys are facing along with the deer themselves.\n\"Sea level rise is slowing encroaching on the habitat making it smaller and reducing fresh water,\" said Chris Berg, program field director for the Nature Conservancy.\nWhat used to be pine rockland is now just left-over dead pine trees surrounded by new mangroves, a plant that thrives in salt water. All around the Key, you can see the slow and steady advance of this saltwater transition zone, coming in from the coast and pushing farther inland year after year. \"\n\"If we can't stop sea level rise, the habitat will continue to shrink, turning fresh water to salt water,\" said Berg.\nWithout fresh water to drink or to grow food for the deer and other animals that call Big Pine Key home, it leaves them with a bleak future.\n\"Basically, they won't have habitat and will become extinct,\" Berg added.\nSaving the Key Deer helps many other plants and animals in the Lower Keys.\n\"So here in the Florida Keys, the Key Deer is that umbrella species that is helping all the other animals that need this habitat as well,\" said Christina Wilson, a wildlife biologist. \"They play a huge role in the Florida Keys, they are always eating something constantly. Spreading these seeds throughout not only this Key but the surrounding Keys as well since they are good swimmers.\"\nIt is not only the slow rise of the seas that will put this healthy habitat at risk in the near future but also more powerful storms that push saltwater farther inland. Once there it can be tough for that water to drain with roads and other human development.\n\"What happened over time, we would have coastal storms pushing saltwater into the marsh and it wouldn't be able to get out,\" said Kevin Kalis, the coastal program coordinator for US Fish and Wildlife. Key Deer Boulevard on this day was closed to the public for a good reason. It runs right down the middle of Big Pine Key and has acted as a barrier, not letting the saltwater drain back to the sea.\nRestoration work has been underway to install drainage pipes and water control devices along the boulevard.\n\"Once we have this restoration fully functioning, we can manage the water allowing saltwater to escape or even hold back the fresh water,\" said Kalis.\nAnother tactic to help the deer involves the opposite of restoration.\n\"This is something we did on purpose, we call them prescribed burns,\" said Kalis as he escorted CBS News Miami's Dave Warren through what was left over from a fire they set over two years ago. These fires were once a natural process, but now left unchecked it allows these areas to become too overgrown. The fires open the habitat, which give the deer access to new supplies of food and fresh water.\n\"It's things like this we need to do to make space for the deer as seas rise and take away habitat on the fringes,\" said Kalis.\nAs the surrounding habitat shrinks, the deer and human population of Big Pine Key find themselves on top of each other. Those that live there do what they can to protect the deer near the roads with homemade signs telling others to slow down, but according to Berg, a lot more will need to be done in the future.\n\"The real root cause of this problem is people contributing to climate change. We all have a role to play in understanding our contributions along with governments at every level.\" Berg said.\nIt may seem like a losing battle, but it is one the people and agencies continue to fight on Big Pine Key.

Young in contempt of her court orders to fix the way the state investigates complaints by children in its care.\nIt is the third time the state has been held in contempt of court orders since a 2011 lawsuit was filed about foster care conditions in the care of the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services.\nThe judge's decision was prompted by the \"continued recalcitrance\" to conduct thorough, accurate and timely abuse, neglect, and exploitation investigations by HHS's Provider Investigations unit, which investigates those allegations from children in DFPS care, the 427-page decision reads.\n\"As demonstrated by the stories of the children and PI's failure to take any action to remedy the egregious flaws identified by the Monitors, PI represents a significant, systemic failure that increases the risk of serious harm [to the children].\"\nThe fines levied against Texas will be lifted when the state can demonstrate that its investigations are in compliance. A hearing on that matter is set for late June.\nThe state filed an appeal and a motion to stay the contempt order on Tuesday, arguing that HHS officials \"are steadfastly committed to the welfare of the children within their care, and they have worked diligently for years to safeguard those children and comply with the Court's remedial orders in this case.\"\nThe filing asked Jack that the order be temporarily halted immediately while it files an appeal with a higher court \"given the magnitude of the presently accruing fines\u2014and the irreparable harm to federal-state comity by holding the Governor-appointed, Senate-confirmed head of one of the largest state agencies in the country in criminal contempt.\"\n\"given the magnitude of the presently accruing fines\u2014and the irreparable harm to federal-state comity by holding the Governor-appointed, Senate-confirmed head of one of the largest state agencies in the country in criminal contempt.\"\nJack denied the motion shortly after. The appeals process will still move forward.\nThe state's response highlights the contentious relationship that HHS, DFPS and Jack have had since Jack made her first ruling condemning the state foster care system in 2015. Three years after that, the conservative Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. Since then, she's ordered several fixes over the years and continuously criticized the state for not complying with her orders.\nSince 2019, DFPS has been under the supervision of court-appointed monitors who have released periodic reports on Texas' progress toward eliminating threats to children's safety in the foster care system.\nAttorneys representing the foster children in the lawsuit said Monday's ruling from Jack sends a strong message.\n\"The judge's ruling is measured but urgent, given the shocking evidence,\" said Paul Yetter, attorney for the plaintiffs. \"Innocent children are suffering every day. After all these years, when will state leadership get serious about fixing this disaster?\"\nThe state's appeal \"sends a terrible message to Texas children that state leadership just doesn't care about their safety,\" Yetter said on Tuesday.\n\"Rather than certify safe, timely investigations of reports of child abuse and neglect, the state seems determined to avoid responsibility,\" he said.\nLast year, the plaintiffs asked the court to place parts of the foster care system under receivership, which is when a court appoints outside experts to run all or parts of an agency's operations while the agency fixes the issues that prompted that action.\nA January report by foster care monitors cited progress in the area of staff training but continued weaknesses in the agencies' responses to investigations into allegations of abuse and neglect made by children or those who contact them.\nAt the center of the battle are the roughly 9,000 children in permanent state custody, removed from their homes due to circumstances that can include abuse at home, or complex health needs that parents are unable to manage without help, or the loss of their family caregivers.\nThey often present the most tragic stories and have some of the most complex mental and behavioral needs of any child in the system, yet they are often left in dangerous homes and residential centers with poor supervision \u2014 frequently overmedicated, trafficked, and unable to get help if they're continuing to be being abused.\nTestimony during a series of hearings earlier this year and late last year zeroed in on the poor quality and backlog of investigations into complaints of sexual abuse reported by children in state care who have intellectual or developmental disabilities, such as autism, fetal-alcohol syndrome, and Down syndrome.\nIn one case, plaintiffs say, a girl was left in the same residential facility for a year while 12 separate investigations piled up around allegations that she had been raped by a worker at the facility. She was left in the facility with that same worker until she was \"dumped in an emergency room, alone, with her jaw broken in two places,\" Jack said.\nThe facility was eventually shut down by the state.\nThat investigation never substantiated the allegations, and a new state agency policy does not require investigators to explain those findings \u2014 a policy criticized by Jack and Yetter and referred to in Monday's decision.\nAccording to the court monitors, children in the state's care are not informed how to report sexual abuse. Also, the state also has not been able to prove that it has properly trained its caseworkers on how to identify potential victims of sexual abuse.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Karen Brooks Harper,Texas Tribune","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/16/42e0761f-6319-4fb5-ada6-4792f9856c86/thumbnail/1200x630/9efd4737538f1d7bbc360eaa501c82bd/judge.png?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSNewsTexas","_score":3.9353435,"_id":"69734836320e78ac0dd429075ff9e441"},{"title":"Biden signs bill reauthorizing contentious FISA surveillance program","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-20 20:34:04","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-signs-bill-reauthorizing-fisa-surveillance-program-section-702","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"U.S. officials have said Section 702 of FISA is crucial in disrupting terrorist attacks, cyber intrusions, and foreign espionage.","summary":"President Biden on Saturday signed legislation reauthorizing a key U.S. surveillance law after divisions over whether the FBI should be restricted from using the program to search for Americans' data nearly forced the statute to lapse.\nBarely missing its midnight deadline, the Senate had approved the bill by a 60-34 vote hours earlier with bipartisan support, extending for two years the program known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Mr. Biden thanked congressional leaders for their work.\n\"In the nick of time, we are reauthorizing FISA right before it expires at midnight,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said when voting on final passage began 15 minutes before the deadline. \"All day long, we persisted and we persisted in trying to reach a breakthrough and in the end, we have succeeded.\"\nWhat is Section 702 of FISA?\nU.S. officials have said the surveillance tool, first authorized in 2008 and renewed several times since then, is crucial in disrupting terrorist attacks, cyber intrusions, and foreign espionage, and has also produced intelligence that the U.S. has relied on for specific operations, such as the 2022 killing of al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri.\n\"If you miss a key piece of intelligence, you may miss some event overseas or put troops in harm's way,\" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said. \"You may miss a plot to harm the country here, domestically, or somewhere else. So in this particular case, there's real-life implications.\"\nSection 702 permits the U.S. government to collect, without a warrant, the communications of non-Americans located outside the country to gather foreign intelligence. The reauthorization faced a long and bumpy road to final passage Friday after months of clashes between privacy advocates and national security hawks pushed consideration of the legislation to the brink of expiration.\nThough the spy program was technically set to expire at midnight, the Biden administration had said it expected its authority to collect intelligence to remain operational for at least another year, thanks to an opinion earlier this month from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which receives surveillance applications.\nStill, officials had said that court approval shouldn't be a substitute for congressional authorization, especially since communications companies could cease cooperation with the government if the program is allowed to lapse.\nHours before the law was set to expire, U.S. officials were already scrambling after two major U.S. communication providers said they would stop complying with orders through the surveillance program, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations.\nAttorney General Merrick Garland praised the reauthorization and reiterated how \"indispensable\" the tool is to the Justice Department.\n\"This reauthorization of Section 702 gives the U.S. the authority to continue to collect foreign intelligence information about non-U.S. persons located outside the United States, while at the same time codifying important reforms the Justice Department has adopted to ensure the protection of Americans' privacy and civil liberties,\" Garland said in a statement Saturday.\nSome lawmakers hesitant to renew Section 702\nBut despite the Biden administration's urging and classified briefings to senators this week on the crucial role they say the spy program plays in protecting national security, a group of progressive and conservative lawmakers who were agitating for further changes had refused to accept the version of the bill the House sent over last week.\nThe lawmakers had demanded that Schumer allow votes on amendments to the legislation that would seek to address what they see as civil liberty loopholes in the bill. In the end, Schumer was able to cut a deal that would allow critics to receive floor votes on their amendments in exchange for speeding up the process for passage.\nThe six amendments ultimately failed to garner the necessary support on the floor to be included in the final passage.\nOne of the major changes detractors had proposed centered around restricting the FBI's access to information about Americans through the program. Though the surveillance tool only targets non-Americans in other countries, it also collects communications of Americans when they are in contact with those targeted foreigners. Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber, had been pushing a proposal that would require U.S. officials to get a warrant before accessing American communications.\n\"If the government wants to spy on my private communications or the private communications of any American, they should be required to get approval from a judge, just as our Founding Fathers intended in writing the Constitution,\" Durbin said.\nIn the past year, U.S. officials have revealed a series of abuses and mistakes by FBI analysts in improperly querying the intelligence repository for information about Americans or others in the U.S., including a member of Congress and participants in the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\nBut members on both the House and Senate intelligence committees as well as the Justice Department warned requiring a warrant would severely handicap officials from quickly responding to imminent national security threats.\n\"I think that is a risk that we cannot afford to take with the vast array of challenges our nation faces around the world,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/08/fd7a3330-743f-4de9-874a-77cf4bde36bd/thumbnail/1200x630/62d087b7bd411cc3011c4016a1ded522/fbi.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSPolitics","_score":3.933944,"_id":"aefa4f7c1341ea576d766388bf203b75"},{"title":"Endangered species are dying out on Earth.

For some animal cells, the moon is the closest place that's cold enough.","summary":"Plants and animals are dying off at an unprecedented rate on Earth. Some scientists are looking to outer space for a solution.\nThe idea is called a lunar biorepository, a facility that maintains and stores plant and animal cells. But instead of on Earth, this would be on the moon.\nWhy the moon?\n\"There's no place on Earth cold enough to do it,\" explained Mary Hagedorn, a senior research scientist with the Smithsonian National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.\nHagedorn has spent the last two decades studying and theorizing modern ways to try and save coral reefs. She is an expert in cryopreservation, the process of freezing biological materials like animal cells at a temperature so cold, it allows them to remain frozen but alive for hundreds of years.\n\"Let's imagine that, unfortunately, climate change wiped out 90% of the Great Barrier Reef. Well, in 100 years, we might be able to just give them back all that diversity,\" Hagedorn said.\nHer inspiration is the Arctic Svalbard Seed Vault in Norway It is a biorepository that keeps seeds at just under 0 degrees Fahrenheit due to the natural temperature of the permafrost. The low temperature and moisture levels in the vault keep the seeds viable for long periods of time.\n\"Svalbard has done a really great job of saying, 'OK, we need to preserve seeds. Everything on Earth depends on seeds. And how are we going to do that?'\" Hagedorn said.\nHagedorn and her team want to do something similar for animal cells, but they need colder temperatures. At the lunar poles, where deep craters are shaded, temperatures reach as low as minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit or colder.\nPreserving these animal skin cells, called fibroblast cells, allows scientists to transform them into sex cells, which is how they clone animals in labs.\nIn addition to threatened and endangered animals like the African elephant, green sea turtle and great cats, the team at the Smithsonian Institute proposes that the lunar biorepository initially include an array of animal species that serve different purposes, including:\nThose that modify their environment, like coral, beavers, woodpeckers and earthworms.\nPollinators that support the production of food, like bees, moths and bats.\nAnimals that live in extremely warm, cold or acidic environments, like monarch butterflies, polar bears and nematodes.\nOrganisms that support the web of life on Earth, like zooplankton, boreal trees and mosses.\nCryopreserved human cardiac stem cells have also recently been sent to the International Space Station.\nChallenges in space\nAs a trial, the Smithsonian Institute collected 10 specimens of the Starry Goby, a fish found in Kane`ohe Bay in Hawaii. The vision is that these cells will be sealed into cryo-packaging and tested under space-like conditions on Earth, followed by a test run on the space station.\nHow the Smithsonian plans to create cryopreserved cells and test them in space:\nHow the Smithsonian plans to create cryopreserved cells and test them in space:\nTeams at the National Science Foundation's National Ecological Observatory Network are also collecting nearly 100,000 animal cell samples every year from 81 sites. NEON's goal is to expand the kinds of cells used in cryopreservation to include sperm and oocytes, which are found in ovaries.\nWhile a lunar biorepository may be a promising idea for preserving Earth's biodiversity, there are challenges for this program.\nResearchers said one of the most difficult problems posed by a lunar biorepository would be the radiation exposure to samples. Countermeasures to radiation could include antioxidant cocktails, as well as providing physical barriers like water, lead or cement to block radiation.\nTemperatures on the moon's surface, which make freezing possible, are also a concern.\nCertain areas of the moon can reach more than 200 degrees Fahrenheit during the lunar day, which is equivalent to about 14 days on Earth. The much colder temperatures in the craters of the North and South Poles, could make it difficult to transport biomaterials.\nAnother challenge is that those areas, known as \"permanently shadowed regions,\" are believed to have large amounts of ice, conditions that would make human monitoring extremely difficult.\nThe long-term effects of microgravity on cells could also pose a problem.\nSome say seeking a solution on the moon shouldn't be the No. 1 priority.\n\"I don't think it's right idea for right now,\" Noah Greenwald, the endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said.\n\"I think we really need to focus on protecting more of the natural world, so we don't lose species in the first place,\" he said.\nA decades-long effort\nHagedorn isn't the only scientist working to create a biorepository on the moon.\nIn 2021, University of Arizona researchers proposed a concept to send an ark filled with 335 million sperm and egg samples to the moon.\n\"They're engineers,\" Hagedorn noted. \"So, we're more biologists coming at this. We know how to cryopreserve. We started the sample. But they have a great sense of how to use robots.\"\nHagedorn said this is a decades-long effort and that developing a lunar biorepository will require collaboration from an array of nations, agencies, cultural groups and other stakeholders.\nGreenwald said while climate change is finally getting the attention it deserves, the extinction crisis is right there with it.\n\"Species are the building blocks of ecosystems. They clean our air, they clean our water, they moderate our climate, they cycle nutrients. We should all be very concerned because the fact that we're losing species at such an accelerated rate really reflects the degradation of the ecosystems they we ourselves depend upon,\" Greenwald said.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Grace Manthey,Based In Dallas-Fort Worth,David Schechter,Alexis Guerrero","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/02/23/f58a16f9-ea81-4026-9a6c-64f4ee929974/thumbnail/1200x630/a8359a6202dd5208174eada2330bdbe0/cbsn-fusion-us-company-achieves-first-american-moon-landing-since-1972-thumbnail.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSNews","_score":3.8361628,"_id":"a251177a483e5ea65310ad1e35e26b4e"},{"title":"South Florida mourns loss of former Florida Governor, U.S. Senator Bob Graham","author":"Cbs Miami Team","published_date":"2024-04-17 15:23:18","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/south-florida-mourns-loss-of-former-florida-governor-u-s-senator-bob-graham","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Politicians from across the aisle said Graham left a lasting legacy in Florida","summary":"MIAMI - South Florida is mourning the loss of former Florida governor and U.S. Sen.

One, in particular, has captured the hearts of many, sparking a legitimate conservation effort \u2013 the near-threatened piping plover.\nThe story starts with the beloved Monty and Rose, the first piping plover pair to successfully nest and fledge chicks in Cook County in more than 70 years. The lovebird's rise to fame began with Timami Itani, founder of the Chicago Piping Plover Group.\nChicago's lovebirds: Monty and Rose\nThe two birds met at six weeks old and stayed together their entire lives.\n\"I noticed two piping plovers doing courtship displays to each other,\" Itani said.\n\"In the spur of the moment, I said I'm just going to call them the male Monty and the female Rose after Montrose, and the name stuck,\" she said.\nItani is also the vice president of the Chicago Orthnological Society.\n\"In our lifetime, certainly, it's unheard of that piping plovers would be nesting on a beach like Montrose here in Chicago,\" Itani said.\nChanging climate and piping plovers\nThe piping plover was placed on the Federal Endangered Species list in 1986. There must be at least 150 breeding pairs not to be considered endangered. Their numbers dropped to only 13 pairs in 1990. Habitat loss from human development, predation, and climate change were all causes of their decline. With the help of organizations like the Piping Plover Group, there are around 70 nesting pairs in the Great Lakes today.\n\"They are birds that respond more to climatic events,\" Matt Igleski, executive director of the Chicago Bird Alliance, said. \"Things that are more dramatic and might impact things like migration or coastal habitat like here.\"\nRecord high lake levels washed away Monty and Rose's first nest in 2019. CBS 2 has been tracking changing lake levels due to climate change for years.\nClimate change is also shifting seasonal patterns. According to Climate Central, winters are getting shorter, and springs are getting longer. This change has a significant impact on birds.\n\"What we see is an a-synchronicity, kind of this mismatch of when food is available and when the birds arrive,\" Igleski said.\n\"So, if the food is not quite available yet, then that could mess up some of their getting ready for nesting, feeding, and habits like that,\" he said.\nHuman activity is another danger. In 2019, \"Mamby On The Beach\" was set to attract thousands of concert-goers and bring loud music and activities to Monty and Rose's home.\n\"It all kind of came together in this one year where the birds and the music event created this big story that everyone latched on to,\" Igleski said. More than 6,000 people signed a petition opposing the concert in an effort to protect the piping plovers, and they won.\nThen, in 2020, Chicago shut down, and the lakefront was closed during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Chicago Park District shared that the pair came back to try and nest for another season.\n\"Their presence was such a positive in that gloomy year,\" Itani said.\n\"Many people went to become birders and bird lovers because of Monty and Rose and their chicks,\" she said.\nSome grew even more dedicated to protecting the birds' livelihood.\n\"I basically started coordinating the volunteer effort, and the rest is history,\" Itani said. The volunteer group has grown to around 100 people still guarding the piping plovers on Montrose Beach during the nesting season.\n\"We have a significant volunteer effort, and that consists of two volunteers doing two-hour shifts from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. every single day, and often, people will stay past 8 p.m. to 9 p.m.,\" Itani said.\nIt is a serious business for volunteers. In addition to the long hours, if a predatory bird attempts to land in the plover area, they are ready to spring into action. \"We will do big arm gestures! Herons are skittish,\" she said with a laugh.\nForever a part of history\nMonty suddenly died in 2021 due to a severe respiratory infection that is believed to be caused by a natural fungus. Rose did not come back to the beach, which means she likely passed away at the same time, according to Itani.\n\"It was hard for all of us. I absolutely love Monty and Rose. Absolutely love them,\" she said, sporting piping plover earrings and a matching hat.\nItani and many other volunteers spent hours with the birds, getting to know their personalities. Monty in particular was quite bold and enjoyed showing off, Itani said. Rose, on the other hand, was more reserved.\nThe new star of the show is their son, Imani, who hatched on the beach in 2021.\nLast summer, the Fish and Wildlife Service released three other chicks in Chicago, in hopes that one of them is female and can mate with Imani.\nThe hope is for Imani to use the newly renamed and expanded \"Monty and Rose Wildlife Habitat,\" named in his parents' honor. The Chicago Park District dedicated the space to the birds and their love story on Valentine's Day.\nImani is expected to return around the end of April or early May.\nThe human connection\nAs the weather warms and summer approaches, more humans will flock to the beaches. Although people enjoy a day in the sand, the beaches are home to many species and are a part of the city's ecosystem. Igleski hopes the piping plover habitat will remind people that they share these beaches with other animals.\n\"The fact that it is a space that even we can share as citizens of Chicago, I think, highlights the importance of these areas not only for humans but also for birds,\" he said.\nHe said, \"We are protecting spaces for animals so we are not infringing on their rights to be in these spaces with us.\"\nOne of the biggest drivers of climate change is human activity. Climate change has a devastating impact on the earth's biodiversity, or variety of life on Earth, in all its forms, from genes and bacteria to entire ecosystems, according to a United Nations report.\nClimate change and biodiversity loss are part of an interlinked triple planetary crisis the world is facing today, the report found.\nPiping plovers are a part of Illinois and the Great Lake's biodiversity. These birds also offer a unique insight into the condition of an ecosystem for scientists, according to a study by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\n\"Birds and wildlife and nature in general help us mentally, emotionally, physically, and what we do for them eventually comes back to us in many ways,\" Itani said.\nThis Earth Day, Itani wants everyone to remember the legacy of Monty and Rose.\n\"Love piping plovers. Advocate for them,\" she said, \"and continue to care for habitat and birds so they are with us for centuries to come.\"","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Mikayla Price,Tara Molina","media":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/22/0f6e5f5e-f89e-43f9-b459-3e9cf9ce210c/thumbnail/1200x630/9f92c527d208d642ab5bce7a6a4a0cb0/piping-plovers.jpg?v=57e8fa9efcf044a821348136ff26ed69","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSchicago","_score":3.4472198,"_id":"0a189cd579e4ee8754bb17c217154d64"},{"title":"Former Maryland Gov.

(AP) \u2014 Andy DePaola welcomed Larry Hogan to his family's restaurant with a big smile and a handshake. The warning came a few minutes later.\nDePaola, the 64-year-old namesake of DePaola's Bagel and Brunch here in Maryland's conservative Eastern Shore, whispered to a reporter that Hogan better avoid disparaging former President Donald Trump.\n\"I'm a Trumper,\" DePaola said as Hogan posed for pictures and made small talk with the excited breakfast crowd on a recent Friday morning. \"I think Larry would be better off if he kept how he felt about Trump under his breath.\"\nThe brief exchange during a weeks-long bus tour illustrates a stark political reality for the popular Republican former governor, who has single-handedly transformed Maryland's sleepy Senate race into a top-tier contest in the national fight for the Senate majority. Hogan, who was perhaps the most outspoken anti-Trump Republican governor in the nation, can ill afford to lose any pieces of his delicate and diverse political coalition.\nHe's hoping to become the first Republican in more than 40 years to win a Senate seat in this deep-blue state, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1 statewide, with much of the Democratic support in Baltimore and the suburbs of Washington. Over the next six months, Hogan will have to fend off political threats from all sides.\nAs Trump loyalists eye the 67-year-old businessman with skepticism, Democrats are counting on abortion rights to make Hogan's historic challenge even harder. But the R after his name may ultimately prove the most serious liability for Hogan in a state Trump lost by 33 points four years ago.\nIf Hogan wins Maryland's open Senate seat, Republicans would almost certainly claim the majority in the U.S. Senate \u2014 and with it, the power to control the agenda and judicial nominations for the next two years, at least.\nIn an interview, Hogan confirmed he would caucus with Republicans in Washington, despite his concerns about Trump's grip on the party. He also vowed not to leave the GOP after the election, even if Trump returns to the White House.\n\"I'm a real Republican,\" Hogan told The Associated Press, noting that he does not identify with Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement.\nWhen pressed to explain his concerns about MAGA, and whether he views Trump as a threat to U.S. democracy, Hogan parsed his words carefully.\n\"I think certainly there has been some threats,\" Hogan said. \"But you know, I think that's not what this campaign is really all about.\"\nMeanwhile, Hogan's opponents on the left are only just beginning to organize as Democrats wade through their own nomination process. While Hogan faces token opposition in the GOP, Democrats will pick Hogan's general election opponent next month.\nOn Tuesday, a coalition of labor, immigration and progressive groups gathered in the state capital to criticize the former governor for using his veto powers to block legislation to increase abortion access while undermining other Democratic priorities, including health care, environmental protection and education funding.\nThe anti-Hogan event was a reminder that voters in his gubernatorial elections may have been more willing to overlook party affiliation than they will be in a Senate contest that could tilt the balance of power in Washington toward Republicans.\n\"Despite him claiming to be a moderate, we know his actions show that he's a staunch Republican,\" said 1199 SEIU political director Ricarra Jones, who slammed Hogan's veto of legislation to increase the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n\"The Senate race in November is bigger than just Maryland,\" she continued. \"A Republican-dominated Senate would pursue a drastically different agenda, one that could unwind years of progressive achievements and reshape Maryland's policy landscape in ways that could take generations to reverse.\"\nMeanwhile, Hogan is trying to avoid divisive political disputes as he reintroduces himself to Maryland voters during a low-profile \"Back to Work\" bus tour across the state.\nPerhaps the nation's most vocal anti-Trump Republican governor while in office, Hogan barely mentions Trump's name unless asked about him. He's just as eager to ignore abortion, even though Maryland is among the states that will vote on an abortion referendum this fall \u2014 a winning issue for Democrats in red and blue states alike where ballot questions have appeared since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022.\nDemocrats suggest he would support a federal abortion ban, but Hogan insisted in an interview that he would not.\nHe also said he strongly supports in-vitro fertilization and would introduce legislation to protect the practice, an apparent attempt to clarify his position after he declined to say in an Axios interview last month whether he would support such federal protections.\nHe also said he \"would consider voting for\" a Maryland ballot measure this fall that would preserve abortion rights, although he argues that it's unnecessary.\nHogan said abortion doesn't comes up much on the campaign trail. He predicted it wouldn't be \"a deciding issue\" in the election.\nAsked about the issues that matter most to him, Hogan said he's most focused on ending the divisiveness in Washington, followed by the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, crime and the economy.\nBut Hogan largely avoided talking politics at all on his weekend bus tour, preferring to connect with voters on a personal level. He was eager to jump behind restaurant counters to chat with the kitchen staff or pose for pictures welcoming small business owners. And voters, regardless of their party affiliation, embraced him enthusiastically at nearly every stop.\nLanda Mitchell, a 46-year-old old African American woman from Hanover, Maryland, flagged down the governor as he toured small business booths at a weekend boat show. She had met him years ago at a fundraiser for the homeless.\nMitchell said she's not a Republican, but she'd likely vote for Hogan.\n\"He's not far right wing. He's over there, but he's not far far over there,\" Mitchell said with a laugh, adding that she's not sure whether she'll support President Joe Biden this fall because of the state of the economy. \"I'm far from a Trump supporter, but I go into the grocery store today and I cry.\"\nCaroline County Sheriff Donald Baker, who welcomed Hogan on a tour through his office, said he also appreciates the former governor's strong support for law enforcement, noting that the sheriff's office didn't get a single applicant for a recent job posting.\n\"It's gonna be a tough road for him to navigate,\" Baker said of Hogan's political challenge. \"If anybody can do it, I believe Larry Hogan can do it. Why? Because he is a middle-of-the-road kind of guy. He knows how to work with people.\"\nAnd as Democrats fight to link him to Trump's Republican Party, Hogan will take pains to distance himself from Trump \u2014 but not too far.\n\"We don't want to alienate Trump voters,\" Hogan told the AP. \"We need Trump voters. And we need a lot of Biden voters. Maryland is tough.\"\nBut he doesn't expect Trump or any other MAGA celebrities to campaign in Maryland on his behalf in the coming months. He said he's not sure if he'll even attend this summer's Republican National Convention, where Trump will formally become the GOP presidential nominee; Hogan skipped Trump's last two nominating conventions as well.\n\"I don't think Trump would help me at all. I ran 46 points ahead of him,\" Hogan said, noting that Trump lost Maryland in 2020 by a bigger margin than any other state in the nation. \"I don't think he needs to campaign in Maryland.\"","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/17/d193f4c2-3581-4a18-8b37-534e7ec4fb29/thumbnail/1200x630/f5882c4eca9776bd509c9443fd16adde/ap24103629841107.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@wjz","_score":3.3208196,"_id":"9e3df53e54c38a9972e045dc8eb02c8c"},{"title":"Poland's Duda is latest foreign leader to meet with Trump as U.S. allies hedge their bets on November election","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-18 10:54:05","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-duda-meeting","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Former President Donald Trump met Wednesday in New York with Polish President Andrzej Duda, the latest in a series of meetings with foreign leaders as Europe braces for the possibility of a second\u2026","summary":"New York \u2014 Former President Donald Trump met Wednesday in New York with Polish President Andrzej Duda, the latest in a series of meetings with foreign leaders as Europe braces for the possibility of a second Trump term.\nThe presumptive Republican nominee hosted Duda at Trump Tower, where the two discussed the war in Ukraine and Duda's push to boost NATO members' defense spending, according to a readout from Trump's campaign.\nDuda, who has long expressed admiration for Trump, is also a staunch supporter of Ukraine and has encouraged Washington to provide more aid to Kyiv amid Russian's ongoing invasion. That funding has been held up by Trump allies in Congress.\nAs he arrived, Trump praised the Polish president, saying, \"He's done a fantastic job and he's my friend.\"\nDonald Trump stands with Polish President Andrzej Duda at Trump Tower on April 17, 2024 in New York City.\nMichael M Santiago / Getty Images\n\"We had four great years together,\" Trump added. \"We're behind Poland all the way.\"\nFollowing the almost 2 1/2 hour meeting, Duda said only that it was a \"friendly meeting in very nice atmosphere.\"\nHis aide, Wojciech Kolarski, also in attendance, described it as an \"excellent meeting\" of \"two friends who reminisced on the time when for four years they cooperated while holding presidential offices,\" a time that was \"very fruitful for Polish-U.S. relations.\"\nDuda is the latest foreign leader to meet with Trump in the weeks since he locked up the Republican nomination. U.S. allies across the world were caught off guard by Trump's surprise 2016 win, forcing them to scramble to build relationships with a president who often attacked longstanding treaties and alliances they valued. Setting up meetings with him during the 2024 campaign suggests they don't want to be behind again.\nTrump's allies have been encouraging foreign countries to send diplomats and official emissaries to Mar-a-Lago to reconnect ahead of another potential Trump stint in the White House, sources with direct knowledge of the meetings confirmed to CBS News.\nTrump advisers and allies believe he'll be able to capitalize on the decline in Americans' approval of President Biden's foreign policy decisions. An April CBS News poll found that only 33% of Americans approve of Mr. Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict, down from 44% in October.\nEven as he goes on trial for one of the four criminal indictments against him, Trump and Mr. Biden are locked in a rematch that most observers expect will be exceedingly close in November.\nSuch meetings aren't unprecedented\nWhile some in Poland worried the visit might damage the country's relationship with Biden, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. - a Biden ally and a major voice in his party on foreign affairs - said such meetings make sense.\n\"The polls are close,\" he said. \"If I were a foreign leader - and there's a precedent attached to meeting with candidates who are nominated or on the path to being nominated - I'd probably do it too.\"\nMurphy noted that former President Barack Obama did a lengthy international tour and met with foreign leaders when he first ran for the White House. So did Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, who challenged Obama in 2012 and whose trip included a stop in Poland's capital, Warsaw.\nDuda's visit comes a week after Trump met with British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, another NATO member and key proponent of supporting Ukraine, at the former president's Florida estate.\nIn March, Trump hosted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, an autocrat who has maintained the closest relationship with Russia among European Union countries. Orb\u00e1n shared a montage of footage of the visit on his Instagram feed, which included an image of him and his staff meeting with Trump and the former president's aides in a scene that looked like an official bilateral meeting.\nTrump also met briefly in February with Javier Milei, the fiery, right-wing populist president of Argentina who ran a campaign inspired by Trump, complete with red \"Make Argentina Great Again\" hats. Milei gave Trump an excited hug backstage at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, according to video posted by a Trump campaign aide.\nBiden administration officials have been careful not to weigh in publicly on foreign leaders' meetings with Trump, acknowledging he has a real chance of winning the race.\nWhile some officials have privately expressed frustration with such meetings, they are mindful that any criticism would open the U.S. to charges of hypocrisy because senior American officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, meet frequently with foreign opposition figures at various forums in the United States and abroad.\nSecurity and policy officials monitor the travel plans of foreign officials visiting the U.S., but generally don't have a say in where they go or with whom they meet, according to an administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss protocol.\nTrump has been back in his hometown this week for the start of his criminal hush money trial, which has dramatically limited his ability to travel and campaign. While in town, aides have been planning a series of events that began Tuesday evening when Trump, after court adjourned, stopped by a Harlem bodega where a man was killed to rail against crime and blast the district attorney who made him the first former president in U.S. history to stand criminal trial.\nTrump-Duda as \"friends\"\nDuda, a right-wing populist who once proposed naming a military base in his country \"Fort Trump,\" described the dinner earlier Wednesday as a private get-together between friends at Trump's former residence while he is in town for meetings at the United Nations, where Duda is to deliver a speech.\n\"I have been invited by Mr. Donald Trump to his private apartment,\" Duda told reporters, saying it was \"a normal practice when one country has good relations with another country\" to want those relations to be as strong as \"possible with the representatives of various sides of the political stage.\"\n\"We know each other as people. Like two, I can say in some way, friends,\" said Duda, whose term ends in 2025.\nDuda's visit comes as House Republicans wrangle over a $95 billion foreign aid bill that would provide new funding to Ukraine, including money for the U.S. military to replace depleting weapon supplies. Polish leaders have been urging the House to approve the aid bill and ease domestic concerns.\nMany Trump allies in the House are fiercely opposed to aiding Ukraine, even as the country warns that it's struggling amid a fresh Russian offensive. Trump has said he might be open to aid in the form of a loan.\nOne area where Trump and Duda agree when it comes to the conflict is a desire to push NATO members to increase their defense spending. Duda has called on fellow members of the alliance to raise their spending to 3% of gross domestic product as Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine. That would represent a significant increase from the current commitment of 2% by 2024.\nTrump, in a stunning break from U.S. precedent, has long been critical of the Western alliance and has threatened not to defend member nations that do not hit that spending goal. That threat strikes at the heart of the alliance's Article 5, which states that any attack against one NATO member will be considered an attack against all.\nIn February, Trump went even further, recounting that he'd once told leaders that he would \"encourage\" Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to members that are - in his words - \"delinquent.\"\nTrump's campaign said the two discussed the NATO proposal during the meeting. The two also discussed Israel and the Middle East, Trump's 2017 trip to Warsaw \"and many other topics having to do with getting to world peace,\" the campaign said in its readout, which described the men as \"great friends.\"\nThe visit was met with mixed reaction in Poland, where fears of Russia run high and Duda's friendly relationship with Trump has been a source of controversy.\nPoland's centrist Prime Minister Donald Tusk, a political opponent of Duda, was critical of the dinner but expressed hope that Duda would use it as an opportunity \"to raise the issue of clearly siding with the Western world, democracy and Europe in this Ukrainian-Russian conflict.\"","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/18/cf82b33d-ecab-4efc-b2f4-ff182695a986/thumbnail/1200x630/59f9b519dc2ffe8290a752a8173ccc84/gettyimages-2149039936-1.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSPolitics","_score":3.2123337,"_id":"ff5fad89397a3a9250c6732df6b22f18"},{"title":"Supreme Court appears divided over obstruction law used to prosecute Trump, Jan. 6 rioters","author":"Melissa Quinn","published_date":"2024-04-16 13:02:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/supreme-court-january-6-trump-obstruction-law-oral-arguments","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"The Supreme Court seemed divided over a case challenging the scope of a federal obstruction law that prosecutors have used to charge more than 300 Jan. 6 defendants.","summary":"How SCOTUS could upend Jan. 6 cases\nHow SCOTUS could upend Jan. 6 cases\nHow the Supreme Court could upend Jan. 6 cases\n05:18\nWashington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared divided over whether to narrow the scope of a federal obstruction statute used to prosecute hundreds of people who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a legal battle that could have ramifications for the election interference case against former President Donald Trump.\nAt issue in the court fight known as Fischer v. U.S. is whether federal prosecutors can apply a law passed in the wake of the Enron scandal to the Jan. 6 assault. The measure makes it a crime to \"corruptly\" obstruct or impede an official proceeding, and defense attorneys argued that the Justice Department has turned the measure into a \"dragnet.\"\nThe first provision of the law prohibits altering, destroying, mutilating or concealing a document. Before the Jan. 6 attack, prosecutors had never used the statute in cases that did not involve evidence tampering. But since the unprecedented assault on the Capitol, it has been levied against more than 350 defendants who breached the building where Congress had convened a joint session to tally states' electoral votes.\nIt is also among the charges that Trump is facing in the case brought in Washington, D.C., by special counsel Jack Smith last year. The former president pleaded not guilty to one count of obstructing Congress' counting of Electoral College votes, one count of conspiring to obstruct the proceeding and two others.\nOral arguments\nThe case is the first in which the Supreme Court has been tasked with tackling the fallout from the Jan. 6 attack head-on, and Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued on behalf of the government, repeatedly sought to remind the justices of the unprecedented nature of the events that day.\n\"The fundamental wrong committed by many of the rioters, including petitioner, was a deliberate attempt to stop the joint session of Congress from certifying the results of the election,\" she said in opening remarks to the justices. \"That is, they obstructed Congress' work in that official proceeding.\"\nJustice Clarence Thomas, who was absent from arguments Monday, was back on the bench. The justices focused much of the first half of arguments on the language of the statute, including the use of the word \"otherwise.\" Prelogar argued that the obstruction provision functions as a \"classic catchall\" designed to cover all other acts that obstruct an official proceeding.\nJustice Elena Kagan seemed to agree, noting that Congress drafted the measure to fill gaps in the law that were exposed after the Enron scandal.\n\"This is their backstop provision,\" she told Jeffrey Green, who is representing Joseph Fischer, the man charged with obstructing an official proceeding on Jan. 6 and is seeking to have the count dismissed.\nBut during the second half, when Prelogar defended prosecutors' use of the statute in cases arising out of the Capitol breach, several of the conservative justices seemed concerned that the Justice Department is applying the law too broadly.\n\"What happened on Jan. 6 was very, very serious,\" Justice Samuel Alito said after asking whether a protester who disrupts a Supreme Court argument could be charged with violating the obstruction law. \"But we need to find out what are the outer reaches of this statute under your interpretation.\"\nRioters loyal to President Donald Trump at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\nJose Luis Magana / AP\nThe outcome of the case is being closely watched because of the possible impacts to the charges against Trump, which stem from what Smith alleges was a multi-pronged plot to reverse the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. If the court sides with Fischer, Trump could seek to have the two counts related to obstruction of an official proceeding dismissed.\nTrump's case has been paused for months as he seeks to have all four charges tossed out on the grounds he is entitled to presidential immunity. The Supreme Court will consider that issue next week.\nSeparate from Trump, the obstruction dispute could also have repercussions for the Jan. 6 defendants who have already been convicted of the offense or pleaded guilty. A decision finding prosecutors' broad reading of the measure was wrong could prompt bids for new trials or lighter sentences.\nPrelogar said for 50 people, it is the only felony charge brought against them. The average sentence among those defendants is 26 months in prison.\nThe Jan. 6 case\nFischer brought the case currently before the Supreme Court after he was charged in a seven-count indictment in early 2021. Then a police officer in Pennsylvania, Fischer attended the \"Stop the Steal\" rally outside the White House and later entered the Capitol around 3:25 p.m. on Jan. 6. Prosecutors claimed he encouraged rioters to \"charge\" and ran into a line of officers while yelling an obscenity.\nHis lawyers, though, said Fischer was pushed by the crowd into a police line. Fischer was in the Capitol for less than four minutes, they told the court.\nAmong the charges Fischer faced was assaulting a police officer, disorderly conduct and corruptly obstructing, influencing and impeding an official proceeding \u2014 Congress' certification of the Electoral College vote. The charge was enacted as part of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and violators face up to 20 years in prison.\nFischer moved to dismiss the count. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols granted his request, determining that nothing in the indictment alleged that Fischer \"took some action with respect to a document, record, or other object\" in order to obstruct the congressional proceedings. Nichols has been the only district court judge out of 15 in D.C. hearing Jan. 6 cases to adopt a narrow reading of the statute.\nThe Justice Department appealed his ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which ruled against Fischer in a divided decision last year. Lawyers for Fischer then asked the Supreme Court to review the D.C. Circuit's decision, and it agreed to do so in December.\nDuring arguments Tuesday, Green urged the justices to reject the Justice Department's broad use of the law.\n\"The Jan. 6 prosecutions demonstrate that there are a host of felony and misdemeanor crimes that cover the alleged conduct,\" he said. \"The Sarbanes-Oxley-based, Enron-driven evidence tampering statute is not one of them.\"\nGreen had warned in court filings that the government's definition of the law encompassed lawful acts like lobbying, advocacy and protest, a prospect that appeared to concern Alito and Justice Neil Gorsuch.\nGorsuch asked whether a sit-in that disrupts a trial or access to a federal courthouse would qualify as corruptly obstructing an official proceeding, or whether a heckler who disrupted a Supreme Court address could be charged under the law. He also seemed to reference an incident involving Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge after pulling a fire alarm in a Capitol Hill office building ahead of a vote on a government funding bill last year.\n\"Are those all federal felonies subject to 20 years in prison?\" Gorsuch asked.\nThe Justice Department, though, said the text, context and history of the provision shows it broadly bars a person from corruptly engaging in conduct to obstruct court, agency and congressional proceedings.\nAccepting Fischer's argument, Prelogar in a Supreme Court brief, \"would undermine Congress's effort to prohibit unanticipated methods of corruptly obstructing an official proceeding \u2014 such as petitioner's alleged conduct in joining a violent riot to disrupt the joint session of Congress certifying the presidential election results.\"\nPrelogar refuted warnings from Fischer's attorneys that if interpreted broadly, the law would be used to prosecute constitutionally protected conduct like lobbying or peaceful protests. Instead, she said the statute is limited to acts that hinder a proceeding, and advocacy like lobbying or presenting oral argument before a court don't qualify.\n\"The text of the provision resolves this case, and there is no basis to insert language into the statute that Congress did not write,\" she argued, noting that it functions as a \"catchall offense\" designed to cover all forms of corrupt obstruction of an official proceeding.\nThe impacts of a decision\nThe Supreme Court said in December it would take up the case, and its decision to do so reverberated swiftly. Some defendants who were convicted of violating the obstruction statute but not yet sentenced sought to pause their proceedings until the justices rule, likely by the end of June.\nIf Fischer prevails and the high court finds the law narrowly covers corrupt evidence-related conduct, there could be dozens of defendants who have been convicted and seek resentencing, withdraw guilty pleas or ask for a new trial.\nAs for the impact on Trump's case, the special counsel told the Supreme Court in a filing in the immunity case last week that regardless of how it rules, the charges against Trump are still valid.\nSmith has accused Trump of deceitfully organizing fake slates of electors in seven battleground states and urging state officials to send the false certificates to Congress. The creation of the phony documents, he said, \"satisfies an evidence-impairment interpretation.\"","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Daily Signal,Melissa Quinn,Federal Courts.","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/12/15/d9693c01-6b20-42a2-9e22-693536850501/thumbnail/1200x630/6c198c67f6340f087a87002283a22d5e/ap23349721706515.jpg?v=6450b1292090ace5f47bbb23ced2a4e3","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@@MelissaQuinn97","_score":3.1408632,"_id":"6bacb23e043ab2ad690a1795234c9898"},{"title":"Transcript: House Appropriations Committee chair Rep.

TOM COLE (R-OK): Good morning.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you were the lead sponsor on Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan bills. And I know this was a big decision for the speaker to hold the vote at all. The Polish Prime Minister tweeted, \"Speaker Johnson, thank you. Better late than too late. And I hope it is not too late for Ukraine.\" How do you measure the cost of inaction over the past six months?\nREP. COLE: Well, first of all, the Senate only passed the bill 65 days ago. And it's not like the Speaker didn't have other things to do. He had to get all the appropriations done.\n(CROSSTALK)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It was an emergency - they were running out of ammunition.\n(CROSSTALK)\nREP. COLE: Well, again, this administration waited a while, the Senate took a while, and we had other business underway, but it got done and got done in a bipartisan way. He showed incredible leadership. And frankly, he gave us a rule that is the structure in which we considered all these different matters where every single member got to vote the way they wanted to on every single issue. That wasn't the case in the Senate. I think actually, when they follow the example we have, you'll see more support for Ukraine than we probably saw in the original vote.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But to be fair, we're not talking about a policy debate -debate that doesn't have a direct impact on the battlefield. I mean, the Supreme Allied Commander testified before Congress on April 10, Ukrainians are being out shot by the Russian side five to one because of this debate. The delay.\nREP. COLE: I'm sorry, democracy is kind of a messy business. And the reality is, it's done. So it moved through. It moved through on a very bipartisan basis.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: More Republicans voted against it, than voted for it.\nREP. COLE: Well, look, it's about an even split. And quite frankly, if you really want to look at the hardcore Republican opposition, go to the motion to recommit or look at the bill to strip funding from Ukraine. It's about two to one, actually three to one on the motion to recommit. This is politics, there is such a thing as a \"vote no, hope yes\" crowd in every caucus. I can go down that list and tell you the member just said, Okay, you got the votes, you don't need me. So I think there's \u2013\n(CROSSTALK)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That would be a fun game. I would take a few names off that list.\n(CROSSTALK)\nREP. COLE: It's politics. Well, I'm not critical of anybody - the reality is we have overwhelming bipartisan support for each part of this package. It was structured in a way that it allowed members to vote, make the points they wanted to make, and frankly, if they need political cover, do it, but it got done. So I'm, I'm pretty proud of the Speaker.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you more on the other side of this break. But just you are in there, acknowledging when you say \"vote no, hope yes\" that there were Republicans who had to vote no. Because of the political pressure, and the fight within your own party.\nREP. COLE: No, they felt they had to. People \u2013\n(CROSSTALK)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Who wanted it to pass?\nREP. COLE: You think nobody makes political calculations in the United States Senate or in the administration? Welcome to American politics. But the point is, look at the numbers. Look at the overwhelming bipartisan numbers.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to do that -\n(CROSSTALK)\nREP. COLE: Over and over\nMARGARET BRENNAN:-- on the other side of this break. Stay here. We'll be right back.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We want to continue our conversation now with Oklahoma Republican Congressman Tom Cole. Congressman, before the break, we've been talking about this vote the House had yesterday to prove the $95 billion package. There was a decision here for Speaker Johnson, that was an important one, he basically put his job on the line. As we know, there's this movement among House conservatives led by Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene to try to oust him from power, in part because this Ukraine aid bill. Do you think this is a real threat to his leadership?\nREP. COLE: Well, I take anything seriously. But no, I don't. Look, I think it's a relatively small number of Republican members, frankly, just as it was in McCarthy's case, there were only eight people. But the point is I don't think there's unified Democratic support, there was unified Democratic support. To remove the speaker. I think both sides have now seen how dangerous this is how irresponsible it is. And quite frankly, I think it's unlikely that Democrats who supported Ukraine, not as many support Israel, as we would have liked, but they did support Ukraine. I think they're unlikely to remove the speaker with that all though, to be fair, they removed McCarthy after he did what he asked them to do, which was keep the government funded. But again, I don't think that's going to happen this case, but if somebody wants to do it, it's within the rules, and they can take their shot.\nMARGARET BRENNAN:\nBut what you're saying there is that Democrats, you trust would protect speaker Johnson from being as they wouldn't vote to do it.\n(CROSSTALK)\nREP. COLE: I don't think you'd lose very many Republicans. We didn't lose very many Republicans with McCarthy. So it doesn't take very many Democrats to either not vote or oppose it. And I don't- frankly, I don't think we'd lose the same number of Republicans that we lost with Kevin McCarthy. I think even people that disagree with the Speaker--\n(CROSSTALK)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You wouldn't get to eight Republicans, they've gotten to three--\nREP. COLE: I don't think so--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Marjorie Taylor Greene--\n(END CROSSTALK)\nREP. COLE: --look, I- I think a lot of people that like the speaker, that respect the speaker, even when they disagree with him. They know he's honest. He's a straight shooter. They also had a taste of what it's like to go without a Speaker for three weeks. I don't think they want that again, I certainly don't think they want it close to an election.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Former Speaker Gingrich said, \"The demons that Matt Gaetz unleashed by going after Kevin McCarthy are still out there. You can't govern by shooting yourself in the head every day.\" How does Speaker Johnson get anything done?\nREP. COLE: Well, first of all, he just got a lot done. He's gotten every appropriations bill passed. He's gotten FISA through, he just got this consequential--\n(CROSSTALK)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But he has to rely on Democratic votes, which he's being faulted for by members of his party.\nREP. COLE: --so he's actually been, you know- it's- well, that's fine. I mean, honestly- no.\n(END CROSSTALK)\nREP. COLE: Every appropriations bill is bipartisan at the end of the day, they just work that way. So most of these- and something like FISA ought to be bipartisan. I actually think he's, you know, empowered the center and marginalized the extremes on- on each side. Now, is there some risk with that? Sure. But the point is, he's gotten a lot done. I think people admire him. They genuinely like him. They all respect him. Every single Republican voted for him. I don't think that any other person could have done that at the time other than Mike Johnson. So the reservoir of goodwill is enormous. I- I think he's much stronger than the people seem to think. And I think he's demonstrated that by what he's passed.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: If- first of all, do you think Republicans after November will have the majority, and if so, he could be reelected?\nREP. COLE: I do, because I think we're likely to win the presidency. I think this is pretty simple. I used to do politics for a living, I guess I still do. But the reality is, the person that wins the presidency, you're probably going to take the House. It's close enough that that probably makes a difference. I think we'll win. So I think we will have the House.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, good to have you here--\nREP. COLE: Great privilege. Thank you.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- In person, We'll be right back.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/04/29/340c23e5-e5a3-40ef-bf68-dcc84ef47c4b/thumbnail/1200x630/6e2e666786e7a06c8786e0cd609401f5/restrictedimagesub.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@facethenation","_score":3.137236,"_id":"f1a07d1dcdfe23ee2ba009623d1789ba"},{"title":"Transcript: Sen.

Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, that aired on April 21, 2024.","summary":"The following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, that aired on April 21, 2024.\nThe following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, that aired on April 21, 2024.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Alaska Republican Senator Dan Sullivan who is also here with us. It was a busy weekend here in Washington--\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yeah, Margaret, good to be back on the show.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, this Ukraine aid that finally has moved, President Zelenskyy was on another network this morning and he said the U.S. will send a signal with this, that this will not be a second Afghanistan, the U.S. will stay with Ukraine. If Donald Trump wins this next election, can you guarantee the U.S. will stay with Ukraine?\nSEN. SULLIVAN: Well, listen, I can't guarantee anything, but it's actually good that the President- President Zelenskyy mentioned Afghanistan because Margaret, this gets lost too much. I think we gotta look at how we got to the situation of Ukraine. I believe strongly that the weakness coming out of the Biden White House, they cut defense spending, you know, every- every year in terms of the President's budget. Their energy policies exude weakness, and the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan emboldened Putin to undertake the invasion of Ukraine. So we gotta remember, kind of broadly, more strategically, where we are. But as you know, I was a supporter of the defense supplemental. And I think it's not just going to be important for Ukraine, as you and I have talked about before, it's going to be really important for the industrial base of America, which has atrophied dramatically. 60% of this bill goes into building weapons, everything from submarines to--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- In many Republican districts too, which is why it's so surprising it took so long to get through the House.\nSEN. SULLIVAN: All over the place. So I think it's important, but again, you know, a lot of this, in terms of where we are on Ukraine, from my perspective, comes from the weakness of the Biden administration, and, you know, the president's inability to actually make the case on Ukraine. He's given two speeches on Ukraine in the last two years, and all his speeches do is kind of villain- villainize another part of the Congress--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We could--\nSEN. SULLIVAN: --He hasn't tried to bring people together.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We could have a historical argument for the next hour--\nSEN. SULLIVAN: -- Well the history's important--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- going back years about green lights being given to Vladimir Putin around the world by leaders in many countries.So let's talk about--\nSEN. SULLIVAN: -- The history on this is important--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- I'm not saying it's not, but let's talk about the future here, and the signals being sent. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban met in March with Donald Trump at Mar-A-Lago, and then he gave an interview. And in that interview, he said that Trump told him, he will not give a penny to fund Ukraine. And that is why the war will end because Ukraine cannot stand on its own feet. We know he's not a fan of President Zelenskyy. So why do you think he will be persuaded? He might win this election.\nSEN. SULLIVAN: Well, listen, I mean, President Trump put out a statement recently where he thought it was important to support- support Ukraine. He actually also mentioned the Europeans need to do more and he actually mentioned something, as I just said, that it was very unlikely the war would have started, had he still been in the White House. So--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Russia hadn't withdrawn from Ukraine- You know, they'd gone in- in 2014. So this argument over \"Trump would have made a difference,\" it didn't make a difference--\nSEN. SULLIVAN: -- Well look I think--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --for his four years in office.\nSEN. SULLIVAN:\n-- Again, the broader- the broader issue, particularly between Biden and Trump right now, you know, where are we- is the world a safer place for the United States and our allies today as it was four years ago? I think that the answer to that is unequivocally no. But let's get back to your question. I do think that the Republican Party in the House and in the Senate is still very much the peace through strength party. This is the tradition of Republicans, Reagan, the Bush presidencies, Eisenhower, Teddy Roosevelt--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you just talking about the Senate or the House? Because there were more Republicans in the House who voted against Ukraine aid than voted for it.\nSEN. SULLIVAN: Well, but actually look at some of the other votes. There was a vote- Republicans in the House two to one rejected an amendment to strip funding for Ukraine, two to one in the house and--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- That was Marjorie Taylor Green's effort.\nSEN. SULLIVAN:-- Correct an- and, you know, we'll see what the Senate does this Tuesday on this bill. One of the things that I think the Speaker did a good job on with regard to this legislation is actually-he actually improved it for a whole host of reasons. But I predict that you'll probably see a majority of Senate Republicans supporting this legislation. And like I said, peace through strength- this is important because Donald Trump was part of that tradition very much, remember President Obama cut defense spending by 25%. His second term, he gutted readiness. This is what Democrats sent-Presidents do, Biden did it-Obama did it.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm-I'm gonna talk about some of these mixed messages in the house with our congressman ahead senator\u2013\nSEN. SULLIVAN:\u2013 Okay, but look I mean \u2013\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 It's not-it's not still clear \u2013\nSEN. SULLIVAN: \u2013 I think our party is still a peace through strength party, one of the dangers of my view\u2013\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013but as just said you can't guarantee a Trump administration\nSEN. SULLIVAN: \u2013well nobody can guarantee anything\u2013\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013but he hasn't even endorsed this bill publicly.\nSEN. SULLIVAN: He came out with a statement last week saying something that you know, Ukraine was important\u2013\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013No he says everyone agrees Ukrainian survival and strength should be much more important to Europe then to us, but it's also important to us, get moving Europe. That was the best that Republicans got out of him. David Cameron from the U.K.,\nSEN. SULLIVAN: \u2013 let me make one other point\u2013\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013the Polish President\u2013\nSEN. SULLIVAN: I think that we're kind of given Joe Biden a bit of a pass on, not just as I mentioned how we got here, but the execution of the Ukraine\u2013\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 Yeah \u2013\nSEN. SULLIVAN: \u2013Effort is you know, literally every major weapon system that the Ukrainians have said they need from HIMARS, Patriots, stingers, tanks, F-16s, now ATACMs, every single weapon system, this administration, delays, delays because they're scared of, you know, making Vladimir Putin mad. The Senate, you saw Mark Warner there a second ago, you interviewed him. In a bipartisan way we come in and we say, Mr. President, you have to give them these weapon systems, they finally relent. Think about where we'd be Margaret, if, you know, a year and a half ago, we would have gotten all these weapons systems in Ukraine.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- Or six months ago, if Republicans in the House actually held a vote to do what they did just yesterday, but I need to move on to the climate because I know you're also passionate about this and what the Biden administration just announced about your state of Alaska. The President wants to conserve 30% of us lands as part of his climate change efforts. And he has limited oil and gas drilling in parts in the national petroleum reserves to protect polar bears and other things. And then he also blocked a role- road, excuse me, crucial to operating a copper and zinc mine. You said this is suicidal and lawless.\nSEN. SULLIVAN: It was.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Those are strong words.\nSEN. SULLIVAN: Well, it's lawless. He doesn't have the authority to do it. And I could go into all the laws that support me on that. It's, as I say, national security suicide. Look, this president won't sanction the Iranian oil and gas regime. You may have seen Senator Blumenthal and I put sent a letter to the President on Friday saying you need to do that. But he has no problem sanctioning Alaska that this administration has issued 63 executive orders and executive actions, singularly focused on Alaska to shut our state down. Now that of course, hurts my constituents. But Margaret, national resources, energy critical minerals, that's an American strength, this should concern all kinds of Americans. I'll mention one final thing that I really wanted to highlight here. You know, I've been in the Senate nine years, I have never seen such a cynical and dishonest display coming out of any presidency. When this President on Friday with Secretary Haaland announced that they did this because the Alaska Native, the indigenous people on the North Slope of Alaska, asked them to, they wanted them to ,these- the leaders of the North Slope of Alaska, were unanimous in opposition to this. They tried to meet with Secretary Haaland, she wouldn't meet with them. This is a rule that focuses on their lands where they've been living for 1000s of years. And then the President says, well, I did it because the indigenous people of Alaska wanted it. That is a lie. And I- it is a lie and go look, go see what the indigenous people of Alaska from that part of my state said, they're very upset and the President was canceling their voices and now stealing their voices. It was really a despicable move.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, we have to leave it there because of the break, but I know you could talk with me on this perhaps again in the future--\nSEN. SULLIVAN:-- Thank you--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- more in depth. We'll be right back.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/21/c83da135-91c7-4e9e-9d26-9b86aff30c45/thumbnail/1200x630/04c1009117b9213f55b0f5be91ec4a61/1713717020555.png?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@facethenation","_score":2.9867704,"_id":"1986720ef990db30306f8f2fff01e073"},{"title":"In major homelessness case, Supreme Court grapples with constitutionality of anti-camping ordinances","author":"Melissa Quinn","published_date":"2024-04-22 12:00:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/supreme-court-constitutionality-anti-camping-ordinances-grants-pass-oregon","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"The Supreme Court considered whether efforts to address homelessness in Grants Pass, Oregon, violated the Constitution's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.","summary":"U.S. Supreme Court to hear case on constitutionality of anti-camping ordinances targeting homeless p\nU.S. Supreme Court to hear case on constitutionality of anti-camping ordinances targeting homeless p\nU.S. Supreme Court to hear case on constitutionality of anti-camping ordinances targeting homeless p\n04:15\nWashington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday wrestled with the constitutionality of local laws that ban public camping in a dispute over whether an Oregon city's rules aimed at addressing homelessness violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\nThe case is the most significant involving homelessness to come before the nation's highest court in decades, and its outcome could impact how cities and states respond to high rates of homelessness that have given rise to encampments on public property.\nThe dispute involves the constitutionality of laws that punish homeless people with civil citations for camping on public property when they have nowhere else to go. Arguments come as the nation confronts a spike in homelessness driven in part by high housing costs, and a ruling is likely to reach beyond the borders of the Oregon city at the center of the dispute.\nThere were an estimated 256,000 unsheltered people in the U.S. on a given night in 2023, according to a December report from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Homelessness rose 12% from 2022 to 2023, its highest level since tracking began in 2007, the report found, as housing prices soared and pandemic-era assistance programs expired.\nA man plays with his dog in Baker Park next to his tent, at left, after using the stick to help the stream of water flow better on Friday, March 22, 2024, in Grants Pass, Ore.\nJenny Kane / AP\nAt the center of the case is Grants Pass, a city of roughly 40,000 in southern Oregon with ordinances that bar camping or sleeping on public property or in city parks. The city's rules define \"campsite\" as \"any place where bedding, sleeping bag, or other material used for bedding purposes, or any stove or fire is placed.\"\nViolators face fines of at least $295, but repeat offenders may be banned from a city park for 30 days. If a person violates that order by camping in a park, they are committing criminal trespass, punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $1,250 fine.\nDuring more than two hours of arguments, the justices appeared divided over whether Grants Pass went too far with its rules, and they struggled with where to draw the line for what a city can do to address homelessness before it becomes a constitutional violation.\n\"How do we draw these difficult lines\" of whether the Eighth Amendment would prohibit a municipality from punishing other acts like public urination if there are no facilities available or trespassing, asked Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\nSome of the justices also seemed concerned with the notion that federal judges would be considering city policies designed to address homelessness, instead of local officials.\n\"Judges across the country are now going to superintend this under the Eighth Amendment,\" said Justice Neil Gorsuch.\nIt was a concern echoed by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Elena Kagan.\n\"Many people have mentioned this is a serious policy problem, and it's a policy problem because the solution of course is to build shelter, to provide shelter for those who are otherwise harmless,\" Roberts said. \"But municipalities have competing priorities. What if there are lead pipes in the water? Do you build the homeless shelter or do you take care of the lead pipes? What if there isn't enough fire protection? Which one do you prioritize? Why would you think that these nine people are the best people to judge and weigh those policy judgments?\"\nKagan asked Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler, who argued on behalf of the Biden administration, \"Where is the line where the city can say our legitimate municipal interests can come in and say as to that, as to that, you can't do that?\"\n\"How does the court make these judgments?\" she said. \"These are tough judgments and usually they're the kind of judgments that we think of as municipal officials make them.\"\nStill, Kagan and the two other liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, sharply probed a lawyer arguing on behalf of Grants Pass about how the ordinances did not criminalize homelessness.\n\"For a person who has no place to go, sleeping in public is kind of like breathing in public,\" Kagan said.\nShe acknowledged that the issue of homelessness is a \"super hard policy problem\" for all municipalities, but said the rules in Grants Pass sweep too broadly.\n\"Your statute says that a person cannot take himself and himself only and take a blanket and sleep some place without it being a crime,\" Kagan said. \"It just seems like you're criminalizing a status.\"\nSotomayor asked where homeless people would go \"if every city every village, every town lacks compassion and passes a law identical to this? Where are they supposed to sleep?\"\nJackson said it seems \"both cruel and unusual to punish people for acts that constitute basic human needs.\"\n\"We're talking about sleeping,\" she said. \"That is universal, that is a basic function.\"\nThe challenge to the Grants Pass ordinances\nThe case before the Supreme Court dates back to 2018, when three homeless people in Grants Pass sued the city on behalf of its homeless population, alleging its public sleeping and camping ordinances unconstitutionally punished them by violating the Eighth Amendment's protections against cruel and unusual punishment.\nThe city said in court papers that it enforced the ordinances \"with moderation,\" issuing more than 500 citations from 2013 to 2018. A policy from the Grants Pass Department of Public Safety states \"homelessness is not a crime,\" and the department does \"not use homelessness solely as a basis for detention or law enforcement action.\"\nA federal district court in Oregon ruled for the challengers and barred Grants Pass from enforcing the public-camping ordinances during daytime hours without 24-hour notice, and at night entirely against the roughly 600 homeless people in the city. A divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld the district court's ruling as to the public-camping rules.\n\"The City of Grants Pass cannot, consistent with the Eighth Amendment, enforce its anti-camping ordinances against homeless persons for the mere act of sleeping outside with rudimentary protection from the elements, or for sleeping in their car at night, when there is no other place in the city for them to go,\" Judge Roslyn Silver, who was on the 9th Circuit panel, wrote for the majority.\nThe full 9th Circuit declined to rehear the case over the dissent of 13 active judges and four senior judges.\nWith Fruitdale Elementary School in the background, a Grants Pass police officer walks to check on a homeless person after relatives asked for a welfare check at Fruitdale Park on Saturday, March 23, 2024, in Grants Pass, Ore.\nJenny Kane / AP\nGrants Pass officials appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court, arguing in a filing that \"modest\" fines and short jail terms for camping on public property are not cruel and unusual punishments under the Eighth Amendment.\nTheane Evangelis, the lawyer representing the city, told the justices during arguments that the 9th Circuit's decision tied the city's hands by \"constitutionalizing the policy debate\" over how to address growing encampments, which she said present harms to the public.\nIf the challengers prevail, Evangelis said Grants Pass \"will be forced to surrender its public spaces.\"\n\"When the 9th Circuit constitutionalized this area, it left cities with really no choice: either keep building enough shelter that may or may not be adequate or suitable to someone's preferences or be force to give up all of your public spaces. That is what's happened,\" she said.\nBut Kelsi Corkran, who argued on behalf of the challengers, said the ordinances \"by design make it physically impossible for homeless people to live in Grants Pass without facing endless fines and jail time.\"\nShe said the city's rules punish people based on their status, which is considered cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment.\n\"All the ordinances do is turn the city's homelessness problem into someone else's problem by forcing its homeless residents into other jurisdictions,\" Corkran said, adding that the 9th Circuit's order still leaves the city with tools to address homelessness, such as imposing time, place and manner restrictions on when and where homeless people sleep.\nIn court filings, lawyers representing the homeless population in Grants Pass accused the city of punishing them for sleeping or resting \"anywhere on public property at any time with so much as a blanket to survive the cold\" and said the laws make it \"physically impossible for a homeless person who does not have access to shelter\" to stay in Grants Pass without facing fines and jail time.\nThe Supreme Court's arguments\nDuring the oral arguments, Kavanaugh and some of the conservative justices suggested that homeless people facing citations could raise a \"necessity defense\" under state law as a justification for violations.\nStill, Kavanaugh raised concerns that in Grants Pass, there are more homeless people than there are available shelter beds and questioned whether there should be a different constitutional rule in that circumstance.\n\"The law here, how does it help if there's not enough beds for the number of homeless people in the jurisdiction,\" he asked.\nKavanaugh also told Evangelis that imposing criminal penalties on a homeless person for sleeping in a public space does not necessarily ensure their circumstances will be improved.\n\"When you get out of jail, what's going to happen then? You still don't have a bed available so how does this help?\" he asked. \"If you run through that cycle and end up in jail for 30 days, then you get out, you're not going to be better off than you were before in finding a bed ... if there aren't beds available in the jurisdiction.\"\nBarrett, meanwhile, asked Kneedler how the federal government addresses homeless encampments, such as a 70-person encampment in a Washington, D.C., park that was cleared last year.\nKneedler, representing the Biden administration, said that instance was the \"gold standard\" of how to address homeless encampments and said there was extensive cooperation between the National Park Service and District of Columbia. Still, he expressed concerns about what could follow if Grants Pass is allowed to enforce its ordinances.\n\"If Grants Pass can do this, so could every other city, so could a state do it statewide and eventually a homeless person would have no place to be,\" Kneedler said.\nEfforts to address a homelessness crisis\nIn addition to the Biden administration, the dispute attracted input from a range of advocacy and law enforcement organizations, cities, states and members of Congress.\nThe Justice Department said in a filing that the 9th Circuit was right to find that the Eighth Amendment prohibits a local government from effectively criminalizing homelessness by prohibiting individuals who lack access to shelter from residing in that area. But it said applying that principle to a particular person requires a look at their circumstances, and the lower court was wrong to issue the broad injunctive relief that it did.\nThose broad injunctions issued by U.S. district courts \"may limit cities' ability to respond appropriately and humanely to encampments and other legitimate public health and safety concerns,\" the Biden administration said.\nSeveral major cities have asked the justices to allow them to address public health and safety concerns that arise from homeless encampments.\nThe city of Phoenix and the League of Arizona Cities and Towns said municipalities must have the authority to \"arrest, cite, or forcibly remove individuals camping on public property when their actions jeopardize public safety.\" In San Francisco, which is facing a homelessness crisis, city leaders told the Supreme Court that the 9th Circuit's decision has prevented it from enforcing six state and local laws that place limits on where and when homeless people can sleep and erect tents on public property.\n\"The city has been unable to implement the considered policy decisions of its Mayor and local legislature; unable to enforce the will of San Francisco voters; unable to allow conscientious City employees to do their jobs; and unable to protect its public spaces,\" lawyers for the city said in their brief, filed in support of neither party.\nThe lower court decisions have \"harmed both San Francisco's housed and unhoused populations by causing obstructed and inaccessible sidewalks, unsafe encampments, and fewer unhoused people to accept services,\" they continued.\nA decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Melissa Quinn,Daily Signal,Federal Courts.","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/22/13fc889b-fbdd-4542-a4fd-7f2ab08324ca/thumbnail/1200x630g8/7550f90f9e6a829322afb1944b2f8f2b/gettyimages-2147863353.jpg?v=57e8fa9efcf044a821348136ff26ed69","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@@MelissaQuinn97","_score":2.674396,"_id":"4470951166bb6af02ddcbdb4210ca8e1"},{"title":"Full transcript of \"Face the Nation,\" April 21, 2024","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-21 18:35:17","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-full-transcript-04-21-2024","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"On this \"Face the Nation\" broadcast, Sen.

But is it coming too late to help Ukraine defeat Vladimir Putin?\nAfter six months of party infighting over aid to Ukraine, Speaker Johnson did an end run around his MAGA conservative critics and worked with Democrats to get a $95 billion package of foreign aid through the House, a move that could cost him his job.\n(Begin VT)\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON (R-Louisiana): I said these are not normal times. They're not. The world is destabilized and it's a tinderbox.\n(End VT)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But will it revive the weary Ukrainian war effort?\nWe will talk with Senate Intelligence Chair Mark Warner. Plus, we will hear from Republican Congressman Tom Cole and Senator Dan Sullivan about all this and more.\nPlus: As former President Trump prepares for opening statements in the New York hush money trial, bad weather kept him off the campaign trail this weekend.\n(Begin VT)\nDONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States (R) and Current U.S. Presidential Candidate): They're saying the weather is really getting bad, really, really getting bad.\n(End VT)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden spent three days in a state that's a must-win for him.\n(Begin VT)\nJOE BIDEN (President of the United States): You're my ticket to the White House, you, Pennsylvania. No, it's not hyperbole.\n(End VT)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk with that state's Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro.\nFinally, ahead of Earth Day, what impact is the recent run of extreme weather having on American views on climate change?\nIt's all just ahead on Face the Nation.\nGood morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.\nSix months to the day after President Biden requested the funding for Ukraine, it has finally passed the House. The $95 billion foreign aid package includes $61 billion for Ukraine and rebuilding U.S. weapons stockpiles, $26 billion in aid for Israel \u2013 that includes some humanitarian aid for Palestinians \u2013 and $8 billion for parts of the Indo- Pacific region, which includes Taiwan.\nA bill also forces the Chinese-owned firm ByteDance to sell TikTok or risk a U.S. ban.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, along with a minority of Republicans, worked with a majority of Democrats to get the Ukraine aid through. That bipartisan effort has made some ultraconservative House Republicans livid, and they're threatening to remove the speaker from his job just six months after a similar scenario cost Kevin McCarthy the speakership. The Senate is expected to pass the funding bill later this week.\nWe begin today with the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner.\nGood morning, and good to have you here.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER (D-Virginia): Thank you, Margaret.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, Senator, $61 billion in aid to Ukraine, about 60 percent of that stays as an investment into the U.S. industrial base, as I understand it.\nPresident Zelenskyy said this morning on another network it's important that they get crucial long range artillery like ATACMS. Is that what this money will pay for? And, if so, when will they actually get them?\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, the great news is, this is finally happening.\nIt should have happened six months ago. The next best time is right now, this week. We've seen the Ukrainians overperform.\nIf you step back for a moment and think about the fact that, for most of my life, most of America's defense forces were focused on Russia, getting this additional equipment as quickly as possible \u2013 I hope, once this gets to the president by Tuesday or Wednesday, that these shipments will be literally launched with that longer-range ATACM.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: By next week?\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: I hope, once the president signs, we've been told that there is \u2013 it is the president's signature, making sure Congress does its job, that these materials will be in transit by the end of the week.\nAnd on that schedule, what it will do is, it's clearly been the case that the Ukrainians, morale has been great, but it's been undermined over the last couple of months, when they have been \u2013 literally given out rationed bullets, eight to 10 bullets a day, and on artillery shells, Russians 10-1.\nYou can't underestimate the Ukrainians' grit, determination. But if they don't have the materiels\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 they can't carry this fight to the Russians.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Will they get those long-range artillery?\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Not just ammunition?\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: The ATACMS \u2013 I believe the administration\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 was prepared over the last couple of months to prepare \u2013 or to provide ATACMS. It is written into this legislation.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: According to the State Department, China has helped Russia rebuild its defense industrial base, which has an impact on the battlefield as well here.\nHow have they been able to just blow through U.S. sanctions or defy them to help the Russians, who are fighting Ukraine?\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, if we look back again, I think we would all acknowledge that the sanctions regime has not been as tight as we would have like to have seen it, China being the worst offender with direct military support, India, a country I'm very supportive of, but India in terms of purchasing Russian oil that give that hard currency to Russia for them to go out into the marketplace and acquire arms.\nIt's one of the reasons why I think this package, which the House just passed, we will take up this week\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 that says, we have to be ready to be prepared for our national security interests, not only in Ukraine and Russia, also in terms of military assistance to Israel, but with additional humanitarian aid for the Palestinians who are\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 in such great challenges.\nAnd there's about $8 billion or $9 billion for the Indo-Pacific region\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 because of the concern that we have about China's aggressiveness towards Taiwan.\nClearly, the Chinese linkage to Russia, combined with the fact that the Iranians are \u2013 are providing drones, for example\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 for Russia and the outlier nation, North Korea, I know the terminology used to be Axis of Evil. This may be the 2024 Axis of Evil combination of nations.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And Speaker Johnson has used that language.\nOne of the other things that the House voted to do was move this TikTok bill through. So this would force the Chinese-owned parent company, ByteDance, to divest it, to sell it. But they have the better part of a year to do so. The Chinese government says they're not going to allow that.\nByteDance doesn't want to sell it. So, if this just gets stuck in the courts, isn't the reality that TikTok is not going away?\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: TikTok, 170 million Americans a day, 90 minutes a day\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 that's, frankly, more than the power of eyes that your network reaches on a daily basis.\nAnd that information \u2013 and many young people on TikTok get their news.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: The idea that we would give the Communist Party this much of a propaganda tool, as well as the ability to scrape 170 million American \u2013 million Americans' personal data, it is a national security risk.\nWhat \u2013 what our goal\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But it is a national security risk, according to U.S. intelligence community, that has a direct impact potentially on U.S. elections. TikTok accounts\u2026\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: On U.S. elections, on elections this year.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, targeted candidates from both political parties during the midterm cycle in 2022. That's the Worldwide Threat Assessment.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: This is a world\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But TikTok is not going away before November.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, here is the question \u2013 the issue.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, that means it's an active threat.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: There is plenty of creativity on TikTok. There are people that make their living off of TikTok as social influencers. I don't want that to go away.\nI simply want to make sure that the individuals pulling the strings\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 are not ultimately functionaries of the Communist Party of China.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I understand.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: And given\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But even with this significant bill, the timeline is such that it doesn't take it away as a risk for the election. And it seems the U.S. government is so limited in so many ways when it comes to these election influence efforts.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: The \u2013 the timeline of giving \u2013 this is going to be a complicated transaction.\nTo give it up to a full year, I think, just from a business standpoint, makes sense. The one thing we do have in place \u2013 and I'm not putting a whole lot of solace in this.\nBut I was at the Munich Security Conference earlier in the year, when all 20 of the major social media companies, including TikTok, including Twitter, X, including Facebook, Google, Amazon, you name it, they have all said they would have a voluntary agreement about disinformation and misinformation in elections, because, with artificial intelligence\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 the ability for people to see this, our images here, maybe having words that we don't speak\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 is \u2013 ought to scare the dickens out of all of us.\nAnd the truth is, you know, these 20 companies have a \u2013 guaranteed a voluntary agreement. They'll take on watermarking, which will indicate altered \u2013 altered content, be willing to take this content down.\nBut the proof is going to be in the pudding. The parliamentary elections in Europe start in less than 60 days. So we are going, along with our European partners, to say, all right, companies you promised.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Show us what you're doing.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, this other measure that was approved as well, Section 702, it's a key surveillance tool\u2026\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Mm-hmm.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 was reauthorized for two years, instead of five.\nTake a listen to what the CIA director told my colleague Norah O'Donnell Friday about how his agency is using this authority.\n(Begin VT)\nWILLIAM BURNS (CIA Director): Its reauthorization, its passage, I think, is a crucial tool to fight fentanyl, because something like 70 percent of all the successful disruptions of fentanyl traffic moving into the United States that we've been a part of have come directly from intelligence derived from 702.\n(End VT)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, these changes to 702, how does it help fight the trafficking of fentanyl? What \u2013 what difference is there?\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, let's \u2013 let's remember what 702 is.\nIt is the ability for the United States government to surveil, listen in, on non-Americans, foreigners who are abroad. And many times, the fentanyl drug cartels are being run out of Mexico, many times supplied with basic goods out of China.\nAnd this ability to listen in on the bad guys' communications is extraordinarily powerful. Matter of fact, the president gets a daily brief of all of the intelligence hot spots around the world. Sixty percent, 60 percent of what he reads each day is material that comes out of the 702 program.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Now, let me be clear. There have been times in the past where particularly the FBI didn't even follow its own rules on making sure that a foreign individual, a foreign terrorist that might be talking to American, that we put appropriate protections on that American.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That led to some of this Republican criticism.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: It's led to some of the concern.\nFive years ago, the FBI itself was screwing up on 30 percent of their queries just meeting their own criteria. We put in place reforms. The screw-up level has dropped from about 30 percent to less than 1 percent.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: We put requirements so that you can no longer do batch queries. We got to make sure FBI agents have to show a national security purpose.\nIf a journalist or a political figure or a religious figure were even to be queried \u2013 queried about, you have to get approval from either the director to the deputy director or head of the National Security Division. We think we've got a very strong reform bill. It's why it passed the Senate.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, so much to talk to you about. Good to have you here in person.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Thank you, Margaret.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Alaska Republican Senator Dan Sullivan, who is also here with us.\nIt was a busy weekend here in Washington.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN (R-Alaska): Yes, Margaret, good to be back on the show.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, Senator, this Ukraine aid that finally has moved, President Zelenskyy was on another network this morning, and he said: \"The U.S. will send a signal with this that this will not be a second Afghanistan. The U.S. will stay with Ukraine.\"\nIf Donald Trump wins this next election, can you guarantee the U.S. will stay with Ukraine?\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, listen, I can't guarantee anything, but I \u2013 it's actually good that the president, President Zelenskyy, mentioned Afghanistan, because, Margaret, this gets lost too much.\nI think we got to look at how we got to the situation of Ukraine. I believe strongly that the weakness coming out of the Biden White House \u2013 they cut defense spending, you know, every \u2013 every year, in terms of the president's budget, their energy policies exude weakness, and the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan \u2013 emboldened Putin to undertake the invasion of Ukraine.\nSo, we got to remember, kind of broadly, more strategically, where we are. But, as you know, I was a supporter of the defense supplemental. And I think it's not just going to be important for Ukraine. As you and I have talked about before\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: \u2026 it's going to be really important for the industrial base of America, which has atrophied dramatically. Sixty percent of this bill goes into building weapons\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: \u2026 everything from submarines to 155\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: In many Republican districts too, which is why it's so surprising it took so long to get through the House.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, all over the place.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: So, I think it's important.\nBut, again, you know, a lot of this, in terms of where we are on Ukraine\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: \u2026 from my perspective, comes from the weakness of the Biden administration\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: \u2026 and, you know, the president's inability\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: \u2026 to actually make the case on Ukraine. He's given two speeches on Ukraine in the last two years.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And all his speeches do is kind of villain \u2013 villainize another part of the Congress.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You \u2013 you \u2013 we \u2013 we could\u2026\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: He hasn't tried to bring people together.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We could have a historical argument for the next hour\u2026\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, the history's important.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 going \u2013 .. going back years about green lights being given to Vladimir Putin around the world by leaders in many countries.\nSo, let's talk about\u2026\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: The history on this is important.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm not saying it's not, but let's talk about the future here\u2026\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Sure. Sure.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 and the signals being sent.\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban met in March with Donald Trump at Mar-A-Lago, and then he gave an interview. And in that interview, he said that Trump told him: \"He will not give a penny to fund Ukraine. And that is why the war will end because Ukraine cannot stand on its own feet.\"\nWe know he's not a fan of President Zelenskyy. So why do you think he will be persuaded? He might win this election.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nWell, listen, I mean, President Trump put out a statement recently where he thought it was important to support \u2013 support Ukraine. He actually also mentioned the Europeans need to do more. And he actually mentioned something, as I just said, that it was very unlikely the war would have started had he still been in the White House. So\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Russia hadn't withdrawn from Ukraine. You know, they'd gone in 2014. So, this argument over Trump would have made a difference, it didn't make a difference during his four years in office.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, I mean, I think the \u2013 again, the broader \u2013 the broader issue\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: \u2026 particularly between Biden and Trump right now, you know, where are we? Is the world a safer place for the United States and our allies today as it was four years ago?\nI think the \u2013 the answer to that is unequivocally no. But let \u2013 let's get back to your question.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I do think that the Republican Party in the House and in the Senate is still very much the peace-through-strength party.\nThis is the tradition of Republicans, Reagan, the Bush presidencies, Eisenhower, Teddy Roosevelt, and \u2013 and\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you just talking about the Senate, or the House? Because there were more Republicans in the House who voted against Ukraine aid than voted for it.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, but, actually, look at some of the other votes. There was a vote. Republicans in the House 2-1 rejected an amendment to strip funding for Ukraine, 2-1 one in the House. And I \u2013 and, look\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That was Marjorie Taylor Green's effort you're talking about.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct. And \u2013 and, you know, we'll see what the Senate does this Tuesday on this bill.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: One of the things that I think the speaker did a good job on with regard to this legislation is, actually, \u2013 he actually improved it for a whole host of reasons.\nBut I \u2013 I predict that you'll probably see a majority of Senate Republicans supporting this legislation.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And, like I said, peace through strength, this is important because\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: \u2026 Donald Trump was part of that tradition very much. You remember President Obama cut defense spending by 25 percent his second term.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: He gutted readiness. This is what Democrats sen \u2013 con \u2013 presidents do.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Biden did it. Obama did it.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to \u2013 I'm going to talk about some of these mixed messages in the House with our congressmen ahead, Senator.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: OK, but, look, I mean\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But it's not \u2013 it's not so clear.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: But I think our party is the peace through strength party. One of the dangers, in my view\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But, as just said, you can't guarantee a Trump administration and what they do.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, nobody can guarantee anything. But\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But he hasn't even endorsed this bill publicly.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, he came out with a statement\u2026\n(LAUGHTER)\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: \u2026 just last week saying something that, you know, Ukraine was important.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: No, he says: \"Everyone agrees Ukrainian survival and strength should be much more important to Europe than to us, but it's also important to us.\"\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \"Get moving, Europe.\"\nThat was the best that Republicans got out of him.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, I \u2013 I think \u2013 I \u2013 I\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: David Cameron from U.K.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Let me make one other point on this.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The Polish president.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I think that we're \u2013 we're\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: \u2026 kind of giving Joe Biden a bit of a pass on, not just, as I mentioned how we got here, but the execution of the Ukraine effort.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: As you know, literally, every major weapon system that the Ukrainians have said they need, from HIMARS, Patriots, Stingers, tanks, F-16s, now ATACMS, every single weapon system, this administration delays, delays, because they're scared of, you know, making Vladimir Putin mad.\nThe Senate \u2013 you saw Mark Warner there a second ago.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: You interviewed him. In a bipartisan way, we come in and we say, Mr. President, you have to give them these weapons systems.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: They finally relent. Think about where we'd be Margaret, if, you know, a year-and-a-half ago, we would have gotten all these weapons systems to Ukrainians. They have\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Or six months ago, if Republicans in the House actually held a vote to do what they did just yesterday.\nBut I need to move on to the climate\u2026\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: OK. OK.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 because I know you're also passionate about this and what the Biden administration just announced about your state of Alaska.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The president wants to conserve 30 percent of U.S. lands as part of his climate change efforts.\nAnd he has limited oil and gas drilling in parts in the National Petroleum Reserve\u2026\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 to protect polar bears and other things. And then he also blocked a role \u2013 road \u2013 excuse me \u2013 crucial to operating a copper and zinc mine.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You said this is suicidal and lawless.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: It was. And\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Those are strong words.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, it's lawless. He doesn't have the authority to do it.\nAnd I could go into all the laws that support me on that. It's, as I say, national security suicide. Look, this president won't sanction the Iranian oil and gas regime. You may have seen Senator Blumenthal and I put a \u2013 sent a letter to the president on Friday, saying you need to do that.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: But he has no problem sanctioning Alaska.\nThis \u2013 this administration has issued 63 executive orders and executive actions singularly focused on Alaska to shut our state down. Now, that, of course, hurts my constituents. But, Margaret, the national resources, energy, critical minerals, that's an American strength.\nThis should concern all kinds of Americans. I will mention one final thing that I really wanted to highlight here. You know, I have been in the Senate nine years. I have never seen such a cynical and dishonest display coming out of any presidency\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: \u2026 when this president on Friday, with Secretary Haaland\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: \u2026 announced that they did this because the Alaska Native, the indigenous people\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: \u2026 on the North Slope of Alaska asked them to, they wanted them to.\nThese \u2013 the leaders of the North Slope of Alaska were unanimous in opposition to this.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: They tried to meet with Secretary Haaland. She wouldn't meet with them.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: This is a rule that focuses on their lands\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: \u2026 where they've been living for thousands of years.\nAnd then the president says, well, I did it because the indigenous people of Alaska wanted it.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: That is a lie.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Wow.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And I \u2013 it is a lie. And go\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We\u2026\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Go see what the indigenous people of Alaska from that part of my state said.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: They're very upset.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I know there's \u2013 there's some\u2026\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And the president was canceling their voices and now stealing their voices. It was really a despicable move.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, we have to leave it there because of the break, but I know you could talk with me on this perhaps again in the future\u2026\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Thank you.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 more in depth.\nWe'll be right back.\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Oklahoma Republican Congressman Tom Cole.\nGood morning.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE (R-Oklahoma): Morning.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, you were the lead sponsor on Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan bills. And I know this was a big decision for the speaker to hold the vote at all.\nThe Polish prime minister tweeted: \"Speaker Johnson, thank you. Better late than too late. And I hope it is not too late for Ukraine.\"\nHow do you measure the cost of inaction over the past six months?\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Well, first of all, the Senate only passed the bill 65 days ago.\nAnd it's not like the speaker didn't have other things to do. He had to get all the appropriations done, had to do FISA.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: This was an emergency. They were running out of ammunition\u2026\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: You know, and \u2013 well, again\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 when they asked for it.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: The \u2013 the\u2026\n(LAUGHTER)\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: \u2026 administration waited a while. The Senate took a while, and we had other business under way.\nBut it got done, got done in a bipartisan way. He showed incredible leadership. And, frankly, he gave us a rule that is a structure in which we considered all these different matters where every single member got to vote the way they wanted to on every single issue.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: That wasn't the case in the Senate. And I think, actually, when they follow the example we have, you will see more support for Ukraine than we probably saw in their original vote.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But, to be fair, we're not talking about a policy debate \u2013 debate that doesn't have a direct impact on the battlefield.\nI mean, the supreme allied commander testified before Congress on April 10 the Ukrainians are being outshot by the Russian side 5-1 because of this debate, the delay.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: I'm sorry. Democracy is a \u2013 kind of a messy business.\nAnd the reality is, it's done. So it moved through. It moved through on a very bipartisan basis.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: More Republicans voted against it than voted for it.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Well, look, it's about an even split.\nAnd, quite frankly, if you want to \u2013 want to look at the hardcore Republican opposition, go to the motion to recommit, or look at the bill to strip funding from Ukraine. It's about 2-1, actually 3-1 one on the motion to recommit.\nThis is politics. There is such a thing as a \"Vote no, hope yes\" crowd in every caucus. I can go down that list and tell you the members who said, OK, you got the votes. You don't need me. So, I think there's actually much more\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That would be a fun game with you, actually.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Well, it is a fun game.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Because I \u2013 I could pick a few of those names off that list.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: And, look, it's \u2013 it's \u2013 it's politics. I'm not critical of anybody.\nThe reality is, we have overwhelming bipartisan support for each part of this package. It was structured in a way that it allowed members to both make the points they wanted to make and, frankly, if they needed political cover, do it. But it got done.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: So, I'm \u2013 I'm pretty proud of the speaker.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I \u2013 I want to talk to you more on the other side of this break, but just you are in there acknowledging, when you say, \"Vote no, hope yes,\" that there were Republicans who had to vote no\u2026\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Well, they felt they had to.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 because of the political pressure and the fight within your own party.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: People don't \u2013 no, it's not \u2013 again, people make\u2026\n(CROSSTALK)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But who wanted it to pass?\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: You think nobody makes political calculations in the United States Senate or in the administration?\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Yes.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Welcome to American politics.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: But the point is, look at the numbers. Look at overwhelming bipartisan numbers\u2026\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to do that\u2026\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: \u2026 over and over.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 on the other side of this break.\nStay here, please.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Got it.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back.\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be back in just a moment.\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.\nWe want to continue our conversation now with Oklahoma Republican Congressman Tom Cole.\nCongressman, before the break we'd been talking about this vote the House had yesterday to approve the $95 billion package. There was a decision here for Speaker Johnson that was an important one. He basically put his job on the line. As we know, there's this movement among House conservatives, led by Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, to try to oust him from power, in part because of this Ukraine aid bill.\nDo you think this is a real threat to his leadership?\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Well, I take anything seriously. But, no, I don't. Look, I think it's a relatively small number of Republican members, frankly just as it was in McCarthy's case. There were only eight people.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: But the point is, I don't think there's unified Democratic support. There was unified Democratic support to remove the speaker. I think both sides have now seen how dangerous this is, how irresponsible it is. And, quite frankly, I think it's unlikely that Democrats who supported Ukraine, not as many supported Israel as we would have liked, but they did support Ukraine, I think they're unlikely to remove the speaker over that. All told to be fair, they removed McCarthy after he did what he asked them to do, which was keep the government funded. But, again, I don't think that's going to happen in this case. But if somebody wants to do it, it's within the rules and they can take their shot.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But what you're saying there is that Democrats you trust would protect Speaker Johnson from being ousted because they wouldn't vote to -\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Well, I think, frankly - I don't think you'd lose very many Republicans. We didn't lose very many Republicans with McCarthy. So, it doesn't take very many Democrats to either not vote or oppose it. And I don't - frankly, I don't think we'd lose the same number of Republicans that we lost with Kevin McCarthy. I think even people that disagree with the speaker -\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You wouldn't get to eight Republicans?\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: I don't think so.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: They've gotten to three, Marjorie Taylor Greene says there's (ph) three.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Look, I think there's a lot of people that like this speaker, that respect this speaker, even when they disagree with him. They know he's honest, he's a straight shooter. They also had a taste of what it's like to go without a speaker for three weeks. I don't think they want that again. I certainly don't think they want it close to an election.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Former Speaker Gingrich said, \"the demons that Matt Gaetz unleashed by going after Kevin McCarthy are still out there. You can't govern by shooting yourself in the head every day.\"\nHow does Speaker Johnson get anything done?\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Well, first of all, he just got a lot done. He's gotten every appropriations bill passed. He's gotten FISA through. He just got this consequential - so he's actually been -\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he has to rely on Democratic votes, which he's being faulted for by members of his party.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: No. Well, that's fine. I mean, honestly - no, there - every appropriations bill is bipartisan at the end of the day. They just work that way. So, most of these - and something like FISA ought to be bipartisan. I actually think he's, you know, empowered the center, and marginalized the extremes on - on each side.\nNow, is there some risk to that? Sure. But the point is, he's gotten a lot done. I think people admire him. They genuinely like him. They all respect him. Every single Republican voted for him. I don't think that any other person could have done that at the time other than Mike Johnson. So, the reservoir of goodwill is enormous. I think he's much stronger than the people seem to think, and I think he's demonstrated that by what he's passed.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: (INAUDIBLE) Republicans - first of all, do you think Republicans, after November, will have the majority?\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: I do.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And if so, he could be re-elected.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: I do because I think we're likely to win the presidency. I think this is pretty simple. I used to do politics for a living. I guess I still do. But the reality is, the person that wins a presidency is probably going to take the House. It's close enough that that probably makes a difference. I think we'll win. So, I think we will have the House.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, good to have you here in person.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Great privilege. Thank you.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Overnight, Israeli defense forces launched a deadly series of air strikes on the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, but there's also been an uptick of violence in the West Bank.\nOur Debora Patta reports.\n(BEGIN VT)\nDEBORA PATTA (voice over): Every ten minutes a child is killed in Gaza says the United Nations. That's nearly 15,000 children in almost seven months.\nHere, paramedics rush to save the injured after yet another Israeli air strike in Rafah. For this little girl, it was too late. Her grief-stricken father is inconsolable. He is not alone. In this room there are only the bodies of children.\nOvernight, at least ten more names added to that endless list of horror. The youngest, just two years old.\nOur CBS News team in Gaza reports that among the dead was a pregnant woman. Miraculously, doctors saved her baby girl.\nHere, Israel Defense Force soldiers prepare for a mission, but this is not in Gaza. It's IDF footage of a two-day operation in the West Bank city of Tulkarm, where they say they have been rooting out militants. At least 14 Palestinians were killed.\nDEBORA PATTA: The IDF pulled out last night, leaving this massive destruction in its wake. It's on a scale, residents say, they've never seen before.\nDEBORA PATTA (voice over): This morning, they were mopping up the damage. Israeli soldiers used bulldozers to smash through the area, destroying streets, buildings and infrastructure.\nThe West Bank has reached a boiling point. Nearly 500 Palestinians have been killed since October 7th and there are ongoing clashes with Israeli settlers, which escalated after a 14-year-old settler was found dead over a week ago.\nThe U.S. has imposed new sanctions on West Bank settlers and a U.S. official told CBS News that since 2022 it's been investigating an IDF unit of ultra-orthodox soldiers accused of human rights atrocities with an announcement expected this week.\nDEBORA PATTA: The unit is stationed here in the West Bank. Media reports suggesting it could be blacklisted from receiving U.S. military aid prompted an angry outburst from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said any sanctions imposed on the IDF would be a moral low when it is fighting in Gaza.\n(END VT)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That was our Debora Patta.\nAnd we're joined now by \"New York Times\" White House and national security correspondent David Sanger. His latest book \"New Cold Wars\" is out now.\nDavid, good to see you again.\nDAVID SANGER (White House and National Security Correspondent, \"New York Times\"): Great to be with you, Margaret.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Where do we begin? The world truly is on fire.\nDAVID SANGER: It is.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And one of the things I like about your book is, you write, going all the way back to listening to the Nixon-Kennedy debates, and hearing those candidates hash out America's role in the world, and geostrategy. In this election, we don't even know if the candidates will have a debate. Meanwhile, the world's on fire.\nHow do the American \u2013 members of the American public need to think about the global competition the United States is in the middle of?\nDAVID SANGER: Well, it's a very different competition than what we had in the Cold War. You know, those Nixon-Kennedy debates were, you know, at the height of the moment of a U.S. contest against the Soviet Union, which was terrifying and nuclear. But there was a simplicity about it. You know, there was a predictability about it. We understood who controlled their nuclear weapons. They understood who controlled ours. We knew who to call.\nThe new cold wars are quite different, Margaret. We've got Russia and China coming together in a periodic partnership. I wouldn't say it's a full alliance. We have other players, like Iran and North Korea, as you were discussing with earlier guests, supplying them, becoming sort of what the Iranians call an axis of resistance to the U.S. It is a far more volatile, I think far more dangerous period than we had even then.\nAnd yet, as you point out, our ability to discuss it as a nation has somewhat degraded. You watch those Kennedy-Nixon debates and put aside who was sweating and who looked young and vigorous and all that -\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\nDAVID SANGER: It was an incredibly sophisticated argument largely about nuclear deterrence. I'm afraid that we're not having that incredibly sophisticated argument today, you know, 60 years - more than 60 years later.\nBut the vote yesterday, which you've been discussing about Ukraine, at the end of the day turned out to be a fairly overwhelming vote in favor of the U.S. pushing against the Russians in Ukraine and perhaps beyond.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Certainly overwhelmingly yes for Democrats. A bit split for Republicans.\nDAVID SANGER: A majority of Republicans voted - voted against.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nDAVID SANGER: But it passed - it passed comfortably.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It passed. It did.\nAnd I - it's just - I think it's such an interesting point you make, though, in sort of changing how we think about competition with Russia and China. We learned Friday that the U.S. is likely to lose a significant counterterrorism base in the African country of Niger because the government demanded troop withdraw. I think a lot of Americans didn't even know that there was 1,000 U.S. troops there fighting or working in the counterterrorism space. Russia is moving in.\nDAVID SANGER: That's right.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: China is getting and carving out a large amount of influence in Africa. What are the fronts in the new cold war?\nDAVID SANGER: Well, there are a couple of different ones. You point out one in Africa. Also an area that China has been wiring up with Huawei equipment and so forth. So, we are concerned, you know, rightly so, that U.S., in not having a competitor straight on to put in 5G equipment may be losing the opportunity to help bind the continent together.\nIn the book I take you to the Solomon Islands, a place the U.S. fought for in World War II, and scored a big victory, but now has basically moved over into China's camp. There's still some contest underway.\nBut to answer your question more broadly, if you believe that there is something of a new iron curtain coming down, a place where you're going to divide the U.S., the NATO nations, against China, Russia, Iran, others, it's somewhere in that border land between Ukraine and Russia. And that's why the bill that went through Congress was so important.\nI don't know if it's enough to turn the tide. The Ukrainians may have lost so much time and ammunition here that it may be too late. But certainly had it not passed, that was pretty much, by the judgment of the CIA director, Bill Burns, and others, going to be the end of the contest. The Russians almost certainly would have surged forward.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And China has made clear they have a stake in Russia winning in Ukraine. It is this competition.\nDAVID SANGER: That's right. And, you know, if we had those debates again, and as you say, who knows if we will, I think the most interesting -\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Or even those interviews.\nDAVID SANGER: Or even - that's right.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Substantial interviews with conversations about national security interests of America. I mean, we should.\nDAVID SANGER: That's right. And, you know, President Biden has been reluctant to have, you know, major sit down interviews, at least with the print organizations. But I think if we did have those interviews, I think one of the big questions is, what is your plan to get in the midst of the Russia-China combination?\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nDAVID SANGER: Because the core of what Nixon and Kissinger were doing in the early '70s, in recognizing China, was to prevent Russia and China from coming together.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You also make this interesting point about the dynamic that's so different given, first of all, they're so economically intertwined, the United States and China. But also the business community and technology and the role that plays in this version of competition.\nA top U.S. cyber official told you companies, not the U.S. government, have all the insight these days. How do we know when an attack's coming?\nDAVID SANGER: Yes. The book opens with the days running up to the war in Ukraine. And while there was certainly lots of indicators coming from American satellites and signals intelligence and so forth, in the end one of the key indicators that the Russians were getting ready to roll came from Microsoft, whose engineers were noticing that malware that had been placed by the Russians on Ukrainian government agencies were being activated and sent a notice through their channels, which ultimately went to the White House.\nAt the end of the day, what kept Ukraine running was some combination of Microsoft and Amazon moving all of their data to the cloud and then Elon Musk coming in and providing Starlink so they could communicate to that cloud.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Incredible.\nDAVID SANGER: Something we never saw in the old cold wars.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: David, it's a fascinating read. It's good to see you in person. And we'll have to leave it there.\nDAVID SANGER: Thank you.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Pennsylvania's governor, Josh Shapiro, is standing by waiting for us.\nWe'll be right back.\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro. He joins us this morning from Abington, Pennsylvania.\nAnd, Governor, thank you for sticking with us. We've been having some transmission technical issues, so hopefully we don't get interrupted.\nI'll get - I'll get straight to it.\nGOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA): Good, I look forward to the conversation. Thanks.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'll get straight to it, Governor.\nYou have been outspoken against the rising and troubling anti-Semitism in this country. I know the FBI director said just a few days ago that federal law enforcement is concerned about lone actors targeting gatherings ahead of the start of Passover, which starts tomorrow. Are there known threats in your state?\nJOSH SHAPIRO: Well, there's not known threats right now. And I can tell you, the Pennsylvania State Police, working in coordination with our federal and local partners, are all over this and will let folks know in communities if there are specific threats.\nBut we continue to work closely with law enforcement and community leaders to do everything we can to take down the temperature, to address the rise in anti-Semitism, islamophobia, other forms of hate. There should be no place for that here in Pennsylvania. Of course, Pennsylvania founded on the vision of William Penn, a place that would be a place of tolerance and welcome and peace. A place where people could come together and practice their faith, whatever their faith is.\nWe have a special relationship with that here in this commonwealth where we respect all, no matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love or who you choose to pray to. And we're going to continue to do everything we can to make sure everyone feels protected in this commonwealth.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there should be no place for it anywhere in America. And I know you agree with that.\nLet me get to the politics of the moment.\nPresident Biden won the state of Pennsylvania in 2020 narrowly. He spent a lot of time in your state this past week. We've seen in our polling his approval rating among young voters aged 18 to 29 has dropped 12 points since February, from 55 percent to 43 percent today.\nHow does the president get that back?\nJOSH SHAPIRO: I think the president gets it back doing exactly what he's doing, showing up, talking about his record, addressing things like climate change, which are incredibly important issues for young voters, along with many others, obviously. Making sure that young people feel included in the conversation, not just as a vote, but as part of the governing coalition going forward.\nYoung people helped propel me to victory as governor. One of the first things I did was start what I believe is the first ever next gen engagement commission here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. A place where young people, quite literally, advise me on policy, meet with me regularly, give me their perspective on what's happening in the community.\nI think part of the frustration by young people is that that - they oftentimes don't feel heard.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nJOSH SHAPIRO: And they feel like their voices and their votes are taken advantage of come election time. This is a moment where the young people deserve to be at the table. And the fact that the president is showing up in these communities and talking about these issues that are going to help young people in the future I think is a really important step.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, last weekend Donald Trump was campaigning in Pennsylvania. It's so key. Here's what he said.\n(BEGIN VC)\nDONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Biden has imposed a savage natural gas export ban that's putting countless Pennsylvania jobs at risk. He's risking your lives. He's risking your jobs. But he doesn't care because all he cares about is the green new scam.\n(END VC)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He is speaking to real fear among some of your constituents about President Biden's decision to, at least temporarily, put a pause on new natural gas projects. How do you respond to that?\nJOSH SHAPIRO: Look, I've been very clear with the White House and publicly. I hope that this pause that they put in place is very quick and then we move forward.\nHere in Pennsylvania, our energy economy has powered this nation, and it has done so over many generations. And going forward I think Pennsylvania has an opportunity to be the center of the clean energy economy. Thanks to the president, we're the only state in the nation with two regional hydrogen hubs.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But just to - just -\nJOSH SHAPIRO: Thanks to the president, we've been able to work together -\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry, just - you broke up at the beginning. I think you said you've been very clear to the White House that you hope this is a short pause. Does that mean you agree it is costing your state jobs and money?\nJOSH SHAPIRO: Well, I think if the pause goes on for a long time it has the potential to cost us jobs. That's why I want this to be as quick as possible.\nAnd what I went on to say, though, is, we have an opportunity here in Pennsylvania to be the center of the clean energy economy. Thanks to President Biden, we have two regional hydrogen hubs. Thanks to President Biden, we are capping methane emissions from abandoned wells. We have billions of dollars of tax credits and other resources coming from the Department of\nEnergy to help us through a transition.\nHere in Pennsylvania, we're showing that we can both protect the jobs that exist today and create more energy jobs tomorrow. Energy is critical to the future of our commonwealth.\nNow, listen, the bravado and the bluster from the former president do nothing to actually create jobs in Pennsylvania. He's got an abysmal track record when it comes to that. President Biden has a strong record. And we're going to continue to lead on energy here in Pennsylvania.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned young voters and how key the issue of climate is to them. The Biden administration touts the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA, as a green energy bill, even though it wasn't named that. But CBS polling shows half of Americans have not heard much or nothing at all about what the administration has done. Only 14 percent say they've heard a lot. Two-thirds don't know if their state has gotten federal funds for climate change projects. This seems a real vulnerability for Democrats when it comes to young voters.\nJOSH SHAPIRO: Let me be very clear, climate change is real, it is serious and we have to address it. And Joe Biden understand that. Donald Trump has made fun of climate change and denies its existence. So, there's a clear contrast in this race.\nBecause of the federal dollars that have flowed to Pennsylvania, as I mentioned a moment ago, we are positioned to get two regional hydrogen hubs that are going to help us combat climate change. We're addressing all kinds of infrastructure needs here in the commonwealth, from repairing roads and bridges, to making sure people are connected to the internet, to making sure families in Esplen, which is a minority - predominantly minority community in Pittsburgh, no longer need to drink water out of the lines that contain lead thanks to Joe Biden cleaning that up.\nSo, when it comes to infrastructure investments, when it comes to the kind of investments that are going to help spur on a clean energy economy, President Biden has been there.\nNow, we have to make that case. And we've got to make sure folks understand that and hear that. That's why you run a campaign. That's why you'll see stark differences when it comes to combatting climate change between the policies of President Biden and what Donald Trump has done in the past and wants to do in the future.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the messaging needs work is what you're saying?\nJOSH SHAPIRO: Well, I think the case - I think the case needs to be made.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nJOSH SHAPIRO: There's a wonderful track record. There's a wonderful body of work. They need to make that case.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nJOSH SHAPIRO: And I'll be helping make that case alongside the president.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask about something that has been really damaging your state, and that is drug addiction. Pennsylvania has - I'm sorry, excuse me, the number one public health crisis in Pennsylvania, according to the state, is opioids. The CDC says Pennsylvania recently saw the highest number of xylazine related deaths in the country.\nWhat is driving the addiction?\nJOSH SHAPIRO: Well, listen, 13 Pennsylvanians die every single day from an opioid overdose. It is unacceptable. And here in Pennsylvania we're trying to come at it with a multipronged approach.\nFirst, we have to understand that drug addiction is a disease, not a crime. Now, we have to invest in law enforcement. And I have. We've increased the number of state troopers by 400 and I'm looking to add another 400. As attorney general, I arrested over 8,000 drug dealers. So, we're not going soft on those who are peddling these poisons in our community.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nJOSH SHAPIRO: But we also have to make sure that treatment is available. As attorney general, I led a national coalition that ended up holding those drug companies accountable.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Yes.\nJOSH SHAPIRO: The very people that brought this crisis into our communities and brought $2 billion back to Pennsylvania for treatment.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK. I'm - I'm sorry to interrupt you.\nJOSH SHAPIRO: This is really critical stuff and it's going to require a multipronged approach.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry I have to interrupt you. We have to leave it there, Governor. Thank you.\nWe'll be back.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/21/a1537d73-eca5-4c3c-b012-277cd03ecf5a/thumbnail/1200x630/ff2c4b61dad1b5960a677ad727eda658/0421-ftn-page2-2852798-640x360.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@facethenation","_score":2.3740962,"_id":"6715e718bc2c12ee92f8c8401b8953a5"}],"user_input":{"q":"conservative","search_in":["title_summary_en"],"lang":["en"],"not_lang":null,"countries":null,"not_countries":null,"from":"2024-04-15 00:00:00","to":null,"ranked_only":"True","from_rank":null,"to_rank":null,"sort_by":"relevancy","page":1,"size":100,"sources":["cbsnews.com"],"not_sources":[],"topic":null,"published_date_precision":null}}
