            "summary": "Washington — The Senate is set to convene for the impeachment trial of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday afternoon, with the Democratic-led upper chamber obliged to take on the House GOP-backed impeachment effort.\nSenators will be sworn in as jurors at 1 p.m. for the proceedings, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said. How long the trial will last remains to be seen, but Democrats are hoping to bring it to a swift end.\nSchumer, a New York Democrat, announced that the upper chamber would convene in accordance with impeachment rules shortly after House Republican impeachment managers transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate on Tuesday. Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat and the president pro tempore of the chamber, will preside over the trial.\nThe House voted to impeach Mayorkas in February, and the Senate's rules dictate that the upper chamber is compelled to convene as a court of impeachment after the articles have been delivered by the House impeachment managers. Tuesday's transmission came after months of delay and kickstarted the trial process in the Senate.\nBut once senators are sworn in, the 51-member Democratic majority, which includes three independents, will likely be able to move to quickly dismiss or delay the trial not long after it gets underway — if Democrats can remain united.\nMeanwhile, Senate Republicans have encouraged Schumer to hold a comprehensive trial. Last week, all but six members of the conference signed on to a letter demanding that the Senate \"properly adjudicate\" the House's impeachment effort.\nSome of those Senate Republicans are expected to employ procedural maneuvers to slow the process down on Wednesday, unless they can reach an agreement with Democratic leadership to allow for limited time for discussion on the Senate floor.\nSen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, told reporters on Tuesday that Senate leadership was mulling a time agreement that would allow limited debate before a vote to ultimately dismiss or table the trial, estimating that it would take \"the better part of the afternoon\" or into the evening and would offer \"an opportunity to build our case.\" But an agreement appeared out of reach on Wednesday.\nReps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Mark Green and other impeachment managers carry the articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas into the Senate Chamber on Capitol Hill on April 16, 2024.\nAndrew Harnik / Getty Images\nThe articles of impeachment\nHouse Republicans in January released two articles of impeachment against Mayorkas, accusing him of \"willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law\" and a \"breach of public trust.\" After an initial attempt failed, the House voted narrowly in February to impeach the secretary under the articles, with three Republicans and all Democrats opposing.\nIn the first article, House Republicans argue that Mayorkas has \"repeatedly violated laws enacted by Congress regarding immigration and border security.\" It accuses Mayorkas of overstepping his authority and disregarding federal laws by releasing many asylum seekers into the U.S. and allowing more than 1 million to enter under an authority known as parole.\nThe House Republicans accuse Mayorkas in the second article of \"knowingly making false statements to Congress and the American people and avoiding lawful oversight in order to obscure the devastating consequences of his willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law and carry out his statutory duties.\"\nDHS has denounced the effort, calling it \"baseless,\" while saying that House Republicans \"continue to ignore the facts and undermine the Constitution.\"\n\"Congressional Republicans should stop wasting time with unfounded attacks, and instead do their job by passing bipartisan legislation to properly fund the Department's vital national security missions and finally fix our broken immigration system,\" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement.\nUnder the Constitution, the basis for impeachment is \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" Constitutional scholars argue that the allegations against Mayorkas do not rise to that level.\nAlan He contributed reporting.",

            "summary": "Denver — Colorado's Democratic-controlled House on Sunday passed a bill that would ban the sale and transfer of semiautomatic firearms, a major step for the legislation after roughly the same bill was swiftly killed by Democrats last year.\nThe bill, which passed on a 35-27 vote, is now on its way to the Democratic-led state Senate. If it passes there, it could bring Colorado in line with 10 other states - including California, New York and Illinois - that have prohibitions on semiautomatic guns.\nBut even in a state plagued by some of the nation's worst mass shootings, such legislation faces headwinds.\nColorado's political history is purple, shifting blue only recently. The bill's chances of success in the state Senate are lower than they were in the House, where Democrats have a 46-19 majority and a bigger far-left flank. Gov. Jared Polis, also a Democrat, has indicated his wariness over such a ban.\nLast year, a similar bill died in committee, with some Democratic lawmakers citing concerns over the sweep of a ban and promises they made to their constituents to avoid government overreach affecting most gun owners' rights.\nDemocrats last year passed and Polis signed into law four less-expansive gun control bills. Those included raising the age for buying any gun from 18 to 21; establishing a three-day waiting period between the purchase and receipt of a gun; strengthening the state's red flag law; and rolling back some legal protections for the firearms industry, exposing it to lawsuits from the victims of gun violence.\nThose laws were signed months after five people were killed at an LGBTQ+ nightclub in Colorado Springs last year. Soon, the state will mark the 25th anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School shooting that killed 13 people. Other mass shootings in Colorado include 12 people killed in 2012 at an Aurora movie theater and 10 people killed in 2021 at a Boulder supermarket.\n\"This is the state where the modern era of the mass shooting began with Columbine,\" Democratic Rep. Javier Mabrey said in urging fellow lawmakers to join other states that ban semiautomatic weapons.\nRepublicans decried the legislation as an onerous encroachment on the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment. They argued that mental illness and people who do not value life - not guns - are the issues that should be addressed. People with ill intent can use other weapons, such as knives, to harm others, they argued.\nDemocrats responded that semiautomatic weapons can cause much more damage in a short period of time.\n\"In Aurora, when the shooter walked in that theater and opened fire,\" Mabrey said, \"and in less than 90 seconds shot up a room full of people. That cannot be done with a knife, that can't be done with a knife.\"",

            "summary": "Washington — The Senate convened Wednesday for the impeachment trial of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, when senators were sworn in as jurors and tasked with determining whether Mayorkas should be removed from office.\nMayorkas is all but certain to be acquitted on the impeachment charges, given Democrats' control of the chamber. Just how long the trial will last remains to be seen, but Democrats are hoping to bring it to a swift end.\nSen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat and the president pro tempore of the chamber, is presiding over the trial. Murray administered an oath to senators to mark the official start of the trial Wednesday afternoon. Senators then took turns signing an oath book, an indication of the gravity of the proceedings.\nThe House voted to impeach Mayorkas in February, accusing him of refusing to enforce immigration laws and a \"breach of public trust.\" He is just the second Cabinet official in U.S. history to be impeached. House Republicans transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate on Tuesday. Some of the House impeachment managers, including Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona and Clay Higgins of Louisiana, observed the proceedings from the Senate floor.\nSenators swear an oath to act as impartial jurors before the impeachment trial of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in the Senate on Wednesday, April 17, 2024.\nSenate TV\nThe 51-member Democratic majority, which includes three independents, planned to move to quickly dismiss or delay the trial over the objections of Republicans, who have encouraged Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to hold a comprehensive trial. Last week, all but six members of the Republican conference signed on to a letter demanding that the Senate \"properly adjudicate\" the House's impeachment effort.\nSome of those Senate Republicans were expected to employ procedural maneuvers to slow the process down on Wednesday, unless they reached an agreement with Democratic leadership to allow for limited time for discussion on the Senate floor.\nSchumer said on Wednesday morning that senators would seek an agreement for a period of debate time to \"accommodate the wishes\" of GOP colleagues, allowing them to offer a vote on trial resolutions and allow for points of order before moving to dismiss. He said the matter was \"the least legitimate, least substantive and most politicized impeachment trial ever in the history of the United States.\"\n\"If our House Republicans want to have a debate about the border, Democrats are glad to have it,\" Schumer said. \"But instead of wasting time on impeachment, we should debate bipartisan legislation to secure our border once and for all.\"\nReps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Mark Green and other impeachment managers carry the articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas into the Senate Chamber on Capitol Hill on April 16, 2024.\nAndrew Harnik / Getty Images\nThe articles of impeachment\nHouse Republicans in January released two articles of impeachment against Mayorkas, accusing him of \"willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law\" and a \"breach of public trust.\" After an initial attempt failed, the House voted narrowly in February to impeach the secretary under the articles, with three Republicans and all Democrats opposing.\nIn the first article, House Republicans argue that Mayorkas has \"repeatedly violated laws enacted by Congress regarding immigration and border security.\" It accuses Mayorkas of overstepping his authority and disregarding federal laws by releasing many asylum seekers into the U.S. and allowing more than 1 million to enter under an authority known as parole.\nThe House Republicans accuse Mayorkas in the second article of \"knowingly making false statements to Congress and the American people and avoiding lawful oversight in order to obscure the devastating consequences of his willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law and carry out his statutory duties.\"\nDHS has denounced the effort, calling it \"baseless,\" while saying that House Republicans \"continue to ignore the facts and undermine the Constitution.\"\n\"Congressional Republicans should stop wasting time with unfounded attacks, and instead do their job by passing bipartisan legislation to properly fund the Department's vital national security missions and finally fix our broken immigration system,\" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement.\nUnder the Constitution, the basis for impeachment is \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" Constitutional scholars argue that the allegations against Mayorkas do not rise to that level.\nAlan He contributed reporting.",

(KDKA) - Election Day is just one week from Tuesday, April 23, and this region has one Senate seat where both parties have contested primaries next Tuesday.\nIn his ongoing series on primary contests, KDKA-TV political editor Jon Delano explains this race is to fill the seat of a retiring state senator.\nBoth Democrats and Republicans are picking their nominees to replace retiring state Sen. Jim Brewster, a Democrat in the 45th state senatorial district that stretches from Plum and Monroeville into the Mon Valley to Elizabeth and forward and westward into the South Hills to Castle Shannon.\n\"It's one of the five senatorial districts in Allegheny County. There are 50 state senators in Pennsylvania,\" said Rep. Nick Pisciottano, a Democrat from West Mifflin.\nRep. Pisciottano is one of the Democrats seeking this office. He's not alone on the ballot in the 45th District.\n\"[The district] was redistricted, so this is the first election we are having in the new district,\" said Makenzie White, a Brentwood Democrat.\nThe other Democrat, Makenzie White, is a social worker and public health professional from Brentwood. White says the district doesn't need another politician in Harrisburg.\n\"I felt like it was time that we had representation from our community that understood the struggles that most of us are facing every day, and I also felt like it was time that we had more people with human services backgrounds,\" White said.\nPisciottano, elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 2020, is a certified public accountant, and he cites his experience in both the private and public sectors.\n\"When you want to send somebody to the state senate, you want to have somebody who has the experience in Harrisburg, who has the relationships, both here in Allegheny County and Harrisburg, to be able to hit the ground running on day one and to be able to argue loudly for my future constituents,\" Pisciottano said.\nRepublicans also have two candidates running for this office: Kami Stulginskas of Munhall and Jennifer Dintini of Plum Borough.\nDintini is a small businesswoman.\n\"I own two businesses: AmGard and 3G Security Solutions, and we provide contract security guard service,\" Dintini said.\nDintini, who has never held an elective office, wants to bring economic opportunity back to a region she says has lost out.\n\"If we keep electing the same kinds of politicians to Harrisburg, we're going to keep getting the same result,\" Dintini added.\nDespite many requests, Stulginskas has not made herself available for interviews. In her campaign filing, she describes herself as a consultant.\nVoters in both parties will pick their nominees on April 23.",

Kevin Boyle to go on leave\nPennsylvania House Republicans call on State Rep. Kevin Boyle to go on leave\nHARRISBURG, Pa. (CBS) -- A Pennsylvania House Democrat introduced a resolution on Thursday that could expel State Rep. Kevin Boyle as he faces charges for violating a protection from abuse order.\nHouse Majority Leader Matt Bradford, a Democrat who serves part of Montgomery County, introduced a resolution that could expel a member of the house if the person is determined unfit to serve.\nThe resolution would form a five-person subcommittee to investigate whether the person can effectively serve their constituents. The subcommittee would look into whether the person suffers from a \"temporary or permanent impairment, physical or mental, rendering a member unable to discharge the duties of office.\" It would also include looking into whether the person has a history of substance abuse or a decline in cognitive abilities.\nThe resolution will be called up for debate when the House returns to session, which could happen as soon as April 29.\nEarlier this week, Philadelphia police issued an arrest warrant for Boyle for violating a protection from abuse order. Sources said Boyle texted his estranged wife, which is a violation of that order. He's yet to turn himself in.\nIn 2021, Boyle was arrested and charged with harassment and violating a protection order filed by his estranged wife. At the time, his attorney called it a domestic issue.\nBoyle, a Democrat, represents Pennsylvania District 172, which covers parts of Montgomery County and Northeast Philadelphia. He has represented the district since 2011 and is seeking his eighth term.\nBoyle's brother, Congressmember Brendan Boyle, who represents Pennsylvania's Second District, released a statement that Kevin's struggle with mental illness is a \"nightmare\" for their family.\n\"Like any family who has a beloved member with a serious health issue, we are doing the best we can to help him get better,\" the statement read, in part.\nThe resolution comes as the Pennsylvania primary is approaching on April 23. Democrats currently control the Pennsylvania House with a slim majority.\nRepublicans are also hoping to flip Boyle's seat in the House in the general election.\nBoyle will face Sean Dougherty, who has the support of the state party, raising $72,000 from the PA House Democratic Campaign Committee, according to campaign finance reports, in the primary.\nIf you or someone you know is in emotional distress or suicidal crisis, call or text the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 988.

            "summary": "Washington — A third Republican joined the effort to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson from his post on Friday, making it more likely that Democrats will have to save him if it comes to a vote.\nRep. Paul Gosar of Arizona announced he was signing onto the motion to vacate against Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, after the House advanced a foreign aid package with more Democratic votes than Republican support.\n\"I have added my name in support of the motion to vacate the Speaker,\" Gosar said in a statement. \"Our border cannot be an afterthought. We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neo-cons and the military industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away.\"\nA number of right-wing hardliners have lashed out at Johnson for omitting border security provisions from the package. The House is expected to vote on final passage on the legislation, which includes aid for Israel, Ukraine, the Indo-Pacific region and other foreign policy priorities, on Saturday.\nThe effort to oust Johnson has been spearheaded by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. She has dangled the threat over his head for weeks, warning him against holding a vote on funding for Ukraine, but she has so far not moved to force a vote and has not said when she would. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky is also supporting the resolution.\nGreene said Thursday she had not forced the vote yet because \"I'm a responsible person.\"\n\"I'm not acting out of emotions or rash feelings or anger,\" she said. \"I'm doing this the right way.\"\nAhead of Friday's procedural vote, Johnson said he was not worried about his job.\n\"I don't worry,\" he said. \"I just do my job.\"\nJohnson said Wednesday he had not asked Democrats to help him.\n\"I have not asked a single Democrat to get involved in that at all,\" he said. \"I do not spend time walking around thinking about the motion to vacate. I have a job to do here, and I'm going to do the job, regardless of personal consequences, that's what we're supposed to do. If Marjorie brings the motion, she brings the motion and we'll let the chips fall where they may.\"\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wouldn't explicitly say Friday whether Democrats will bail him out, saying the caucus \"will have a conversation about how to deal with any hypothetical motion to vacate, which at this point hasn't been noticed.\"\n\"Marjorie Taylor Greene, Massie and Gosar are quite a group,\" the New York Democrat said. \"I'm sure that will play some role in our conversation. But central to the conversation, the prerequisite to the conversation, is to make sure that the national security legislation in totality is passed by the House of Representatives.\"\nNikole Killion, Ellis Kim, Jaala Brown and Laura Garrison contributed reporting.",

            "summary": "Washington — The Senate convened Wednesday for the impeachment trial of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, when senators were sworn in as jurors and tasked with determining whether Mayorkas should be removed from office.\nMayorkas is all but certain to be acquitted on the impeachment charges, given the Democratic majority in the chamber. Just how long the trial will last remains to be seen, but Democrats are hoping to bring it to a swift end.\nSen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat and the president pro tempore of the chamber, is presiding over the trial. Murray administered an oath to senators to mark the official start of the trial Wednesday afternoon. Senators then took turns signing an oath book, an indication of the gravity of the proceedings.\nThe House voted to impeach Mayorkas in February, accusing him of refusing to enforce immigration laws and a \"breach of public trust.\" He is just the second Cabinet official in U.S. history to be impeached. House Republicans transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate one day before the trial, and some of the House impeachment managers, including Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona and Clay Higgins of Louisiana, observed the proceedings from the floor.\nSenators swear an oath to act as impartial jurors before the impeachment trial of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in the Senate on Wednesday, April 17, 2024.\nSenate TV\nThe 51-member Democratic majority, which includes three independents, planned to move to quickly dismiss or delay the trial over the objections of Republicans, who have encouraged Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to hold a comprehensive trial. Last week, all but six members of the Republican conference signed on to a letter demanding that the Senate \"properly adjudicate\" the House's impeachment effort.\nSome of those Senate Republicans were expected to employ procedural maneuvers to slow down the process, unless they reached an agreement with Democratic leadership to allow for limited time for discussion on the Senate floor.\nSchumer said earlier Wednesday that senators would seek an agreement for a period of debate time to \"accommodate the wishes\" of GOP colleagues, allowing them to offer a vote on trial resolutions and allow for points of order before moving to dismiss. But when he tried to move forward with an agreement under unanimous consent, Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Missouri Republican, objected.\n\"I will not assist Sen. Schumer in setting our Constitution ablaze,\" Schmitt said.\nThe move threw the chamber's next steps into question. Following the objection, Schumer raised a point of order asserting that the charge in the first impeachment article does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense under the Constitution.\nThe articles of impeachment\nHouse Republicans in January unveiled two articles of impeachment against Mayorkas, accusing him of \"willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law\" and a \"breach of public trust.\" After an initial attempt failed, the House voted narrowly in February to impeach the secretary under the articles, with three Republicans and all Democrats opposing.\nIn the first article, House Republicans argue that Mayorkas has \"repeatedly violated laws enacted by Congress regarding immigration and border security.\" It accuses Mayorkas of overstepping his authority and disregarding federal laws by releasing many asylum seekers into the U.S. and allowing more than 1 million to enter under an authority known as parole.\nThe House Republicans accuse Mayorkas in the second article of \"knowingly making false statements to Congress and the American people and avoiding lawful oversight in order to obscure the devastating consequences of his willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law and carry out his statutory duties.\"\nDHS has denounced the effort, calling it \"baseless,\" while saying that House Republicans \"continue to ignore the facts and undermine the Constitution.\"\n\"Congressional Republicans should stop wasting time with unfounded attacks, and instead do their job by passing bipartisan legislation to properly fund the Department's vital national security missions and finally fix our broken immigration system,\" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement.\nUnder the Constitution, the basis for impeachment is \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" Constitutional scholars argue that the allegations against Mayorkas do not rise to that level.\nAlan He contributed reporting.",

Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, could incriminate his wife when he heads to trial next month to fight charges that he traded his political influence for cash, gold bars and a luxury Mercedes, according to newly unsealed court documents.\nA legal brief from Menendez's lawyers said the senator might testify about communications with his wife that will demonstrate \"the ways in which she withheld information\" from her husband \"or otherwise led him to believe that nothing unlawful was taking place.\"\nThe disclosure about Menendez's possible defense strategy, which had been redacted, was unsealed by a federal judge at the request of several news organizations, including CBS News.\nMenendez was indicted in September on charges alleging he and his wife, Nadine, accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bribes while using his power and influence to enrich and protect three New Jersey businessmen and benefit the government of Egypt.\nLater, a superseding indictment alleged Menendez and his wife conspired to act as a foreign agent for Egypt and accepted expensive gifts in exchange for favorable comments about Qatar. The latest indictment unsealed in March accused the duo of obstructing the investigation into the alleged yearslong corruption scheme.\nMenendez and his wife have pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.\nThe New Jersey senator's trial is scheduled to begin in early May, while Nadine Menendez is set to be tried separately. The federal judge delayed her trial until at least July while she undergoes surgery to treat a medical condition.\nAccording to her lawyers, Nadine Menendez is suffering from a \"serious medical condition that will require a surgical procedure.\" They said the surgery would take place within weeks, and she might need \"possibly significant follow-up and recovery treatment.\"\nErica Brown and Pat Milton contributed reporting.",

            "summary": "Some members of Congress who led the investigation into former President Donald Trump's role in the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot acknowledge they've talked to their families about their safety — and the risk of their arrest — if Trump wins a second term in November.\nIn a series of interviews with CBS News, House Democrats who helped lead the House Jan. 6 select committee and some of the police witnesses who testified before it predicted they'd be targeted for retribution by a future Trump administration.\nTrump raised the prospect of future arrests of some of the Jan. 6 committee participants in a social media post on March 18. Referring to the panel's vice chair, former Rep. Liz Cheney, Trump wrote, \"She should go to Jail along with the rest of the Unselect Committee!\"\n\"My wife and I have had conversations about what life would look like if the worst happened,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who was one of seven Democrats on the Jan. 6 select committee. Speaking to CBS News near the House chamber between votes last week, Schiff said, \"You can't avoid the conversations about 'What if?' And I have to think about my own personal safety.\"\nRep. Pete Aguilar, who chairs the House Democratic Caucus and was a member of the Jan. 6 committee, told reporters last week that he takes Trump's threat of jailing seriously. But Aguilar, noting the proximity of the Washington, D.C., jail to the U.S. Capitol, smiled and wryly noted, \"My family has told me that they're going to come to D.C. either way — and they'll visit me, no matter where I am.\"\n\"One of the things that I observed during our Jan. 6 committee work was that when Trump says something, he intends to do it,\" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, another California Democrat who helped lead the panel.\n\"I take that lesson to heart,\" she told CBS News. \"When he says various things, I think that's what he means he'll do.\"\nShe acknowledged she has been harassed by some Trump supporters.\n\"He's going to weaponize the Department of Justice...and use it to go after people like myself,\" former Washington, D.C. police officer Michael Fanone told CBS News. Fanone testified at a 2021 public hearing of the committee and has been an outspoken Trump critic, accusing him of employing authoritarian rhetoric.\n\"He's telling us exactly what he plans on doing,\" Fanone said.\nHarry Dunn, a former U.S. Capitol Police officer who also testified before the select committee, told CBS News, \"Trump means what he says. Anybody who has testified against him, or spoken out in a public capacity, should be worried.\" Dunn, who is seeking the Democratic Party's nomination for a U.S. House seat in Maryland, said the threat of arrest \"is a little scary to think about, but you have to continue to do the right thing.\"\nThe Trump campaign did not respond directly to questions about whether Trump intends to pursue arrests of the Jan. 6 committee members.\n\"Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Liz Cheney, and the Corrupt Democrats on the sham January 6th Committee have lied to the American public for years, denied key witnesses from testifying to the truth, and covered up evidence that proved President Trump, nor any of his supporters, ever engaged in an alleged 'insurrection.' Their entire narrative is a lie and Americas know that Joe Biden is the true threat to democracy,\" a Trump spokeswoman said in a statement to CBS News.\nTrump's March 18 social media post prompted criticism from scholars who study the rhetoric and practices of authoritarian regimes.\n\"This sort of post is not what you want to see out of your political leaders in a healthy democracy,\" said Erica Frantz, a political science professor at Michigan State University. Frantz, who specializes in authoritarian politics, told CBS News that calls by political leaders \"to jail their political opponents are red flags in terms of potential slides to authoritarianism.\"\nFrantz said when political figures talk about jailing some critics, it can have a chilling effect on others.\n\"It's intended to invoke fear among them and deter them from speaking out against Trump,\" she said. \"The more that critics are silenced, the more leaders with authoritarian ambitions are able to get away with their power grab.\"\nThe select committee executed a high-profile investigation of Trump that included a series of nationally televised public hearings. The committee spoke with hundreds of witnesses, including Trump's top White House aides, as it reviewed his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The committee voted to refer criminal charges to the Justice Department for Trump and accused him of threatening the future of democracy and inciting the violent Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol.\nThe committee was disbanded in late 2022, after Republicans won control of the House. Two of its members lost their campaigns for reelection, including Cheney. Two others retired from the House.\nSome committee members have reported being targeted by threats and harassment by Trump supporters.\nOne senior U.S. House aide said a presidential candidate's threats to jail legislators for public speech and legislative work also run afoul of the Speech and Debate Clause, which protect the independence of Congress.\nOne senior U.S. House aide said a presidential candidate's threats to jail legislators for public speech and legislative work also run afoul of the Speech and Debate Clause, which protect the independence of Congress.\nIn remarks to reporters last week, Aguilar said Trump's ongoing rhetoric raises the risk of continued harassment, threats and danger to public officials. Aguilar said, \"Trump wants to act like those dictators he hosts at Mar-a-Lago. That's difficult rhetoric, and it's not anything that any of us, any of the members under this Dome take lightly.\"",

            "summary": "Washington — The House is set to vote Saturday afternoon on a $95 billion foreign aid package, a pivotal moment for House Speaker Mike Johnson as he tries to stave off a right-wing rebellion.\nThe package consists of four bills that will be voted on separately and then combined into one before being sent to the Senate. The first three bills include $60.8 billion to help Ukraine in its war with Russia; $26.4 billion to support Israel, which is fighting Hamas and Iran; and $8.1 billion to counter China in the Indo-Pacific. Humanitarian aid for Gaza, which Democrats said was necessary for their support, is also included.\nThe fourth bill would allow the sale of frozen assets of Russian oligarchs to help fund future aid to Ukraine, potentially force the sale of TikTok and authorize stricter sanctions on Russia, China and Iran.\nThe speaker said separating the bills will allow members to vote their \"conscience\" on each one.\nJohnson, a Louisiana Republican, unveiled the package earlier this week amid increasing pressure from other congressional leaders and the White House to hold a vote on a similar $95 billion package that passed the Senate in February. The Senate package has sat idle in the House for months as the speaker debated a path forward, and as he has faced threats from a small number of Republicans, who oppose sending more aid to Ukraine and want border measures, to hold a vote on dethroning him.\n\"This is the best possible product that we can get under these circumstances, to take care of these really important obligations,\" Johnson said Friday.\nHe said that if he hadn't moved forward with his plan, an effort to bypass him and force a vote on the Senate bill would have gained more support. House Democrats tried to use a rarely successful legislative maneuver known as a discharge petition to do just that, but are short of the 218 signatures needed.\n\"We would have had to eat the Senate supplemental bill,\" Johnson said.\nThe effort to oust Johnson had three Republican backers as of Friday afternoon: Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona. Gosar announced his support after more Democrats than Republicans on Friday voted to advance the package, setting it up for final passage on Saturday.\nThe rebellion puts Johnson's job at risk if Democrats don't step in to save him if the group of hardliners forces a vote. But Greene hasn't given a timeline for if and when she plans to force a vote.\nJohnson has stood behind his decision to bring up Ukraine aid for a vote. Citing classified briefings he's received, Johnson called the aid \"critically important\" in pushing back on Russian aggression.\n\"If I operated out of fear over a motion to vacate, I would never be able to do my job,\" Johnson said earlier this week.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Friday the upper chamber would \"move expeditiously\" to send the package to President Biden, who has said he will sign it.\nJaala Brown and Ellis Kim contributed reporting.",

            "excerpt": "Despite a growing threat to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Tom Cole said he's \"much stronger than people seem to think.\"",
            "summary": "Washington — Rep. Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican who leads the House Appropriations Committee, said Sunday that despite a growing threat to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, he's \"much stronger than people seem to think,\" noting that \"the reservoir of goodwill is enormous.\"\n\"I actually think he's, you know, empowered the center and marginalized the extremes on each side,\" Cole said on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday. \"Now, is there some risk for that? Sure. But the point is, he's gotten a lot done. I think people admire him. They genuinely like him.\"\nThe Louisiana Republican has faced pushback in recent weeks for his handling of the government funding process, prompting Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, to file a motion to vacate, threatening to bring up a vote for his ouster. That frustration was bolstered by his shepherding of a foreign aid package that the House approved on Saturday, which some conservatives also opposed. And though Greene has yet to commit to a timeline for bringing up a vote on Johnson's removal, she's gained some backers in recent days.\nThe effort to oust Johnson now has three public Republican supporters: Greene, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona, who announced his support for the effort on Friday. Republicans have a razor-thin majority at the moment, so Johnson can only afford to lose one vote unless they get support from Democrats.\nRep. Tom Cole on \"Face the Nation,\" April 21, 2024.\nCBS News\nBut Cole made clear that \"it's a relatively small number\" of Republicans who would support a motion to oust Johnson, saying he doesn't anticipate that \"we'd lose the same number of Republicans that we lost with Kevin McCarthy,\" who was last year the first speaker to be removed from his post in October under similar circumstances.\n\"There's a lot of people that like the speaker, that respect the speaker, even when they disagree with him,\" Cole said. \"They know he's honest, he's a straight shooter. They also had a taste of what it's like to go without a speaker for three weeks. I don't think they want that again.\"\nJoining the eight Republicans who voted to boot McCarthy from the post was every Democrat. And the same might not be true for Johnson. Cole said he doesn't believe there's unified Democratic support to remove Johnson, saying that it's unlikely for Democrats who supported the foreign aid package, particularly its aid for Ukraine, to vote to oust the speaker.\n\"I think both sides have now seen how dangerous this is, how irresponsible it is,\" Cole said. \"But if somebody wants to do it, it's within the rules and they can take their shot.\"",

            "summary": "The director of Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign in Wisconsin, who pushed allegations of widespread fraud that were ultimately debunked, has been hired to run the Republican Party of Wisconsin heading into the November election.\nAndrew Iverson will serve as executive director of the Wisconsin GOP as it prepares to host the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July, the state party announced Friday. He takes over for Mark Jefferson, who left in February to serve as executive director of the Tavern League of Wisconsin.\nIverson, a graduate of Wisconsin Lutheran College, most recently worked as regional political director for the Republican National Committee. He previously worked on campaigns in Wisconsin for U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil. In 2020, Iverson was the state director for Trump Victory, a joint operation of the Trump campaign and the RNC.\nIt was in that role following Trump's narrow loss in Wisconsin in 2020 that Iverson told other operatives two days after the election to support claims that Trump had actually won. His comments came as Trump's campaign was suing in other battleground states and preparing to request a recount of the two largest Democratic counties in Wisconsin.\nBiden defeated Trump by nearly 21,000 votes in Wisconsin in 2020, a result that has withstood independent and partisan audits and reviews, as well as lawsuits and the recounts Trump requested.\n\"Here's the drill: Comms is going to continue to fan the flame and get the word out about Democrats trying to steal this election. We'll do whatever they need (inaudible) help with. Just be on standby in case there's any stunts we need to pull,\" Iverson said in the recording of a meeting two days after the November election that was obtained by The Associated Press.\nWisconsin was a big part of Trump's victory in 2016, when he smashed through the Democrats' \"Blue Wall\" in the Upper Midwest, and his campaign fought hard to keep the swing state in his column four years later before his loss to Biden. Wisconsin is one of a few battleground states this year that could go either way in the rematch between Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\"At the end of the day, this operation received more votes than any other Republican in Wisconsin history,\" Iverson said in the 2020 recording. \"Say what you want, our operation turned out Republican or DJT supporters. Democrats just got 20,000 more than us, out of Dane County and other shenanigans in Milwaukee, Green Bay and Dane. There's a lot that people can learn from this campaign.\"\nIverson's comments came after Trump sued in other states and before be brought a case in Wisconsin seeking to overturn his loss. The Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected that case in December 2020.\n\"My earnest assessment of each party's performance in the 2020 election was unfortunately misconstrued due to both a poor choice of words on my part\" and a lack of context, Iverson said in a statement Monday. He said that his comments should be viewed in light of the fact that they \"came two days after the election and before any recount had begun in Wisconsin.\"\nWisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming said in a statement that he was \"thrilled\" with the hiring of Iverson.\n\"His wide breadth of experience and ability will prove crucial for us winning in November,\" Schimming said in a statement. \"Wisconsin will decide the 2024 race. Andrew Iverson is the right man for the job in this pivotal election.\"\nIn addition to the presidential race, Wisconsin has a high-profile U.S. Senate race pitting Democratic incumbent Sen. Tammy Baldwin against Republican businessman Eric Hovde.\n\"Wisconsin is the cornerstone of the Republican Party's chances this November,\" Iverson said in a statement. \"I am eager to get to work on behalf of all of our candidates to take back the White House and usher in a new era of conservative leadership.\"",

One of those races is in the 32nd District.\nFor nearly 40 years, the Penn Hills area had but one state representative, Tony DeLuca. When he died in 2022, the 32nd District in Oakmont, Penn Hills, Verona and half of Plum reelected him posthumously.\nThat led to a special election in February of 2023 when Joe McAndrew, a 33-year-old legislative and party staffer was elected in a special election after he was chosen by a ballot of party committee people to be the nominee. It was a big generational shift from the 85-year-old DeLuca.\n\"We really need somebody who is going to look at what those needs really are for my generation and the generation below and above me and making sure there is opportunity for people,\" said McAndrew.\nMcAndrew's Democratic primary challenger is Pauline Calabrese, the mayor of Penn Hills and a 63-year-old attorney. Calabrese says McAndrew was nominated by people he appointed to the Penn Hills Democratic Committee.\n\"Mr. McAndrew was picked by political insiders. The voters have never had a chance to have a primary election. I think they deserve a choice, and I'm going to give them that,\" said Calabrese.\nCalabrese cites her hands-on experience as mayor now in her second term and says it's not McAndrew's age that is the issue.\n\"I am not going to hold that against him, but the voters need to know that he has no prior experience in public office. He ran for mayor of Oakmont and did not win that election, so he moved to Penn Hills. I have lived in Penn Hills for about 26 years. He's lived in Penn Hills for about 26 months,\" Calabrese said.\nMcAndrew says his family has lived in Penn Hills since 1955 and he recently bought his great-grandparents' home. As for the experience, McAndrew touts his office's work helping 11,000 residents and his subcommittee appointment as a freshman.\n\" I was made subcommittee chair on public transportation, and so overall I have been focusing very heavily on making sure my constituents are taken care of, that we have good infrastructure, and that we are moving the ball forward for Pennsylvanians,\" McAndrew said.\n\"I was made subcommittee chair on public transportation, and so overall I have been focusing very heavily on making sure my constituents are taken care of, that we have good infrastructure, and that we are moving the ball forward for Pennsylvanians,\" McAndrew said.\nDemocrats will choose between McAndrew and Calabrese on Tuesday, so far, there is no Republican on the ballot which allows for a write-in candidate, including the two Democrats, to win the Republican nomination.",

Mark Green of Tennessee, one of the House impeachment managers, said as he began reading the impeachment articles on the Senate floor.\nThe upper chamber is compelled by Senate rules to convene as a court of impeachment after the articles have been transmitted. Though the House voted to impeach Mayorkas in February in a historic vote that marked the first time a Cabinet secretary has been impeached in nearly 150 years, House leaders opted to wait until after a government funding fight to present the issue to the Senate. And although they intended to begin the process last week, Senate Republicans made a push to delay the proceedings until this week amid concerns over attendance.\nHouse impeachment managers deliver articles of impeachment for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to the Senate at the Capitol on April 16, 2024.\nJULIA NIKHINSON/AFP via Getty Images\nBut even after the GOP push to delay the articles' transmission, the duration of the trial in the Democratic-controlled Senate, where the effort is widely seen as a political stunt, has not been determined.\nThe impeachment push in the House\nMany Republicans in Congress want to punish Mayorkas for the Biden administration's handling of the U.S.-Mexico border, claiming that the secretary has failed to enforce the nation's laws and stop tens of thousands of migrants from crossing the border.\nDHS has denounced the effort as \"baseless,\" saying that House Republicans \"continue to ignore the facts and undermine the Constitution\" with the impeachment push.\n\"Congressional Republicans should stop wasting time with unfounded attacks, and instead do their job by passing bipartisan legislation to properly fund the Department's vital national security missions and finally fix our broken immigration system,\" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement.\nIn January, House Republicans released two articles of impeachment accusing Mayorkas of \"willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law\" and a \"breach of public trust.\" In February, after an initial attempt failed, the House voted narrowly to impeach Mayorkas under the articles, with three Republicans and all Democrats opposing.\nThe first article outlines how House Republicans say Mayorkas \"has repeatedly violated laws enacted by Congress regarding immigration and border security.\" By releasing many asylum seekers into the U.S. and allowing more than 1 million to enter under an authority known as parole, the resolution accused Mayorkas of overstepping his authority and disregarding federal laws.\nThe second impeachment article accuses Mayorkas of \"knowingly making false statements to Congress and the American people and avoiding lawful oversight in order to obscure the devastating consequences of his willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law and carry out his statutory duties.\"\nStill, constitutional scholars argue that the allegations against Mayorkas do not rise to the level of impeachable offenses. Under the Constitution, the basis for impeachment is \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" And although enough House Republicans supported the impeachment effort in the lower chamber, the effort is all but certain to die in the Senate.\nThe Senate's role in impeachments\nUnder the Constitution, the House has the \"sole Power\" of impeachment, while the Senate has the authority to hold a trial. Impeachment is only the first step toward removing an official from office, followed by a Senate trial, which could result in removal. But how that trial proceeds is largely up to the Senate's Democratic majority.\nAfter the House transmits the articles of impeachment to the upper chamber, the chamber must schedule a trial to begin the next legislative day, according to Senate rules. After the Senate has convened, the majority makes the calls. With 51 seats controlled by Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, the majority can speed up, delay or dismiss the impeachment outright.\nSenators are expected to be sworn in as jurors on Wednesday. Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat and the president pro tempore of the Senate, will preside.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said after the GOP delay last week that \"our plan over here has not changed — the Senate is ready to go whenever the House is.\"\n\"We want to address this issue as expeditiously as possible,\" Schumer said. \"Impeachment should never be used to settle policy disagreements, that sets an awful precedent.\"\nJohnson and the 11 impeachment managers penned a letter to Schumer last month saying they would present the articles of impeachment to the upper chamber on April 10 and urging the Senate leader to schedule a trial \"expeditiously.\" Among the impeachment managers are Green, Michael McCaul of Texas, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Ben Cline of Virginia, Andrew Garbarino of New York, Michael Guest of Mississippi, Harriet Hageman of Wyoming, Clay Higgins of Louisiana, Laurel Lee of Florida, August Pfluger of Texas, and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.\n\"If he cares about the Constitution and ending the devastation caused by Biden's border catastrophe, Senator Schumer will quickly schedule a full public trial and hear the arguments put forth by our impeachment managers,\" Johnson said in a statement.\nNikole Killion contributed reporting.",

            "excerpt": "Hogan hopes to become the first Republican in more than 40 years to win a Senate seat in deep-blue Maryland, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1 statewide.",
            "summary": "STEVENSVILLE, Md. (AP) — Andy DePaola welcomed Larry Hogan to his family's restaurant with a big smile and a handshake. The warning came a few minutes later.\nDePaola, the 64-year-old namesake of DePaola's Bagel and Brunch here in Maryland's conservative Eastern Shore, whispered to a reporter that Hogan better avoid disparaging former President Donald Trump.\n\"I'm a Trumper,\" DePaola said as Hogan posed for pictures and made small talk with the excited breakfast crowd on a recent Friday morning. \"I think Larry would be better off if he kept how he felt about Trump under his breath.\"\nThe brief exchange during a weeks-long bus tour illustrates a stark political reality for the popular Republican former governor, who has single-handedly transformed Maryland's sleepy Senate race into a top-tier contest in the national fight for the Senate majority. Hogan, who was perhaps the most outspoken anti-Trump Republican governor in the nation, can ill afford to lose any pieces of his delicate and diverse political coalition.\nHe's hoping to become the first Republican in more than 40 years to win a Senate seat in this deep-blue state, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1 statewide, with much of the Democratic support in Baltimore and the suburbs of Washington. Over the next six months, Hogan will have to fend off political threats from all sides.\nAs Trump loyalists eye the 67-year-old businessman with skepticism, Democrats are counting on abortion rights to make Hogan's historic challenge even harder. But the R after his name may ultimately prove the most serious liability for Hogan in a state Trump lost by 33 points four years ago.\nIf Hogan wins Maryland's open Senate seat, Republicans would almost certainly claim the majority in the U.S. Senate — and with it, the power to control the agenda and judicial nominations for the next two years, at least.\nIn an interview, Hogan confirmed he would caucus with Republicans in Washington, despite his concerns about Trump's grip on the party. He also vowed not to leave the GOP after the election, even if Trump returns to the White House.\n\"I'm a real Republican,\" Hogan told The Associated Press, noting that he does not identify with Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement.\nWhen pressed to explain his concerns about MAGA, and whether he views Trump as a threat to U.S. democracy, Hogan parsed his words carefully.\n\"I think certainly there has been some threats,\" Hogan said. \"But you know, I think that's not what this campaign is really all about.\"\nMeanwhile, Hogan's opponents on the left are only just beginning to organize as Democrats wade through their own nomination process. While Hogan faces token opposition in the GOP, Democrats will pick Hogan's general election opponent next month.\nOn Tuesday, a coalition of labor, immigration and progressive groups gathered in the state capital to criticize the former governor for using his veto powers to block legislation to increase abortion access while undermining other Democratic priorities, including health care, environmental protection and education funding.\nThe anti-Hogan event was a reminder that voters in his gubernatorial elections may have been more willing to overlook party affiliation than they will be in a Senate contest that could tilt the balance of power in Washington toward Republicans.\n\"Despite him claiming to be a moderate, we know his actions show that he's a staunch Republican,\" said 1199 SEIU political director Ricarra Jones, who slammed Hogan's veto of legislation to increase the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n\"The Senate race in November is bigger than just Maryland,\" she continued. \"A Republican-dominated Senate would pursue a drastically different agenda, one that could unwind years of progressive achievements and reshape Maryland's policy landscape in ways that could take generations to reverse.\"\nMeanwhile, Hogan is trying to avoid divisive political disputes as he reintroduces himself to Maryland voters during a low-profile \"Back to Work\" bus tour across the state.\nPerhaps the nation's most vocal anti-Trump Republican governor while in office, Hogan barely mentions Trump's name unless asked about him. He's just as eager to ignore abortion, even though Maryland is among the states that will vote on an abortion referendum this fall — a winning issue for Democrats in red and blue states alike where ballot questions have appeared since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022.\nDemocrats suggest he would support a federal abortion ban, but Hogan insisted in an interview that he would not.\nHe also said he strongly supports in-vitro fertilization and would introduce legislation to protect the practice, an apparent attempt to clarify his position after he declined to say in an Axios interview last month whether he would support such federal protections.\nHe also said he \"would consider voting for\" a Maryland ballot measure this fall that would preserve abortion rights, although he argues that it's unnecessary.\nHogan said abortion doesn't comes up much on the campaign trail. He predicted it wouldn't be \"a deciding issue\" in the election.\nAsked about the issues that matter most to him, Hogan said he's most focused on ending the divisiveness in Washington, followed by the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, crime and the economy.\nBut Hogan largely avoided talking politics at all on his weekend bus tour, preferring to connect with voters on a personal level. He was eager to jump behind restaurant counters to chat with the kitchen staff or pose for pictures welcoming small business owners. And voters, regardless of their party affiliation, embraced him enthusiastically at nearly every stop.\nLanda Mitchell, a 46-year-old old African American woman from Hanover, Maryland, flagged down the governor as he toured small business booths at a weekend boat show. She had met him years ago at a fundraiser for the homeless.\nMitchell said she's not a Republican, but she'd likely vote for Hogan.\n\"He's not far right wing. He's over there, but he's not far far over there,\" Mitchell said with a laugh, adding that she's not sure whether she'll support President Joe Biden this fall because of the state of the economy. \"I'm far from a Trump supporter, but I go into the grocery store today and I cry.\"\nCaroline County Sheriff Donald Baker, who welcomed Hogan on a tour through his office, said he also appreciates the former governor's strong support for law enforcement, noting that the sheriff's office didn't get a single applicant for a recent job posting.\n\"It's gonna be a tough road for him to navigate,\" Baker said of Hogan's political challenge. \"If anybody can do it, I believe Larry Hogan can do it. Why? Because he is a middle-of-the-road kind of guy. He knows how to work with people.\"\nAnd as Democrats fight to link him to Trump's Republican Party, Hogan will take pains to distance himself from Trump — but not too far.\n\"We don't want to alienate Trump voters,\" Hogan told the AP. \"We need Trump voters. And we need a lot of Biden voters. Maryland is tough.\"\nBut he doesn't expect Trump or any other MAGA celebrities to campaign in Maryland on his behalf in the coming months. He said he's not sure if he'll even attend this summer's Republican National Convention, where Trump will formally become the GOP presidential nominee; Hogan skipped Trump's last two nominating conventions as well.\n\"I don't think Trump would help me at all. I ran 46 points ahead of him,\" Hogan said, noting that Trump lost Maryland in 2020 by a bigger margin than any other state in the nation. \"I don't think he needs to campaign in Maryland.\"",

Tony Evers' partial veto powers in a new lawsuit, alleging Evers improperly struck sections of a bill that set up a plan to spend $50 million on student literacy.\nMADISON, Wis. — Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin are challenging Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' partial veto powers in a new lawsuit, alleging Evers improperly struck sections of a bill that set up a plan to spend $50 million on student literacy.\nThe lawmakers filed their suit Tuesday in Dane County Circuit Court. The action centers on a pair of bills designed to improve K-12 students' reading performance.\nEvers signed the first bill in July. That measure created an early literacy coaching program within the state Department of Public Instruction as well as grants for public and private schools that adopt approved reading curricula. The state budget that Evers signed weeks before approving the literacy bill set aside $50 million for the initiatives, but the bill didn't allocate any of that money.\nREAD MORE: Ex-Trump staffer who urged \"fan the flame\" after 2020 loss picked to lead Wisconsin GOP\nREAD MORE: Ex-Trump staffer who urged \"fan the flame\" after 2020 loss picked to lead Wisconsin GOP\nThe governor signed another bill in February that Republicans argue created guidelines for allocating the $50 million. Evers used his partial veto powers to change the multiple allocations into a single appropriation to DPI, a move he said would simplify things and give the agency more flexibility. He also used his partial veto powers to eliminate grants for private voucher and charter schools.\nRepublicans argue in their lawsuit that the partial vetoes were unconstitutional. They maintain that the governor can exercise his partial veto powers only on bills that actually appropriate money and the February bill doesn't allocate a single cent for DPI. They referred to the bill in the lawsuit as a \"framework\" for spending.\nEvers' office pointed Thursday to a memo from the Legislature's nonpartisan attorneys calling the measure an appropriations bill.\nWisconsin governors, both Republican and Democratic, have long used the broad partial veto power to reshape the state budget. It's an act of gamesmanship between the governor and Legislature, as lawmakers try to craft bills in a way that are largely immune from creative vetoes.\nREAD MORE: Wisconsin Republicans fire 8 more Evers appointees, including regents and judicial watchdogs\nREAD MORE: Wisconsin Republicans fire 8 more Evers appointees, including regents and judicial watchdogs\nThe governor's spokesperson, Britt Cudaback, said in a statement that Republicans didn't seem to have any problems with partial vetoes until a Democrat took office.\n\"This is yet another Republican effort to prevent Gov. Evers from doing what's best for our kids and our schools — this time about improving literacy and reading outcomes across our state,\" Cudaback said.\nThe latest lawsuit comes after Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state's largest business group, filed a lawsuit on Monday asking the state Supreme Court to strike down Evers' partial vetoes in the state budget that locked in school funding increases for the next 400 years.",

            "summary": "Washington — Iran's large-scale attack on Israel has turned up the pressure on House Speaker Mike Johnson to hold a vote soon on a foreign aid package that also includes funding for Ukraine and Taiwan.\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Monday criticized Johnson for failing to bring up a $95 billion package for a vote after it was approved by the Senate months ago, in February. Since then, it has languished in the House amid fractures among Republicans over aid to Ukraine.\n\"The gravely serious events of this past weekend in the Middle East and Eastern Europe underscore the need for Congress to act immediately,\" the New York Democrat wrote in a dear colleague letter on Monday. \"We must take up the bipartisan and comprehensive national security bill passed by the Senate forthwith.\"\nJeffries added that \"this is a Churchill or Chamberlain moment,\" referring to the British prime ministers during World War II. Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister from 1937-1940, is best known for the policy of appeasement that failed to stop Adolf Hitler from starting the war.\nHouse Democratic Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts also called on Johnson to hold an immediate vote on the Senate bill. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, have also pushed for a House vote on the bill.\nJohnson, a Louisiana Republican, told Fox News on Sunday that the House would \"try again this week\" to pass wartime aid for Israel in response to Iran's drone-and-missile attack over the weekend that was in retaliation for a strike on an Iranian consulate in Syria earlier this month. But it's unclear whether that will ultimately include aid for Ukraine and Taiwan.\n\"The details of that package are being put together now. We're looking at the options and all the supplemental issues,\" Johnson said.\nFor months, the speaker has faced pressure from defense hawks in both parties to pass the foreign aid legislation to deliver on the U.S. promise to continue to assist Ukraine in its war against Russia amid repeated warnings that Kyiv is running out of ammunition. Johnson has instead considered other ways of delivering the funding, including through a loan, but has yet to unveil a plan.\nThe attack on Israel has renewed urgency in getting the Senate bill over the finish line in the House, but it also threatens Johnson's leadership role as he faces pushback from the right wing of his party, who oppose sending any more aid to Ukraine. If Johnson tries to pass a standalone bill on Israel, he is likely to lose Democratic votes.\nThe conservative House Freedom Caucus warned Johnson against using the situation in Israel to pass Ukraine aid.\n\"The House Freedom Caucus stands unequivocally with Israel. Congress should provide aid to Israel,\" the group said in a statement. \"Under no circumstances will the House Freedom Caucus abide using the emergency situation in Israel as a bogus justification to ram through Ukraine aid with no offset and no security for our own wide-open borders.\"\nWhite House spokesman John Kirby said the White House opposes a standalone Israel bill.\n\"You got two good friends here — Israel and Ukraine — very different fights to be sure, but active fights for their sovereignty and for their safety and security,\" Kirby told reporters during the daily press briefing. \"And time is not on anyone's side here in either case, so they need to move quickly on this, and the best way to get that aid into the hands of the IDF and into the hands of the Ukrainian soldiers is to pass that bipartisan bill that the Senate passed.\"\nNikole Killion and Kaia Hubbard contributed reporting.",

            "summary": "PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — Five state representatives are being challenged by members of their party in next Tuesday's Pennsylvania primary.\nIn his ongoing series on contested primary elections, KDKA political editor Jon Delano takes a close look at one of the more hotly contested battles.\nIn 2022, Summer Lee ran for Congress and state House at the same time. She won both and resigned her state House seat, leading to a special election. Swissvale Councilwoman Abigail Salisbury won that election and said she has already delivered $10 million to the district.\n\"We've done a lot of work with helping the local elected officials to learn how to do grant-writing, identify grant opportunities, how to work with appropriations here in the state Capitol to be able to access money for municipalities, whether that's for paving, capital improvements, any number of things,\" Salisbury said.\nWhile Salisbury is focused on services, her Democratic primary opponent — Wilkinsburg School Board Director Ashley Comans, the wife of Wilkinsburg Mayor Dontae Comans — says she's running to rekindle the progressive momentum begun by Lee.\n\"This particular district has been the catalyst for a lot of the changes that we've been seeing in Allegheny County and really building power to excite voters,\" Comans said.\nBoth Salisbury and Comans call themselves progressives, but Comans has been endorsed by Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato, Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey and Lee.\n\"I will work tirelessly to be a champion and fighter for the needs that we have,\" Comans said. \"And I will also work diligently with our three progressive champions that our community has overwhelmingly supported over the past several years so that we can really bring this vision that we share across this district.\"\nSalisbury says her focus is the 34th District, which includes 12 municipalities and parts of Pittsburgh. She added that while Comans may have Gainey's support, she has the support of eight local mayors in her district.\n\"There was a question at the 14th Ward Independent Democratic Committee meeting where my opponent was asked how she would have voted differently from me,\" Salisbury said. \"And she was unable to identify any vote that I have taken in the past 13 months that she would have voted differently on.\"\nNo Republican has filed for this seat.",

I also condemn those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians.\" A reporter cut off the president's sentence before he could finish.\nMore than 100 people have been arrested at Columbia University since pro-Palestine protesters began occupying the grounds last week, and police arrested 45 protesters at Yale University on Monday after the demonstrators repeatedly refused to vacate the plaza voluntarily. Students at Yale and Columbia are calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and demanding their universities divest from companies connected to Israel. But some Jewish students at Columbia say many of the chants are antisemitic, and they're concerned about their safety.\nSimilar protests have been taking place at other college campuses, including at MIT, Boston University, Emerson College and Tufts University.\nOther top Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, both of New York, have criticized the demonstrations, too. The protests come as Passover is set to begin at sundown Monday.\nCalls are growing for Columbia's president, Nemat \"Minouche\" Shafik, to resign, as Columbia goes fully remote in an effort to deescalate the situation.\nThe entire Republican congressional New York delegation called for Shafik's resignation Monday, accusing her of failing to keep students safe.\n\"The ongoing situation that has unfolded is a direct symptom of your continued lax enforcement of policy and clear double standards,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"Your failure to enforce the rules on campus has created an environment in which students and outside agitators know they are able to operate with impunity and without any accountability. While the rot is systemic, the responsibility rests squarely on your shoulders.\"\nGOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York, who was just outside Columbia University Monday, \"Everybody has the right to protest. They have the right to voice their opinion. The moment you turn that into physical assaults or threats against others is the moment you lose that right.\"\nShafik testified before Congress for several hours last week, telling Congress, \"Antisemitism has no place on our campus and I am personally committed to doing everything I can to confront it directly.\"\nSome Jewish congressional Democrats also went to Columbia's campus to offer their support for Jewish students. They did not echo the calls for Shafik's resignation, but demanded the restoration of order.\nAddressing his remarks to the university's administrators, Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, said, \"Stop the double talk and start acting now. Discipline harassers, restore civility on this campus, encourage peaceful, constructive dialogue.\"\nMr. Biden declined Monday to weigh in on Shafik's fate.\nAt the same Earth Day event with Mr. Biden, progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York cited the \"peaceful student-led protests\" at Columbia University and other campuses, highlighting how politically sensitive the politics are with respect to the Israel-Hamas conflict.\nThe president also condemned antisemitism at protests at university campuses in a written statement Sunday night.\n\"Silence is complicity,\" he said. \"Even in recent days, we've seen harassment and calls for violence against Jews. This blatant antisemitism is reprehensible and dangerous – and it has absolutely no place on college campuses, or anywhere in our country.\"\nIsrael continues near-daily aid raids on Rafah, a city in southern Gaza, resulting in the deaths of many civilians, including children.",

            "summary": "Washington — House Republican leadership on Wednesday unveiled the legislative text for three bills that are part of a complicated plan by Speaker Mike Johnson to get aid to U.S. allies while addressing concerns from conservatives.\nThe three bills would provide $26.4 billion to support Israel, $60.8 bill to bolster Ukraine and $8.1 billion to counter China in the Indo-Pacific, including billions for Taiwan.\nThe fourth bill, which is set to be released later in the day, is geared toward addressing other GOP foreign policy priorities. That measure would allow the sale of frozen assets of Russian oligarchs, potentially force the sale of TikTok and authorize stricter sanctions on Russia, China and Iran. House Republicans are also expected to release a border security bill that would be considered separately.\nJohnson said he would give lawmakers 72 hours to review the legislation, teeing up a vote as soon as Saturday.\nThe Louisiana Republican announced the proposal on Monday amid mounting pressure from members in both parties to hold a vote on a bipartisan Senate package that includes support for the U.S. allies. The $95 billion supplemental funding package that passed the Senate in February has stagnated for months in the House as Johnson has debated a path forward.\n\"We won't be voting on the Senate supplemental in its current form, but we will vote on each of these measures separately in four different pieces,\" Johnson told reporters after unveiling his plan to House Republicans on Monday.\nThe divide over foreign aid\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson speaks during a news conference in the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Tuesday, April 16, 2024.\nBill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\nLawmakers expressed new urgency around approving the funds for Israel after it faced unprecedented airstrikes by Iran over the weekend, which came in retaliation for an Israeli strike on an Iranian consulate in Syria. And while Senate leaders and the White House had insisted that the House approving the Senate-passed package would be the most effective way to move forward, Johnson has resisted that pressure in the face of threats from the right flank of his party to oust him.\nForeign aid has highlighted the growing divide within the Republican Party, particularly in the House, where conservatives oppose additional funding to Ukraine.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, has threatened to trigger a vote on ousting Johnson over Ukraine aid. Her effort lacked the public support of any of her GOP colleagues until Tuesday, when Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie signed onto the resolution to remove the speaker, known as a motion to vacate.\nJohnson said he is \"not resigning,\" calling it \"an absurd notion\" that someone would bring a motion to vacate \"when we are simply here trying to do our jobs.\"\nThe conservative House Freedom Caucus on Wednesday accused Johnson of \"surrendering the last opportunity we have to combat the border crisis.\"\nBefore the bills' text was released, a handful of Republican committee chairs backed Johnson's plan and called for the legislation to be passed this week.\n\"There is nothing our adversaries would love more than if Congress were to fail to pass critical national security aid,\" the group said in a statement.\nWith such a narrow majority, Democrats would have to step in to save Johnson if Greene or Massie follow through with forcing a vote. Republicans can afford to lose just two votes if all members are present and voting. Beginning next week, after Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin resigns, Republicans can spare a single vote.\nDemocrats have kept the door open to backing Johnson's plan, as long as it includes aid to the three U.S. allies and humanitarian assistance. House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California said Tuesday they were \"more concerned about the substance\" of the legislation \"than we are the process.\"\n\"If Speaker Johnson's version is missing one of these components, it's highly unlikely Democrats would support it,\" said Rep. Ted Lieu of California, the caucus' vice chair.\nHouse Democratic Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts called Johnson's indecisiveness \"a threat to global security,\" adding that Johnson's effort to pacify his detractors is futile.\n\"How many appearances has he made saying 'I am bringing up Ukraine funding next week'? Here we are. There is no appeasing the Marjorie Taylor Greene's of this conference,\" Clark told reporters Wednesday.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Tuesday morning he is \"reserving judgment\" on the proposal until more details are released, while again calling on the House to vote on the Senate bill.\nThe White House has said it does not support a standalone Israel bill, and two previous efforts to provide aid to Israel since the Oct. 7 terrorist attack by Hamas have failed in Congress. On Tuesday afternoon, White House spokesman John Kirby said administration officials were waiting to see more details on Johnson's plan, but \"it does appear at first blush, that the speaker's proposals will, in fact, help us get aid to Ukraine, aid to Israel and needed resources to the Indo-Pacific.\"\nEllis Kim, Nikole Killion, Cristina Corujo and Gabrielle Ake contributed reporting.",

Not doing enough to prosecute public corruption cases has been — according to some — a weakness of Rundle. This week, Jim's guest is South Miami Mayor Javier Fernandez.\nMIAMI — CBS News Miami's Jim DeFede continues scrutinizing the three-plus decades during which Katherine Fernandez Rundle has led the Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office. Not doing enough to prosecute public corruption cases has been — according to some — a weakness of Rundle. This week, Jim's guest is South Miami Mayor Javier Fernandez.\nHere's why: During the 2020 election, Fernandez was running for state senate as a Democrat. At the time, there was a coordinated and well-financed effort to take out Democratic Senate candidates by using so-called \"ghost candidates\" as a way of siphoning votes away from them. The group allegedly violated campaign finance laws by injecting more than $700,000 in dark money into these ghost candidates.\nFrank Artiles, a disgraced former state senator, was charged with violating campaign finance laws - charges he denies ahead of his trial later this year. Fernandez was one of the candidates whom Artiles allegedly targeted with a ghost candidate.\nGuest: Mayor Javier Fernandez/City of South Miami\nGuest: Mayor Javier Fernandez/City of South Miami",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON, Pa. (KDKA) — In Washington County, some votes are at risk of not being counted.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania is now speaking out after county commissioners voted to not allow voters who made mistakes with absentee or mail-in ballots to make corrections, also known as curing.\nIn a 2 to 1 vote earlier this month, county commissioners voted to not notify voters of mistakes made on the declaration form on the outer return envelope. The county is following the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling. Last month, it ruled that undated or misdated ballots should not be counted in Pennsylvania.\n\"They didn't talk about notice and cure at all. It was not an issue in the case. I was counseling the case. It's not an issue. So, nothing has changed in Pennsylvania law regarding the ability of counties to offer voters an opportunity to correct an error on the declaration on their envelope. Nothing has changed. The only thing that's changed is Washington County,\" said Marian Schneider, senior policy council for voting rights at the ACLU.\nAt least 14,000 ballots were mailed out: 10,379 for Democrats and 3,681 for Republicans This has promoted some to believe Democratic voters may be disproportionately impacted by the county's decision. The chairman of the Washington County Republican Party doesn't believe it's politically motivated.\n\"It's a matter of doing a few things really well. The election office's job is to again accept the vote, tabulate them and report them. That's their job. They are going to do that very well. Adding extra duties on top of that limits what they can do,\" Sean Logue said.\nNearly 7,500 ballots have been received and 133 are deficient.\nKDKA-TV reached out to the county, which sent a statement from Commissioner Nick Sherman:\n\"We have yet to have the chance to review the ACLU letter with our solicitor. Nonetheless, we want to reassert our decision to abide by the majority ruling of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. Accordingly, we will not provide an opportunity to \"cure\" or amend ballots after they have been submitted to the county.\"",

            "summary": "Washington — The Senate convened Wednesday for the impeachment trial of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and quickly dispensed with one of the charges he faces.\nSenators were sworn in as jurors in the afternoon, and tasked with determining whether Mayorkas should be removed from office on charges the House passed in February. Heading into the trial, Mayorkas was all but certain to be acquitted, given the Democratic majority in the chamber.\nAfter the senators were sworn in, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer tried to move forward with an agreement to allow for a period of debate to \"accommodate the wishes\" of his GOP colleagues, who have pushed for a full trial. But when he brought the motion up under unanimous consent, Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Missouri Republican, objected.\n\"I will not assist Sen. Schumer in setting our Constitution ablaze,\" Schmitt said.\nSchumer then asked senators to declare that the charge in the first impeachment article did not rise to the level of a high crime or misdemeanor, the threshold for impeachment under the Constitution. After several GOP attempts to delay, senators ultimately voted 51-48 along party lines in favor of Schumer's point of order. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, voted present.\nSenators swear an oath to act as impartial jurors before the impeachment trial of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in the Senate on Wednesday, April 17, 2024.\nSenate TV\nBefore the vote, Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, argued that Schumer presented no evidence of the claim and motioned to move the impeachment trial into a closed session for debate. His motion fell short.\n\"The majority leader's position is asking members of this Senate to vote on political expediency to avoid listening to arguments,\" Cruz said. \"The only rational way to resolve this question is actually to debate it, to consider the Constitution and consider the law.\"\nSen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat and the president pro tempore of the chamber, is presiding over the trial. Murray administered an oath to senators to mark the official start of the trial Wednesday afternoon. Senators then took turns signing an oath book, an indication of the gravity of the proceedings.\nThe articles of impeachment\nThe House voted to impeach Mayorkas in February, accusing him of refusing to enforce immigration laws and a \"breach of public trust.\" He is just the second Cabinet official in U.S. history to be impeached. House Republicans transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate one day before the trial, and some of the House impeachment managers, including Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona and Clay Higgins of Louisiana, observed Wednesday's proceedings from the floor.\nIn the first article, House Republicans charged Mayorkas with \"willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law,\" arguing he has \"repeatedly violated laws enacted by Congress regarding immigration and border security.\" It accuses Mayorkas of overstepping his authority and disregarding federal laws by releasing many asylum seekers into the U.S. and allowing more than 1 million to enter under an authority known as parole.\nThe second article accused Mayorkas of \"knowingly making false statements to Congress and the American people and avoiding lawful oversight in order to obscure the devastating consequences of his willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law and carry out his statutory duties.\"\nDHS denounced the effort, calling it \"baseless,\" while saying that House Republicans \"continue to ignore the facts and undermine the Constitution.\"\n\"Congressional Republicans should stop wasting time with unfounded attacks, and instead do their job by passing bipartisan legislation to properly fund the Department's vital national security missions and finally fix our broken immigration system,\" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement.\nUnder the Constitution, the basis for impeachment is \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" Constitutional scholars argue that the allegations against Mayorkas do not rise to that level.\nAlan He contributed reporting.",

            "summary": "Record heat, hurricanes, wildfires all have been making news in recent years. And while not everyone agrees events like these are the direct result of climate change, they do connect to peoples' opinions about it: a big majority of Americans feel the U.S. needs to address climate change, with those who report experiencing extreme weather more likely to say we should do so right now.\nViews on climate change have long been associated with partisanship, and they still are, but age is a factor, too. Younger Americans, including younger Republicans, are even more likely to say the U.S. needs to take steps to at least try to slow it.\nThere's a sense of urgency from many in the public, too. A large majority think it needs to be addressed at least in the next few years, including half who think it needs to be addressed right now.\nThere's the sense that we should address climate change, and there's also some belief that we can.\nThat extends down to the personal level, too. Most Americans believe humans can do something to at least slow the effects of climate change, and those who think so feel they personally have a responsibility to do something about it.\nExtreme weather and climate change\nPeople who report having experienced extreme weather in their area in recent years — which is half the country — are more inclined than those who haven't to believe climate change is a major factor contributing to extreme weather, and more of them see the issue as one that needs to be addressed right away.\nAnd even if people don't experience the extreme weather themselves, such events can spark concern. When people hear about the earth experiencing the warmest temperatures on record, more than half say it makes them more concerned about climate change. Those who don't see climate change as a factor in extreme weather are less persuaded by this, including some who don't believe that the earth's temperature is rising.\nYounger people and the political divides on climate change\nMajorities across all age groups favor the U.S. taking steps to address climate change, but it's people under age 45 — many who say they were taught about climate change in school — who are especially likely to be in support of the country taking action.\nThere have long been political divisions on addressing climate change, with Democrats expressing more concern than Republicans. These continue today, to some extent. Democrats are more than twice as likely as Republicans to say climate change needs to be addressed right now. And Democrats overwhelmingly support the U.S. taking steps to reduce climate change, but Republicans are divided on that.\nDivisions in the GOP on climate?\nThe divides within the rank and file GOP we see are along age and ideological lines. Most younger Republicans — those under age 45 — support the U.S. taking steps slow or stop climate change, while most older Republicans do not\nMore moderate Republicans also see climate change as more pressing than those who are more conservative.\nAnd like the public overall, Republicans who report having experienced extreme weather in their local area are more likely to think climate change needs to be addressed.\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,230 U.S. adult residents interviewed between April 16-19, 2024. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as past vote. The margin of error is ±2.7 points.\nToplines",

            "summary": "The following is a transcript of an interview with House Appropriations Committee chair Rep. Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, that aired on April 21, 2024.\nThe following is a transcript of an interview with House Appropriations Committee chair Rep. Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, that aired on April 21, 2024.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Oklahoma Republican Congressman Tom Cole. Good morning.\nREP. TOM COLE (R-OK): Good morning.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you were the lead sponsor on Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan bills. And I know this was a big decision for the speaker to hold the vote at all. The Polish Prime Minister tweeted, \"Speaker Johnson, thank you. Better late than too late. And I hope it is not too late for Ukraine.\" How do you measure the cost of inaction over the past six months?\nREP. COLE: Well, first of all, the Senate only passed the bill 65 days ago. And it's not like the Speaker didn't have other things to do. He had to get all the appropriations done.\n(CROSSTALK)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It was an emergency - they were running out of ammunition.\n(CROSSTALK)\nREP. COLE: Well, again, this administration waited a while, the Senate took a while, and we had other business underway, but it got done and got done in a bipartisan way. He showed incredible leadership. And frankly, he gave us a rule that is the structure in which we considered all these different matters where every single member got to vote the way they wanted to on every single issue. That wasn't the case in the Senate. I think actually, when they follow the example we have, you'll see more support for Ukraine than we probably saw in the original vote.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But to be fair, we're not talking about a policy debate -debate that doesn't have a direct impact on the battlefield. I mean, the Supreme Allied Commander testified before Congress on April 10, Ukrainians are being out shot by the Russian side five to one because of this debate. The delay.\nREP. COLE: I'm sorry, democracy is kind of a messy business. And the reality is, it's done. So it moved through. It moved through on a very bipartisan basis.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: More Republicans voted against it, than voted for it.\nREP. COLE: Well, look, it's about an even split. And quite frankly, if you really want to look at the hardcore Republican opposition, go to the motion to recommit or look at the bill to strip funding from Ukraine. It's about two to one, actually three to one on the motion to recommit. This is politics, there is such a thing as a \"vote no, hope yes\" crowd in every caucus. I can go down that list and tell you the member just said, Okay, you got the votes, you don't need me. So I think there's –\n(CROSSTALK)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That would be a fun game. I would take a few names off that list.\n(CROSSTALK)\nREP. COLE: It's politics. Well, I'm not critical of anybody - the reality is we have overwhelming bipartisan support for each part of this package. It was structured in a way that it allowed members to vote, make the points they wanted to make, and frankly, if they need political cover, do it, but it got done. So I'm, I'm pretty proud of the Speaker.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you more on the other side of this break. But just you are in there, acknowledging when you say \"vote no, hope yes\" that there were Republicans who had to vote no. Because of the political pressure, and the fight within your own party.\nREP. COLE: No, they felt they had to. People –\n(CROSSTALK)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Who wanted it to pass?\nREP. COLE: You think nobody makes political calculations in the United States Senate or in the administration? Welcome to American politics. But the point is, look at the numbers. Look at the overwhelming bipartisan numbers.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to do that -\n(CROSSTALK)\nREP. COLE: Over and over\nMARGARET BRENNAN:-- on the other side of this break. Stay here. We'll be right back.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We want to continue our conversation now with Oklahoma Republican Congressman Tom Cole. Congressman, before the break, we've been talking about this vote the House had yesterday to prove the $95 billion package. There was a decision here for Speaker Johnson, that was an important one, he basically put his job on the line. As we know, there's this movement among House conservatives led by Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene to try to oust him from power, in part because this Ukraine aid bill. Do you think this is a real threat to his leadership?\nREP. COLE: Well, I take anything seriously. But no, I don't. Look, I think it's a relatively small number of Republican members, frankly, just as it was in McCarthy's case, there were only eight people. But the point is I don't think there's unified Democratic support, there was unified Democratic support. To remove the speaker. I think both sides have now seen how dangerous this is how irresponsible it is. And quite frankly, I think it's unlikely that Democrats who supported Ukraine, not as many support Israel, as we would have liked, but they did support Ukraine. I think they're unlikely to remove the speaker with that all though, to be fair, they removed McCarthy after he did what he asked them to do, which was keep the government funded. But again, I don't think that's going to happen this case, but if somebody wants to do it, it's within the rules, and they can take their shot.\nMARGARET BRENNAN:\nBut what you're saying there is that Democrats, you trust would protect speaker Johnson from being as they wouldn't vote to do it.\n(CROSSTALK)\nREP. COLE: I don't think you'd lose very many Republicans. We didn't lose very many Republicans with McCarthy. So it doesn't take very many Democrats to either not vote or oppose it. And I don't- frankly, I don't think we'd lose the same number of Republicans that we lost with Kevin McCarthy. I think even people that disagree with the Speaker--\n(CROSSTALK)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You wouldn't get to eight Republicans, they've gotten to three--\nREP. COLE: I don't think so--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Marjorie Taylor Greene--\n(END CROSSTALK)\nREP. COLE: --look, I- I think a lot of people that like the speaker, that respect the speaker, even when they disagree with him. They know he's honest. He's a straight shooter. They also had a taste of what it's like to go without a Speaker for three weeks. I don't think they want that again, I certainly don't think they want it close to an election.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Former Speaker Gingrich said, \"The demons that Matt Gaetz unleashed by going after Kevin McCarthy are still out there. You can't govern by shooting yourself in the head every day.\" How does Speaker Johnson get anything done?\nREP. COLE: Well, first of all, he just got a lot done. He's gotten every appropriations bill passed. He's gotten FISA through, he just got this consequential--\n(CROSSTALK)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But he has to rely on Democratic votes, which he's being faulted for by members of his party.\nREP. COLE: --so he's actually been, you know- it's- well, that's fine. I mean, honestly- no.\n(END CROSSTALK)\nREP. COLE: Every appropriations bill is bipartisan at the end of the day, they just work that way. So most of these- and something like FISA ought to be bipartisan. I actually think he's, you know, empowered the center and marginalized the extremes on- on each side. Now, is there some risk with that? Sure. But the point is, he's gotten a lot done. I think people admire him. They genuinely like him. They all respect him. Every single Republican voted for him. I don't think that any other person could have done that at the time other than Mike Johnson. So the reservoir of goodwill is enormous. I- I think he's much stronger than the people seem to think. And I think he's demonstrated that by what he's passed.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: If- first of all, do you think Republicans after November will have the majority, and if so, he could be reelected?\nREP. COLE: I do, because I think we're likely to win the presidency. I think this is pretty simple. I used to do politics for a living, I guess I still do. But the reality is, the person that wins the presidency, you're probably going to take the House. It's close enough that that probably makes a difference. I think we'll win. So I think we will have the House.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, good to have you here--\nREP. COLE: Great privilege. Thank you.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- In person, We'll be right back.",

            "excerpt": "President Biden believes painting former President Trump as a \"threat\" to democracy is a crucial contrast to highlight in his campaign.",
            "summary": "When Vice President Kamala Harris dropped by a campaign office in Madison, Wisconsin, in March, those who attended were handed some poster board and asked to write down why they're supporting President Joe Biden's reelection.\nDemocratic voter Frank Pohlkamp wrote, \"because democracy matters.\"\n\"There was quite a bit of planning [from Trump's side] that went into the idea of the transfer of power,\" Pohlkamp said of the period between the 2020 election and the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks on the U.S. Capitol. \"That is concerning to me. The rule of law and democracy matters to the United States.\"\nFormer President Donald Trump has placed Jan. 6 at the center of his presidential campaign, as both he and other Republicans downplay the severity of the attack and the baseless claims of election fraud that inspired it.\nMr. Biden believes reminding voters again about this rhetoric from Trump, and painting him as a \"threat\" to democracy is a crucial contrast to highlight. It's a variation on the theme of his 2020 campaign, which he referred to as a fight for the \"soul of the nation,\" and one that he returned to during the 2022 midterm elections.\nBut beyond Democratic base voters like Pohlkamp, it remains to be seen whether a focus on Jan. 6 is an effective argument in the rematch against Trump, since voters may be facing more immediate concerns, such as the economy and cost of living.\n\"Absolutely we have to focus on pocketbook issues,\" said Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is running for reelection in the battleground state of Wisconsin. \"But if you don't have your democracy, those may pale in comparison at some point in the future.\"\nTrump has said one of his \"first acts\" if elected this November would be to free January 6 \"hostages.\" At a March rally in Ohio, he saluted a rendition of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" performed by a choir of men imprisoned for their alleged involvement on Jan. 6. He has said if he doesn't win in November, he doesn't think there will be \"another election in this country.\"\nLast Friday, Trump held a press conference with GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson at his Florida Mar-a-Lago residence to announce a new \"election integrity\" bill that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote, though it has been illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections for decades.\nWhile a CBS News January poll showed Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the attacks on Jan. 6, polling reveals a mixed picture of who voters think would be \"better\" for democracy, despite Trump's role in creating and spreading election denialism.\nIn a March CBS News poll of voters in the battleground state of Georgia, where Trump is being investigated for alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election, more people thought Trump would make democracy stronger (48%) than Biden (43%). An April New York Times/Siena College poll of likely voters found that 46% believed Mr. Trump is \"bad for democracy\" while 39% said the same about Mr. Biden.\nCongressional Democrats urge Biden to emphasize democracy, Jan. 6 on campaign trail\n\"You gotta tie it in with other challenges,\" New Jersey Democratic Rep. Andy Kim, who was pictured cleaning up debris in the Capitol after Jan. 6, said about how the Biden campaign should campaign on democracy.\nAbortion has been the biggest contrast issue for the Biden campaign, which has directed its political muscle and considerable cash at highlighting how Trump's appointment of Supreme Court justices led to the overturning of the federal right to an abortion and in the wake of that, to more restrictive abortion bans in Republican-led states.\nBut Jan. 6 has its role in the president's reelection effort, too. For Mr. Biden, it's a testament to character and a marker of the binary choice between him and Trump.\n\"Are there challenges that we deal with every day, whether it be the challenges of inflation that we're still battling or the challenges of global conflict? Absolutely. But those will pale in comparison to the great challenges that we will face as a crumbling America, should Trump be elected,\" said Texas Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Biden campaign co-chair.\n\"Whether democracy is still America's sacred cause is the most urgent question of our time. And it's what the 2024 election is all about,\" Mr. Biden said in Blue Bell, Pa., in January, on the third anniversary of the Jan. 6 riots.\nIn April, the Biden campaign held a press conference with two police officers who were at the Capitol during the Jan. 6 assault. Former Capitol Police Sergeant Aquilno Gonell argued voters should be worried about threats to democracy because \"if you don't have democracy, then your job is probably gonna go; your liberties are probably gonna go.\"\n\"As President Biden said, Donald Trump's campaign is obsessed with the past, not the future. He's willing to sacrifice our democracy to put himself in power,\" said Biden campaign spokesperson James Singer. \"Our campaign will continue to underscore the choice in this election and defend the truth against Donald Trump's Big Lie.\"\nNow less than seven months out from Election Day, Trump's baggage from Jan.6 — and the Biden campaign's tactic of highlighting it — isn't going away.\n\"Their entire narrative is a lie, and Americans know that Joe Biden is the true threat to democracy as he continues to allow an invasion of our borders, his weakness is leading our country straight into World War III, and he weaponizes our justice system,\" said Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\nYet some Republicans don't appear to be worried. Asked by CBS News if Jan. 6 is a vulnerability for Trump on the campaign trail, Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley said, \"That issue's been so litigated, and I think people have made up their minds about it completely.\"\n\"What is there left to say that hasn't been said? And what political advantage is there left to wring from it that Democrats have shamelessly not yet attempted to wring,\" said Hawley, who was among more than 100 Republicans in Congress who objected to certifying Biden's win in two swing states after the attack.\nCalifornia Rep. Mike Garcia, a battleground district Republican whose seat will likely be critical as the GOP tries to hold its tiny majority this fall, said he didn't like what happened on Jan. 6 — and neither do voters. At the same time, he dismissed it as an ineffective campaign issue for Mr. Biden.\n\"If this president is trying to resurrect that issue and run on that – then it's an indication that he's failed to accomplish things in the last three and a half years of his presidency,\" argued Garcia, who voted against certifying Mr. Biden's win in two battleground states in the hours after the attack.\nThere are practical contradictions in Trump's campaign rhetoric, though. He has attempted to champion police and the need for law and order. But on Jan. 6, a mob of his supporters clashed with police and injured over 100 people in law enforcement.\nThe Department of Justice announced recently on its website that close to 500 people \"have been charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees, including approximately 129 individuals who have been charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer.\"\nThat violence doesn't get much attention from Trump and his most ardent allies.\nStill, there are some who are clearly uncomfortable with the friendly tenor Trump is taking with people who attempted to upset the peaceful transfer of power over three years ago.\n\"Jan. 6 is not going to be a good selling point to the American public long term,\" South Dakota GOP Sen. Mike Rounds said.\nJacob Rosen contributed to this report.",

Perhaps, of 40,000, they'll have 10,000. The city can't stop people from coming,\" he said.\nRather than dwell on the cancellation, Goldman and others like him have been exploring alternative ways to celebrate, particularly during San Francisco Weed Week.\n\"Every night from April 13 to April 20 there's been more than one event. Many of them at cannabis consumption lounges such as Mo Greens and Mission Cannabis Club where people can, not only purchase cannabis but taste some cannabis that's coming out now,\" Goldman explained.\nKevin Ortiz, another festival regular, shared his plans for Saturday, highlighting a different approach to celebration.\n\"Born and raised in the Mission District -- whenever I go to smoke is at Dolores Park so my plans for Saturday are gonna be going to Mission cannabis club and picking up a nice preroll joint and go to watch the view at Dolores Park,\" he said.\nOrtiz emphasized the importance of community and advocacy within the cannabis industry.\n\"I'm excited because we're gonna be doing an event for the first time with the Latino Democratic Club and the Brownie Mary Democratic Club. We're having a mixer, talking about how do we continue to bring equity and representation to the cannabis industry -- especially when we know that Black and Brown folks have been negatively impacted by this for years,\" Ortiz said.\nDispensaries have seen a surge in customers during Weed Week.\n\"This is like the Black Friday of cannabis so there's definitely a lot of deals and things like that but we also try to make it different here at Solful and a lot of that has to do with how we source our flower. Everything we source we buy directly from all farmers in Northern California,\" the owner of Solful in San Francisco's Sunset District said.\nGoldman and Ortiz both hope that, despite the festival cancellation, the spirit of celebration and camaraderie within the cannabis community will continue to thrive.",

            "excerpt": "RFK Jr. denies he's a spoiler who won't be on the ballot in enough states to reach the 270 electoral votes needed to win. He's on the ballot in two states.",
            "summary": "Washington — In mid-April, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was on the ballot as an independent presidential candidate in Utah and Michigan, though his campaign says it is working to get him on the ballot in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nKennedy's backers insist he's not pursuing his White House bid just to hand the election to another candidate. They say he's the real deal and has a shot at winning the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidential election.\nGetting on the ballot in enough states to secure 270 votes — just over half the 538 votes in the Electoral College — is no small feat for a third-party contender. But it's possible.\n\"I think he has a very good chance of getting onto all 50 ballots,\" said Bernard Tamas, an associate professor of political science at Valdosta State University who studies third parties. \"The short answer is, I can't say definitively that he will, but it looks like he's on track for it.\"\nFile: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., during a campaign event in Oakland, California, on Tuesday, March 26, 2024.\nDavid Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images\nKennedy's campaign says it has completed signature gathering in seven other states in addition to Utah and Michigan — Nevada, Idaho, Hawaii, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Nebraska and Iowa.\nThe super PAC supporting Kennedy, American Values 2024, says it has collected enough signatures in Arizona, Georgia and South Carolina.\nAnd yet, the campaign has yet to complete the paperwork and submit the petitions in those states. It noted that it still has months in most states to submit the paperwork because most states' deadlines aren't until July or August.\nThe campaign says it's trying to evade legal battles by picking the right time to hand in the petitions, holding onto the signatures until the 11th hour in hopes that the signatures will face fewer challenges.\nKennedy has already run into a paperwork snafu in Nevada. In March, the campaign learned that it would likely have to start the signature process all over again after failing to include a vice presidential candidate on the petition it used to collect signatures in the state.\n\"After successfully collecting all of the signatures we need in Nevada, the DNC Goon Squad and their lackeys in the Nevada Secretary of State's office are outright inventing a new requirement for the petition with zero legal basis,\" Kennedy campaign ballot access attorney Paul Rossi complained.\nIn addition to varying state regulations for ballot access and expensive legal battles, Kennedy faces opposition from Democratic groups aiming to undermine third-party campaigns.\nEarlier this year, the Democratic National Committee formed a team to challenge third-party and independent presidential candidates. The effort will depend on other groups like Third Way, MoveOn, and a new super PAC, Clear Choice, backed by allies of President Biden.\n\"Only two candidates have a path to 270 electoral votes — President Biden and Donald Trump,\" said DNC spokesperson Matt Corridoni. \"The stakes are high and we know this is going to be a close election. That's why a vote for any third-party candidate is a vote for Donald Trump.\"\nThe Kennedy campaign said it plans to secure ballot access in all 50 states, dismissing suggestions that Kennedy aims to help former President Donald Trump's bid for the presidency by taking votes from Mr. Biden.\n\"Our campaign is a spoiler. I agree with that. It's a spoiler for President Biden and for President Trump,\" Kennedy said when he revealed his running mate, Nicole Shanahan, last month.\nIn some states, the time frame for collecting signatures is brief. Others have provisions for signature thresholds to be reached in every county of a state. More than half the states require independent candidates to have a running mate.\nCollecting enough signatures isn't difficult in every state. Many only require 1,000 to 5,000 signatures, Tamas said. Louisiana requires no signatures and a $500 fee. Other states have higher thresholds. Texas requires over 113,000 signatures, and Florida requires more than 145,000.\nAnd those are the number of valid signatures required. Any third-party candidate needs to overshoot that target in order to make sure they have enough in case some of the signatures are found to be invalid.\nIn states like Hawaii, where the Kennedy campaign claims to have gathered enough signatures, it's more convenient to run under a party affiliation rather than as an independent candidate. Kennedy supporters are also collecting signatures in California, Mississippi, North Carolina and Delaware to establish the \"We The People\" party, which can then nominate Kennedy as its presidential candidate.\nThe Kennedy campaign says it's aiming to collect 60% over the signature threshold in each state.\n\"We have the field teams, volunteers, legal teams, paid circulators, supporters, and strategists ready to get the job done,\" said campaign press secretary Stefanie Spear. \"We are exceeding all our benchmarks and will be announcing new states each week.\"\nBut Tamas says Kennedy should be aiming higher — closer to double the required number of signatures.\n\"I'm surprised they're saying it's as low as 60, you just can't take any chances,\" Tamas said.\nCollecting signatures is expensive. Kennedy's super PAC estimates that it will cost around $40 to $50 million just to collect all the necessary signatures, although Tamas noted RFK Jr.'s running mate, Shanahan, the billionaire ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, has the financial resources.\nCollecting the signatures isn't the hardest part — it's the battle over the signatures that's the real fight, Tamas said. The Democratic Party will be fighting hard to invalidate Kennedy's signatures.\n\"You really have to prepare for a battle, so a lot of the cost is not actually getting the signatures, but actually the legal fees of fighting each state,\" Tamas said.\nDemocratic Party members are already trying to block Kennedy from getting on the ballot in Hawaii and Michigan.\nHistorically, there have been independent candidates who secured ballot access across nearly all states. In 1968, George Wallace, the former governor of Alabama, and in 1992, businessman Ross Perot both appeared on the ballot in all 50 states. Ralph Nader's candidacy in 2000 extended to 43 states.\nOnly Wallace managed to win any electoral votes. Perot's impressive 19% of the popular vote in 1992 did not translate to the Electoral College.\nPerot's former campaign manager, Russell Verney, said third-party candidates must overcome more obstacles today than in the past.\n\"Every time there's a reasonably successful independent candidate, the state legislatures, which are made up of Republicans and Democrats, who by definition do not like competition, increase the state barriers to getting on the ballot,\" Verney said. \"The requirements to get on these state ballots continues to get more onerous in every election cycle.\"\nBut \"someone in RFK's position, I don't think the Democrats are going to stop him,\" Tamas said. \"I think he's going to be on — if not all — then probably most of the ballots.\"\nA successful third-party candidate has to focus on individuals who aren't being represented by the major parties, Tamas said, and that's a problem for Kennedy.\n\"He's all over the place, and it's really not clear what's the disaffected group he's trying to tap into,\" Tamas said. \"He's running on conspiracy theories is part of it. But if someone's a conspiracy theorist, chances are they're going to support Donald Trump.\"\nAt this point, if Kennedy's ballot petitions were validated in all of the states where his website says the signature gathering is complete — Nevada, Hawaii, Idaho, Nebraska, Iowa, North Carolina and New Hampshire — plus Louisiana, which, as noted, does not have a signature requirement, and the two states where he is on the ballot — he could win 73 electoral votes. Add in the three states where his super PAC says it has the signatures, and that's another 36, putting him at 109.\nThe latest YouGov/Economist national polling shows Mr. Biden and Trump tied with 44% and Kennedy at 3%.\nKennedy's support is likely to drop off before November, Tamas predicted.\nBut it's not yet clear whether Mr. Biden or Trump stands to lose more from Kennedy's presidential bid.\n\"Nobody really knows for sure who he's going to take votes from,\" Tamas said.",

            "summary": "North Carolina Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton, 26, is the youngest state party chair in the country — and she's taken on the job of campaigning for the oldest presidential candidate in history in a state that hasn't been won by a Democrat since 2008.\n\"It's going to be a fight,\" Clayton said. \"I don't think, right now, anybody actually knows what is going to happen in November.\"\nClayton, who often passes for a college student when she's out canvassing, thinks that her youth has been an advantage in trying to register students at Appalachian State University, her alma mater.\n\"[Students] respond best when they have someone that looks like them, talking to them about the issues that are important to them, too,\" Clayton said.\nNorth Carolina becomes a battleground\nThough Donald Trump won North Carolina twice, 2020 was his narrowest victory in any state. He beat Joe Biden by 1.4 points, or around 75,000 votes.\nSeeing it as Mr. Biden's best pickup opportunity, the Biden campaign began targeting general election voters in the Tar Heel State during the primary with a $25 million TV ad campaign in seven battleground states that included North Carolina.\nAnderson Clayton.\nCBS Saturday Morning\nBuilding a student coalition\nClayton has been a key player in outreach to young voters, Biden officials said.\n\"Every person that's leading a canvas right now in North Carolina is a young person,\" Clayton said. \"Folks out there out on the doors right now in North Carolina are young people.\nIn March, Clayton joined Vice President Kamala Harris in a \"Students for Biden\" coalition launch event in Durham. They helped train young North Carolinians on political organizing and Clayton says the state party is developing a pipeline that would hire eligible students for the campaign after they graduate\n\"We want local North Carolina youth out there organizing for this campaign this year, because we fundamentally think that this is the way forward in our state,\" she said.\nTarak Duggal, a senior at Wake Forest University, was one of the event's participants.\n\"It is inspiring and helpful to see that, you know, the campaign is taking us seriously and is listening to us and understands how important of a voting bloc that young people are,\" Duggal told CBS News.\nAppalachian State is one of 16 institutions in the University of North Carolina network. The state is also home to about a dozen historically Black colleges. The Biden campaign believes the many HBCUs provide the perfect infrastructure to support their youth outreach strategy. The team is planning to open 11 North Carolina field offices this cycle that will include staffing focused on turning out campuses across the state.\nThe North Carolina Republican Party indicated it doesn't see the Biden campaign's effort as much of a threat. A spokesperson told CBS News the group does not plan to expand their operations, touting its current relationship with the RNC and Donald Trump as sufficient in winning in November.\n\"We have paid staffers and volunteer-powered field programs in every battleground state, including North Carolina, and they are expanding daily,\" Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.\nPresident Joe Biden speaks on April 17, 2024 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nJeff Swensen / Getty Images\nBiden losing steam with young people\nTurnout among young voters is historically low, and Biden's support with young voters is shrinking.\nIn 2020, North Carolina's Board of Elections reported 18-25 year olds made up just 13% of registered voters, and 60% of them actually voted.\nAccording to a recent CBS News poll, the president's approval rating has dipped to 43% among people under 30. Left-leaning young voters told CBS News Mr. Biden's age and handling of the Israel-Gaza conflict are top concerns for them.\n\"Usually, I wouldn't care that much, but now they're both, like, kind of senile, like decaying on stage when they give their speeches,\" said Jacob Cook, 18, a student at Appalachian State. \"So it's a pretty big factor this year.\"\n\"I thought it would be the easiest choice in the world between Biden over Trump,\" said student Elijah Bozorth, 19. \"But, Biden's decisions in office are, I guess, complacent since the situation with Gaza. He has really lost my vote.\"\nClayton, however, believes the majority of young Democrats will back Mr. Biden in November.\n\"Young people aren't stupid,\" Clayton said. \"We know what a future under Donald Trump looks like for us and what a future under Joe Biden looks like for us.\"",

Bob Graham has died. Graham, who chaired the Intelligence Committee following the 2001 terrorist attacks and opposed the Iraq invasion, was 87.\nHis family announced the death Tuesday in a statement posted on X by his daughter Gwen Graham.\nThe Florida Democratic Party issued the following statement on Graham's passing:\n\"There are no words that can fully capture what Bob Graham meant to the state of Florida. A giant in Florida politics, Bob set the standard for every elected official who followed — both Democrat and Republican. He lived a life most of us could only dream of, one where he impacted the lives of millions with an unparalleled heart for service and a moral compass that always pointed true. Our hearts go out to Adele, Gwen, and the entire Graham family as they mourn their loss and celebrate his incredible life.\n\"Part of the DNA of every Florida Democrat is living up to the example Bob Graham set for us. As we honor his legacy, may we all love and serve Florida the way he did — with a twinkle in our eyes and a curiosity for things unknown.\"\nGraham, who served three terms in the Senate, made an unsuccessful bid for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, emphasizing his opposition to the Iraq invasion.\nFormer U.S. Senator and Florida Governor Bob Graham. (Source: CBS4)\nBut his bid was delayed by heart surgery in January 2003. Never able to gain enough traction with voters to catch up, he bowed out that October. He didn't seek re-election in 2004 and was replaced by Republican Mel Martinez.\nA man of many quirks, Graham perfected the \"workdays\" political gimmick of spending a day doing various jobs from horse stall mucker to FBI agent. He kept a meticulous diary, noting almost everyone he spoke with, everything he ate, the TV shows he watched and even his golf scores.\nBut he closed the notebooks to the media during his short-lived presidential bid.\nGraham was among the earliest opponents of the Iraq war, saying it diverted America's focus on the battle against terrorism centered in Afghanistan. He also criticized President George W. Bush for failing to have an occupation plan in Iraq after the U.S. military threw out Saddam Hussein in 2003.\nGraham said Bush took the United States into the war by exaggerating claims of the danger presented by the Iraqi weapons of destruction that were never found. Saying Bush distorted intelligence data, Graham argued that was more serious than the sexual misconduct issues that led to President Clinton's impeachment in the late 1990s.\nThe Town of Miami Lakes community mourns the passing of Senator Bob Graham. A key member & figure of our town's history, his leadership and service will be celebrated long after his passing. Our thoughts and condolences are with his loved ones during this difficult time. pic.twitter.com/zFwBgpnWs8\n— Miami Lakes, FL (@MiamiLakesNews) April 17, 2024\nIt spurred Graham to launch his brief presidential bid.\n\"The quagmire in Iraq is a distraction that the Bush administration, and the Bush administration alone, has created,\" Graham said in 2003.\nAs a politician, few were better. Florida voters hardly considered him the wealthy Harvard-educated attorney that he was.\nGraham's political career spanned five decades, beginning with his election to the Florida House of Representatives in 1966.\nHe won a state Senate seat in 1970, was elected governor in 1978 and was re-elected in 1982. Four years later, he won the first of three terms in the U.S. Senate when he ousted incumbent Republican Paula Hawkins.\nGraham remained widely popular with Florida voters, winning re-election by wide margins in 1992 and 1998 when he carried 63 of 67 counties.\nEven when in Washington, Graham never took his eye off the state and the leadership in Tallahassee.\nWhen Gov. Jeb Bush and the Republican-controlled Legislature eliminated the Board of Regents in 2001, Graham saw it as a move to politicize the state university system. He led a successful petition drive the next year for a state constitutional amendment that created the Board of Governors to assume the regents' role.\nDaniel Robert Graham was born Nov. 9, 1936, in Coral Gables where his father, Ernest \"Cap\" Graham, had moved from South Dakota and established a large dairy operation. Young Bob milked cows, built fences and scooped manure as a teenager. One of his half-brothers, Phillip Graham, was publisher of The Washington Post and Newsweek until he committed suicide in 1963, just a year after Bob Graham's graduation from Harvard Law.\nIn 1966 he was elected to the Florida Legislature, where he focused largely on education and health care issues.\nBut Graham got off to a shaky start as Florida's chief executive, and was dubbed \"Gov. Jello\" for some early indecisiveness. He shook that label through his handling of several serious crises.\nAs governor, he also signed numerous death warrants, founded the Save the Manatee Club with entertainer Jimmy Buffett and led efforts to establish several environmental programs.\nGraham pushed through a bond program to buy beaches and barrier islands threatened by development and also started the Save Our Everglades program to protect the state's water supply, wetlands and endangered species.\nGraham also was known for his 408 \"workdays,\" including stints as a housewife, boxing ring announcer, flight attendant and arson investigator.\n\"This has been a very important part of my development as a public official, my learning at a very human level what the people of Florida expect, what they want, what their aspirations are and then trying to interpret that and make it policy that will improve their lives\" said Graham in 2004 as he completed his final job as a Christmas gift wrapper.\nAfter leaving public life in 2005, Graham spent much of his time at a public policy center named after him at the University of Florida and pushing the Legislature to require more civics classes in the state's public schools.\nGraham was one of five members selected for an independent commission by President Barack Obama in June 2010 to investigate a massive BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that threatened sea life and beaches along several southeastern Gulf states.\nHere's the statement posted on X by his daughter Gwen Graham:",

PAUL, Minn. — A key lawmaker backing legislation mandating new regulations for rideshare operations in Minnesota said Tuesday that stakeholders are \"very close\" to an agreement on wages for drivers — a sticking point in negotiations.\nST. PAUL, Minn. — A key lawmaker backing legislation mandating new regulations for rideshare operations in Minnesota said Tuesday that stakeholders are \"very close\" to an agreement on wages for drivers — a sticking point in negotiations.\nSen. Omar Fateh, DFL-Minneapolis, made the comment during the Senate Commerce Committee meeting where lawmakers greenlit some small changes to the bill expanding insurance for drivers who are injured or lose their life on their way to pick up or while driving passengers to their destination.\nCoverage would not exceed $1 million and would include medical expenses, lost compensation, disability benefits and survivor benefits at no cost to the driver. It was one of the items Gov. Tim Walz's work group consisting of drivers, state and local elected officials, and the rideshare companies agreed to last year.\n\"Other places [in the bill], we're still negotiating. We're very, very close in terms of the jurisdiction around arbitration and the wages and all that,\" Fateh told the panel Tuesday after it agreed to insurance provisions.\nLobbyists for Uber and Lyft testified that they support the insurance requirements, as was the agreement during the governor's work group, but warned that it represents just one part of a larger bill that is still sparking concerns. Right now, Fateh's legislation has pay rates that are similar to minimum per-minute and per-mile wages set by the ordinance in Minneapolis, where Uber and Lyft threaten they will exit if the local law stands.\n\"We are working diligently to get to a statewide solution that would allow these companies to operate in the state. If this passed without further amendment, that would not be the case,\" said Joel Carlson, who is representing Uber.\nRepublicans tried but failed again to amend the bill to undo Minneapolis' decision with pre-emption language. The city council recently bought state lawmakers more time to come up with a statewide solution by delaying implementation until July 1.\nThe companies have said they will continue to operate until that date. The legislature is set to adjourn on May 20.\n\"If this is not addressed and fixed by the end of this legislative session, the people of Minnesota will have been failed dramatically,\" said Sen. Zach Duckworth, R-Lakeville.\nBut Democrats are optimistic they can find a compromise. Fateh said Tuesday that stakeholders—drivers, companies and legislative leaders—have been working several times per week to get closer to a deal. Those meetings are happening behind closed doors.\nEarlier this month, House Majority Leader Jamie Long, a Democrat from Minneapolis said he was \"confident\" that there could be a deal reached by the end of session. He has rejected the idea that lawmakers would preempt the city; instead, he said, they are working alongside Minneapolis.",

            "summary": "BOSTON – We're entering the height of budget season on Beacon Hill, when billions of dollars worth of decisions are made that will impact your schools, taxes and everything else state government touches.\nMassachusetts State Sen. Peter Durant (R-Spencer) told WBZ-TV the budget priorities coming from Gov. Maura Healey and the Democrat-dominated legislature are \"a bit misplaced.\"\nConcerns over Massachusetts budget\nDurant said the governor talks a good game about making the state more affordable and helping cities and towns cope with inflation.\n\"But I don't see that necessarily reflected in the budget. What we've seen is some large increases in MassHealth … primarily due to the migrant crisis that's happening right now,\" he said. \"In addition, we see that local aid going to cities and towns has started to slip a bit from where we used to do. Charlie Baker always made sure that if the budget increased by 4%, locally, [local aid] increased by the same amount. This year we're seeing that while the governor did that, the House pared it back [to] just 1%, which is completely unacceptable.\"\nCriticism of Gov. Healey\nDurant, the newest member of the Senate who won a formerly Democratic seat last year, was also critical of the governor's proposal to make it easier for cities and towns to increase local taxes.\n\"It is really misdirected to say we're going to allow cities and towns to increase their own taxes in various ways,\" he said. \"We know that there's a proposal for a local property transfer tax. And when I hear things like that, I really think that's just political posturing which says 'I'm not going to increase your taxes but I'm gonna let you to go ahead and do it yourself.' And I think that's the wrong direction for our state.\"\nBudget impact from Massachusetts migrant crisis\nWith the state on the verge of exhausting its budget to pay for shelter and services for the migrants coming into Massachusetts over the past year, we asked Durant what happens if there's no help forthcoming from the federal government.\n\"I don't think we can count on the feds,\" he said. \"They have allocated another $6 million to give to the state, which is really just a drop in the bucket for us here in Massachusetts. The governor has said if we run out, which is supposed to happen sometime this month, she has a few other levers to pull. But we are running out of money for this program. More money has to be put in. And this is a big debate for us here on Beacon Hill.\"\nSen. Durant also discussed the status of federal work permits for migrants and the high number of retirements of longtime legislators at the State House.\nWatch the entire interview in the video player above, and join us every Sunday morning at 8:35 a.m. for more newsmaker interviews on Boston's most-watched Sunday morning political interview program.\nWatch the entire interview in the video player above, and join us every Sunday morning at 8:35 a.m. for more newsmaker interviews on Boston's most-watched Sunday morning political interview program.",

Among those supporters: Mayor Eric Johnson, a wide variety of organizations and Dallas Council Member Paula Blackmon.\n\"We need to invest in our city, plain and simple,\" Blackmon said.\nMost of the money will go toward Proposition A: streets and transportation for a total of $521 million. That money would be used to fix potholes, repave and repair streets and alleys and make roads safer.\nProposition A: streets and transportation for a total of $521 million.

The new facility will be built at UNT's new campus in South Dallas.\nSupporters, including former Dallas Council Member Jennifer Staubach Gates, believe a new police training facility is needed because the existing one was outdated long ago.\n\"Anybody who's toured it I think is just appalled,\" she said. \"If you want a great police department, it starts with the training, and this is going to help us retain and recruit, which we desperately need.\"\nBut not everyone supports this project.\n\"We believe that will result in more over-spending and repression in our communities and we thing that money could be utilized elsewhere,\" said Tamera Hutcherson, an organizer with the group, Stop Cop City Dallas. \"Why not invest money in updating that facility instead of constructing a new facility entirely?\"\nMendelsohn, who chairs the Public Safety Committee, also supports the project.\n\"Probably the same group that wanted us to defund police way back when,\" Mendelsohn said. \"What I'm going to say is that we need to have a robust police force. Right now we are down hundreds of police officers, and I have not met anybody hat doesn't want more police in their neighborhood and doesn't want a highly trained office.\"\nTo the allegation that her group is anti-police, Hutcherson said: \"It's a good question. I encourage those people to engage in conversation with us.\"\nThe new facility will be built at UNT's new campus in South Dallas and would cost a total of $140 million.

            "summary": "DOVER, Del. (AP) — A bill allowing doctor-assisted suicide in Delaware narrowly cleared the Democrat-led House on Thursday and now goes to the state Senate for consideration.\nThe bill is the latest iteration of legislation that has been repeatedly introduced by Newark Democrat Paul Baumbach since 2015, and it is the only proposal to make it to a floor vote. After lengthy debate, lawmakers voted 21-16 for the measure, which needed at least 21 affirmative votes for passage.\nAmong those voting for the bill was Republican Rep. Kevin Hensley of Townsend, who voted against the proposal in previous legislative sessions.\n\"I did not get confused,\" Hensley assured fellow lawmakers after the vote. Hensley said his perspective on the issue changed after his mother, who lived in California, opted for physician-assisted suicide a year ago.\n\"This was probably one of the toughest votes I've ever had to make,\" said Hensley, the only GOP lawmaker to vote for the bill.\nCalifornia is one of 10 states, along with the District of Columbia, that has laws legalizing medically assisted suicide.\nIn New Jersey, a \"right to die\" law went into effect in 2019 after being signed by Governor Phil Murphy.\nSeveral Republican lawmakers expressed ethical concerns about the Delaware legislation. They also questioned the need for it, given advances in hospice and palliative care in recent years.\nBaumbach said the measure is not intended to replace palliative or hospice care, but to complement them. Data from other states indicates that hospice care is involved in the vast majority of cases involving doctor-assisted suicide, he added.\nBaumbach said the \"end-of-life option\" offered in the bill gives terminally ill individuals certainty that they can choose to end their pain if it becomes greater than what hospice or palliative care can alleviate.\n\"This puts the choice in the dying person's hands to determine whether or not they wish to self-administer the medicine,\" he said.\nThe legislation allows an adult resident of Delaware who is diagnosed with a terminal illness and expected to die within six months to request lethal prescription drugs from a doctor or advanced practice registered nurse who has primary responsibility for the terminal illness. A consulting physician or nurse would have to confirm the diagnosis and prognosis of the patient, who must have \"decision-making capacity.\"\nThe patient would have to be evaluated by a psychiatrist or a psychologist if any of the medical professionals involved is concerned that he or she lacks decision-making capacity. A person also would not qualify for doctor-assisted suicide solely because of age or disability.\nThe patient would have to make two oral requests for a lethal prescription, followed by a written request, and would have to wait at least 15 days after the initial request before receiving the drugs. The attending doctor or nurse would have to wait at least 48 hours after the written request, which must be signed by two witnesses, before prescribing the drugs.\nThe bill states that any provision in a contract, will or other agreement that would affect whether an individual could make or rescind a request for lethal prescription \"is not valid.\" It also states that requesting, prescribing or dispensing the lethal medication \"does not, for any purpose, constitute elder abuse, suicide, assisted-suicide, homicide, or euthanasia.\"\nThe legislation goes further to assert that the act of killing oneself with self-administered prescription medication does not invalidate any part of an insurance policy or annuity.",

You have been outspoken against the rising and troubling antisemitism in this country. I know the FBI director said just a few days ago that federal law enforcement is concerned about lone actors targeting gatherings ahead of the start of Passover, which starts tomorrow. Are there known threats in your state?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Well, there's not known threats right now. And I can tell you, the Pennsylvania State Police working in coordination with our federal and local partners are all over this. And we'll let folks know, and communities, if there are specific threats. But we continue to work closely with law enforcement and community leaders to do everything we can to take down the temperature, to address the rise in antisemitism, Islamophobia, other forms of hate. There should be no place for that here in Pennsylvania. Of course, Pennsylvania, founded on the vision of William Penn, a place that would be a place of tolerance and welcome and peace, a place where people could come together and practice their faith, whatever their faith is, we have a special relationship with that, here in this commonwealth, where we respect all, no matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love, or who you choose to pray to. And we're going to continue to do everything we can to make sure everyone feels protected in this commonwealth.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there should be no place for it anywhere in America. I- and I know you agree with that. But let me get to the politics of the moment. President Biden won the state of Pennsylvania in 2020, narrowly. He spent a lot of time in your state this past week. We've seen in our polling, his approval rating among young voters aged 18 to 29 has dropped 12 points since February, from 55% to 43% today. How does the president get that back?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: I think the president gets it back by doing exactly what he's doing: showing up, talking about his record, addressing things like climate change, which are incredibly important issues for young voters, along with many others, obviously. Making sure that young people feel included in the conversation, not just as a vote, but as part of the governing coalition going forward. Young people helped propel me to victory as governor. One of the first things I did was start what I believe is the first ever Next Gen Engagement Commission here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, a place where young people quite literally advise me on policy, meet with me regularly, give me their perspective on what's happening in the community. I think part of the frustration by young people is that they- they oftentimes don't feel heard, and they feel like their voices and their votes are taken advantage of, come election time. This is a moment where the young people deserve to be at the table. And the fact that the President is showing up in these communities and talking about these issues that are going to help young people in the future, I think is a really important step.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So last weekend, Donald Trump was campaigning in Pennsylvania, it's so key. Here's what he said.\n[START SOUND ON TAPE]\nDONALD TRUMP: Biden has imposed a savage natural gas export ban that's putting countless Pennsylvania jobs at risk. He's risking your lives. He's risking your jobs. But he doesn't care, because all he cares about is the green new scam.\n[END SOUND ON TAPE]\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He is speaking to real fear among some of your constituents about President Biden's decision to, at least temporarily, put a pause on new natural gas projects. How do you respond to that?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Look, I've been very clear with the White House, and publicly, I hope that this policy that they put in place is very quick, and then we move forward. Here in Pennsylvania, our energy economy has powered this nation, and it has done so over many generations. And going forward, I think Pennsylvania has an opportunity to be the center of the clean energy economy. Thanks to the president, we're the only state in the nation with two regional hydrogen hubs.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But just to- just--\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Thanks to the president, we've been able to work together.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry, just- you broke up at the beginning. I think you said you've been very clear to the White House that you hope this is a short pause. Does that mean you agree, it is costing your state jobs and money?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Well, I think if the pause goes on for a long time, it has the potential to cost us jobs. That's why I want this to be as quick as possible. And what I went on to say, though, is we have an opportunity here in Pennsylvania to be the center of the clean energy economy. Thanks to President Biden, we have two regional hydrogen hubs. Thanks to President Biden, we are capping methane emissions from abandoned wells, we have billions of dollars of tax credits and other resources coming from the Department of Energy to help us through a transition. Here in Pennsylvania, we're showing that we can both protect the jobs that exist today and create more energy jobs tomorrow. Energy is critical to the future of our commonwealth. Now, listen, the bravado and the bluster from the former president do nothing to actually create jobs in Pennsylvania. He's got an abysmal track record when it comes to that. President Biden has a strong record. And we're going to continue to lead on energy here in Pennsylvania.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned young voters and how key the issue of climate is to them. The Biden administration touts the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA, as a green energy bill even though it wasn't named that. But CBS polling shows half of Americans have not heard much, or nothing at all, about what the administration has done. Only 14% say they've heard a lot. Two thirds don't know if their state has gotten federal funds for climate change projects. This seems a real vulnerability for Democrats when it comes to young voters.\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Well, let me be very clear, climate change is real, it is serious, and we have to address it. And Joe Biden understands that. Donald Trump has made fun of climate change and denies its existence. So there's a clear contrast in this race. Because of the federal dollars that have flown- flowed to Pennsylvania, as I mentioned a moment ago, we are positioned to get two regional hydrogen hubs that are going to help us combat climate change. We're addressing all kinds of infrastructure needs here in this commonwealth, from repairing roads and bridges, to making sure people are connected to the internet, to making sure families in Esplen, which is a minority- predominantly minority community in Pittsburgh, no longer need to drink water out of the lines that contain lead, thanks to Joe Biden cleaning that up. So when it comes to infrastructure investments, when it comes to the kinds of investments that are going to help spur on a clean energy economy, President Biden has been there. Now, we have to make that case. And we've got to make sure folks understand that and hear that, that's why you run a campaign. That's why you'll see stark differences when it comes to combating climate change between the policies of President Biden and what Donald Trump has done in the past and wants to do in the future.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the messaging needs work, is what you're saying?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Well, I think the case- I think the case needs to be made. There's a wonderful track record. There's a wonderful body of work. They need to make that case, and I'll be helping make that case alongside the president.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask about something that has been really damaging your state and that is drug addiction. Pennsylvania, has- I'm sorry, excuse me. The number one public health crisis in Pennsylvania, according to the state, is opioids. The CDC says Pennsylvania recently saw the highest number of xylazine-related deaths in the country. What is driving the addiction?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Listen, 13 Pennsylvanians die every single day from an opioid overdose. It is unacceptable. And here in Pennsylvania, we're trying to come at it with a- a multi-pronged approach. First, we have to understand that drug addiction is a disease, not a crime. Now we have to invest in law enforcement. And I have. We've increased the number of state troopers by 400, and I'm looking to add another 400. As Attorney General, I arrested over 8,000 drug dealers. So we're not going soft on those who are peddling these poisons in our community. But we also have to make sure the treatment is available. As Attorney General I led a national coalition that ended up holding those drug companies accountable, the very people that brought this crisis into our communities, and brought $2 billion back to Pennsylvania for treatment--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm- I'm sorry to interrupt you--\nGOV. SHAPIRO: --this is really critical stuff and it's going to require a multi-pronged approach.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry, I have to interrupt you. We have to leave it there, Governor. Thank you. We'll be back.",

            "summary": "A crackdown on how some of the nation's largest utilities spend customers' money faces a do-or-die vote Monday in the California Legislature.\nCalifornians already pay some of the highest electricity rates in the country, in part because of the expensive work required to maintain and upgrade electrical equipment to reduce the risk of wildfires in a state with long, dry summers.\nAs rates continue to climb, utilities like Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric have faced increasing scrutiny from consumer groups over how they spend the money they collect.\nUtilities aren't allowed to use money from customers to pay for things like advertising or lobbying. Instead, utilities must pay for those activities with money from private investors who have bought stock shares.\nConsumer groups say utilities are finding ways around those rules. They accuse them of using money from customers to fund trade groups that lobby legislators and for TV ads disguised as public service announcements, including some recent ads by PG&E.\nA legislative bill would expand the definitions of prohibited advertising and political influence to include things like regulators' decisions on rate-setting and franchises for electrical and gas corporations. It would also allow regulators to fine utilities that break the rules.\n\"It's always fun to be able to give away other people's money and use other people's money to try to advance their own interests,\" said state Sen. Dave Min, a Democrat who authored the bill. \"But for a regulated industry like (investor-owned utilities), I would submit that that's not good policy.\"\nThe bill faces fierce opposition from utilities and some labor unions that fear it would prohibit union members who work for utilities from lobbying.\nThe bill had a public hearing last week in a committee, but it failed to pass after multiple Democrats, who hold large majorities in both legislative chambers, did not vote. The committee is scheduled to hear the bill again Monday. If it fails a second time, it likely won't pass this year.\nMin said he has accepted amendments to address lawmakers' concerns, including allowing a grace period for utilities to correct errors and require that any money collected from fines be put into the state's general fund. Still, he said it was \"50-50\" whether the bill would survive Monday's vote.\nPG&E opposes the bill because it said it would take away the power of state regulators to examine utility companies' costs and decide whether it is \"just or reasonable\" for customers to pay for them.\nPlus, PG&E lobbyist Brandon Ebeck said it's appropriate for customers to pay for the company's membership fees that go to various industry associations because they benefit customers. He noted those groups coordinate emergency response and wildfire training. When the war in Ukraine started, the Edison Electric Institute - a national association representing investor-owned utilities - sought to find surplus equipment that could be sent to Ukraine.\n\"There's a lot of benefits to customers,\" Ebeck said.\nConsumer groups argue the current rules for utilities \"incentivizes them to see what they can get away with,\" said Matt Vespa, an attorney with the advocacy group Earthjustice.\nThose groups and Min point to as much as $6 million in TV ads PG&E paid for to tout its plan to bury power lines to reduce wildfire risk, a plan that some consumer groups opposed because it increased customers' bills.\nThe ads first aired in 2022 and feature CEO Patti Poppe in a company-branded hard hat while saying the company is \"transforming your hometown utility from the ground up.\"\nThe utility recorded the expenses for those ads to come from a customer-funded account that is dedicated to reducing wildfire risk, as first reported by the Sacramento Bee. PG&E spokesperson Lynsey Paulo said the company has not yet asked regulators to review that expense. The California Public Utilities Commission will decide whether customer funds can pay for the ads.\nPaulo noted state regulators allow utilities to use money from customers to pay for safety communications on television.\n\"Our customers have told us they want to know how we are investing to improve safety and reliability,\" Paulo said. \"We also use digital and email communications, but some customers do not have internet or email access, so we use methods including television spots to communicate with all of our customers.\"\nSome consumer groups say the ads have crossed the line.\n\"Only at PG&E would (Poppe's) attempts at brand rehabilitation be considered a 'safety message,'\" said Mark Toney, executive director of the Utility Reform Network. \"This blatant misuse of ratepayer funds is exactly why we need SB 938 and its clear rules and required disclosures for advertising costs.\"\nAdam Beam contributed to this report.",

            "summary": "President Joe Biden made addressing climate change a key issue in his 2020 campaign. Three years into his presidency, what do those who care about the issue most think about what he's done? How much do they know?\nFew Americans say they've heard a lot about what the administration has done on climate change. That extends to those in the president's own party and to those who rate the issue of climate change as very important. Half of them have heard little or nothing at all about what the administration has done.\nAnd perhaps as a result, those who prioritize climate change are feeling somewhat unsatisfied — more of them feel the president has done too little, rather than the right amount on trying to reduce it.\nBut they do like the Biden administration's policies when they hear about them.\nClimate change: An issue important to Biden's base\nClimate change is not the most important issue for Americans overall; it trails economic issues and matters like crime and immigration. But most Democrats, liberals, those who voted for Mr. Biden in 2020 and many younger people place a lot of importance on the issue. These groups will be crucial to Mr. Biden in November.\nJust 10% of Americans who say climate change is a very important issue have heard or read a lot about what the Biden administration has done so far to deal with it. And when evaluating the Biden administration, many think it has done too little to address it.\nWhen presented with some of the Biden administration's climate change policies, a majority of those who place a lot of importance on climate change — from enhanced regulations, to reducing toxic chemicals in drinking water, to tax rebates for buying an electric vehicle — favored the policies.\nEven people who feel the administration has done too little on climate change support these policies. So this may be more about Mr. Biden needing to get his message out there than having to convince this \"climate constituency\" — those who call the climate issue very important — of the substance of his policies.\nWhat is the \"climate constituency\" looking for?\nNine in 10 of those who call the climate issue very important support the country taking steps to stop or slow the rate of climate change, and if they had to choose, they overwhelmingly would prioritize protecting the earth's climate over energy production.\nAnd most agree with the administration and Democratic leaders that efforts to reduce climate change would help the economy, not hurt it, putting them at odds with those who place little or no importance on the issue.\n2024 presidential candidates and climate change\nWhile this \"climate constituency\" would like to see Mr. Biden do more, they do prefer his approach to climate change and energy policy to former President Donald Trump's. It's the public at large that is not convinced, and that adds up to Mr. Biden running about even with Trump among people who are asked whose approach to the issue they agree with more. More than a quarter pick neither.\nAmericans who think the issue of climate change is very important and those who want an energy policy that moves away from fossil fuels in favor of renewable energy sources prefer Mr. Biden's approach on both climate and energy, while those who place little importance on climate change and who want to encourage greater production of fossil fuels favor Trump's approach.\nThis cuts heavily to partisanship as well, though independents — who think efforts to fight climate change will hurt rather than help their finances — lean more towards Trump's approach than Mr. Biden's.\nLooking ahead, there's skepticism that either candidate can do much about climate change if elected in November.\nOn balance, more think Mr. Biden will slow the rate of climate change and more think Trump will increase it, while half don't think it will make any difference, regardless of who wins in 2024.\nAmericans with a more fatalistic view on climate change — who think humanity can't do anything about climate change or who think it doesn't exist in the first place — are the most likely to say the election will make no difference.\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,230 U.S. adult residents interviewed between April 16-19, 2024. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as past vote. The margin of error is ±2.7 points.\nToplines",

            "summary": "California pet owners struggling to find a rental that accepts their furry, four-legged family members could have an easier time leasing new housing under proposed state legislation that would ban blanket no-pets policies and prohibit landlords from charging additional fees for common companions like cats and dogs.\nBackers of the bill, which recently cleared a key committee, say the lack of pet-friendly units is pushing renters to forgo housing or relinquish beloved pets to overcrowded shelters. They say the legislation also would allow more tenants with unapproved pets to come out of the shadows.\nSacramento renter Andrea Amavisca said she and her boyfriend searched for more than a month for a place that would accept their 2-year-old cattle dog mix. Options were few and prospective landlords would not return her calls after learning the couple had a dog.\nThey finally found a two-bedroom apartment after meeting with the landlord and putting down an extra $500 for the security deposit.\n\"It's really awful that there are these restrictions you have to take into consideration when making a personal life choice,\" she said.\nBut landlords are pushing back, saying they're worried over the cost of repairs, liability over potential dog bites and nuisance issues that might drive away other tenants. They also want state lawmakers to allow higher security deposits — which legislators limited to one month's rent last year — to scrub out possible urine and feces stains in carpets or repair damage to wood floors.\n\"There are bad people and there are bad dogs, and our job is to screen that and make sure that we're providing a safe environment for everyone,\" said Russell Lowery, executive director of the California Rental Housing Association.\nAssembly bill 2216 authored by Assemblymember Matt Haney, a San Francisco Democrat and chair of the renters' caucus, would not require all landlords to accept common household pets, such as cats and dogs.\nBut landlords would have to provide reasonable justifications, such as public health, for denying a pet. A landlord could not inquire of pets until after approving an applicant, and applicants would have to notify the landlord that they have a pet or plan to get one at least three days prior to signing a lease. Should the landlord deny the pet, the applicant would then decide whether to seek housing elsewhere.\nThe landlord also could not require additional rent or security deposit for a pet. The bill, if approved, would apply to new leases starting on or after Jan. 1.\nIvan Blackshear already rents to tenants with cats at his triplex in Chico, a small city north of Sacramento. But he says the question of pets and deposits should be left to the property owner and any agreement they reach with their tenants.

A constitutional amendment referring the question to voters failed in the state senate after every Republican voted against it.\nIt takes two-thirds of both the House and Senate for a measure to be referred to the ballot, so every Democrat and at least one Republican needed to vote in favor of the amendment.\nIf passed and approved by voters, it would have allowed survivors of child sex assault to bring civil claims against their abusers and the institutions that covered up the abuse, no matter how long ago it happened.\nRepublicans wanted institutions exempted from the amendment, but bill sponsors Senators Jessie Danielson and Rhonda Fields refused.\nDanielson says those who harbor abusers should not be protected. She accused Republicans of standing with the Catholic Church and insurance companies, who opposed the measure, over sex assault survivors.\n\"The Republicans chose power and profits over children, this fight is not over, this community is very strong and resilient and we will comeback and we will win,\" she said.\nSenate Republican Leadership issued a statement noting they have supported previous bills that protect children and punish abusers but, they say, the amendment would have unintended consequences, \"If passed, the resolution would have upended numerous constitutional and legally settled rights we all depend on, including the principles of legal certainty and reliance, the principle of finality of litigation, and due process.\"",

            "summary": "California pet owners struggling to find a rental that accepts their furry, four-legged family members could have an easier time leasing new housing under proposed state legislation that would ban blanket no-pets policies and prohibit landlords from charging additional fees for common companions like cats and dogs.\nBackers of the bill, which recently cleared a key committee, say the lack of pet-friendly units is pushing renters to forgo housing or relinquish beloved pets to overcrowded shelters. They say the legislation also would allow more tenants with unapproved pets to come out of the shadows.\nSacramento renter Andrea Amavisca said she and her partner searched for more than a month for a place that would accept their 2-year-old cattle dog mix. Options were few and prospective landlords would not return her calls after learning the couple had a dog.\nThey finally found a two-bedroom apartment after meeting with the landlord and putting down an extra $500 for the security deposit.\n\"It's really awful that there are these restrictions you have to take into consideration when making a personal life choice,\" she said.\nBut landlords are pushing back, saying they're worried over the cost of repairs, liability over potential dog bites and nuisance issues that might drive away other tenants. They also want state lawmakers to allow higher security deposits — which legislators limited to one month's rent last year — to scrub out possible urine and feces stains in carpets or repair damage to wood floors.\n\"There are bad people and there are bad dogs, and our job is to screen that and make sure that we're providing a safe environment for everyone,\" said Russell Lowery, executive director of the California Rental Housing Association.\nThe proposal authored by Assemblymember Matt Haney, a San Francisco Democrat and chair of the renters' caucus, would not require all landlords to accept common household pets, such as cats and dogs.\nBut landlords would have to provide reasonable justifications, such as public health, for denying a pet. A landlord could not inquire of pets until after approving an applicant, and applicants would have to notify the landlord that they have a pet or plan to get one at least three days prior to signing a lease. Should the landlord deny the pet, the applicant would then decide whether to seek housing elsewhere.\nThe landlord also could not require additional rent or security deposit for a pet. The bill, if approved, would apply to new leases starting on or after Jan. 1.\nIvan Blackshear already rents to tenants with cats at his triplex in Chico, a small city north of Sacramento. But he says the question of pets and deposits should be left to the property owner and any agreement they reach with their tenants. It should not, he said, be mandated by politicians trying to curry favor with voters.\n\"Chasing mom and pop landlords like myself — small investors like myself — out of California is not going to solve the high price of rent; it actually is going to make it worse,\" said Blackshear, who once had to replace the wood flooring in a rental due to a tenant with a cat.\nAssemblymember Isaac Bryan, a Democrat who represents parts of Los Angeles, said he and his fiancée, an attorney, were shut out of renting several places just because of Darius, their well-behaved Great Dane.\n\"Darius is the sweetest dog,\" said Bryan, who is vice chair of the legislative renters' caucus. \"And so it was shocking, and it showed that this simple barrier of having a companion animal could lead directly to housing insecurity and homelessness, if not addressed.\"\nAnimal welfare groups are among those supporting the bill.\nAnn Dunn, director of Oakland Animal Services, says the number of people giving up their pets has soared since the city of Oakland's eviction moratorium ended last summer.

            "summary": "First day of Trump's 'hush money' trial\nFirst day of Trump's 'hush money' trial\nJury selection begins in first criminal trial for former President Donald Trump\n03:06\nThe first criminal trial of a former president in U.S. history is getting underway Monday in a crowded Manhattan courtroom, with both sides preparing for the arduous task of seating a 12-person jury in the case of The People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump.\nFlanked by his attorneys in room 1530 of the Manhattan Criminal Court, Trump is seated at a table where countless defendants before him have appeared. The presumptive Republican nominee for president addressed reporters outside the courtroom before making his way inside.\n\"This is really an attack on a political opponent. That's all it is,\" Trump said. \"So I'm very honored to be here.\"\nThe case is the first of four criminal prosecutions against Trump to make it to trial. He is charged with 34 state counts of falsifying business records related to a \"hush money\" payment his attorney made to an adult film star before the 2016 election. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges, claiming the prosecution is part of a plot by Democrats aimed at preventing him from retaking the White House.\nThe first day of the Trump trial\nFormer President Donald Trump attends the first day of his \"hush money\" trial at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City on April 15, 2024.\nJEFFERSON SIEGEL/POOL/AFP via Getty Images\nJudge Juan Merchan took his seat on the bench just before 10 a.m. and called the proceedings to order. He quickly denied a motion from Trump's legal team asking him to recuse himself from the case. Trump's attorneys had argued that Merchan should step aside because of his daughter's employment at a consultancy firm that does work for Democratic candidates and progressive groups. Merchan said their argument relied upon \"a series of inferences, innuendos and unsupported allegations.\"\nTrump's lawyers and prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office argued over some outstanding issues related to trial rules and the questions that potential jurors will answer.\nJoshua Steinglass, a member of Bragg's team, said the prosecution would offer evidence that Trump conspired with his former attorney Michael Cohen and an executive at the parent company of the National Enquirer to suppress damaging stories about Trump, and publish negative stories about his rivals, before the 2016 election.\nSteinglass said David Pecker, then the CEO of American Media, Inc., would testify that Pecker that \"he ran these stories to bolster Mr. Trump's campaign\" and that they were \"shown to Mr Trump before they were published, so he could approve, suggest or reject changes.\" Steinglass said prosecutors would introduce evidence pointing to \"a deal struck between the defendant and AMI to put their thumbs on the scale.\"\nTodd Blanche, an attorney for Trump, said the evidence has \"nothing to do with the charged crime.\" Merchan soon said he would allow prosecutors to use the evidence at trial.\nOnce the final pretrial questions are resolved, more than 500 members of the jury pool will soon be escorted into the room for jury selection. Many will be able to see Trump and observe any of his reactions while the judge describes the case. The allegations, Merchan is expected to say, \"are, in substance, that Donald Trump falsified business records to conceal an agreement with others to unlawfully influence the 2016 presidential election.\"\nHe'll continue by mentioning the names of two well-known key witnesses in the case, both of whom Trump considers archnemeses: his former attorney Michael Cohen, and Stormy Daniels, the adult film star.\n\"Specifically, it is alleged that Donald Trump made or caused false business records to hide the true nature of payments made to Michael Cohen, by characterizing them as payment for legal services rendered pursuant to a retainer agreement,\" Merchan will say, according to pretrial court filings. \"The [prosecutors] allege that in fact, the payments were intended to reimburse Michael Cohen for money he paid to Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, in the weeks before the presidential election to prevent her from publicly revealing details about a past sexual encounter with Donald Trump.\"\nThe potential jurors will be asked to fill out a form with 42 questions ranging from the mundane — what jobs they hold — to the more pointed, like whether they follow Trump on social media. Trump's lawyers and prosecutors will seek to whittle the group of potential jurors down to just 12, plus a few alternates, in a process that is expected to take more than a week. The two sides will then begin presenting their cases.\nAs a criminal defendant, Trump is required to attend proceedings each day of the trial unless he applies for a waiver. Court personnel and lawyers from both sides have said they expect the trial to last between six and eight weeks.",

            "summary": "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has completed a book about her years in public life, from legislation she helped enact to such traumatizing moments as the Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol and the assault at her San Francisco home that left her husband with a fractured skull.\nSimon & Schuster announced Thursday that Pelosi's \"The Art of Power\" will be released Aug. 6.\n\"People always ask me how I did what I did in the House,\" Pelosi, the first woman to become speaker, said in a statement. \"In 'The Art of Power,' I reveal how — and more importantly, why.\"\nPelosi, 84, was first elected to the House in 1987, rose to minority leader in 2003 and to speaker four years later, when the Democrats became the majority party. She served as speaker from 2007-2011, and again from 2019-2023, and was widely credited with helping to mobilize support for and pass such landmark bills as the Affordable Care Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.\nShe stepped away from any leadership positions after Republicans retook the majority in the 2022 elections, but she continues to represent California's 11th district.\nAccording to Simon & Schuster, Pelosi also will offer a \"personal account\" of Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters rampaged through the Capitol as Congress voted to certify Joe Biden's victory over Trump. She also recounts the night in 2022 when an intruder broke into the Pelosi home and assaulted her husband, Paul Pelosi, with a hammer. (Nancy Pelosi was in Washington at the time).\n\"Pelosi shares that horrifying day and the traumatic aftermath for her and her family,\" the publisher's announcement reads in part.\nPelosi's previous book, \"Know Your Power: A Message to America's Daughters,\" came out in 2008. In 2022, she was the subject of the HBO documentary \"Pelosi in the House,\" made by daughter Alexandra Pelosi.",

Mark Warner , Democrat of Virginia and Senate Intelligence Committee chairman\n, Democrat of Virginia and Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Sen. Dan Sullivan , Republican of Alaska\n, Republican of Alaska House Appropriations Committee chair Rep. Tom Cole , Republican of Oklahoma\n, Republican of Oklahoma Author David Sanger\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat\nClick here to browse full transcripts of \"Face the Nation.\"\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.\nAnd this week on Face the Nation: The House passes a massive aid package with tens of billions of dollars for Ukraine, widening the divide within the Republican Party. But is it coming too late to help Ukraine defeat Vladimir Putin?\nAfter six months of party infighting over aid to Ukraine, Speaker Johnson did an end run around his MAGA conservative critics and worked with Democrats to get a $95 billion package of foreign aid through the House, a move that could cost him his job.\n(Begin VT)\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON (R-Louisiana): I said these are not normal times. They're not. The world is destabilized and it's a tinderbox.\n(End VT)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But will it revive the weary Ukrainian war effort?\nWe will talk with Senate Intelligence Chair Mark Warner. Plus, we will hear from Republican Congressman Tom Cole and Senator Dan Sullivan about all this and more.\nPlus: As former President Trump prepares for opening statements in the New York hush money trial, bad weather kept him off the campaign trail this weekend.\n(Begin VT)\nDONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States (R) and Current U.S. Presidential Candidate): They're saying the weather is really getting bad, really, really getting bad.\n(End VT)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden spent three days in a state that's a must-win for him.\n(Begin VT)\nJOE BIDEN (President of the United States): You're my ticket to the White House, you, Pennsylvania. No, it's not hyperbole.\n(End VT)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk with that state's Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro.\nFinally, ahead of Earth Day, what impact is the recent run of extreme weather having on American views on climate change?\nIt's all just ahead on Face the Nation.\nGood morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.\nSix months to the day after President Biden requested the funding for Ukraine, it has finally passed the House. The $95 billion foreign aid package includes $61 billion for Ukraine and rebuilding U.S. weapons stockpiles, $26 billion in aid for Israel – that includes some humanitarian aid for Palestinians – and $8 billion for parts of the Indo- Pacific region, which includes Taiwan.\nA bill also forces the Chinese-owned firm ByteDance to sell TikTok or risk a U.S. ban.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, along with a minority of Republicans, worked with a majority of Democrats to get the Ukraine aid through. That bipartisan effort has made some ultraconservative House Republicans livid, and they're threatening to remove the speaker from his job just six months after a similar scenario cost Kevin McCarthy the speakership. The Senate is expected to pass the funding bill later this week.\nWe begin today with the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner.\nGood morning, and good to have you here.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER (D-Virginia): Thank you, Margaret.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, Senator, $61 billion in aid to Ukraine, about 60 percent of that stays as an investment into the U.S. industrial base, as I understand it.\nPresident Zelenskyy said this morning on another network it's important that they get crucial long range artillery like ATACMS. Is that what this money will pay for? And, if so, when will they actually get them?\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, the great news is, this is finally happening.\nIt should have happened six months ago. The next best time is right now, this week. We've seen the Ukrainians overperform.\nIf you step back for a moment and think about the fact that, for most of my life, most of America's defense forces were focused on Russia, getting this additional equipment as quickly as possible – I hope, once this gets to the president by Tuesday or Wednesday, that these shipments will be literally launched with that longer-range ATACM.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: By next week?\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: I hope, once the president signs, we've been told that there is – it is the president's signature, making sure Congress does its job, that these materials will be in transit by the end of the week.\nAnd on that schedule, what it will do is, it's clearly been the case that the Ukrainians, morale has been great, but it's been undermined over the last couple of months, when they have been – literally given out rationed bullets, eight to 10 bullets a day, and on artillery shells, Russians 10-1.\nYou can't underestimate the Ukrainians' grit, determination. But if they don't have the materiels…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: … they can't carry this fight to the Russians.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Will they get those long-range artillery?\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Not just ammunition?\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: The ATACMS – I believe the administration…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: … was prepared over the last couple of months to prepare – or to provide ATACMS. It is written into this legislation.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: According to the State Department, China has helped Russia rebuild its defense industrial base, which has an impact on the battlefield as well here.\nHow have they been able to just blow through U.S. sanctions or defy them to help the Russians, who are fighting Ukraine?\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, if we look back again, I think we would all acknowledge that the sanctions regime has not been as tight as we would have like to have seen it, China being the worst offender with direct military support, India, a country I'm very supportive of, but India in terms of purchasing Russian oil that give that hard currency to Russia for them to go out into the marketplace and acquire arms.\nIt's one of the reasons why I think this package, which the House just passed, we will take up this week…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: … that says, we have to be ready to be prepared for our national security interests, not only in Ukraine and Russia, also in terms of military assistance to Israel, but with additional humanitarian aid for the Palestinians who are…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: … in such great challenges.\nAnd there's about $8 billion or $9 billion for the Indo-Pacific region…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: … because of the concern that we have about China's aggressiveness towards Taiwan.\nClearly, the Chinese linkage to Russia, combined with the fact that the Iranians are – are providing drones, for example…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: … for Russia and the outlier nation, North Korea, I know the terminology used to be Axis of Evil. This may be the 2024 Axis of Evil combination of nations.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And Speaker Johnson has used that language.\nOne of the other things that the House voted to do was move this TikTok bill through. So this would force the Chinese-owned parent company, ByteDance, to divest it, to sell it. But they have the better part of a year to do so. The Chinese government says they're not going to allow that.\nByteDance doesn't want to sell it. So, if this just gets stuck in the courts, isn't the reality that TikTok is not going away?\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: TikTok, 170 million Americans a day, 90 minutes a day…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: … that's, frankly, more than the power of eyes that your network reaches on a daily basis.\nAnd that information – and many young people on TikTok get their news.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: The idea that we would give the Communist Party this much of a propaganda tool, as well as the ability to scrape 170 million American – million Americans' personal data, it is a national security risk.\nWhat – what our goal…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But it is a national security risk, according to U.S. intelligence community, that has a direct impact potentially on U.S. elections. TikTok accounts…\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: On U.S. elections, on elections this year.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, targeted candidates from both political parties during the midterm cycle in 2022. That's the Worldwide Threat Assessment.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: This is a world…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But TikTok is not going away before November.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, here is the question – the issue.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, that means it's an active threat.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: There is plenty of creativity on TikTok. There are people that make their living off of TikTok as social influencers. I don't want that to go away.\nI simply want to make sure that the individuals pulling the strings…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: … are not ultimately functionaries of the Communist Party of China.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I understand.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: And given…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But even with this significant bill, the timeline is such that it doesn't take it away as a risk for the election. And it seems the U.S. government is so limited in so many ways when it comes to these election influence efforts.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: The – the timeline of giving – this is going to be a complicated transaction.\nTo give it up to a full year, I think, just from a business standpoint, makes sense. The one thing we do have in place – and I'm not putting a whole lot of solace in this.\nBut I was at the Munich Security Conference earlier in the year, when all 20 of the major social media companies, including TikTok, including Twitter, X, including Facebook, Google, Amazon, you name it, they have all said they would have a voluntary agreement about disinformation and misinformation in elections, because, with artificial intelligence…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: … the ability for people to see this, our images here, maybe having words that we don't speak…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: … is – ought to scare the dickens out of all of us.\nAnd the truth is, you know, these 20 companies have a – guaranteed a voluntary agreement. They'll take on watermarking, which will indicate altered – altered content, be willing to take this content down.\nBut the proof is going to be in the pudding. The parliamentary elections in Europe start in less than 60 days. So we are going, along with our European partners, to say, all right, companies you promised.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Show us what you're doing.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, this other measure that was approved as well, Section 702, it's a key surveillance tool…\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Mm-hmm.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … was reauthorized for two years, instead of five.\nTake a listen to what the CIA director told my colleague Norah O'Donnell Friday about how his agency is using this authority.\n(Begin VT)\nWILLIAM BURNS (CIA Director): Its reauthorization, its passage, I think, is a crucial tool to fight fentanyl, because something like 70 percent of all the successful disruptions of fentanyl traffic moving into the United States that we've been a part of have come directly from intelligence derived from 702.\n(End VT)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, these changes to 702, how does it help fight the trafficking of fentanyl? What – what difference is there?\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, let's – let's remember what 702 is.\nIt is the ability for the United States government to surveil, listen in, on non-Americans, foreigners who are abroad. And many times, the fentanyl drug cartels are being run out of Mexico, many times supplied with basic goods out of China.\nAnd this ability to listen in on the bad guys' communications is extraordinarily powerful. Matter of fact, the president gets a daily brief of all of the intelligence hot spots around the world. Sixty percent, 60 percent of what he reads each day is material that comes out of the 702 program.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Now, let me be clear. There have been times in the past where particularly the FBI didn't even follow its own rules on making sure that a foreign individual, a foreign terrorist that might be talking to American, that we put appropriate protections on that American.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That led to some of this Republican criticism.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: It's led to some of the concern.\nFive years ago, the FBI itself was screwing up on 30 percent of their queries just meeting their own criteria. We put in place reforms. The screw-up level has dropped from about 30 percent to less than 1 percent.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: We put requirements so that you can no longer do batch queries. We got to make sure FBI agents have to show a national security purpose.\nIf a journalist or a political figure or a religious figure were even to be queried – queried about, you have to get approval from either the director to the deputy director or head of the National Security Division. We think we've got a very strong reform bill. It's why it passed the Senate.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, so much to talk to you about. Good to have you here in person.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Thank you, Margaret.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Alaska Republican Senator Dan Sullivan, who is also here with us.\nIt was a busy weekend here in Washington.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN (R-Alaska): Yes, Margaret, good to be back on the show.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, Senator, this Ukraine aid that finally has moved, President Zelenskyy was on another network this morning, and he said: \"The U.S. will send a signal with this that this will not be a second Afghanistan. The U.S. will stay with Ukraine.\"\nIf Donald Trump wins this next election, can you guarantee the U.S. will stay with Ukraine?\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, listen, I can't guarantee anything, but I – it's actually good that the president, President Zelenskyy, mentioned Afghanistan, because, Margaret, this gets lost too much.\nI think we got to look at how we got to the situation of Ukraine. I believe strongly that the weakness coming out of the Biden White House – they cut defense spending, you know, every – every year, in terms of the president's budget, their energy policies exude weakness, and the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan – emboldened Putin to undertake the invasion of Ukraine.\nSo, we got to remember, kind of broadly, more strategically, where we are. But, as you know, I was a supporter of the defense supplemental. And I think it's not just going to be important for Ukraine. As you and I have talked about before…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … it's going to be really important for the industrial base of America, which has atrophied dramatically. Sixty percent of this bill goes into building weapons…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … everything from submarines to 155…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: In many Republican districts too, which is why it's so surprising it took so long to get through the House.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, all over the place.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: So, I think it's important.\nBut, again, you know, a lot of this, in terms of where we are on Ukraine…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … from my perspective, comes from the weakness of the Biden administration…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … and, you know, the president's inability…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … to actually make the case on Ukraine. He's given two speeches on Ukraine in the last two years.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And all his speeches do is kind of villain – villainize another part of the Congress.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You – you – we – we could…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: He hasn't tried to bring people together.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We could have a historical argument for the next hour…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, the history's important.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … going – .. going back years about green lights being given to Vladimir Putin around the world by leaders in many countries.\nSo, let's talk about…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: The history on this is important.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm not saying it's not, but let's talk about the future here…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Sure. Sure.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … and the signals being sent.\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban met in March with Donald Trump at Mar-A-Lago, and then he gave an interview. And in that interview, he said that Trump told him: \"He will not give a penny to fund Ukraine. And that is why the war will end because Ukraine cannot stand on its own feet.\"\nWe know he's not a fan of President Zelenskyy. So why do you think he will be persuaded? He might win this election.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nWell, listen, I mean, President Trump put out a statement recently where he thought it was important to support – support Ukraine. He actually also mentioned the Europeans need to do more. And he actually mentioned something, as I just said, that it was very unlikely the war would have started had he still been in the White House. So…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Russia hadn't withdrawn from Ukraine. You know, they'd gone in 2014. So, this argument over Trump would have made a difference, it didn't make a difference during his four years in office.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, I mean, I think the – again, the broader – the broader issue…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … particularly between Biden and Trump right now, you know, where are we? Is the world a safer place for the United States and our allies today as it was four years ago?\nI think the – the answer to that is unequivocally no. But let – let's get back to your question.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I do think that the Republican Party in the House and in the Senate is still very much the peace-through-strength party.\nThis is the tradition of Republicans, Reagan, the Bush presidencies, Eisenhower, Teddy Roosevelt, and – and…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you just talking about the Senate, or the House? Because there were more Republicans in the House who voted against Ukraine aid than voted for it.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, but, actually, look at some of the other votes. There was a vote. Republicans in the House 2-1 rejected an amendment to strip funding for Ukraine, 2-1 one in the House. And I – and, look…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That was Marjorie Taylor Green's effort you're talking about.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct. And – and, you know, we'll see what the Senate does this Tuesday on this bill.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: One of the things that I think the speaker did a good job on with regard to this legislation is, actually, – he actually improved it for a whole host of reasons.\nBut I – I predict that you'll probably see a majority of Senate Republicans supporting this legislation.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And, like I said, peace through strength, this is important because…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … Donald Trump was part of that tradition very much. You remember President Obama cut defense spending by 25 percent his second term.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: He gutted readiness. This is what Democrats sen – con – presidents do.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Biden did it. Obama did it.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to – I'm going to talk about some of these mixed messages in the House with our congressmen ahead, Senator.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: OK, but, look, I mean…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But it's not – it's not so clear.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: But I think our party is the peace through strength party. One of the dangers, in my view…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But, as just said, you can't guarantee a Trump administration and what they do.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, nobody can guarantee anything. But…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But he hasn't even endorsed this bill publicly.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, he came out with a statement…\n(LAUGHTER)\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … just last week saying something that, you know, Ukraine was important.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: No, he says: \"Everyone agrees Ukrainian survival and strength should be much more important to Europe than to us, but it's also important to us.\"\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \"Get moving, Europe.\"\nThat was the best that Republicans got out of him.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, I – I think – I – I…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: David Cameron from U.K.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Let me make one other point on this.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The Polish president.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I think that we're – we're…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … kind of giving Joe Biden a bit of a pass on, not just, as I mentioned how we got here, but the execution of the Ukraine effort.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: As you know, literally, every major weapon system that the Ukrainians have said they need, from HIMARS, Patriots, Stingers, tanks, F-16s, now ATACMS, every single weapon system, this administration delays, delays, because they're scared of, you know, making Vladimir Putin mad.\nThe Senate – you saw Mark Warner there a second ago.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: You interviewed him. In a bipartisan way, we come in and we say, Mr. President, you have to give them these weapons systems.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: They finally relent. Think about where we'd be Margaret, if, you know, a year-and-a-half ago, we would have gotten all these weapons systems to Ukrainians. They have…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Or six months ago, if Republicans in the House actually held a vote to do what they did just yesterday.\nBut I need to move on to the climate…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: OK. OK.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … because I know you're also passionate about this and what the Biden administration just announced about your state of Alaska.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The president wants to conserve 30 percent of U.S. lands as part of his climate change efforts.\nAnd he has limited oil and gas drilling in parts in the National Petroleum Reserve…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … to protect polar bears and other things. And then he also blocked a role – road – excuse me – crucial to operating a copper and zinc mine.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You said this is suicidal and lawless.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: It was. And…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Those are strong words.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, it's lawless. He doesn't have the authority to do it.\nAnd I could go into all the laws that support me on that. It's, as I say, national security suicide. Look, this president won't sanction the Iranian oil and gas regime. You may have seen Senator Blumenthal and I put a – sent a letter to the president on Friday, saying you need to do that.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: But he has no problem sanctioning Alaska.\nThis – this administration has issued 63 executive orders and executive actions singularly focused on Alaska to shut our state down. Now, that, of course, hurts my constituents. But, Margaret, the national resources, energy, critical minerals, that's an American strength.\nThis should concern all kinds of Americans. I will mention one final thing that I really wanted to highlight here. You know, I have been in the Senate nine years. I have never seen such a cynical and dishonest display coming out of any presidency…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … when this president on Friday, with Secretary Haaland…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … announced that they did this because the Alaska Native, the indigenous people…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … on the North Slope of Alaska asked them to, they wanted them to.\nThese – the leaders of the North Slope of Alaska were unanimous in opposition to this.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: They tried to meet with Secretary Haaland. She wouldn't meet with them.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: This is a rule that focuses on their lands…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … where they've been living for thousands of years.\nAnd then the president says, well, I did it because the indigenous people of Alaska wanted it.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: That is a lie.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Wow.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And I – it is a lie. And go…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Go see what the indigenous people of Alaska from that part of my state said.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: They're very upset.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I know there's – there's some…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And the president was canceling their voices and now stealing their voices. It was really a despicable move.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, we have to leave it there because of the break, but I know you could talk with me on this perhaps again in the future…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Thank you.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … more in depth.\nWe'll be right back.\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Oklahoma Republican Congressman Tom Cole.\nGood morning.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE (R-Oklahoma): Morning.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, you were the lead sponsor on Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan bills. And I know this was a big decision for the speaker to hold the vote at all.\nThe Polish prime minister tweeted: \"Speaker Johnson, thank you. Better late than too late. And I hope it is not too late for Ukraine.\"\nHow do you measure the cost of inaction over the past six months?\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Well, first of all, the Senate only passed the bill 65 days ago.\nAnd it's not like the speaker didn't have other things to do. He had to get all the appropriations done, had to do FISA.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: This was an emergency. They were running out of ammunition…\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: You know, and – well, again…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … when they asked for it.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: The – the…\n(LAUGHTER)\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: … administration waited a while. The Senate took a while, and we had other business under way.\nBut it got done, got done in a bipartisan way. He showed incredible leadership. And, frankly, he gave us a rule that is a structure in which we considered all these different matters where every single member got to vote the way they wanted to on every single issue.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: That wasn't the case in the Senate. And I think, actually, when they follow the example we have, you will see more support for Ukraine than we probably saw in their original vote.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But, to be fair, we're not talking about a policy debate – debate that doesn't have a direct impact on the battlefield.\nI mean, the supreme allied commander testified before Congress on April 10 the Ukrainians are being outshot by the Russian side 5-1 because of this debate, the delay.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: I'm sorry. Democracy is a – kind of a messy business.\nAnd the reality is, it's done. So it moved through. It moved through on a very bipartisan basis.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: More Republicans voted against it than voted for it.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Well, look, it's about an even split.\nAnd, quite frankly, if you want to – want to look at the hardcore Republican opposition, go to the motion to recommit, or look at the bill to strip funding from Ukraine. It's about 2-1, actually 3-1 one on the motion to recommit.\nThis is politics. There is such a thing as a \"Vote no, hope yes\" crowd in every caucus. I can go down that list and tell you the members who said, OK, you got the votes. You don't need me. So, I think there's actually much more…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That would be a fun game with you, actually.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Well, it is a fun game.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Because I – I could pick a few of those names off that list.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: And, look, it's – it's – it's politics. I'm not critical of anybody.\nThe reality is, we have overwhelming bipartisan support for each part of this package. It was structured in a way that it allowed members to both make the points they wanted to make and, frankly, if they needed political cover, do it. But it got done.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: So, I'm – I'm pretty proud of the speaker.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I – I want to talk to you more on the other side of this break, but just you are in there acknowledging, when you say, \"Vote no, hope yes,\" that there were Republicans who had to vote no…\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Well, they felt they had to.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … because of the political pressure and the fight within your own party.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: People don't – no, it's not – again, people make…\n(CROSSTALK)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But who wanted it to pass?\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: You think nobody makes political calculations in the United States Senate or in the administration?\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Yes.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Welcome to American politics.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: But the point is, look at the numbers. Look at overwhelming bipartisan numbers…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to do that…\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: … over and over.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … on the other side of this break.\nStay here, please.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Got it.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back.\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be back in just a moment.\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.\nWe want to continue our conversation now with Oklahoma Republican Congressman Tom Cole.\nCongressman, before the break we'd been talking about this vote the House had yesterday to approve the $95 billion package. There was a decision here for Speaker Johnson that was an important one. He basically put his job on the line. As we know, there's this movement among House conservatives, led by Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, to try to oust him from power, in part because of this Ukraine aid bill.\nDo you think this is a real threat to his leadership?\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Well, I take anything seriously. But, no, I don't. Look, I think it's a relatively small number of Republican members, frankly just as it was in McCarthy's case. There were only eight people.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: But the point is, I don't think there's unified Democratic support. There was unified Democratic support to remove the speaker. I think both sides have now seen how dangerous this is, how irresponsible it is. And, quite frankly, I think it's unlikely that Democrats who supported Ukraine, not as many supported Israel as we would have liked, but they did support Ukraine, I think they're unlikely to remove the speaker over that. All told to be fair, they removed McCarthy after he did what he asked them to do, which was keep the government funded. But, again, I don't think that's going to happen in this case. But if somebody wants to do it, it's within the rules and they can take their shot.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But what you're saying there is that Democrats you trust would protect Speaker Johnson from being ousted because they wouldn't vote to -\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Well, I think, frankly - I don't think you'd lose very many Republicans. We didn't lose very many Republicans with McCarthy. So, it doesn't take very many Democrats to either not vote or oppose it. And I don't - frankly, I don't think we'd lose the same number of Republicans that we lost with Kevin McCarthy. I think even people that disagree with the speaker -\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You wouldn't get to eight Republicans?\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: I don't think so.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: They've gotten to three, Marjorie Taylor Greene says there's (ph) three.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Look, I think there's a lot of people that like this speaker, that respect this speaker, even when they disagree with him. They know he's honest, he's a straight shooter. They also had a taste of what it's like to go without a speaker for three weeks. I don't think they want that again. I certainly don't think they want it close to an election.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Former Speaker Gingrich said, \"the demons that Matt Gaetz unleashed by going after Kevin McCarthy are still out there. You can't govern by shooting yourself in the head every day.\"\nHow does Speaker Johnson get anything done?\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Well, first of all, he just got a lot done. He's gotten every appropriations bill passed. He's gotten FISA through. He just got this consequential - so he's actually been -\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he has to rely on Democratic votes, which he's being faulted for by members of his party.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: No. Well, that's fine. I mean, honestly - no, there - every appropriations bill is bipartisan at the end of the day. They just work that way. So, most of these - and something like FISA ought to be bipartisan. I actually think he's, you know, empowered the center, and marginalized the extremes on - on each side.\nNow, is there some risk to that? Sure. But the point is, he's gotten a lot done. I think people admire him. They genuinely like him. They all respect him. Every single Republican voted for him. I don't think that any other person could have done that at the time other than Mike Johnson. So, the reservoir of goodwill is enormous. I think he's much stronger than the people seem to think, and I think he's demonstrated that by what he's passed.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: (INAUDIBLE) Republicans - first of all, do you think Republicans, after November, will have the majority?\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: I do.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And if so, he could be re-elected.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: I do because I think we're likely to win the presidency. I think this is pretty simple. I used to do politics for a living. I guess I still do. But the reality is, the person that wins a presidency is probably going to take the House. It's close enough that that probably makes a difference. I think we'll win. So, I think we will have the House.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, good to have you here in person.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Great privilege. Thank you.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Overnight, Israeli defense forces launched a deadly series of air strikes on the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, but there's also been an uptick of violence in the West Bank.\nOur Debora Patta reports.\n(BEGIN VT)\nDEBORA PATTA (voice over): Every ten minutes a child is killed in Gaza says the United Nations. That's nearly 15,000 children in almost seven months.\nHere, paramedics rush to save the injured after yet another Israeli air strike in Rafah. For this little girl, it was too late. Her grief-stricken father is inconsolable. He is not alone. In this room there are only the bodies of children.\nOvernight, at least ten more names added to that endless list of horror. The youngest, just two years old.\nOur CBS News team in Gaza reports that among the dead was a pregnant woman. Miraculously, doctors saved her baby girl.\nHere, Israel Defense Force soldiers prepare for a mission, but this is not in Gaza. It's IDF footage of a two-day operation in the West Bank city of Tulkarm, where they say they have been rooting out militants. At least 14 Palestinians were killed.\nDEBORA PATTA: The IDF pulled out last night, leaving this massive destruction in its wake. It's on a scale, residents say, they've never seen before.\nDEBORA PATTA (voice over): This morning, they were mopping up the damage. Israeli soldiers used bulldozers to smash through the area, destroying streets, buildings and infrastructure.\nThe West Bank has reached a boiling point. Nearly 500 Palestinians have been killed since October 7th and there are ongoing clashes with Israeli settlers, which escalated after a 14-year-old settler was found dead over a week ago.\nThe U.S. has imposed new sanctions on West Bank settlers and a U.S. official told CBS News that since 2022 it's been investigating an IDF unit of ultra-orthodox soldiers accused of human rights atrocities with an announcement expected this week.\nDEBORA PATTA: The unit is stationed here in the West Bank. Media reports suggesting it could be blacklisted from receiving U.S. military aid prompted an angry outburst from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said any sanctions imposed on the IDF would be a moral low when it is fighting in Gaza.\n(END VT)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That was our Debora Patta.\nAnd we're joined now by \"New York Times\" White House and national security correspondent David Sanger. His latest book \"New Cold Wars\" is out now.\nDavid, good to see you again.\nDAVID SANGER (White House and National Security Correspondent, \"New York Times\"): Great to be with you, Margaret.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Where do we begin? The world truly is on fire.\nDAVID SANGER: It is.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And one of the things I like about your book is, you write, going all the way back to listening to the Nixon-Kennedy debates, and hearing those candidates hash out America's role in the world, and geostrategy. In this election, we don't even know if the candidates will have a debate. Meanwhile, the world's on fire.\nHow do the American – members of the American public need to think about the global competition the United States is in the middle of?\nDAVID SANGER: Well, it's a very different competition than what we had in the Cold War. You know, those Nixon-Kennedy debates were, you know, at the height of the moment of a U.S. contest against the Soviet Union, which was terrifying and nuclear. But there was a simplicity about it. You know, there was a predictability about it. We understood who controlled their nuclear weapons. They understood who controlled ours. We knew who to call.\nThe new cold wars are quite different, Margaret. We've got Russia and China coming together in a periodic partnership. I wouldn't say it's a full alliance. We have other players, like Iran and North Korea, as you were discussing with earlier guests, supplying them, becoming sort of what the Iranians call an axis of resistance to the U.S. It is a far more volatile, I think far more dangerous period than we had even then.\nAnd yet, as you point out, our ability to discuss it as a nation has somewhat degraded. You watch those Kennedy-Nixon debates and put aside who was sweating and who looked young and vigorous and all that -\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\nDAVID SANGER: It was an incredibly sophisticated argument largely about nuclear deterrence. I'm afraid that we're not having that incredibly sophisticated argument today, you know, 60 years - more than 60 years later.\nBut the vote yesterday, which you've been discussing about Ukraine, at the end of the day turned out to be a fairly overwhelming vote in favor of the U.S. pushing against the Russians in Ukraine and perhaps beyond.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Certainly overwhelmingly yes for Democrats. A bit split for Republicans.\nDAVID SANGER: A majority of Republicans voted - voted against.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nDAVID SANGER: But it passed - it passed comfortably.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It passed. It did.\nAnd I - it's just - I think it's such an interesting point you make, though, in sort of changing how we think about competition with Russia and China. We learned Friday that the U.S. is likely to lose a significant counterterrorism base in the African country of Niger because the government demanded troop withdraw. I think a lot of Americans didn't even know that there was 1,000 U.S. troops there fighting or working in the counterterrorism space. Russia is moving in.\nDAVID SANGER: That's right.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: China is getting and carving out a large amount of influence in Africa. What are the fronts in the new cold war?\nDAVID SANGER: Well, there are a couple of different ones. You point out one in Africa. Also an area that China has been wiring up with Huawei equipment and so forth. So, we are concerned, you know, rightly so, that U.S., in not having a competitor straight on to put in 5G equipment may be losing the opportunity to help bind the continent together.\nIn the book I take you to the Solomon Islands, a place the U.S. fought for in World War II, and scored a big victory, but now has basically moved over into China's camp. There's still some contest underway.\nBut to answer your question more broadly, if you believe that there is something of a new iron curtain coming down, a place where you're going to divide the U.S., the NATO nations, against China, Russia, Iran, others, it's somewhere in that border land between Ukraine and Russia. And that's why the bill that went through Congress was so important.\nI don't know if it's enough to turn the tide. The Ukrainians may have lost so much time and ammunition here that it may be too late. But certainly had it not passed, that was pretty much, by the judgment of the CIA director, Bill Burns, and others, going to be the end of the contest. The Russians almost certainly would have surged forward.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And China has made clear they have a stake in Russia winning in Ukraine. It is this competition.\nDAVID SANGER: That's right. And, you know, if we had those debates again, and as you say, who knows if we will, I think the most interesting -\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Or even those interviews.\nDAVID SANGER: Or even - that's right.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Substantial interviews with conversations about national security interests of America. I mean, we should.\nDAVID SANGER: That's right. And, you know, President Biden has been reluctant to have, you know, major sit down interviews, at least with the print organizations. But I think if we did have those interviews, I think one of the big questions is, what is your plan to get in the midst of the Russia-China combination?\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nDAVID SANGER: Because the core of what Nixon and Kissinger were doing in the early '70s, in recognizing China, was to prevent Russia and China from coming together.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You also make this interesting point about the dynamic that's so different given, first of all, they're so economically intertwined, the United States and China. But also the business community and technology and the role that plays in this version of competition.\nA top U.S. cyber official told you companies, not the U.S. government, have all the insight these days. How do we know when an attack's coming?\nDAVID SANGER: Yes. The book opens with the days running up to the war in Ukraine. And while there was certainly lots of indicators coming from American satellites and signals intelligence and so forth, in the end one of the key indicators that the Russians were getting ready to roll came from Microsoft, whose engineers were noticing that malware that had been placed by the Russians on Ukrainian government agencies were being activated and sent a notice through their channels, which ultimately went to the White House.\nAt the end of the day, what kept Ukraine running was some combination of Microsoft and Amazon moving all of their data to the cloud and then Elon Musk coming in and providing Starlink so they could communicate to that cloud.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Incredible.\nDAVID SANGER: Something we never saw in the old cold wars.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: David, it's a fascinating read. It's good to see you in person. And we'll have to leave it there.\nDAVID SANGER: Thank you.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Pennsylvania's governor, Josh Shapiro, is standing by waiting for us.\nWe'll be right back.\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro. He joins us this morning from Abington, Pennsylvania.\nAnd, Governor, thank you for sticking with us. We've been having some transmission technical issues, so hopefully we don't get interrupted.\nI'll get - I'll get straight to it.\nGOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA): Good, I look forward to the conversation. Thanks.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'll get straight to it, Governor.\nYou have been outspoken against the rising and troubling anti-Semitism in this country. I know the FBI director said just a few days ago that federal law enforcement is concerned about lone actors targeting gatherings ahead of the start of Passover, which starts tomorrow. Are there known threats in your state?\nJOSH SHAPIRO: Well, there's not known threats right now. And I can tell you, the Pennsylvania State Police, working in coordination with our federal and local partners, are all over this and will let folks know in communities if there are specific threats.\nBut we continue to work closely with law enforcement and community leaders to do everything we can to take down the temperature, to address the rise in anti-Semitism, islamophobia, other forms of hate. There should be no place for that here in Pennsylvania. Of course, Pennsylvania founded on the vision of William Penn, a place that would be a place of tolerance and welcome and peace. A place where people could come together and practice their faith, whatever their faith is.\nWe have a special relationship with that here in this commonwealth where we respect all, no matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love or who you choose to pray to. And we're going to continue to do everything we can to make sure everyone feels protected in this commonwealth.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there should be no place for it anywhere in America. And I know you agree with that.\nLet me get to the politics of the moment.\nPresident Biden won the state of Pennsylvania in 2020 narrowly. He spent a lot of time in your state this past week. We've seen in our polling his approval rating among young voters aged 18 to 29 has dropped 12 points since February, from 55 percent to 43 percent today.\nHow does the president get that back?\nJOSH SHAPIRO: I think the president gets it back doing exactly what he's doing, showing up, talking about his record, addressing things like climate change, which are incredibly important issues for young voters, along with many others, obviously. Making sure that young people feel included in the conversation, not just as a vote, but as part of the governing coalition going forward.\nYoung people helped propel me to victory as governor. One of the first things I did was start what I believe is the first ever next gen engagement commission here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. A place where young people, quite literally, advise me on policy, meet with me regularly, give me their perspective on what's happening in the community.\nI think part of the frustration by young people is that that - they oftentimes don't feel heard.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nJOSH SHAPIRO: And they feel like their voices and their votes are taken advantage of come election time. This is a moment where the young people deserve to be at the table. And the fact that the president is showing up in these communities and talking about these issues that are going to help young people in the future I think is a really important step.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, last weekend Donald Trump was campaigning in Pennsylvania. It's so key. Here's what he said.\n(BEGIN VC)\nDONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Biden has imposed a savage natural gas export ban that's putting countless Pennsylvania jobs at risk. He's risking your lives. He's risking your jobs. But he doesn't care because all he cares about is the green new scam.\n(END VC)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He is speaking to real fear among some of your constituents about President Biden's decision to, at least temporarily, put a pause on new natural gas projects. How do you respond to that?\nJOSH SHAPIRO: Look, I've been very clear with the White House and publicly. I hope that this pause that they put in place is very quick and then we move forward.\nHere in Pennsylvania, our energy economy has powered this nation, and it has done so over many generations. And going forward I think Pennsylvania has an opportunity to be the center of the clean energy economy. Thanks to the president, we're the only state in the nation with two regional hydrogen hubs.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But just to - just -\nJOSH SHAPIRO: Thanks to the president, we've been able to work together -\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry, just - you broke up at the beginning. I think you said you've been very clear to the White House that you hope this is a short pause. Does that mean you agree it is costing your state jobs and money?\nJOSH SHAPIRO: Well, I think if the pause goes on for a long time it has the potential to cost us jobs. That's why I want this to be as quick as possible.\nAnd what I went on to say, though, is, we have an opportunity here in Pennsylvania to be the center of the clean energy economy. Thanks to President Biden, we have two regional hydrogen hubs. Thanks to President Biden, we are capping methane emissions from abandoned wells. We have billions of dollars of tax credits and other resources coming from the Department of\nEnergy to help us through a transition.\nHere in Pennsylvania, we're showing that we can both protect the jobs that exist today and create more energy jobs tomorrow. Energy is critical to the future of our commonwealth.\nNow, listen, the bravado and the bluster from the former president do nothing to actually create jobs in Pennsylvania. He's got an abysmal track record when it comes to that. President Biden has a strong record. And we're going to continue to lead on energy here in Pennsylvania.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned young voters and how key the issue of climate is to them. The Biden administration touts the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA, as a green energy bill, even though it wasn't named that. But CBS polling shows half of Americans have not heard much or nothing at all about what the administration has done. Only 14 percent say they've heard a lot. Two-thirds don't know if their state has gotten federal funds for climate change projects. This seems a real vulnerability for Democrats when it comes to young voters.\nJOSH SHAPIRO: Let me be very clear, climate change is real, it is serious and we have to address it. And Joe Biden understand that. Donald Trump has made fun of climate change and denies its existence. So, there's a clear contrast in this race.\nBecause of the federal dollars that have flowed to Pennsylvania, as I mentioned a moment ago, we are positioned to get two regional hydrogen hubs that are going to help us combat climate change. We're addressing all kinds of infrastructure needs here in the commonwealth, from repairing roads and bridges, to making sure people are connected to the internet, to making sure families in Esplen, which is a minority - predominantly minority community in Pittsburgh, no longer need to drink water out of the lines that contain lead thanks to Joe Biden cleaning that up.\nSo, when it comes to infrastructure investments, when it comes to the kind of investments that are going to help spur on a clean energy economy, President Biden has been there.\nNow, we have to make that case. And we've got to make sure folks understand that and hear that. That's why you run a campaign. That's why you'll see stark differences when it comes to combatting climate change between the policies of President Biden and what Donald Trump has done in the past and wants to do in the future.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the messaging needs work is what you're saying?\nJOSH SHAPIRO: Well, I think the case - I think the case needs to be made.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nJOSH SHAPIRO: There's a wonderful track record. There's a wonderful body of work. They need to make that case.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nJOSH SHAPIRO: And I'll be helping make that case alongside the president.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask about something that has been really damaging your state, and that is drug addiction. Pennsylvania has - I'm sorry, excuse me, the number one public health crisis in Pennsylvania, according to the state, is opioids. The CDC says Pennsylvania recently saw the highest number of xylazine related deaths in the country.\nWhat is driving the addiction?\nJOSH SHAPIRO: Well, listen, 13 Pennsylvanians die every single day from an opioid overdose. It is unacceptable. And here in Pennsylvania we're trying to come at it with a multipronged approach.\nFirst, we have to understand that drug addiction is a disease, not a crime. Now, we have to invest in law enforcement. And I have. We've increased the number of state troopers by 400 and I'm looking to add another 400. As attorney general, I arrested over 8,000 drug dealers. So, we're not going soft on those who are peddling these poisons in our community.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nJOSH SHAPIRO: But we also have to make sure that treatment is available. As attorney general, I led a national coalition that ended up holding those drug companies accountable.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Yes.\nJOSH SHAPIRO: The very people that brought this crisis into our communities and brought $2 billion back to Pennsylvania for treatment.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK. I'm - I'm sorry to interrupt you.\nJOSH SHAPIRO: This is really critical stuff and it's going to require a multipronged approach.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry I have to interrupt you. We have to leave it there, Governor. Thank you.\nWe'll be back.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

There's no current law that compels Montgomery to be in the courtroom, but that could change in future cases thanks to a new bill from lawmakers.\nThe New Hampshire House voted Thursday to require those charged with serious crimes to be present when they learn their fate.\nWhy are defendants allowed to skip sentencing?\nUnder the federal rules of criminal procedure, defendants are allowed to be absent from the courtroom in non-capital cases if they so choose after a trial has begun. Adam Montgomery took that option last month when he was convicted of killing his 5-year-old daughter, Harmony.\nThat would change for future cases under the bill that was sent to the New Hampshire Senate. As originally drafted, the bill would have required defendants charged with crimes punishable by incarceration of at least 15 years to appear in court for their entire trials as well as sentencing hearings. But opponents argued that only those who have been convicted should be required to appear.\n\"This could be used to weaponize the court process for someone who's been accused of a crime but not found guilty,\" said Rep. J.R. Hoell, a Republican from Dunbarton.\nAdam Montgomery and Harmony Montgomery.\nManchester Police\nBill spurred by Harmony Montgomery's murder\nThe amended version of the bill would require defendants to be present for the reading of verdicts and at sentencing hearings.\n\"If the jury spends the time to hear this case, the defendant should take the time to go in to respect that jury and hear their verdict. And he darn sure should show up for his sentencing,\" said Rep. Terry Roy, a Republican from Deerfield.\nRoy cosponsored the legislation with Rep. Steve Shurtleff, a Democrat from Penacook, who spoke about the Montgomery case at a public hearing earlier this month.\nAdam Montgomery asks to skip sentencing appearance\nMontgomery, who was convicted of second- degree murder, abuse of a corpse and other charges, was accused of killing Harmony in 2019 and then hiding and moving her body for months. Her remains have not been found.\nProsecutors have asked a judge to require Montgomery to appear at his sentencing hearing in May to face the girl's family and loved ones, Shurtleff said.\n\"And when I hear that phrase, Harmony Montgomery's loved ones, I feel that includes all of us, too, the citizens of New Hampshire,\" he said.",

Kennedy Jr.'s family, including six of his siblings, endorsed President Biden in Philadelphia Thursday, even as he pursues an independent bid for Mr. Biden's job.\n\"The Kennedy family endorses Joe Biden for president,\" said Kerry Kennedy, a sister of independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as she stood alongside the president.\n\"We want to make crystal clear our feelings that the best way forward for America is to reelect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to four more years,\" she added.\nKerry Kennedy praised Mr. Biden as a \"hero,\" and she referred to him as a leader in the mold of her father, Robert F. Kennedy, who \"stood for equal justice, human rights and freedom from want and fear — just as President Biden does today.\"\nHer father served as attorney general in John F. Kennedy's administration and was running for president himself when he was assassinated in 1968.\nSpeaking for the family members who are endorsing Mr. Biden, Kerry Kennedy had harsh words for presumptive Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump.\n\"I can only imagine how Donald Trump's outrageous lies and behavior would have horrified my father,\" she said, and she accused Trump of \"running to take us backwards, attacking the most basic rights and freedoms that are at the core of who we are as Americans.\" She accused Trump of planning to \"use his power to punish his enemies, silence his opponents and incite more chaos.\"\nShe did not mention her brother's presidential run. On Thursday, RFK Jr. qualified for the ballot in Michigan, as the nominee of the Natural Law Party, the office of the secretary of state confirmed. He is now on the ballot in two states, having qualified in Utah, too.\nJoseph P. Kennedy II, a former congressman and a brother of RFK Jr., replied, \"Of course,\" when asked by reporters if he would encourage his brother to drop out of the race.\n\"We cannot do anything that in any way, strips even one vote from President Biden. You put the name Kennedy on the ballot and Democrats are going to feel torn. We are trying to make them understand that this is an issue that they do not have to feel torn about,\" he told reporters while attending a post-rally meet-and-greet with Philadelphia voters.\nDuring the rally, Mr. Biden called the endorsement by the Kennedy family members \"an incredible honor\" and throughout his speech, he spoke of about how Robert F. Kennedy had been a hero to him. He cited a speech Robert F. Kennedy delivered in Indianapolis the night that Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated.\nMr. Biden also mentioned that in the Oval Office, he has busts of both King and Robert F. Kennedy. \"I keep looking to remind myself of what they would do in tough calls,\" he said.\nHe also said he spoke recently with Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Robert F. Kennedy, to wish her a happy 96th birthday.\n\"Your dad, I never got to meet him,\" Mr. Biden told the Kennedys, but recalled a visit by Robert F. Kennedy to Syracuse while he was in law school. \"But he inspired me. And his passion and clarity inspired a generation.\"\nSeveral of RFK Jr.'s family members have already expressed their opposition to their brother's independent candidacy. When he announced in October that he would drop his campaign for the presidency as a Democrat and run instead as an independent, four of his siblings — documentary filmmaker Rory Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, former Rep. Joe Kennedy II and former Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend — called his decision to oppose Mr. Biden \"dangerous to our country.\" In a statement at the time, they said, \"Bobby might share the same name as our father, but he does not share the same values, vision or judgment.\" The four said of his decision to run as an independent that, \"We denounce his candidacy and believe it to be perilous for our country.\"\nIn addition to Kerry Kennedy, RFK Jr.'s siblings, Rory Kennedy, Joe Kennedy II, Christopher Kennedy, Maxwell Kennedy and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, as well as several other relatives, endorsed Mr. Biden Thursday.\nKennedy said in a social media post Thursday morning that he's \"pleased\" his family is being politically active, calling it a family tradition. He added that they are \"divided in our opinions but united in our love for each other,\" adding that the sentiment could also be shared by Americans to \"restore civility and respect to public discourse.\"\n\"My campaign, which many of my family members are working on and supportive of, is about healing America — healing our economy, our chronic disease crisis, our middle class, our environment, and our standing in the world as a peaceful nation,\" he said.\nA bust of Robert F. Kennedy is visible behind President Biden in the Oval Office as he speaks during a virtual meeting with Ireland's Prime Minister Micheal Martin on St. Patrick's Day, March 17, 2021.\nAndrew Harnik / AP\nLast month, on St. Patrick's Day, Mr. Biden gave members of the extended Kennedy family a private tour of the Oval Office and West Wing and celebrated with them and hundreds of guests at a holiday reception. Kennedy family members posted photos with the president, signaling that they stand with him rather than with the Kennedy running against him.\nSeveral of the Kennedys joined Mr. Biden for a grassroots organizing event and helped with voter outreach, according to the campaign.\nGabrielle Ake, Kristin Brown, Allison Novelo and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",

But when redistricted in 2020, the seat turned Republican, electing Bud Cook of Washington County.\n\"I believe that I'm the first Republican in 100 years to serve in that position,\" Cook said.\nThe district includes all of Greene County and 24 municipalities in Washington County. This year, Cook is being challenged by Greene County Republican Stephanie Waggett of Carmichaels, a nurse and former power plant administrator who worries about the future of this region.\n\"My fear is that it is going to spiral downward unless we get someone in there who is really willing to work hard for us, be a voice for us and work to improve Greene and Washington counties,\" Waggett said.\nWaggett said Cook is not responsive to local officials.\n\"A lot of the people I've talked to feel like they've not been heard or just not getting a good response back,\" Waggett said. \"I believe these people have great information, and their needs are not being met.\"\nCook, who is one of only three local Republican House members being challenged in the primary, says he's being opposed because he's an outsider.\n\"It's about the politically connected versus the outsider,\" Cook said.\nCook sees himself as an outsider to the politically connected Republicans who have opposed him in the past and many, he says, have endorsed his opponent.\n\"Their motivation from my perspective is their power, their control, and their personal gain,\" Cook said. \"And when you put that ahead of the people, you're always going to have problems.\"\nFor her part, Waggett says that while Greene County deserves representation in the State House, she will represent everyone in the district, which is what Cook says he is already doing.",
