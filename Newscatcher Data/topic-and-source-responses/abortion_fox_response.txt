Some German women have traveled to neighboring countries such as the Netherlands \u2014 especially during later phases of their pregnancies when abortion is considered completely illegal in Germany except for very grave cases \u2014 to have abortions there.\nOther European countries are in very different places in their approach to abortion. France, for example, inscribed the guaranteed right to abortion in its constitution last month, in a world first and a powerful message of support to women around the globe. Meanwhile, Poland's parliament held a long-awaited debate last week on liberalizing the country's law, which is more restrictive than Germany's, although many women terminate pregnancies at home with pills mailed from abroad.\nWhile the German commission's recommendation for the government to decriminalize abortion is non-binding, it is likely to heat up discussion over the issue in the country again. It could eventually also lead to the current regulation being reformed by parliament, but at this point it is not clear if and when that would happen.\n\"Our recommendation is to move away from this illegality and to label abortion in the early stages of pregnancy as legal,\" Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf, a law professor who is a member of the commission, told reporters in Berlin.\n\"This is not simply a formality, but you can imagine that it makes a big difference to the women concerned, those who are in the situation of considering whether to request an abortion, whether what they are doing is wrong or right,\" she added.\nMany women who have had abortions in Germany have described the mandatory counseling as humiliating, while others have said it helped them in their decision-making.\nIn addition to the tricky legal status of abortions in Germany, the experts also pointed out that in recent years, the number of physicians willing to perform an abortion in the country has gone down and that it's been more difficult for women to find a doctor in their region to help them.\nThe commission said that if the government decides to make abortion legal during the first 12 weeks, it should also ensure that women wishing to have a termination have quick and easy access to organizations and doctors providing it.\nCurrently, about 10% of physicians performing the medical intervention have faced criminal charges, though they are almost never found guilty.\nThe Catholic Church, one of the main opponents of liberalizing abortion regulations in Germany, quickly condemned the commission's recommendations.\n\"The commission is considering legalizing abortion in the early stages of pregnancy. This would mean the end of a clear concept of life protection,\" said Irme Stetter-Karp, the president of the powerful lay group Central Committee of German Catholics.\n\"Human dignity exists from the very beginning,\" she added, calling the proposal \"unacceptable.\"\nIn addition to its recommendations for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, the commission said that for the middle phase of pregnancy, it should be up to lawmakers to decide whether and for how long an abortion should be legal, while in the last trimester, abortions should not be allowed unless there is a strong medical or social reason.\n\"The shorter the pregnancy, the more likely an abortion is permissible; and the more advanced the gestational age, the more important the needs of the unborn child are,\" the commission members said in a summary of their report, which they handed over to government ministers later on Thursday.\nGerman Health Minister Karl Lauterbach said the report's \"scientific expertise is a major help in answering the complex ethical questions on reproductive self-determination and reproductive medicine.\"\nLauterbach warned everyone not to use the publication of the report as a trigger to heat up the discussion about the legitimacy of abortion again.\n\"What we don't need in Germany is another debate that divides society,\" the minister added. \"That's why I appeal to everyone to react objectively, to discuss things objectively, to avoid slipping into an ideological discussion.\"\nHe said the government would also discuss the report in detail and share it with parliament.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Germany-March-For-Life.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":11.338017,"_id":"4cabf04514ce5af88219aee82cd5f53f"},{"title":"Feds gave $700M to Planned Parenthood during year of record abortions","author":"Jamie Joseph","published_date":"2024-04-19 18:32:57","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/feds-gave-700m-to-planned-parenthood-during-year-of-record-abortions","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Biden administration vows to expand access to abortions while Planned Parenthood report reveals record-high abortions after Roe v. Wade.","summary":"The federal government gave nearly $700 million to Planned Parenthood during a one-year span in which the clinic performed a record number of abortions, which coincided with a decline in all other major services, a recent report shows.\nMeanwhile, the Biden administration has vowed to expand access to Planned Parenthood's abortion services.\nPlanned Parenthood's 2022-2023 report released Tuesday, called \"Above and Beyond,\" found that several non-abortion categories of services were down, compared to the previous year. Contraceptive services, including counseling, were down by 4%, cancer screenings dropped 1% and pap smears were down by nearly 14%. Adoption referrals dipped by 5%, and preventative visits dropped by 4%.\nPlanned Parenthood conducted 392,715 abortions between Oct. 1, 2021, and Sept. 30, 2022 \u2014 a 5% increase from the 2021-2022 period.\nThe Biden-Harris administration ramped up its support for Planned Parenthood's abortion access following the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022. Vice President Kamala Harris toured a Minnesota Planned Parenthood clinic last month, making her the first sitting VP to visit an abortion facility.\nAt the time, Harris said \"attacks against an individual's right to make decisions about their own body are outrageous, and in many instances, just plain immoral.\"\nThe demand for abortion where states have limited or fully restricted its access rose by 700%, Planned Parenthood's report noted. In 2023, more than two dozen Planned Parenthood affiliates helped more than 33,000 women get abortions through financial and transportation assistance.\n\"Since the Supreme Court's decision to take away the federal constitutional right to abortion, more than 20 states have banned some or all abortions,\" the report noted. \"For Planned Parenthood health center staff, this was a year of moving mountains: finding appointments in other states and the resources to get patients there, building as much capacity as possible for abortion appointments, fulfilling increased demand in some places for birth control, and much more.\"\nPro-life groups slammed the report on Friday.\n\"Planned Parenthood's annual report illustrates their priorities,\" Tessa Longbons Cox, senior researcher at Charlotte Lozier Institute told Fox News Digital. \"Ultimately, they are an abortion business. It's no surprise that even as total patients and services fell from the previous year, profits soared and Planned Parenthood performed more abortions than ever.\"\nThe founder of pro-life group Live Action, Lila Rose, called the Biden administration's funding of Planned Parenthood \"grotesque.\"\n\"Our government makes every American taxpayer complicit in this killing,\" she said.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jamie Joseph","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/planned_parenthood.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":11.287111,"_id":"b8c9092cbe281dda81f45e1d33fd0475"},{"title":"Alabama senator seeks to expose abortions at the Department of Veterans Affairs","author":"Julia Johnson","published_date":"2024-04-16 08:00:07","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-tuberville-quarterly-abortion-reports-veterans-affairs","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Tommy Tuberville is looking to increase transparency between the VA and taxpayers by requiring the department to report on abortions facilitated each quarter.","summary":"FIRST ON FOX: A prominent Republican senator from Alabama is aiming to increase transparency about abortions that take place within the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nOn Tuesday, Sen. Tommy Tuberville plans to introduce the VA Abortion Transparency Act of 2024, a measure that would require the VA to provide quarterly reports as well as a variety of details surrounding its involvement in abortions performed.\nSome of the data required under the legislation would be the number of abortions that the VA facilitated during the quarter, whether it was conducted with medication such as Mifepristone or if it was a surgical abortion, at what week during pregnancy the abortion took place, and the expenditures associated with abortions during the time frame, among other details.\n\"Congress has spoken. The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 clearly prohibits the VA from providing abortion services of any kind,\" Tuberville said in an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital.\n\"For the Biden administration to twist the law into something other than what Congress intended and force the cost on the taxpayer is a disgrace. Our veterans deserve a VA that is 100% focused on ensuring they receive timely and quality care, not on implementing Joe Biden's abortion-on-demand agenda. I am proud to introduce this bill that provides much needed transparency for taxpayers and holds the VA accountable.\"\nTuberville was at the center of controversy last year when he held up hundreds of military promotions in protest of the Department of Defense's policies on abortion. His blockade began in February 2023 in response to a Pentagon policy providing travel expense reimbursement for abortion. He ended the hold up in December, noting he couldn't continue due to a rule change in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) spending bill.\nSens. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., Roger Marshall, R-Kan., and John Cornyn, R-Texas, are joining Tuberville in his quest for transparency on abortions in the VA \u2014 they've signed onto his bill as co-sponsors.\nThe legislation further has the approval of several pro-life organizations, including CatholicVote, National Right to Life, March for Life Action, Concerned Women for America and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.\nTuberville, who sits on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, is introducing the measure in part because he believes taxpayers should be able to see how funds are being spent by the department, according to his office.\nThe Republican senator's office noted that between September 2022 and September 2023, 88 abortions were facilitated through the VA, 28 of which were surgical, according to Military.com.\nHowever, the VA has since been unwilling to provide more recent data despite various letters requesting such, Tuberville's office said.\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, VA Press Secretary Terrence Hayes said, \"While VA does not comment on pending legislation, VA is committed to providing high-quality, comprehensive care to women veterans \u2014 including basic preventive care, acute care, chronic disease management, mental health care, and reproductive health care.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Julia Johnson","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/0a56e214-Rectangle-Inset-left.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":11.228506,"_id":"ccbc5436f41ae7d1767310bf7876b6e7"},{"title":"Trump risks losing key voter base with opposition to Arizona abortion law, pro-lifers say","author":"Chris Pandolfo","published_date":"2024-04-16 18:21:35","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-risks-losing-key-voter-base-opposition-arizona-abortion-law-pro-lifers-say","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Pro-life and Christian activists say that former President Donald Trump risks alienating a key voting bloc with his moderated stance on abortion ahead of the 2024 election.","summary":"Former President Trump's opposition to a strict abortion ban in Arizona has put him at odds with pro-life and Christian activists, who represent a voter base key to his presidential election effort.\nLast week, the Trump presidential campaign released a statement saying that states should decide how to regulate abortion. Days later, that position was tested when the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that an 1864 law banning abortion without exception for rape or incest should be enforced.\nTrump, who claims to be the most pro-life president in U.S. history, said the court's decision \"went too far\" and urged lawmakers to \"ACT IMMEDIATELY, to remedy what has happened.\" He said that \"ideally\" anti-abortion laws must contain exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. In other comments, he expressed confidence that the Arizona law will be \"straightened out.\"\nThat message was ill-received by Abby Johnson, a former Planned Parenthood director turned pro-life activist, who leads the group \"And Then There Were None.\"\n\"What I heard was that [Trump] is a person that does not believe in banning abortion,\" Johnson told Fox News Digital in an interview. She said there was a conflict between Trump's position that states should decide for themselves and his statement that Arizona went \"too far.\"\n\"So, here was a state that said we're going to ban abortion. And now he says, 'well, no, I don't want you to,'\" Johnson said. \"That tells me he doesn't want to ban it at the federal level. But he also doesn't believe the states should have a right to ban it at the state level.\"\nIt was a disappointing development for Johnson, who spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention in support of Trump's re-election. In her speech, she said Trump \"has done more for the unborn than any other president.\" She pointed to several of his accomplishments, including reinstating the Mexico City policy \u2014 critics call it the \"global gag rule\" \u2014 which blocks U.S. federal funding for non-governmental organizations that support abortion services, as well as appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, making state abortion restrictions possible.\nIndeed, Trump takes credit for his pro-life record regularly on the campaign trail. But he has also repeatedly criticized fellow Republicans for taking a hard-line stance on the issue, blaming candidates who did not allow for exceptions in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the pregnant person is at risk, for the GOP's setbacks in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\"A lot of politicians who are pro-life do not know how to discuss this topic, and they lose their election. We had a lot of election losses because of this, because they didn't know to discuss it. They had no idea,\" he said last year at a leadership summit of the Concerned Women of America.\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe pro-life cause has also suffered a handful of defeats on ballot initiatives that enshrined abortion rights protections even in red states like Ohio and Kansas. Similar initiatives in Arizona and Florida, among other states, are expected to drive up turnout in the November election.\nWilliam Wolfe, a former Trump official who served in the State and Defense Departments, said those defeats show that \"the culture in America still loves abortion, or deeply misunderstands what is happening in an abortion.\"\nWolfe is the executive director of the Center for Baptist Leadership (CBL), a newly-founded nonprofit that exists to revitalize the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC), America's largest Christian protestant denomination. Though the group does not endorse or support political candidates, it released a statement last week chastising Trump for his abortion position and urging him \"to forsake the advice of compromising political consultants.\"\nIn an interview, Wolfe described the Arizona abortion ban as \"a great law\" and encouraged Trump to make an \"unapologetic moral argument\" about how abortion \"ends innocent life\" and \"should be recognized as murder.\"\n\"Evangelicals and Southern Baptists are eager to support candidates who show unflinching courage and make moral arguments against the civilizational suicide that is abortion. I would encourage everybody to stand strong on this issue and run to it and not away from it, because we know that human life is valuable and should be protected from the moment of fertilization until the natural death,\" he said.\nWalker Wildmon, vice president and spokesman of the American Family Association, said the Arizona Supreme Court ruling was a valid ruling that recognizes the pro-life position, that life begins at conception and should be protected until natural death.\nWhile giving Trump credit for his record, Wildmon said the former president's most recent statements are \"out of line with his party and the entire pro-life movement.\"\n\"Just as slavery was a stain on our country, abortion is also a stain on our country. So in our view, since we believe that every life begins at conception, any abortion is too many abortions,\" he said.\nWildmon warned that Trump risks alienating a significant number of Evangelical Christian voters by attempting to appeal to independents or suburban women by watering-down his pro-life stance.\n\"The reality is that wiggling or squirming on the abortion issue isn't going to pick him up many voters,\" he said. \"It will really suppress the Evangelical Christian vote. There's already Evangelical Christians out there, a large voting bloc in the Republican Party, that have some concerns about President Trump and how he handles things and his self-control.\"\nHe added that Trump \"really needs to be moving to the right on this issue\" to consolidate his supporters ahead of a general election showdown with President Biden.\nWhile Republicans triangulate their position on the issue, Democrats have attempted to portray Trump as the man singularly responsible for stripping away women's rights.\n\"Here in Arizona, they have turned the clock back more than a century on women's rights and freedoms. The overturning of Roe was a seismic event. And this ban in Arizona is one of the biggest aftershocks yet,\" Vice President Kamala Harris said at a campaign event in Tuscon on Friday.\nShe called Trump \"the architect of this health care crisis\" and argued a second Trump term would mean \"more bans, more suffering, less freedom.\"\nBrian Burch, president of CatholicVote, said Trump appears mindful that far-reaching laws that restrict abortion access could make his re-election difficult. He and the other pro-life activists interviewed for this story emphasized that Trump remains the best alternative to President Biden for pro-life voters in the upcoming election.\n\"Trump may hold the position that, under the circumstances, states shouldn't go that far. And he's certainly entitled to that position. I believe he's wrong on that, but that's a far-cry from Joe Biden, who is saying he's willing to impose a nationwide abortion at any stage, for any reason, paid-for-by-taxpayers regime on the country,\" Burch told Fox News Digital.\nStill, Johnson said that many pro-life activists she's met with have told her Trump has lost their votes with his criticisms of the Arizona law and Florida's six-week abortion ban. \"It doesn't mean that they're going to go cast their vote for Biden, but they are not going to vote for Trump\" she told Fox News Digital.\n\"I think that just saying that you're pro-life is not going to be good enough anymore for some pro-life voters,\" Johnson added. \"And so while I think there's a lot of people who are waiting to see, and I'm one of those people who are waiting to see if Trump is going to right this ship, I think that he does need to be very careful with how he moves forward between now and the election.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Chris Pandolfo","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/trump-march-for-life-rally.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":11.071312,"_id":"690fb99bf41dd6d2150cfce4538c9288"},{"title":"Dems will make state sanctuary for kids' gender transitions, abortion over GOP protest","author":"Jamie Joseph","published_date":"2024-04-18 21:44:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-will-make-state-sanctuary-kids-gender-transitions-abortion-gop-protest","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Maine could soon shield from liability those who perform abortions or gender surgeries for minors from other states under a bill heading to Gov.

It would also create a private right of action for damages against law enforcement, prosecutors and other officials in states enforcing their respective state laws \u2013 even laws whose constitutionality has been confirmed by federal appellate courts.\nWith the state's Democratic Gov. Janet Mills expected to sign the bill into law, Maine voters must act to elect enough Republicans to \"take back at least one chamber\" in November's election, Republican state Rep. Laurel Libby told Fox News Digital in an interview Thursday.\n\"That's really the only way to make significant change in the face of this legislation,\" Libby said. \"They're stripping their parental rights, and that definitely has been overwhelmingly unpopular with Maine people.\"\nMaine's LD 227 is part of a broader effort nationwide by blue state lawmakers to shield medical providers performing abortions or transgender surgical procedures on minors who do not have full parental support. More than a dozen states have shield laws in place protecting abortion providers from out-of-state investigations where abortion is illegal.\nIt would also prohibit \"interference\" with abortion or sex change procedures, legally protect medical workers from facing lawsuits and could potentially permit concealment of medical records from plaintiffs seeking legal action against a provider.\nRepublicans who oppose the bill caution it might inadvertently allow for the \"kidnapping\" of adolescents in states that have heavier restrictions to undergo these procedures if they are taken across state lines to Maine.\nThe bill comes after 16 attorneys general, led by Tennessee's Jonathan Skrmetti, sent a letter to Gov. Janet Mills, Attorney General Aaron Frey and state legislature leadership denouncing the bill as a \"novel effort at state-sanctioned culture war litigation tourism.\"\nAbortion is legal in Maine up until full term of a woman's pregnancy. Last year, the legislature also approved some transition medication for 16- and 17-year-olds, such as puberty blockers and hormones, without parental consent.\nAt least 23 states restrict or ban transgender surgical procedures for minors.

Wade, complaints that pregnant women were turned away from emergency rooms in the U.S. spiked in 2022, according to federal documents.","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 One woman miscarried in the lobby restroom of a Texas emergency room as front desk staff refused to check her in. Another woman learned that her fetus had no heartbeat at a Florida hospital, the day after a security guard turned her away from the facility. And in North Carolina, a woman gave birth in a car after an emergency room couldn't offer an ultrasound. The baby later died.\nComplaints that pregnant women were turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, federal documents obtained by The Associated Press reveal.\nThe cases raise alarms about the state of emergency pregnancy care in the U.S., especially in states that enacted strict abortion laws and sparked confusion around the treatment doctors can provide.\n\"It is shocking, it's absolutely shocking,\" said Amelia Huntsberger, an OB/GYN in Oregon. \"It is appalling that someone would show up to an emergency room and not receive care -- this is inconceivable.\"\nIt's happened despite federal mandates that the women be treated.\nFederal law requires emergency rooms to treat or stabilize patients who are in active labor and provide a medical transfer to another hospital if they don't have the staff or resources to treat them. Medical facilities must comply with the law if they accept Medicare funding.\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday that could weaken those protections. The Biden administration has sued Idaho over its abortion ban, even in medical emergencies, arguing it conflicts with the federal law.\n\"No woman should be denied the care she needs,\" Jennifer Klein, director of the White House Gender Policy Council, said in a statement. \"All patients, including women who are experiencing pregnancy-related emergencies, should have access to emergency medical care required under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA).\"\nPREGNANCY CARE AFTER ROE\nPregnant patients have \"become radioactive to emergency departments\" in states with extreme abortion restrictions, said Sara Rosenbaum, a George Washington University health law and policy professor.\n\"They are so scared of a pregnant patient, that the emergency medicine staff won't even look. They just want these people gone,\" Rosenbaum said.\nConsider what happened to a woman who was nine months pregnant and having contractions when she arrived at the Falls Community Hospital in Marlin, Texas, in July 2022, a week after the Supreme Court's ruling on abortion. The doctor on duty refused to see her.\n\"The physician came to the triage desk and told the patient that we did not have obstetric services or capabilities,\" hospital staff told federal investigators during interviews, according to documents. \"The nursing staff informed the physician that we could test her for the presence of amniotic fluid. However, the physician adamantly recommended the patient drive to a Waco hospital.\"\nInvestigators with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services concluded Falls Community Hospital broke the law.\nReached by phone, an administrator at the hospital declined to comment on the incident.\nThe investigation was one of dozens the AP obtained from a Freedom of Information Act request filed in February 2023 that sought all pregnancy-related EMTALA complaints the previous year. One year after submitting the request, the federal government agreed to release only some complaints and investigative documents filed across just 19 states. The names of patients, doctors and medical staff were redacted from the documents.\nFederal investigators looked into just over a dozen pregnancy-related complaints in those states during the months leading up to the U.S. Supreme Court's pivotal ruling on abortion in 2022. But more than two dozen complaints about emergency pregnancy care were lodged in the months after the decision was unveiled. It is not known how many complaints were filed last year as the records request only asked for 2022 complaints and the information is not publicly available otherwise.\nThe documents did not detail what happened to the patient turned away from the Falls Community Hospital.\n'SHE IS BLEEDING A LOT'\nOther pregnancies ended in catastrophe, the documents show.\nAt Sacred Heart Emergency Center in Houston, front desk staff refused to check in one woman after her husband asked for help delivering her baby that September. She miscarried in a restroom toilet in the emergency room lobby while her husband called 911 for help.\n\"She is bleeding a lot and had a miscarriage,\" the husband told first responders in his call, which was transcribed from Spanish in federal documents. \"I'm here at the hospital but they told us they can't help us because we are not their client.\"\nEmergency crews, who arrived 20 minutes later and transferred the woman to a hospital, appeared confused over the staff's refusal to help the woman, according to 911 call transcripts.\nOne first responder told federal investigators that when a Sacred Heart Emergency Center staffer was asked about the gestational age of the fetus, the staffer replied: \"No, we can't tell you, she is not our patient. That's why you are here.\"\nA manager for Sacred Heart Emergency Center declined to comment. The facility is licensed in Texas as a freestanding emergency room, which means it is not physically connected to a hospital. State law requires those facilities to treat or stabilize patients, a spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services agency said in an email to AP.\nSacred Heart Emergency's website says that it no longer accepts Medicare, a change that was made sometime after the woman miscarried, according to publicly available archives of the center's website.\nMeanwhile, the staff at Person Memorial Hospital in Roxboro, North Carolina, told a pregnant woman, who was complaining of stomach pain, that they would not be able to provide her with an ultrasound. The staff failed to tell her how risky it could be for her to depart without being stabilized, according to federal investigators. While en route to another hospital 45 minutes away, the woman gave birth in a car to a baby who did not survive.\nPerson Memorial Hospital self-reported the incident. A spokeswoman said the hospital continues to \"provide ongoing education for our staff and providers to ensure compliance.\"\nIn Melbourne, Florida, a security guard at Holmes Regional Medical Center refused to let a pregnant woman into the triage area because she had brought a child with her. When the patient came back the next day, medical staff were unable to locate a fetal heartbeat. The center declined to comment on the case.\nWHAT'S THE PENALTY?\nEmergency rooms are subject to hefty fines when they turn away patients, fail to stabilize them or transfer them to another hospital for treatment. Violations can also put hospitals' Medicare funding at risk.\nBut it's unclear what fines might be imposed on more than a dozen hospitals that the Biden administration says failed to properly treat pregnant patients in 2022.\nIt can take years for fines to be levied in these cases. The Health and Human Services agency, which enforces the law, declined to share if the hospitals have been referred to the agency's Office of Inspector General for penalties.\nFor Huntsberger, the OB-GYN, EMTALA was one of the few ways she felt protected to treat pregnant patients in Idaho, despite the state's abortion ban. She left Idaho last year to practice in Oregon because of the ban.\nThe threat of fines or loss of Medicare funding for violating EMTALA is a big deterrent that keeps hospitals from dumping patients, she said. Many couldn't keep their doors open if they lost Medicare funding.\nShe has been waiting to see how HHS penalizes two hospitals in Missouri and Kansas that HHS announced last year it was investigating after a pregnant woman, who was in preterm labor at 17 weeks, was denied an abortion.\n\"A lot of these situations are not reported, but even the ones that are \u2014 like the cases out of the Midwest \u2014 they're investigated but nothing really comes of it,\" Huntsberger said. \"People are just going to keep providing substandard care or not providing care. The only way that changes is things like this.\"\nNEXT UP FOR EMTALA\nPresident Joe Biden and top U.S. health official Xavier Becerra have both publicly vowed vigilance in enforcing the law.\nEven as states have enacted strict abortion laws, the White House has argued that if hospitals receive Medicare funds they must provide stabilizing care, including abortions.\nIn a statement to the AP, Becerra called it the \"nation's bedrock law protecting Americans' right to life- and health-saving emergency medical care.\"\n\"And doctors, not politicians, should determine what constitutes emergency care,\" he added.\nIdaho's law allows abortion only if the life, not the health, of the mother is at risk. But the state's attorney general has argued that its abortion ban is \"consistent\" with federal law, which calls for emergency rooms to protect an unborn child in medical emergencies.\n\"The Biden administration has no business rewriting federal law to override Idaho's law and force doctors to perform abortions,\" Idaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador said in a statement earlier this year.\nNow, the Supreme Court will weigh in. The case could have implications in other states like Arizona, which is reinstating an 1864 law that bans all abortions, with an exception only if the mother's life is at risk.\nEMTALA was initially introduced decades ago because private hospitals would dump patients on county or state hospitals, often because they didn't have insurance, said Alexa Kolbi-Molinas of the American Civil Liberties Union.\nSome hospitals also refused to see pregnant women when they did not have an established relationship with physicians on staff. If the court nullifies or weakens those protections, it could result in more hospitals turning away patients without fear of penalty from the federal government, she said.\n\"The government knows there's a problem and is investigating and is doing something about that,\" Kolbi-Molinas said. \"Without EMTALA, they wouldn't be able to do that.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Emergency-Rooms-Pregnancy.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":10.181293,"_id":"48300aacf621c6f36907d2dd441eb18c"},{"title":"One of Trevor Bauer's accusers charged with fraud against him after allegedly faking pregnancy, abortion","author":"Ryan Morik","published_date":"2024-04-16 23:10:47","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/one-trevor-bauers-accusers-charged-fraud-against-him-allegedly-faking-pregnancy-abortion","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Darcy Adanna Esemonu, the woman who alleged Trevor Bauer sexually assaulted her, has been charged with two counts of felony fraud and theft by extortion against Bauer.","summary":"One of Trevor Bauer's accusers was charged with felony fraud theft by extortion in Arizona last month after \"knowingly [obtaining] a benefit from\" the pitcher and another man.\nDarcy Adanna Esemonu allegedly told Bauer she was impregnated by him and asked him for money for an abortion but was never pregnant.\nEsemonu was charged in Maricopa County March 19, but the indictment was not made public until Monday. It states that she \"did obtain a benefit\" from Bauer and another man \"by means of fraudulent pretenses, representation, promises, or material omissions.\"\nThe indictment also says Esemonu \"knowingly did obtain or sought property or services\" from the other man by \"means of threat to in the future expose a secret or an asserted fact in a social media message or in any other manner, whether true or false, tending to subject [him] to hatred, contempt, or ridicule or to impair [his] credit, or business unless the threat is based on a plausible claim of right to the property or services obtained or sought to be obtained.\"\nEsemonu is facing 16 years in prison.\nEsemonu \"demanded $3.6 million and claimed I forced her to have an abortion,\" Bauer said in a video posted on X.\n\"But here's the thing. She never had an abortion because she was never even pregnant,\" Bauer said.\n\"When I refused to pay her the [money], she made up a bogus sexual assault claim and filed a civil suit,\" Bauer added, saying their sex was consensual.\nEsemonu then claimed she had a miscarriage, but a motion for partial summary judgment filed by Bauer's legal team in October says there are records of negative pregnancy tests. Esemonu also said under oath there are no existing medical records showing she was pregnant.\nTwo law firms decided not to represent Esemonu in her civil suit against Bauer due to lack of proof of an abortion, Bauer said.\n\"Her MO is clear: Lie to men to get their money, extort them if she must, and when they refuse to pay, stop paying or stop giving her what she wants, go to the police, accuse them of sexual assault, and file a civil suit against them to retaliate,\" Bauer adds in the video.\nBauer is pitching professionally in Mexico after spending the 2023 season in Japan, where he was an All-Star. He last pitched in the majors in 2021 for the Los Angeles Dodgers but was placed on administrative leave and eventually suspended for 324 games for violating MLB's Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy.\nHis suspension was reduced to 194 games, representing the time he missed in 2021 while on administrative leave and the entirety of the 2022 season, but he was still released by the Dodgers before the 2023 season began.\nIn a combined 28 starts in the COVID-shortened 2020 season and his abbreviated 2021 campaign, his ERA was 2.24, and he struck out 11.8 batters per nine innings with a 0.92 WHIP.\nBauer and Lindsey Hill, who accused the pitcher of beating and sexually abusing her in 2021, settled their case late last year. Bauer revealed texts from Hill, who said Bauer would be her \"next victim,\" among other damning messages.\nFollow Fox News Digital's sports coverage on X and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ryan Morik","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/01/Trevor-Bauer3.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":10.001514,"_id":"6ee12ad547c6d4ee2a2e2d551e1d7aaa"},{"title":"Hillary Clinton slams 'cruelty' of Arizona abortion law in interview with emotional Kelly Clarkson","author":"Hanna Panreck","published_date":"2024-04-15 18:17:18","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/hillary-clinton-slams-cruelty-arizona-abortion-law-interview-emotional-kelly-clarkson","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Hillary Clinton reacted to the Arizona abortion ruling during Kelly Clarkson's show on Monday, calling it \"horrifying\" and she feared it would happen.","summary":"Hillary Clinton reacted to a recent ruling in Arizona, which bans abortion in nearly all circumstances, calling it \"cruelty\" during an interview with Kelly Clarkson and encouraging Americans to vote in a way that would \"make life better\" for the largest number of people.\n\"I feared it would happen but I hoped it wouldn't happen.

Longtime Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who was indicted last year on federal corruption charges, is not running for re-election as a Democrat and instead is mulling an independent bid, which polls indicate would potentially take votes away from likely Democratic Senate nominee Rep. Andy Kim.\nBashaw, an entrepreneur and historic preservationist who is recognized in the Garden State for leading the restorations of the historic Congress Hall and the Virginia Hotel in Cape May, at the southern tip of the Jersey shore, is a first time politician.\n\"I'm a political outsider,\" Bashaw emphasized. \"I'm a business guy. I built a business over 35 years restoring landmark abandoned hotels.\"\nAnd he highlighted that he grew his business from 25 to 1,000 employees.\n\"I'm in it because I want to unshackle small business from over regulation,\" he said.\nBashaw's chief rival for the GOP nomination is Christine Serrano Glassner, who's served for four years as mayor of Mendham Borough, in the northern part of the state.\nBashaw holds a formidable fundraising advantage in the Republican race - thanks in part to a large self-investment in his campaign.\nHe also enjoys an advantage on the primary ballot, as he has the county line in two-thirds of the state's 21 counties.\nNew Jersey has long allowed counties to print ballots that include a prominent party line, which are widely viewed as helping candidates with establishment backing. Kim sued in federal court to overturn the county lines in the Democratic Primary. But the GOP county lines were upheld.\n\"New Jersey is made up of thousands and thousands and thousands of small businesspeople. We are going to get to them really quickly and our name ID will go up really fast,\" Bashaw said.\nAnd pointing to a busy schedule on the campaign trail ahead of the primary, Bashaw showcased that \"I go to six coffees a day. I go talk to every single county in our state. I put a lot of miles on the car.\"\nAsked about former President Donald Trump, who is the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee, Bashaw told Fox News \"I'm supporting this ticket top to bottom.\"\nIt's been 36 years since a Republican carried New Jersey in a White House race, but Trump is planning a campaign stop in the state next month.\n\"Donald Trump thinks New Jersey's in play. I agree with him. Trump believes he can flip the country from blue to red. I believe we can flip this Senate seat from blue to red,\" Bashaw said.\nHe argued that \"there's a massive opportunity to pull\" New Jersey's large pool of unaffiliated voters \"to the Republican tent\u2026. We are going to pull those unaffiliated voters our way this fall.\"\nNational Republicans to date have not made any investments in the Senate race in the Garden State.\nBut National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director Mike Berg said \"we're keeping a close eye on New Jersey.\"\nA national Democratic Senate campaign aide, asked about the contest, told Fox News that \"Democrats have won every New Jersey Senate race since 1978 and 2024 will be no different.\"\nBashaw, in his interview, spotlighted a couple of key issues, including crime.\n\"New Jerseyans are not feeling safe and secure in their homes,\" he argued.\nOn immigration and border security, another key issue Republicans are spotlighting, he charged that New Jersey \"is now a border state. There are illegals coming into all of our counties.\"\n\"The woke ideology has permeated through our culture and we now have in our state, schools keeping secrets from parents about very, very, personal decisions,\" he claimed, as he defended parental rights in public education.\nOn the issue of abortion, which Democrats are spotlighting, Bashaw pointed to the two-year-old blockbuster decision by the Supreme Court's conservative majority that overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which for a half century had legalized abortion nationwide.\n\"I believe that the Dobbs decision was the correct decision,\" Bashaw said.\nBut he added that \"I don't support a federal ban,\" which some in his party are backing.\nThe Dobbs decision moved the fight over abortion back to the states, and in New Jersey abortion is legal in all stages of pregnancy.\n\"New Jersey's decided it,\" Bashaw said, before charging that \"the Democrats are the extremists on this issue, passing legislation allowing abortions up until the day of birth.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Paul Steinhauser","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Curtis-Bashaw-Cape-May-NJ-April-10-2024-scaled.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":9.357924,"_id":"938ed8733fa038d13fe7365d089522a4"},{"title":"As someone who grew up in Soviet Russia, don't let America turn into a Godless nation","author":"Rebekah Koffler","published_date":"2024-04-18 12:00:38","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/as-someone-who-grew-up-soviet-russia-dont-let-america-turn-into-godless-nation","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Rebekah Koffler: The assault on religious freedoms is transforming America from a nation steeped in the Judeo-Christian tradition to one more kin to my birthplace, Soviet Russia.","summary":"Former President Trump recently declared that he would not sign a national abortion ban if reelected and such a bill passed Congress, stressing in an interaction with reporters that abortion policy should be determined by individual states.\nTrump, who was raised as a Presbyterian but didn't exactly lead the life of a devout man, appears to focus his policies firmly on defending the Judeo-Christian principles that have served as the foundation of American culture since its inception. This is in stark contrast to President Biden, ostensibly a cradle Catholic but whose views on abortion prompted some of his fellow Catholics to call for Biden's disqualification from communion. Indeed, the policies of the 46th president and his fellow Democrats appear to contribute to, if not drive, the transformation of our country into a Godless nation.\nA massive change is underway in the spiritual landscape of the nation that has in its very Constitution guaranteed complete religious freedom. Modern America is steadily moving away from its religious heritage. Not only is religiosity steadily disappearing from American culture and society, people of faith increasingly have their rights undermined by the state.\nAs an immigrant from Soviet Russia, where religion was outlawed and believers were persecuted, I'm gravely concerned about our society's drift toward secularism and the government's efforts to suppress our constitutionally guaranteed freedom to pursue an authentic devout way of life.\nThe latest and the most direct and egregious affront to people of faith was President Biden's proclamation of March 31, 2024, which fell on Easter Sunday, as Transgender Day of Visibility.\nEaster is the most sacred holiday of the year for Christians, who comprise approximately 63% (or 210 million) of the U.S. population. It's been celebrated here since the Civil War. Transgender Day of Visibility, on the other hand, was created in 2009 to raise awareness about and draw attention to transgender people.\nTransgender persons comprise 1.64 million Americans, according to a 2022 study conducted by a UCLA Law School think tank, which used data from surveys done by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Adding insult to injury, the White House prohibited religious-themed designs from the art contest held for children of the National Guard during the Easter Egg Roll on the White House lawn.\nThis is not the first time the state wields its power to promote secularization of our society. Last December, some government apparatchiks across the country sought to take Christ out of Christmas. Some jurisdictions introduced guidelines for \"inclusive decorating practices\" and \"neutral language\" to mark the holiday season.\nLocal government officials instructed their staff to replace the red and green colors with neutral tones, avoid religious ornaments, and use gender-neutral nouns such as \"snow people\" instead of \"snowmen\" in order not to offend some members of the community. Are religious Americans no longer part of the so-called community? Evidently, it's OK to offend those Americans, trample on their constitutional right to properly celebrate Christmas, a religious holiday, using religious symbols.\nSome in the Democratic Party have been promoting anti-God sentiment, offending devout Americans, for several election cycles as it is courting religiously unaffiliated voters. In 2019, the Democratic National Committee passed a resolution praising the party's religious \"nones.\" The document called on Democratic leaders to listen to the concerns of \"religiously unaffiliated Americans,\" characterizing them as a group that \"advocates for rational public policy based on sound science and universal humanistic values.\"\nIn contrast, the narratives coming out of the Democratic Party messaging machine portray churchgoing Americans as stupid, old-fashioned, nationalistic and radical in their views. Christian nationalism is a new term that's frequently attached by the Democrats and leftist media to the Christian faith. Such commonsense concepts as two genders, marriage between a man and a woman, pro-life, mother and father, parental rights are portrayed as radical ideas.\nUnder Biden's presidency, attacks on religious liberty and Americans of faith have reached unprecedented levels. Biden's 2021 Build Back Better legislation reportedly blocked religious facilities, such as churches, synagogues and schools, from using infrastructure funds for improvements. In November 2021, Biden reversed a Trump-era rule that protects the religious liberty of faith-based organizations that contract with the federal government, allowing them to hire people who specifically hold their faith beliefs.\nIn March 2021, Biden's then-press secretary, Jen Psaki, refused to say if Biden would force doctors with religious objections to perform abortions. In his 2022 budget, Biden called for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which protects American taxpayers from being forced to fund abortion.\nIt is little wonder that America appears to be on the trajectory of becoming more and more secular. Church membership has been on the decline for the past two decades, but in 2020, it fell below the majority for the first time. According to a March 2021 Gallup poll, 47% of Americans said they belonged to a church, synagogue or mosque, down from 50% in 2018 and 70% in 1999.\nIndeed, last month's Gallup research showed attendance at religious services had declined in most U.S. religious groups. Only three in 10 Americans say they attend religious services every week (21%). The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the most observant, with two-thirds attending church weekly or nearly weekly. Protestants rank second, with 44% attending services regularly, followed by Muslims (38%) and Catholics (33%), according to Gallup.\nContributions to religious organizations remain at a historical low of 44%, and volunteering is down.\nAs Biden is gearing up for the 2024 election this November, there are no signs that, if re-elected, America's chief executive and the Democratic Party would halt their assault on Christians and religious freedom.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Rebekah Koffler","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/03/flags.jpg","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":9.222684,"_id":"b98796ba426ca5fcb1bb4f5334a033a2"},{"title":"Rep.

Times, voter focus groups in Arizona did not have favorable views of Vice President Harris, even among Democratic voters.","summary":"Multiple voter focus groups in Arizona have weighed in on Vice President Harris ahead of the November election, and their responses reinforced the notion that she's an unpopular candidate, according to a report in The Los Angeles Times.\nDays after Harris spoke in Arizona on April 12, the political group \"Republican Voters Against Trump\" invited the outlet to view videos of interviews with three different voter focus groups: one of former Trump 2016 voters who voted for Biden in 2020, one of Black voters who are disappointed with Biden, and another of \"California Democrats.\"\nThe Times reported the crossover voters' views, stating, \"Their assessments were brutal. If she is helping Biden, you don't see it. She rubs me the wrong way. She was picked because she is a demographic. The big things she had, she failed.\"\nGunner Ramer, the political director of Republican Voters Against Trump, summed up the views to the Times, saying, \"Swing voters don't like her.\"\nThe other two groups, while less antagonistic towards Harris, were not complimentary of her. \"In a focus group of Black voters who were disappointed with Biden, none raised their hand in support of Harris, with one participant calling her \u2018the bad news bear,'\" the report noted.\nIt added, \"A focus group of California Democrats, while they liked Harris, had to be prompted to discuss her and said she needed more influence and exposure.\"\nThese views of Harris are not surprising considering she is even less popular than even President Biden and former President Trump, two historically unpopular presidents.\nUSA Today and Suffolk University polling from last month recorded that around 52% of registered voters disapprove of her performance as vice president. Additionally, only 36% of those surveyed say she is handling the job well, with 10% undecided.\nSuffolk University Political Research Center Director David Paleologos claimed in USA Today's report that Harris' unpopularity will be a big talking point during this election.\n\"Usually, it's a secondary and muted discussion about vice presidents. This time, it's going to be almost a parallel and loud discussion in comparison,\" he said.\nThe L.A. Times described how \"Harris has heard the criticism since she entered the White House\" and \"stepped up her appearances with core Democratic groups\" in response.\nThis campaign cycle, the vice president has leaned into championing abortion rights. Late last year, she kicked off her Fight for Our Reproductive Freedoms Tour, touring the nation to galvanize Biden voters over the issue of reproductive freedom.\nThe L.A. Times noted that Harris' allies \"believe her role as the administration's leading voice on abortion rights will boost her and the Democratic ticket on an issue that helped carry the party to unexpected success in the 2022 midterm elections.\"\nHowever, the outlet noted that even though she spoke out in Tucson earlier this month in response to the state Supreme Court upholding an 1864 abortion ban, focus group voters didn't notice.\n\"Several voters said in interviews in Phoenix on Monday that they were not aware Harris was in their state just a few days ago, underscoring the challenge of getting attention as a vice president in an era of information overload.\"\nDuring one of the focus group interviews, Black Democratic voter Tracey Sayles said, \"If she is coming for us, she doesn't show it.\"\nOther voters ripped Harris as well. Retired military member Jeff Garland, who voted Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020, declared, \"But from what I have seen of her, she doesn't look like someone I want running my country.\"\nThe Biden/Harris campaign views it differently. Campaign communications director Brian Fallon told the outlet that the vice president \"has proven to be a highly effective messenger on issues from reproductive freedom to gun violence prevention,\" and that she is \"uniquely positioned to mobilize critical groups across the Biden-Harris coalition, including both progressives and independents.\"\nThe Biden campaign did not immediately reply to Fox News Digital's request for comment.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Gabriel Hays","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1765580230.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":8.692669,"_id":"443baf82a59de6decf7bd1de9129065e"},{"title":"Possible jurors in Trump hush money trial excused after making admission and more top headlines","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-16 10:41:14","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/possible-jurors-trump-hush-money-trial-excused-after-making-admission-top-headlines","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Jury selection to resume after possible jurors excused for admitting they could not be impartial.","summary":"TRUMP TRIAL \u2013 Jury selection to resume after possible jurors excused for admitting they could not be impartial.

And I guarantee that if he is a problem for you, then those thoughts, words, and actions are negative \u2014 they're gonna come out and then we commit sin. That's what sin is.\"\nThe bishop urged the faithful to note such destructive resentments when seeking the Sacrament of Reconciliation, the practice through which Catholics believe God forgives the sins they confess.\n\"How many times have you confessed your anger towards the president?\" the bishop asked, provoking unintended laughter from the audience. But the bishop continued, \"I'm serious, I'm not kidding. If you have it, you should be confessing it. Otherwise, you're not free.\"\nGruss compared persistent anger and resentment to a \"ball and chain\" that harms the self more than the other.\nReflecting on his own feelings towards Biden \u2014 who has embraced a public affiliation with Catholicism while also supporting abortion, gender ideology, and other policies contrary to Church teaching \u2014 the bishop said he pities him.\n\"I don't have any anger towards the president. I feel sorry for him. I'm not angry at him, he's just stupid,\" Gruss said.\nThe comment provoked renewed laughter from the audience, though the bishop remained serious.\n\"It's not stupidity in the derogatory way, it's stupidity in the sense of [...] he doesn't understand the Catholic faith.\"\nGruss' comments are only the latest example of Catholic prelates' increasingly vocal opposition to Biden's self-professed Catholic identity.\nFollowing heated debate about the appropriateness of the bishop's remarks, the Diocese of Saginaw released a statement about the talk in which Gruss clarified his points.\n\"I was speaking in the context of forgiving the president and any people in government who offend us by their words and actions \u2014 that we cannot harbor resentment toward them because in doing so, it would be sinful,\" Gruss said.\nGruss did apologize for using the word \"stupid\" to refer to the president, saying he should have chosen a more precise word.\n\"I used the word \u2018stupid' in reference to President Biden, recognizing that it was poor judgment in my choice of words,\" Gruss said. \"It was not meant to be disparaging, and I apologize.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to the Diocese of Saginaw and the office of the bishop but did not receive a response.\nPope Francis himself has previously commented on Biden's \"incoherence\" on the abortion issue as a professed Catholic.\n\"I leave it to [President Biden's] conscience and that he speaks to his bishop, his pastor, his parish priest about that incoherence,\" the pope remarked in 2022.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Timothy Nerozzi","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/01/biden-mcauliffe-youngkin.jpeg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.9665937,"_id":"63969da5dfeb17ab8ae03542ea6eb3f7"},{"title":"Fox News Poll: Biden, Trump in dead heat in 2024 Pennsylvania rematch","author":"Victoria Balara","published_date":"2024-04-18 22:00:08","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-biden-trump-2024-pennsylvania-rematch","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"President Biden and former President Trump in a dead heat in the latest Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters","summary":"The Keystone State looks headed for another tight race as President Biden and former President Trump are in a dead heat in the latest Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters, a state Trump won by less than a point in 2016 and Biden reclaimed by just over a point in 2020.\nThe survey of registered voters, released Thursday, finds the former and current presidents tied at 48% each, a slight improvement for Biden who was down by 2 percentage points in March.\nBiden saw modest gains among nonwhite voters (+5), suburban voters (+5) and voters under age 35 (+9), while Trump's coalition, such as conservatives, White evangelicals, White men without a degree, and rural voters, held relatively steady. What's more, Trump kept the advantage he had among independents: He was ahead among them by 7 points in March and maintains an 8-point edge now.\nBiden won union households by 5 points in 2020. Today, he holds the small subgroup by 2 points (49% Biden, 47% Trump). Non-union households split 48% each.\nIn a potential five-way race that includes third-party candidates, Trump comes out on top by 2 points: Trump 44%, Biden 42%, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. 8%, Jill Stein 2%, and Cornel West 1%. In this scenario, 8% of two-way Trump supporters break for Kennedy (none for Stein or West), while 10% of Biden supporters go for Kennedy (6%), Stein (3%), and West (1%).\nBiden is in the Keystone State this week, focusing on the economy and advocating for higher taxes on the wealthy as he visits several cities, including his hometown of Scranton.\nOver 4 in 10 voters feel they are falling behind financially (44%). Almost as many (41%) say they are holding steady, while just 14% say they are getting ahead. Trump leads among those who feel they are falling behind by 53 points, while Biden is ahead by 42 points among those saying getting ahead/holding steady.\nThe March Fox News Poll identified the economy as the top issue for Pennsylvanians, when voters surveyed felt Trump would better handle the issue. Trump's advantage on the issue (+12 points) held steady in the April poll.\nTrump also has a 16-point lead on another top issue: immigration and border security, while voters favor him on foreign policy by 4 points.\nBiden is seen as better at handling abortion (+10), election integrity (+6), and health care (+6).\nThe two major candidates are nearly tied on energy policy (Biden +1), despite concerns among some Democrats that Biden's opposition to fracking might be unpopular, especially after the administration paused new exports of U.S. natural gas earlier this year. A House Oversight Committee hearing on Thursday saw Republicans question the impact the pause would have on the U.S., especially internationally.\nVoters split over the Biden administration's handling of the conflict in the Middle East: 24% think he's too supportive of the Israelis vs. 23% say he's too supportive of the Palestinians. The largest number, 40%, says Biden's approach is about right.\nDemocrats are more likely to think the White House is too supportive of the Israelis, while Republicans are more likely to think it is too supportive of the Palestinians.\nBiden's job approval rating is nearly identical to his personal favorability rating: 45% approve of the job he's doing and 44% have a favorable opinion of him, while 55% disapprove of his job performance and have an unfavorable view of him.\nTrump is perceived slightly better than Biden on his favorable rating, but still underwater by 5 points (47% favorable vs. 52% unfavorable), while Kennedy is underwater by 6 points (40% favorable, 46% unfavorable, 15% can't rate).\nThe candidates' mental soundness has been a topic of debate and Pennsylvania voters are more likely to think Trump has the mental fitness to serve effectively as president (49%) than say the same of Biden (43%). At least half think they both don't have the mental soundness to perform the duties of president (50% Trump does not, 55% Biden does not).\nThe Pennsylvania congressional race is tight as well: 47% say they would vote for the Democratic candidate in their district while 46% support the GOP candidate. That's a reversal from March when Republicans were up by 3 points.\n\"The liabilities Biden has nationally are present in Pennsylvania, but they're muted,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"His standing with core Democratic constituencies is a little stronger, and he does a little better on issues like abortion, health care, and election integrity. It's the difference between being down a few points versus being tied.\"\nConducted April 11-16 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,141 Pennsylvania registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (211) and cellphones (628) or completed the survey online after receiving a text (302). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of \u00b13 percentage points. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics of respondents are representative of the registered voter population.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Victoria Balara","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/03/Biden-Trump-1-1.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.1363764,"_id":"5ebbe5d03aef295670116545faf89014"},{"title":"GOP bill cracks down on 'loophole' allowing foreign donors to pump dark money into US elections","author":"Andrew Miller","published_date":"2024-04-17 14:31:50","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-bill-cracks-down-loophole-allowing-foreign-donors-pump-dark-money-us-elections","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"A new bill aims to crack down on foreign billionaires using dark money networks to fund ballot measures in the United States using a workaround that critics say violates federal law.","summary":"FIRST ON FOX: Senate Republicans are introducing a bill on Wednesday that aims to prevent foreign nationals from improperly influencing American elections in response to a report outlining how a foreign billionaire allegedly funneled almost $250 million into a liberal dark money network that poured almost $100 million into nationwide ballot campaigns.\nThe Prevent Foreign Interference in American Elections Act, being introduced by Tennessee GOP Sen. Bill Hagerty, states that it will \"amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to further restrict contributions of foreign nationals.\"\nThe move comes after the Senate was briefed on a new report from Americans for Public Trust that shows Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss has sent more than $243 million to the Sixteen Thirty Fund which then invested $97.6 million in ballot campaigns across 25 states over the past decade. Those states included the key swing states of Michigan, Ohio, Colorado, and Nevada.\nThe tens of millions of dollars from the Sixteen Thirty Fund, which has also been funded by George Soros, went into ballot measures promoting abortion access, lessening drug penalties and prison sentences, raising the minimum wage, automatic voter registration and other progressive causes.\nWyss, who is referred to by some as the \"new George Soros\", also allegedly gave more than $135 million between 2016 and 2020 to a nonprofit that gave tens of millions to Super PACs that supported Joe Biden in 2020 and has steered tens of millions of dollars to Democratic fundraising committees, get out the vote efforts, and Democratic candidates via nonprofits.\n\"A single Swiss billionaire, Hansj\u00f6rg Wyss, has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into various left-wing causes meant to influence American politics,\" Honest Elections Project Executive Director Jason Snead told Fox News Digital last year. \"Since 2016 he has given at least $245 million to Arabella Advisors' dark money behemoths New Venture Fund and Sixteen Thirty Fund. In 2020 alone, CTCL (Center for Tech and Civic Life) received $25 million from New Venture Fund. CTCL and its new Alliance are opening avenues for foreign billionaires to pump funds directly into the heart of US elections.\"\nCaitlin Sutherland, who told Fox News Digital last year that Wyss is the \"most influential figure in politics that you've never heard of\", wrote in the report's forward that Sixteen Thirty Fund is using Wyss's money as part of its \"war chest\" to \"support massive get out the vote drives, issue advocacy campaigns bolstering President Biden's agenda, liberal pet projects from abortion to immigration, and attack ads against Republican lawmakers.\"\nHagerty's bill would clarify that the existing foreign-national ban on \"indirect\" contributions covers attempts to circumvent the ban through intermediaries or instructions which conservatives have long argued poses a threat to Democracy when funds are dumped into dark money groups inside the U.S. from abroad.\n\"Foreign nationals are prohibited from donating to U.S. political candidates, committees and super PACs but there is no federal law prohibiting foreign nationals from donating to ballot committees,\" the report's conclusion explains. \"Some state laws exist to try to prevent this type of foreign influence, but in a majority of states, foreign nationals like Hansjorg Wyss, are allowed to write blank checks to fund ballot issues that could prioritize their interests over those of the residents of the state.\"\n\"If state and federal law permits a Swiss billiionaire to fund ballot initiative campaigns, there is nothing stopping U.S. adversaries from Communist China, Russia, or North Korea from doing the same.\"\nThe bill would prohibit foreign nationals from funding ballot harvesting and GOTV efforts, prohibit foreign nationals from funding U.S. election administration, and prohibit foreign nationals from spending money to influence ballot measures.\n\"After years of hysteria over Russiagate and alleged foreign influence in American elections, it turns out Democrats have recently benefited from hundreds of millions of dollars in election-related contributions from a shadowy foreign billionaire, sidestepping the federal ban on foreign-national contributions in U.S. elections,\" Hagerty said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\"This type of influence undermines democracy and self-government here in America, and its staggering scope should be alarming. I'm pleased to introduce this commonsense and critical legislation that will put an end to covert foreign influence on our elections and protect Americans' voice in electing their leaders.\"\nIn a statement, Sutherland said that \"it is irresponsible and alarming that our laws leave the door open to foreign nationals and U.S. adversaries influencing American politics.\"\n\"Our report reveals that Sixteen Thirty Fund alone is acting as a conduit for massive amounts of money from a foreign billionaire with an expressed desire to reshape U.S. politics to align with his out-of-touch worldview. After years of national discourse about fears of foreign influence in our elections, this commonsense proposal to close the foreign influence loophole should be something everyone can support.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to Sixteen Thirty Fund for comment but did not receive a response.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Andrew Miller","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Capture-28.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.1142898,"_id":"5b8b796f24ff1bb7ebc04d3bf8140013"},{"title":"'Protect The Squad' fundraising site launches to bolster far-left lawmakers as primary threats loom","author":"Elizabeth Elkind","published_date":"2024-04-17 13:35:33","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/protect-the-squad-fundraising-site-launches-bolster-far-left-lawmakers-primary-threats-loom","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"A new fundraising venture is aimed at protecting the far-left \"Squad\" from primary threats over their criticism of Israel.","summary":"House Democrats in the ultra-progressive \"Squad\" are being bolstered by a new joint fundraising venture as they face mounting threats to their jobs.\nThe \"Protect The Squad\" website that was launched by Justice Democrats, a progressive PAC, appears to have been launched within the last week and is linked to Democratic fundraising giant ActBlue.

And so, I am a little concerned about the overindulgence around the day-to-day. I get it, I totally get it. The consequential nature of a criminal trial is profound and outsized in some respect, but not more outsized than democracy, more outsized than Dobbs,\" he said, referring to the Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v.

Kornacki noted that back in 2020, the numbers were flipped, and voters viewed Biden as being more competent and effective.\nThe poll found 47% of voters view Trump as competent and effective, compared to just 36% who view the president the same way.\n\"Who has the strong record as president? And again, Trump outpacing Biden on that front. And again, you've got to mention this one, too. Necessary mental and physical health. We asked this four years ago. It was a wash. It's now a clear liability for Joe Biden. So these are all troubling numbers for Biden,\" Kornacki said.\nBiden leads Trump in just two categories; his ability to bring the country together and in dealing with abortion. However, Kornacki noted a lot of voters believed neither candidate was better than the other in their ability to bring the country together.\nWelker and Kornacki noted the poll's findings on RFK Jr.'s standing in the election, as many believe Kennedy would spoil the election for Biden and lead to a Trump victory.\nHowever, the poll found with RFK Jr.'s name on the ballot, the hypothetical match-up would fall to Biden.\n\"We show a 46-44 race for Donald Trump,\" Kornacki said, noting the results of the head-to-head match-up with just Biden and Trump. \"But, look what happens when we add RFK's name to the mix. Suddenly, we have a new leader. Joe Biden, 39%, Donald Trump 37%, there's Kennedy getting 13%. We see by a better than two to one margin, it's Trump voters are flipping to Kennedy in this scenario, not Biden voters.\"\nWelker said the results \"defied conventional wisdom.\"\nKornacki compared Biden's job approval, which currently sits at 42%, to past presidents at the same point in their presidency. Biden's 42% approval rating was the lowest among recent presidencies, including Trump's.\nKornacki also noted that voter interest in the 2024 election was the lowest it has been since NBC News started polling the question in 2008.\nPolling in key battleground states shows the race will prove to be very close, as Biden and Trump are currently tied at 48% in Pennsylvania, a Fox News Poll released on Thursday found.\nIn North Carolina, Trump leads Biden by just two percentage points, according to a poll released in early April.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Hanna Panreck","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1258563469-e1687799098776.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.3804617,"_id":"e4947370b7527fce86ca6e20810cb7b9"},{"title":"Fox News Politics: Unbiased juror quest","author":"Fox News Staff","published_date":"2024-04-16 20:26:45","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-politics-unbiased-juror-quest","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content","summary":"Welcome to Fox News' Politics newsletter with the latest political news from Washington D.C. and updates from the 2024 campaign trail.\nWhat's happening?\n- White House says Biden will not testify in Hunter's business investigations\n- Fetterman calls out anti-Israeli agitators in profanity-laced social media post\n- Soros nonprofit becomes huge spender in 2024 election\nThe second day of jury selection in former President Trump's Manhattan criminal trial saw a similar dynamic play out: Many New Yorkers don't think they can be impartial when it comes to the presumptive Republican nominee.\nMore than 50 of the original 96 prospective jurors were excused Monday, some of them admitting they could not serve as impartial jurors.

There's no spinning those realities and that isn't good for Biden. Only he doesn't care about your pain.","summary":"Inflation and crime, more than any others, are the political issues that voters feel in their gut rather than consider in their mind. For President Joe Biden, this is a massive problem because not only are Americans deeply worried about both, they blame the sitting president.\nAccording to the Real Clear Politics average of polls, 56% of Americans disapprove of Biden's handling of crime, compared to a mere 38% who approve. On inflation, it's even worse, with the president 26 points underwater.\nTaxes, foreign policy, even something as emotionally fraught as abortion are ideas that most people grapple with intellectually, weighing concepts and compromises, deciding whose approach they prefer.\nBut when you look at the grocery bill being tallied and worry you don't have enough left over to get your kid that thing he wants for his birthday, when you're waiting for your ride-share hoping it arrives soon, so you don't get mugged, these are visceral sensations that can't be spun.\nNot that Biden hasn't tried, of course.\nThree years ago, inflation was \"transitory,\" two years ago it was all just \"Putin's Price Hike,\" last year we were told that \"Bidenomics,\" is working, and we simply aren't sophisticated enough to see it.\nBut as the playwright David Mamet once wrote, \"your excuses are your own,\" and all three of these failed whoppers are deep in the rearview mirror today.\nNow, Biden tells us that inflation is down over the past year, but even if that is true, it is down from astronomical heights that he created when he made all the money machines go whirrrr and, more importantly, high prices are still pinching the average American.\nOn crime, it is much the same, but with a new wrinkle that former President Donald Trump has been quick to seize upon. Just in time for the general election, the crime issue has taken on a new dimension, as Trump bluntly puts it, \"the migrant crime crisis.\"\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and his husband might feel safe walking the dog around Capitol Hill, but for denizens of Washington D.C., who don't have a security detail, it is a gauntlet of carjackings, shootings and vagrancy.\nPolice officers are being attacked, nursing students are being murdered, women are being sexually assaulted, and criminal gangs are growing in our prisons all because Biden absolutely refused to secure the border for three years.\nThe inescapable conclusion is that none of this would have happened had our commander in chief been doing his job, that this parade of horribles is entirely owing to his policies.\nSuddenly, Biden says he may shut the border down in a style much like Trump's, is it any wonder why? It is because he is rightfully being politically thrashed for his utter incompetence.\nFinally, securing the border is a good idea that will help Americans, and it may be that Biden can patch together some last-minute policy Hail Marys to help him get across the electoral finish line.\nHowever, none of them will address the real problem, which is that when the American people tell their president that they are fearful and concerned, he just, honest to God, doesn't seem to care.\nWhen President Bill Clinton heard from the American people about their worries and plight, he'd bite his lip and make it clear that he understood and felt our pain.\nBiden's version of this is to lash out at the American people by basically saying, \"you don't know how good you've got it, Jack!.\"\nI'm sorry, that is not a winning message.\nJoe Biden doesn't feel our pain. Joe Biden mocks our pain.\nAnd it is always about Joe. He tells Americans struggling paycheck to paycheck about his dad in the 1950s, who was apparently under constant and brutal economic pressure, wanting to say, \"Joey, it'll be alright.\"\nHe tells the families of murder victims about the losses he has suffered in his own family.\nBiden's empathy is always directed inward.\nCrime and inflation are inescapable realities for Biden in the 2024 election. Even if they improve, they aren't going away.\nHowever, none of them will address the real problem, which is that when the American people tell their president that they are fearful and concerned, he just, honest to God, doesn't seem to care.\nThis pair of issues are emotional gut punches to the electorate and the real problem for Biden, no matter what he does between now and November, is that for three years not only did he do nothing to make them better, he told us they weren't a problem at all.\nEven the longest general election in American history may not be long enough for Joe Biden to escape these cold, honest facts.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David Marcus","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/Philadelphia-Shooting.gif","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.5056844,"_id":"00c9644b90c2d3b42cf38d684b848810"},{"title":"On this day in history, April 17, 1970, Apollo 13 astronauts return alive, defy odds after space explosion","author":"Kerry Byrne","published_date":"2024-04-17 04:02:22","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/this-day-history-april-17-1970-apollo-13-astronauts-return-alive-defy-odds-space-explosion","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The three astronauts on board the Apollo 13 mission safely returned to Earth after an explosion in space threatened their lives on this day in history, April 17, 1970.","summary":"An incredible human drama in space exploration ended with the miraculous safe return of the three Apollo 13 astronauts on this day in history, April 17, 1970.\n\"In Mission Control, pandemonium erupted,\" NASA reports of the joy that overwhelmed the command center after the mission's capsule splashed down in the South Pacific shorty after noon Central Standard Time, just four miles from rescue recovery ship USS Iwo Jima.\nThe fate of the three astronauts of Apollo 13 \u2014 Commander James Lovell, Command Module pilot John \"Jack\" Swigert and Lunar Module pilot Fred W.

Today, they prefer Trump by 3 points.\nA new Fox News survey of Michigan registered voters finds President Biden receives 46% support to former President Trump's 49%. That's within the margin of sampling error. In February, it was 45% Biden \u2014 47% Trump. In April 2020, Biden was at 49% to Trump's 41%.\nTrump's advantage is mainly due to a 19-point lead among men. He is also the favorite among White men without a college degree (by 33 points), rural voters (+23), voters under age 35 (+16), and White voters (+13). Plus, he is helped by a 4-point edge among independents as well as garnering a bit more support among Republicans (94%) than Biden gets among Democrats (92%).\nBiden's best groups include Black voters (+56), urban voters (+27), suburban women (+21), and voters ages 65 and over (+14).\nSince February, Trump is up 5 points among men, and while Biden has made similar gains among Black voters (+7), his 75% support among Blacks is about 20 points below where it was when he won Michigan in 2020.\nVoters living in union households go for Biden by 12 points, while the much larger non-union segment backs Trump by 7.\nTrump retains more of his 2020 voters, with 95% still supporting him compared to 90% of Biden's 2020 voters backing him.\nIn a potential 5-way race, Trump is ahead of Biden by 42%-40%, with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. receiving 9%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 2% each. It was announced Thursday that Kennedy will appear on the ballot in Michigan in November.\nBiden won Michigan by less than three percentage points in 2020. Ninety-six percent of Democrats voted for him, but fewer of them today, 83%, approve of the job he is doing.\nThe president's overall job rating stands at 43% approve and 56% disapprove. Some 11% of those disapproving of Biden's job performance still prefer him over Trump in the matchup.\nMichiganders have mixed views of Biden's approach to the Israel and Hamas war in Gaza, with 24% saying he is too supportive of the Israelis, 21% too supportive of the Palestinians, and 40% about right. Democrats (33%) and independents (22%) are more likely than Republicans (15%) to think Biden is too supportive of the Israelis -- and that shows up in the presidential vote preference. More than one-third of those saying Biden is too close to Israel back Trump (35%), the highest of the four battleground states where Fox News conducted surveys this week (Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin).\nJust over half of Michigan voters are either getting ahead financially or holding steady and those voters choose Biden, while just under half are falling behind and they go big for Trump.\nMore voters trust Trump by wide margins on some of the major issues of the campaign \u2014 immigration (+15 points), the economy (+11 points), and foreign policy (+8), while Biden is more narrowly preferred on election integrity (+6), health care (+6), and abortion (+5). The two are trusted about evenly on energy policy (Trump +2).\nBy a 9-point margin, more think Trump (49%) has the mental fitness to serve effectively as president than Biden (40%). Some 22% of Democrats think Biden lacks the metal soundness to serve. That's more than twice the number of Republicans who say the same about Trump (10%).\nMajorities of voters under age 35 disapprove of Biden (63%), think he lacks the mental fitness to serve (68%), trust Trump to handle the economy (61%), and favor Trump in the head-to-head ballot (+16 points).\nOverall, more voters view Biden negatively than positively by 16 points (41% favorable, 57% unfavorable). Trump's personal rating is also in negative territory but by a narrower 8 points (45-53%). Kennedy is underwater by 3 (39-42%), with one in five unable to rate him (19%).\nForty-six percent of voters say they would back the Republican candidate for Congress in their district, while 43% prefer the Democrat. Almost all of those backing the Democratic candidate go for Biden (92%) and most of those favoring the Republican candidate back Trump (93%).\nConducted April 11-16, 2024 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,126 Michigan registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file.

That 6-point difference is just inside the poll's margin of error.\nBiden's movement can be attributed to modest gains among Black voters (76% now vs. 71% in January) and voters under age 35 (49% vs. 43%), as well as a notable shift among the small subgroup of independents. In January, Trump had the advantage by 20 points (51% to 31% Biden), while the two presumptive candidates are tied today (42% each).\nTrump's coalition has held relatively steady, with some of his best groups being White evangelical Christians (83%), White men without a degree (75%), rural voters (67%), and voters ages 65 and over (58%).\n\"Trump stalled at 49% in 2020 and GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker was at 48-49% in 2022,\" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican Daron Shaw. \"If Georgia voters have soured on Democrats even a little bit, the state is a major pickup opportunity for Trump.\"\nIn a hypothetical five-way race, Trump has a 7-point lead over Biden (46% to 39%), with third-party candidates Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (7%), Cornel West (2%), and Jill Stein (1%) in single digits. This is about where the race stood in January.\n\"Georgia may be the weakest state from Biden's 2020 coalition,\" says Shaw. \"On the plus side, if he can rally African Americans and younger voters, he might be able to recreate his 2020 victory. On the minus side, he might have maxed out that vote in 2020 and it's unclear how compelling his message is to these voters in 2024. I'm in the minority on this point, but it seems North Carolina might be a more promising target this time around.\"\nOn specific issues, Georgia continues to favor Trump, as he is seen as better able to handle \u2014 mostly by double-digits \u2014 five out of seven issues.\nNotably, Trump has the advantage on the two issues that have been dominating the campaign: immigration (Trump preferred by 23 points) and the economy (+22). He is also favored on foreign policy (+15) and energy policy (+8).\nOn other issues, neither candidate has a significant advantage: Trump has the edge on abortion (+2), whereas Biden is narrowly ahead on health care (+2) and election integrity (+3).\nForty-four percent of voters feel they are falling behind financially vs. 41% who are holding steady and 15% who are getting ahead. Voters saying they are falling behind go for Trump by 54 points, while those getting ahead/holding steady go for Biden by 31 points.\nVoters view Trump more favorably than Biden and see the former president as more mentally fit for the job than the incumbent.\nBy a 2-point margin, Georgians view Trump favorably (50% favorable vs. 48% unfavorable), a reversal from July 2022 when he was viewed negatively by 11 points (43% vs. 54%). They also see Trump as having the mental soundness to serve effectively as president (54% has mental soundness vs. 44% does not).\nBiden's favorable rating is underwater by 15 points (42% favorable vs. 57% unfavorable), and more say he lacks the mental soundness to serve by 22 points (38% mentally sound vs. 60% not).\nBiden's job approval rating is also upside down: 42% approve vs. 58% disapprove, which is about where it was in January.\nA few more things\u2026\n\u2014 Views on Kennedy are split, with 39% rating him favorably, 39% unfavorably, and 22% unable to rate him. Democrats are more likely to view him negatively (31% favorable, 46% unfavorable), while Republicans are the opposite (45% favorable, 36% unfavorable). Independents are somewhat split (38% favorable, 33% unfavorable).\n\u2014 By a 6-point margin, Georgia voters think the Biden administration is too supportive of the Palestinians (27%) rather than too supportive of the Israelis (21%) in the war in the Middle East. Still, 4 in 10 think Biden's support of each is about right (39%). Democrats are almost 7 times more likely than Republicans to think there's too much support for the Israelis, while Republicans are 4 times more likely to think there's too much support for the Palestinians.\n\u2014 In a hypothetical U.S. House race, Georgians prefer the Republican candidate by 8 points (50% to 42% for the Democrat).\nConducted April 11-16 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,128 Georgia registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file.

Eric Swalwell, sent out mailers to Pennsylvania voters to slam GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick and say he is not conservative enough, in essence boosting his primary opponent, Mark Houck, Politico first reported this week.\nFox News Digital obtained some of those mailers that framed Fitzpatrick as a \"RINO\" (\"Republican in name only\") and implied he wasn't conservative enough for the base that supports former President Trump.\n\"MAGA is ready to bag the biggest RINO in Congress,\" reads one of the mailers along with a photo of Fitzpatrick photoshopped onto a rhinoceros body. \"We sent Brian Fitzpatrick to D.C. to represent our values, instead, he became best friends with Kamala Harris and the Democrats,\" another mailer said.\nFEC records show True Patriots PA spent roughly $26,000 on the mailer.\nMeagan Olson is listed as treasurer for both True Patriots PA and the Swalwell campaign.\n\"I consider Brian a friend and someone who has bravely defied his party to help secure Ukraine aid,\" Rep.

Suzan DelBene said her group no longer supports the strategy of propping up \"far-right\" candidates in swing districts.\n\"It should come as no surprise that a group connected to Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat who is so dumb that he was tricked into sleeping with a Chinese spy, would be propping up self-described chronic masturbator Mark Houck in the Republican Primary against Brian Fitzpatrick,\" Defending America PAC's Chris Pack told Fox News Digital.\n\"Even Democrats as intellectually challenged as Eric Swalwell know that their best chance at flipping the one seat needed to take back Democrat control of the House of Representatives is if Mark Houck beats Brian Fitzpatrick in the primary next Tuesday.\"\nHouck, a pro-life activist, has made previous acknowledgments that he \"had a pornography problem\" as a young man and spoke openly at a church conference about talking to his son about masturbation and erections.\n\"I struggled with pornography, and of course that leads to sexual sin, masturbation and stuff. That was a chronic habit,\" Houck said in a 2010 interview, which Defending America PAC included in an ad titled \"Beat it.\"\nIn a recent statement, Houck said he \"fell victim to the dehumanizing effects of the pornography industry\" over \"two decades ago.\" He also defended the conversation about his son, saying the clips circulating online \"seizes on de-contextualized comments I made with my son present in public pursuit of this transformative ministry\" meant to steer people away from pornography.\nThe Democrat group boosting Houck is the latest example of a recent trend in which liberal funds have been used to back Republican challengers in an effort to sink candidates who support or are supported by former President Trump.\nPACs linked to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have spent millions meddling in GOP primaries this cycle, including in swing state Senate races in Ohio and Montana.\nDuty and Country PAC, affiliated with Schumer, ran ads during the Ohio GOP Senate primary that accused Trump-backed businessman Bernie Moreno of being \"too conservative for Ohio.\" That effort proved unsuccessful in the primary as Moreno won every county in the Buckeye State, beating his nearest challenger by almost 20 points.\nIn 2022, Democrats spent more than $40 million to boost six pro-Trump candidates in Republican primaries, and all six of those Republicans lost their general election races to Democrats.\nFitzpatrick, who has so far declined to say if he will endorse Trump, voted against impeaching Trump twice and won re-election in 2022 by almost 10 points, despite Biden carrying the 1st Congressional district.\n\"After years of brutal losses, the far-left has finally figured out they have no chance of beating Congressman Fitzpatrick, so they've now tagged California left-wing extremists to meddle in his primary using the same violent political rhetoric they claim to stand against,\" Fitzpatrick campaign spokesperson Ben Trundy told Fox News Digital in statement.\n\"This lame attempt to prop up Mark Houck, an admitted porn addict and serial grifter who believes in complete abortion bans with no exceptions, shows just how desperate they are to force their extreme policies on Bucks and Montgomery County voters.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Andrew Miller","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-2056532467.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.2344966,"_id":"ffe496120a24f35d876a79b29fa022d5"},{"title":"Fox News Poll: Biden and Trump remain deadlocked in Wisconsin","author":"Dana Blanton","published_date":"2024-04-18 22:00:20","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-biden-trump-remain-deadlocked-wisconsin","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Wisconsin voters split their preference between President Biden and former President Trump in a hypothetical 2-way presidential race","summary":"Wisconsin voters split their preference between President Biden and former President Trump in a hypothetical 2-way presidential race \u2014 and between backing the Democratic and the Republican congressional candidates in their House district, according to a new Fox News survey of Wisconsin registered voters.\nIn the head-to-head presidential matchup, Biden and Trump tie with 48% support each.\nBiden gets significant backing from urban voters (+29 points), Whites with a college degree (+26), suburban voters (+10), and union households (+8).\nFor Trump, some of his highest support is from White evangelical Christians (+46 points), White men without a college degree (+29), and rural voters (+15).\nVoters under age 45 back Biden by a single point, while those ages 65 and over go for Biden by 10 points.\nThere's a 17-point gender gap, as men go for Trump by 8 points and women for Biden by 9.\nBiden receives a touch more support among Democrats (95%) than Trump gets among Republicans (93%), but Trump is the choice of the small subgroup of independents (by 8 points).\nWhen potential third-party candidates are included, Biden tops Trump by 2 points (43-41%), with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. getting 9%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 2% each. In January, it was Trump who was up by 3 points over Biden, with Kennedy at 7%.\nKennedy receives a bit more of his backing from those who favor Trump (9%) in the 2-way ballot than from Biden (5%).\nBiden won Wisconsin in 2020 by 20,682 votes, less than one percentage point. Trump's 2016 victory was also by less than a point (22,748 votes).\nMore voters trust Trump to do a better job handling immigration (by 13 points) and the economy (+9). Biden is preferred over Trump on abortion (+9), health care (+7), and election integrity (+7). They are rated more evenly on foreign policy (Trump +2) and energy policy (even).\nOn the Middle East, equal numbers think the Biden administration is too supportive of the Israelis (25%) and the Palestinians (24%). Yet the largest share says Biden's support of each is about right (38%) \u2014 and they favor him over Trump by 38 points.\nOverall, Wisconsinites feel somewhat positive about their personal finances, as 6 in 10 say their situation is either holding steady (45%) or improving (14%). Both of those groups largely favor Biden, while the 4 in 10 who are falling behind financially go for Trump by a wide margin.\nIn the Congressional ballot test, 46% go for the Democratic candidate in their district and 45% for the Republican. Neither Biden nor Trump is a drain on his party, as 94% of those backing the Congressional Democrat favor Biden and 93% of those supporting the Republican go for Trump.\n\"Data from the 2022 election suggests MAGA candidates ran three to four points worse than non-MAGA Republicans,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts Fox News polls with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"But we're not seeing that \u2018Trump tax' so far in the 2024 numbers. Neither are we seeing Biden underperforming other Democrats. It looks like partisans are behaving like partisans.\"\nBy a 5-point margin, more voters think Trump (48%) has the mental soundness to serve effectively as president than Biden (43%). Most Republicans (89%) say Trump has it and most Democrats say Biden does (85%), but independents are 17 points more likely to say Trump is mentally fit.\nThe survey finds 44% approve of Biden's job performance and 55% disapprove \u2014 unchanged since January (44-56%). His 48% support in the 2-way race is higher than his approval because 10% of those disapproving of the job he's doing still pick him over Trump.\nNearly two-thirds think Biden was legitimately elected in 2020, and they back him over Trump by 53 points and are twice as likely to approve of the job he's doing (67% approve, 32% disapprove). Among the one-third who say Biden was not legitimately elected, 98% favor Trump in the 2-way race and 98% disapprove of Biden's job performance.\nWisconsin voters are unified when it comes to having a negative opinion of both Biden and Trump.

An attack without precedent or parallel. But Biden doesn't want Israel to respond with a counterattack.","summary":"\"I don't like you because you're gonna get me killed.\"Zeus' (Samuel Jackson) summation to John McClane (Bruce Willis) in 1995's \"Die Hard With A Vengeance\" is the essence of the \"Trump Doctrine\" critique of the \"Biden Doctrine.\"The former holds \"Strike at America and America will hit you twice as hard; strike at our allies and we will support them in as many ways as we can.\"The Biden Doctrine, developed in the crushing pressure of all-nighter Model U.N. \"negotiations\" in high school or college and now even more tempered by the political realities of radical anti-Israel voters in Michigan (and fears of a Chicago convention that makes its 1968 counterpart seem like child's play) is: \"Never don't sound retreat. Never escalate. The world will evolve towards stable and predictable stasis if China and Iran are treated with deference and if Russia is given some breathing space in Ukraine (and maybe those Baltic states?)\"\nAfter a Saturday night of drama and worry \u2014a direct and ferocious attack on Israel from Iran without precedent or parallel\u2014 the first report I read on rising early Sunday came from the Times of Israel: \"According to media reports, citing senior administration officials, US President Joe Biden has told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the US would not aid any Israeli counterattack on Iran.\"\nOf course. Because at those Model U.N. marathons and within the Yale debate clubs that formed the world views of those propping up an infirm president, nobody ever hauls off and punches the \"Special Rapporteur\" on this or that, the Taliban can be trusted, Chinese Communists aren't really Leninists bent on empire, and we all agree to pay no attention to the mullah behind the curtain controlling Hamas, the Houthis, and Hezbollah. The Biden Doctrine, with its musical score straight from Annie's \"The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow,\" has got nothing to do with the reality of the world but the comfy chairs at the Council on Foreign Relations and the Aspen Institute.The Trump Doctrine? Qassem Soleimani dead, 2,500 American troops still at Bagram Air Base supported by 2,500 NATO troops in and around Kabul and some future for some women in Afghanistan.\nThose are the sure things. But the counter-factuals are all too obvious and the former president is campaigning on them and rightly so: Putin would not have invaded Ukraine a second time. America would continually be reminding the world that CCP negligence (at best) most likely unleashed COVID and all the disasters it has wrought on the world. The United States Navy would be at 300 ships and rising. AUKUS would be building submarines Down Under.\nAnd, crucially, the 1,200 Israelis slaughtered and 5,000 wounded on 10/7 would be alive as would the 260-plus IDF killed in Gaza, nor would three American soldiers based in Jordan be dead or the Red Sea a war zone with American warships under constant attack. The north of Israel would not be emptied of civilians and the north of Gaza would not be leveled. Because the Trump Doctrine, like the Bush Doctrine and the Reagan Doctrine and the Nixon Doctrine and the Eisenhower Doctrine before it, rely on deterrence backed up by America's overwhelming force and the willingness to use it. Enemies get to know America and whether its leadership is weak or strong.\nThe Taliban had an agreement with the United States that they began to violate as soon as Trump left for Mar-a-Lago. Putin saw that collapse and acted. The mullahs and their puppets understand all too well that Team Obama is back and after their coffers were refilled by Team Biden, the leashes were off their rabid religious fanatics in Gaza, Lebanon and Yemen. Now Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader, is so confident that Biden, Blinken et al won't stand behind Israel \u2014at least not for long\u2014 that he dared attack a Jewish State where 90% of the citizens support the war in Gaza.\nWhat should Americans feel? Scorn for the Model U.N. mindset dominating the National Security Council now and the Yale Debate chops of National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and his \"once-in-a-generation intellect. Scorn for Secretary of State Blinken daring to warn Israel that it risked becoming \"indistinguishable\" from Hamas. Scorn for former Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, the epitome of the Biden Doctrine, stating the day before Iran launched its fusillade that \"Israel is better than the way this war is being waged.\"\nSherman is best known for the 1994 \"agreement\" with North Korea when she labored for President Clinton and, with former Secretary of State John Kerry, the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran, the crowning fiasco of President Obama's eight years of face plants around the world. Special scorn for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's backflip to his old \"Israel can count on me\" pose. For how long?This circle of appeasers has brought nothing but the lethal combination of softly spoken words and an ever-present, always-controlling fear of escalation. \"Appeasement\" was a theory of the world we thought crushed by the events leading to World War II. But it lives on in the urgent entreaties of the United States Sunday morning, backed up by leaks to a compliant press, to Israel to do nothing \u2014nothing at all\u2014 after salvos of missiles and drones were launched at its people and of course to not close on the 5,000-10,000 armed terrorists and Hamas leadership hiding in Rafah, protected by the Blinkens, Sullivans and Shermans of the United States propping up an infirm president who can muster only the absurd admonition \"Don't\" and can't deliver a speech from the Oval Office. Scorn is the right response -- and resolve to throw them all out in November.\nTrump, along with his former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor Ambassador Robert O'Brien, would not and indeed could not be advising Israel to stand down because this world in chaos would not be in chaos had Trump won his second term. The \"mean Tweets\" would have continued to appall the youngsters at the Model U.N. near you. But American soldiers and sailors would either not be at risk or would be dispatching those who threaten them. Israel would not have cause to worry about America turning against it.\nWhen they return, count on the White House and the Department of Justice to be the center of a coordinated effort to condemn and cabin anti-Semitism across the U.S. even as we return to unquestioned support for Israel.Many voters are going to make their choice cause of inflation's toll on their lives, or because of their views on abortion or some other issue. But the serious voters are going to put \"not getting killed\" at the top of their list and pull the lever for Trump and a return to realism come November.\nHugh Hewitt is host of \"The Hugh Hewitt Show,\" heard weekday mornings 6am to 9am ET on the Salem Radio Network, and simulcast on Salem News Channel.

The documentary also highlights rare footage of Markle at age 10 attending her first anti-war protest.\nIn 2020, Markle teamed up with Gloria Steinem to speak out on the importance of voting. In 2022, they had a candid conversation about reproductive rights for Vogue.\nIn 2021, Politico reported that Markle had personally reached out to members of Congress to advocate for paid family leave. The news came weeks after she wrote an open letter published by Paid Leave for All.\nAndersen warned that the pair would need to tread carefully.\n\"Meghan won't be getting directly involved in running for office or, I believe, even campaigning for any specific candidate, because that could complicate things tremendously for Harry - especially at a time when his father, the king, and Princess Kate are battling cancer, and the monarchy is in crisis,\" Andersen explained.\n\"Still, Meghan, in particular, would like nothing better than to free herself from royal shackles and campaign for the Harris-Biden ticket,\" he shared. \"The Sussexes' campaign against AI deepfakes is one way for Harry and Meghan to have a real impact without taking sides. The same is true of their ongoing get-out-the-vote efforts.\"\n\"Harry [can] stay quiet, but Meghan can still voice her opinions on critical issues like abortion rights, voting rights, and the environment,\" Andersen noted. \"She might even speak up about Ukraine and Gaza, but that will be far trickier for her.\"\nMarkle became the Duchess of Sussex when she married Harry in 2018.\nHarry, 39, has had a troubled relationship with the royal family since he quit royal duties in 2020 and moved to California with his wife. According to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media prompted the move.\nThese days, Markle has been keeping busy building a lifestyle empire as the royal family deals with health issues.\nMarkle teased her new lifestyle brand, American Riviera Orchard, on March 14 as she launched a new Instagram account. The duchess filed two additional trademark applications, on March 9 and March 19, that expanded the lifestyle brand into cosmetics and gardening.\nThen on Thursday, Deadline reported that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have two nonfiction projects in the works for Netflix.\nA spokesperson for the couple didn't immediately respond to Fox News Digital regarding either project.\nDoug Eldridge, an agent, celeb branding and marketing expert, as well as founder of Achilles PR, told Fox News Digital that four years later, following her royal exit, Markle is \"trying to find herself.\"\n\"This has been an awkward, largely unsuccessful, attempt at a rebrand,\" said Eldridge. \"She is not booking acting gigs, her podcast was scrapped soon after it launched, and she abdicated her royal responsibilities in a highly publicized exit from the royal family. Perhaps she sees politics as a viable reinvention for 2024 and beyond\u200b.\"\n\"Most Americans don't associate Markle with politics, but that, in and of itself, isn't a disqualifying factor for a future in politics,\" he shared. \"Ronald Reagan was a radio, television and movie star before becoming the governor of California, and later a two-term Republican president. Donald Trump was a real estate mogul and reality TV star before throwing his hat in the ring and coming away with the presidency in 2016.\"\n\"Granted, the pathway from the silver screen to the Oval Office is improbable, but it's not impossible,\" Eldridge added.\nBritish royal expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital that if the couple were to dabble in politics, it would only continue to raise questions about whether their royal titles should be removed.\n\"One would think Meghan Markle would have learned a lesson from the derisive comments made by U.S. Senators in response to her attempts back in 2021 to lobby them via cold-calling,\" said Fordwich. \"... At that time, she raised the ire of the Brits, many of whom were calling for the removal of their titles, since they were using them for political means and commercial gain.\"\n\"She wasn't calling Senators just an American citizen but leveraging her Duchess of Sussex title to meddle in U.S. politics,\" Fordwich alleged. \"She demonstrated either abject ignorance of the political impartiality royals have adhered to for centuries or a deliberate attempt to make an impact with the very title she had belittled. It was one of the many instances of hypocrisy which contributed to her plummeting popularity.\"\n\"Therefore, any attempt at another foray into politics would no doubt raise similar issues of wanting one's cake and to eat it too,\" Fordwich added.\nWhether the couple chooses to move forward in American politics remains to be seen. Nick Bullen, co-founder of True Royalty TV, previously told Fox News Digital that anything is possible. Even a humanitarian ambassador's role for Markle looks promising.\n\"It's a very plausible argument,\" Bullen said. \"I think it would be fascinating. Imagine a world in which she does make it to the White House. [Prince] Harry is the first husband. There's a state visit, and what happens then if Meghan is hosting [the British royal family] at the White House? You're going to want a front-row seat for that, aren't you?\"\nTraditionally, members of the British royal family are expected to be apolitical in public, which means they cannot vote or openly express political views. In addition, such a major move would require Harry to give up his royal title.\nBullen said he didn't believe a Hollywood comeback is in her future \u2013 unless the price is right.\n\"I don't think there's a world in which you'll see Meghan going back into acting unless it's a major, major movie,\" he said. \"I think Meghan's ambitions for reaching the top now are focused on a different direction. I honestly think she's much more likely to be playing on a political stage than she is on an acting stage. Unless, of course, maybe Steven Spielberg or Ron Howard offers her a role in some major, major movie, and she's the big star.\"\n\"But I think that will go against where her focus is,\" Bullen continued. \"Everything I'm being told about her is her philanthropy and her political careers \u2026 [her] political focus is where she wants to be.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Stephanie Nolasco,Ashley Papa,Stephanie Nolasco Ashley Papa","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Getty_MeghanMarkle_PrinceHarry.jpg","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.3587713,"_id":"ae1b37f6df64191650c59237adb83c64"},{"title":"NBC News chief being paid by Walmart, Pepsi 'clearly a problem' as network's ties to both companies go deep","author":"Joseph Wulfsohn","published_date":"2024-04-19 09:00:54","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/nbc-news-chief-being-paid-walmart-pepsi-clearly-problem-networks-ties-companies-go-deep","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"NBC News chief Cesar Conde's financial ties to Walmart and Pepsi are fueling questions among critics, including one insider who says it doesn't \"smell right.\"","summary":"The dust is still settling at NBC News following the debacle last month over its hiring and firing of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, but scrutiny of the Comcast-owned network's leadership remains, particularly top boss Cesar Conde.\nConde, who apologized to NBC staff over the hiring of McDaniel as an analyst after network talent erupted in anger, has been the subject of multiple reports questioning whether he is best suited to remain the chair of NBCUniversal News Group, a job he has held since 2020 that oversees NBC News, CNBC and MSNBC.\nHowever, that isn't his only role. Conde also sits on the board of directors for Walmart and PepsiCo.\n\"I think it's untoward, and I think it needs to be addressed,\" an NBC insider told Fox News Digital. \"Clearly Cesar's bosses knew this because everybody knows it. And it didn't occur to anybody to do anything about it. And that's Cesar for you. He's an innocuous guy who, generally speaking, flies under that sort of radar \u2026 He's a young, up-and-coming, hotshot guy. Most of us have realized NBC is a stepping stone for him, right? He's not going to be CEO of Comcast, he wants to be the CEO of another one of these types of companies, a show or a politician or whatever the case is. So I guess the point is, what's the accountability here?\"\nThe NBC insider said Conde could make the case that his financial ties to Walmart and Pepsi are \"good conduct\" for NBC's bottom line, but the ethical issues for the network still remain.\n\"At some point does somebody sit down and say, 'Dude, what's up?'\" the insider said. \"What should Cesar be doing? Should he be resigning from these boards? I mean, the kind of money he gets from this thing is quite something.\"\nThe insider continued, \"Something doesn't smell right with this. The optics of it are wrong, and it does look like a guy whose focus is not on the journalistic integrity of one of the oldest and largest journalistic brands in the country, it's on something else. And knowing what I know about Cesar, he's a businessman. And by the way, his bosses are business people, right? That's part of the thing to understand. The guy who replaced [former NBCUniversal CEO] Jeff Shell is a business guy. The Roberts people [of Comcast] are cable providers \u2026 We're not owned by journalists. We're not controlled by journalists. We are a different enterprise.\"\nConde's financial ties to Walmart and PepsiCo have been public knowledge for years. According to a recent report from the Associated Press, which cites Salary.com, Conde \"earned $275,018 from Walmart in 2022 and $320,000 from PepsiCo, in a combination of cash and stock.\"\nAn NBCUniversal spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal in 2021 that Conde would recuse himself from weighing in on stories involving the two companies.\n\"That Conde sits on the boards of these corporations is clearly a problem from a journalism ethics standpoint. And it would be true for any news executive who serves for corporations that are subjects in the news agenda,\" DePauw University journalism professor Jeffrey McCall says. \"The optics look terrible for a major news executive who is being compensated for corporate board participation. News outlets just have to be totally insulated from the business side of the media world, and this is a blending of journalism and business corporatism that shouldn't be allowed to continue.\"\n\"Even if Conde plays no role in direct news coverage of these two companies, it still looks bad on its face,\" McCall told Fox News Digital, insisting NBC staffers reporting on Walmart and PepsiCo must keep their boss's additional roles in mind.\nNBCUniversal first hired Conde in 2013 and as he climbed the ranks at Rockefeller, he joined PepsiCo's board of directors in 2016 and Walmart's board of directors in 2019. The following year, he was tapped to lead NBC's entire news operation.\nUnder his tenure as NBC's news chief, NBC has aired several bubbly reports about Walmart and Pepsi, according to a review by Fox News Digital.\nIn July 2020, NBC News reported Walmart's decision to close on Thanksgiving Day and to give bonuses to employees. In September 2020, NBC News aired a lengthy report about Walmart's partnership with TikTok and how the retail giant would be featured on the app. In August 2022, NBC boasted about how Walmart was expanding its abortion coverage for employees. In July 2023, \"NBC Nightly News\" aired a report on how Walmart was benefiting from AI.\nIn November 2023, flagship morning show \"Today\" offered free airtime to a Walmart Black Friday ad that reunited the cast of \"Mean Girls,\" showing viewers the commercial almost in its entirety. That month \"Today\" also aired an \"exclusive\" behind-the-scenes look at a Walmart warehouse.\nNBC landed multiple \"exclusive\" interviews with Walmart CEO John Furner, one in February 2021 promoting Walmart's COVID vaccination efforts for customers and employees, and another in November 2021 with him arguing Walmart is the more affordable option during rising inflation.\nNBC even went to great lengths in giving Walmart favorable treatment compared to its direct competitors. In September 2020, it reported how Walmart was \"stepping up its Ecommerce game\" with its delivery service subscription rivaling Amazon. In November 2022, \"Today\" gave Walmart's pre-Black Friday deals top billing ahead of Target, Amazon and Best Buy. Last month, NBC suggested Walmart had the superior subscription service over Target and Amazon since it had \"a few bells and whistles.\"\nAnd just last week, \"Today\" aired a positive segment about Walmart \"upskilling\" its employees in the AI era, though also mentioning Amazon making similar efforts.\nNewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck swiped \"hobnobbing-obsessing\" Conde, telling Fox News Digital it's \"no surprise\" that NBC offered such glowing coverage.\n\"This entire exercise is a reminder of what corporate news looks like in action with big corporations serving as public relations officials for other big corporations,\" Houck says. \"It goes well beyond the old adage of \u2018I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine.'\"\nPepsiCo similarly benefited from NBC's on-air coverage. In March 2021, \"Today\" plugged the soda giant's limited edition Peeps-flavored Pepsi. In December 2021, NBC promoted Pepsi's Super Bowl Halftime Show app. In December 2022, \"Today\" put a spotlight on the viral \"Pilk\" trend inspired by a Pepsi ad featuring Lindsay Lohan drinking a glass of milk combined with Pepsi. In February 2023, \"Today\" offered a \"sneak peek\" into Pepsi's Super Bowl ad starring Steve Martin. Weeks later, \"Today\" plugged another Pepsi ad, this one featuring Ben Stiller reprising his \"Zoolander\" character.\n\"Today\" offered heavy promotion of Pepsi just last month alone, showing a viral video of a 15-month-old boy who \"really, really wanted to try a Pepsi\" and hyping fast food chain Subway's \"head-turning\" decision to switch to Pepsi from Coca-Cola starting next year.\nPepsi's ties to NBCUniversal appear to go far beyond friendly reports on \"Today.\" In 2021, Pepsi was a sponsor of NBCUniversal's Upfront, an annual industry event networks hold to promote their programming to advertisers.\nIn 2019, while Conde served as the chairman of NBCUniversal International Group and NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises, PepsiCo provided \"Pepsi Sparkling Ros\u00e9\" for the company's \"BravoCon.\" In 2015, one year before Conde joined its board, Pepsi partnered with Conde-led NBCUniversal International for a \"Back to the Future\" campaign to promote its brand. There's no evidence to show the two events were related, however.\nAlso notable is NBCUniversal's announced direct partnership with Walmart in November allowing Bravo viewers to shop online while watching the streaming service Peacock for merchandise seen in its programming.\n\"This is a huge issue for NBC News and a clear conflict of interest on Cesar Conde's part,\" media columnist and Fox News contributor Joe Concha said.\nFormer NBC News executive vice president Bill Wheatley similarly told the AP, \"It seemed to me that this was an additional instance of NBC management not understanding the rules by which news leaders are supposed to play.\"\nNeither NBC nor its parent company Comcast responded to requests for comment.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Joseph Wulfsohn","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/CondeNBCWalmartPepsi.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.233044,"_id":"d3bac54b12f0aaf0d0be63e21888d4b1"}],"user_input":{"q":"abortion","search_in":["title_summary_en"],"lang":["en"],"not_lang":null,"countries":null,"not_countries":null,"from":"2024-04-15 00:00:00","to":null,"ranked_only":"True","from_rank":null,"to_rank":null,"sort_by":"relevancy","page":1,"size":100,"sources":["foxnews.com"],"not_sources":[],"topic":null,"published_date_precision":null}}
