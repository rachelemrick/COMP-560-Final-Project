            "summary": "A government-appointed commission in Germany recommended on Monday that lawmakers legalize abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy, a move that could push the country into a long-avoided debate on an issue that for decades remained in a legal gray zone.\nOutside of exceptions for medical reasons or because of rape, abortions in Germany are technically illegal. But, in practice, they are broadly permitted in the first 12 weeks if a woman has received mandatory counseling and then waits at least three days to terminate the pregnancy.\nAbortion rights activists say Germany has grown increasingly out of sync with the rest of Europe, where several countries have recently moved to loosen restrictions on abortion or to bolster laws protecting access to the procedure ‚Äî especially after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\nLast month, legislators in France voted to explicitly enshrine access to abortion in the Constitution, making their country the first in the world to do so.\nIn Poland, where a previous conservative government enacted a near-total ban on abortion, politicians are moving forward with draft legislation to loosen some of Europe's most restrictive abortion laws.\nLast year, Germany's chancellor, Olaf Scholz followed through on one of the agenda items set out by his governing coalition by setting up a commission of ethicists, doctors, psychiatrists and other experts to issue recommendations on abortion, egg donations and surrogacy.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

'This is the video I was looking for,' she said.\nThe reaction to her video, which has been viewed more than 400,000 times and has drawn comments of both commiseration and condemnation, shows how deeply personal and divisive the issue remains in the run up to the November elections.\nImage 'This is the video I was looking for,' Sunni said in her widely shared TikTok.

            "excerpt": "Liberal activists are proposing a ballot measure that would enshrine the right to an abortion in the state Constitution. Republicans in the State Legislature are considering plans to undermine it.",
            "summary": "Facing mounting pressure to strike down a near-total abortion ban revived last week by Arizona's Supreme Court, Republican state legislators are considering efforts to undermine a planned ballot measure this fall that would enshrine abortion rights in the Arizona Constitution, according to a presentation obtained by The New York Times.\nThe 1864 law that is set to take effect in the coming weeks bans nearly all abortions and mandates prison sentences of two to five years for providing abortion care. The proposed ballot measure on abortion rights, known as the Arizona Abortion Access Act, would enshrine the right to an abortion before viability, or about 24 weeks. Supporters of the measure say they have already gathered enough signatures to put the question on the ballot ahead of a July 3 filing deadline.\nRepublicans in the Legislature are under tremendous pressure to overturn, or at least amend, the 1864 ban. Former President Donald J. Trump, the national standard-bearer of the Republican Party, directly intervened on Friday, calling on Republican legislators, in a frantically worded post online, to 'act immediately' to change the law. A top Trump ally in Arizona who is running for the Senate, Kari Lake, has also called for the overturning of the 1864 law, which she had once praised.\nAbortion rights have been a winning message for Democrats since the Supreme Court, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump, overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. And even though it is an objectively unpopular aspect of his White House legacy, Mr. Trump has repeatedly bragged that he is personally responsible for overturning Roe.\nRepublicans in Arizona, however, have already resisted efforts to repeal the 160-year-old law and are bracing for the potential for another floor battle on the ban that is looming for the Legislature, which is set to convene on Wednesday. The plans that circulated among Republican legislators suggest the caucus is considering other measures that would turn attention away from the 1864 law.\nThe presentation to Republican state legislators, written by Linley Wilson, the general counsel for the Republican majority in the Arizona State Legislature, proposed several ways in which the Republican-controlled Legislature could undermine the ballot measure, known as A.A.A., by placing competing constitutional amendments on the ballot that would limit the right to abortion even if the proposed ballot measure succeeded.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Speaker Ben Toma walked off the floor of the Arizona House of Representatives, resolute ‚Äî if stressed ‚Äî after he cast the pivotal vote to again block an effort to repeal the state's 1864 abortion ban.\nHe knew he was going against the wishes of top Republicans like former President Donald J. Trump, who had called on the Legislature to change the ban. He worried about political blowback to Republicans in the coming elections.\nBut Mr. Toma saw himself as upholding moral principles far more foundational than current politics, the past president or even the ban itself. Attempts to undercut it as 'a Civil-War-era law' were 'sort of ridiculous,' he said in an interview on Wednesday after the vote. He pointed to the Constitution and Bill of Rights ‚Äî and the Bible.\n'Even all of our laws are actually based on, what, the Ten Commandments, and the Book of Genesis, which are thousands of years ago,' he said. 'The whole idea that we are equal in the sight of God, our maker, that we have unalienable rights, all that, that is all fundamentally a Christian worldview.'\nThis commitment to Arizona's 1864 ban ‚Äî a near-total ban that the State Supreme Court recently reinstated ‚Äî underscores the power of conservative Christian abortion opponents in shaping American abortion laws, even as they represent a minority view. Despite a popular backlash against the Supreme Court's decision overturning a constitutional right to abortion in 2022, anti-abortion forces have maintained a stronghold in many state legislatures, not only in deeply conservative states like Alabama, but also closely divided ones like Arizona.\nMembers of Students for Life of America went door to door try to persuade voters not to support a proposed ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights in the Arizona Constitution.

            "summary": "Arizona lawmakers are preparing for a renewed attempt on Wednesday to repeal the state's 1864 abortion ban, which was upheld by the State Supreme Court last week in a ruling that exacerbated all the personal emotions and political firestorms surrounding abortion in a battleground state.\nThe court last Tuesday upheld the Civil War-era law, which bans nearly all abortions. The ruling infuriated supporters of abortion rights and presented a grave political threat to Republicans, who narrowly control both houses of the State Legislature.\nDemocrats' immediate attempts to repeal the ban failed last week. A Republican member of the House had sided with Democrats and put forward a measure to repeal it, but G.O.P. leadership adjourned, delaying any action for a week since the Legislature currently meets only on Wednesdays.\nAs a second attempt at repeal looms, both parties are scrambling to count votes and game out legislative strategies to determine whether Democrats have found enough Republican support to strike down the law.\nFormer President Donald J. Trump last week called on legislators to 'act immediately to remedy what has happened,' as Democrats slammed the ban as another sign of Republican extremism in a pivotal state in this fall's election. The ban allows only an exception to save the life of the mother. Doctors prosecuted under the law could face fines and prison terms of two to five years.\nDemocrats likely need only two or three Republicans to vote with them to repeal the law. Activists and lobbyists have jockeyed behind the scenes to sway ‚Äî or hold ‚Äî the handful of Republican lawmakers whose actions could determine the law's fate. A variety of procedural elements could also disrupt a repeal's chance of advancing. If the House is able to pass a repeal, it is expected to head to the Senate later on Wednesday.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, told CBS that President Biden needed to ensure 'that young people feel included in the conversation, not just as a vote but as part of the governing coalition.' He added, 'I think part of the frustration by young people is that they oftentimes don't feel heard. They feel like their voices and their votes are taken advantage of come election time.'

When the interviewer, Dana Bash, pressed her on whether Mr. Pence had been wrong to certify the election results, Ms. Noem again avoided a direct answer, instead criticizing Mr. Pence for denouncing Mr. Trump after Jan. 6. 'I wasn't in Mike Pence's shoes, and the information that he had at that time ‚Äî I don't know how he based his decisions,' she said. 'I think he's a nice man. I think that he's failed Donald Trump since that day, because he certainly does not recognize that we need someone in the White House who needs him out on the trail advocating for him, instead of constantly criticizing and going back and ripping him apart.' On abortion, Ms. Noem, who supported a federal ban when she was a member of Congress, said she now believed restrictions should be left to individual states. That is the position Mr. Trump took this month, though his allies have developed plans that could functionally ban abortion nationwide without formally doing so. Mr. Trump has also expressed support for rape and incest exceptions, which South Dakota's near-total abortion ban does not include. When asked about that, Ms. Noem tried to distance herself from her own state's law, noting that it was a 'trigger ban' enacted years ago to take effect if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. 'The law in my state was passed decades before I ever became governor,' she said, adding: 'That may be a topic that will continue to be discussed in South Dakota. Our law today allows an exception to save the life of the mother, but the people in South Dakota will decide what their laws look like.' She did not give a clear answer when Ms. Bash asked what she believed South Dakota's laws should look like. 'I can have an opinion, and I can weigh forward and I can look at the science and what we've learned about babies in the womb and believe that we should protect life, but I think that our law today is what South Dakota wants,' she said. 'And they'll continue to have that debate, and I'll continue to follow through on my role, which is to make sure the will of the people is enforced.' Ms. Bash repeated her question, and Ms. Noem implied ‚Äî but did not say outright ‚Äî that she might oppose a rape and incest exception. 'We have a law that says that there is an exception for the life of the mother, and I just don't believe a tragedy should perpetuate another tragedy,' she said. Versions of that statement are common among people who believe abortion should be illegal even in cases of rape and incest. 'I believe in taking care of mothers that are in a crisis situation and that we should be locking alongside them, giving them all the information and the best information they can make before they have to be put in a situation where an abortion is the only option that they have,' she added. Ms. Noem also echoed Mr. Trump's claims that the criminal charges against him in New York ‚Äî where his trial began last week ‚Äî were political, and affirmed that she would support him even if he were convicted of felonies. 'When he was in the White House, every single day as governor, I got to be on offense, I got to solve problems,' she said. 'And since Joe Biden has been in the White House, I just have to defend the freedoms of my people in South Dakota. I'm every day trying to push back on what this federal government is trying to do by increasing costs for the everyday families that get up every day and go to work. So yes, Donald Trump should be back in that White House. I'm going to do all I can to help him win.' Credit... Chris Seward/Associated Press Former President Donald J. Trump's presidential campaign committee ended March with $45 million on hand, federal filings showed Saturday, as he tries to close the fund-raising gap with President Biden. But Mr. Trump's campaign is spending much less than it was at the start of the year, which has helped it inch closer. In March, it spent just $3.7 million, the new filings show, compared with $11.4 million in January ‚Äî and much less than the $29.2 million spent by Mr. Biden's campaign in March. In other words, Mr. Trump's campaign is guarding resources as it seeks to build a campaign war chest for the general election. This cycle began with the announcement of former President Donald J. Trump's campaign in November 2022 and President Biden's in April 2023. Raised $43.8 $158.5 $15.3 $114.7 Spent $29.2 $74.3 $4 $70.1 Net cash $85.5 ‚Äî $44.6 ‚Äî Mr. Biden's campaign had $85.5 million on hand at the end of March, according to its monthly filing with the Federal Election Commission, a significant increase from the month before: He ended February with $71 million in his campaign account while Mr. Trump ended February with less than half that. As Mr. Trump and Republicans chase the Democrats' financial edge, Mr. Biden has also started to narrow the polling gap between himself and Mr. Trump. Since late February, the president has cut a deficit of five percentage points to a single point, a virtual tie, according to a recent survey by The New York Times and Siena College. The rivals each capitalized on splashy fund-raisers in the past month that brought in tens of millions of dollars for their respective campaigns. But Mr. Trump's haul from an April 6 event in Palm Beach, Fla., will be reflected on a future filing. His campaign reported that it and the Republican National Committee raked in more than $50.5 million from the dinner, which was held at the home of the billionaire John Paulson. The total nearly doubled the $26 million that Mr. Biden's campaign said it raised on March 28 at Radio City Music Hall in New York, a star-studded event headlined by the president and two former presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Those funds were included in Mr. Biden's March fund-raising numbers. Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump are primarily raising money though joint fund-raising agreements with their respective parties, arrangements that legally allow them to pull in hundreds of thousands of dollars from individual donors, some of which flows into their campaigns. Joint fund-raising committees for both candidates filed reports with the Federal Election Commission this week, providing the first details of 2024 of major donors to both candidates, and the total scale of their fund-raising haul. But the F.E.C. reports for presidential campaigns, which are filed monthly in election years, offer different insights about candidates' activities and how the committees backing them are spending money. By the end of the 2020 cycle Biden had raised and spent more than $1 billion and Trump more than $700 million dollars. For example, federal law guarantees political campaigns bottom-dollar rates for broadcast advertising, so campaign committees are often used to pay for television time. In the first three months of 2024, Mr. Biden's campaign has spent $45.2 million on media buys and production, filings show ‚Äî more than half of its total of $74.1 million in spending. The Biden campaign has spent $6.9 million on payroll and related expenses, and an additional $6.9 million on 'text message outreach.' His campaign's spending shot up in March, after two relatively steady months. In contrast, Mr. Trump's campaign spending has slowed sharply since the beginning of the year, when he was still fending off Republican primary challengers. Since Jan. 1, Mr. Trump's campaign has spent $23 million ‚Äî but just $3.7 million of that was in March. His campaign has paid $6 million for placed media this year, all of it before Super Tuesday. One of Mr. Trump's committees ‚Äî a leadership PAC called Save America, which he has used to pay his legal bills ‚Äî reported on Saturday that it had almost $4.1 million on hand at the end of March, roughly the same amount as it had at the end of February. The group spent $5 million in March, including $3.7 million in bills to the legal teams defending him. Mr. Trump's campaign itself also paid about $473,000 in legal expenses. A super PAC backing Mr. Trump, MAGA Inc., reported raising $14.4 million in March, including a $5 million contribution from the former Trump cabinet official Linda McMahon and $4.2 million from Robert T. Bigelow, an aerospace and real estate mogul. The group also transferred $5 million to Save America ‚Äî part of a huge refund of money from the super PAC to the committee over the past year. With national polls consistently suggesting that the rematch between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden could hinge on a few states or a single one, that has magnified the candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running as an independent. It has also drawn attention to how the liberal scion is paying for his campaign and what he is spending money on, including for ballot access and security. His selection of Nicole Shanahan, a wealthy Silicon Valley lawyer and investor, as his running mate already appears to have become a boon for his campaign. Of the $5.4 million that Mr. Kennedy raised in March, $2 million came from Ms. Shanahan, who until last year was married to the Google co-founder Sergey Brin. A correction was made on : An earlier version of this story misstated the total amount MAGA Inc. raised in March. It was $14.4 million, not $9.4 million. The lower figure inaccurately took into account a $5 million transfer from the group to another Trump committee. How we handle corrections Credit... Travis Dove for The New York Times After former President Donald J. Trump sat in a courtroom in New York for much of the last week, Saturday night was supposed to herald a return to the campaign trail and the large rallies where he often gives long, freewheeling speeches. With thousands gathered on the tarmac at an airport in Wilmington, N.C., Mr. Trump's campaign was building anticipation. Two hours before he was set to speak, the campaign sent a fund-raising blast with a message from Mr. Trump: 'They can't keep me off stage! Did they think I would run and hide?' Ninety minutes later, the skies darkened to charcoal and lightning flashed. As thunderstorms swept toward the area and the National Weather Service issued watches and warnings concerning dangerous winds and hail, the rally was canceled over safety concerns. 'We'll make up for this very quickly at another time,' Mr. Trump said on a call he made into the rally that was broadcast over the speakers. 'We'll do it as quick as possible. I'm devastated that this could happen.' But the cancellation, which Mr. Trump indicated was out of his hands, highlights the challenges that he may face as he tries to balance his presidential campaign with a criminal trial that will keep him busy through May. For much of the last week, Mr. Trump's public comments had been limited to social media posts and remarks to reporters outside the courtroom. His only campaign stop was at a bodega in New York City, in a state he overwhelmingly lost in the last two elections and that is not expected to be in play in November. Saturday's rally was expected to serve as a preview of the upcoming weeks, with Mr. Trump traveling on weekends to campaign in battleground states that are more central to his efforts to return to the White House. He has repeatedly claimed that the trial is preventing him from campaigning in places like North Carolina, which he won in 2016 and 2020, but where Democrats are making a big push in November. Opening arguments are slated to start on Monday, and the trial is set to last six to eight weeks. As is often the case with Mr. Trump's rallies, the crowds began lining up hours ahead of his expected remarks. Among those gathered outside was a group wearing shirts with the logo of the Proud Boys, a prominent far-right extremist group. One person held a sign that read 'Free All of the J6 Prisoners,' a reference to those serving sentences in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. Mr. Trump, who faces four criminal indictments that include charges tied to his efforts to overturn his election loss, has recently embraced dozens of Jan. 6 defendants. He has called them 'hostages' and has said he would consider pardoning them. In a statement, Ammar Moussa, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, criticized the group's presence, pointing to remarks Mr. Trump made in a debate in 2020, in which he told the Proud Boys to 'stand back and stand by.' 'This is Donald Trump's America: where white nationalists and violent far-right extremists are empowered and working families are left behind,' Mr. Moussa wrote. Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, responded in a statement, 'We don't comment on stupid.' Mr. Trump's remarks were expected to face particular scrutiny given that he is under a gag order in his criminal trial that bans him from attacking witnesses, prosecutors, jurors and court staff, as well as their relatives and relatives of the judge. Prosecutors have said Mr. Trump has violated the gag order seven times, and there is a hearing about the issue on Tuesday. Mr. Trump did travel to North Carolina earlier in the day, attending a fund-raiser in Charlotte in the afternoon. When he called into the rally, he told the attendees that he was minutes away from 'flying in' to Wilmington but that the authorities 'would prefer that we not come in' over safety concerns. 'I'm so sorry,' Mr. Trump said. 'But we'll do it again, and we'll do it bigger and better. You have my promise.' As the crowd left to seek shelter in their cars, vendors outside were still selling an array of merchandise, some of which had been created specifically for the occasion. One T-shirt promoted what it called the Wilmington stop on Mr. Trump's 'Save America' tour. 'I was there!' The shirt read. 'Where were you???'

Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, told CBS that President Biden needed to ensure 'that young people feel included in the conversation, not just as a vote but as part of the governing coalition.' He added, 'I think part of the frustration by young people is that they oftentimes don't feel heard. They feel like their voices and their votes are taken advantage of come election time.' He said he thought Biden had taken steps toward including them.\nApril 21, 2024, 12:15 p.m. ET April 21, 2024, 12:15 p.m. ET Representative Tony Gonzales, a Republican of Texas whose district encompasses a vast swath of the U.S.-Mexico border, delivered a harsh criticism of his hard-right G.O.P. colleagues who voted against the military aid package to U.S. allies, comparing some members with the Ku Klux Klan. 'The way to take out the bully is to bloody their nose,' he said after saying that the days where rank-and-file members were 'kind of easygoing' and 'put their head down' were over.

            "summary": "Barbara Joans, an iconoclastic anthropologist and feminist who, in her early 60s, became something of a Margaret Mead in black leather, steering her Harley-Davidson deep into a biker culture and producing the 2001 book, 'Bike Lust: Harleys, Women, and American Society,' died on March 6 in Santa Cruz, Calif. She was 89.\nThe cause of her death, in an assisted living facility, was cardiopulmonary failure, her son Howard Schwartz said.\nMs. Joans, Brooklyn-born, plucky and outspoken, began her career as an instructor at the New School for Social Research in Greenwich Village, with a focus on women's issues, producing papers on topics like the anthropological aspects of menopause.\nStarting in the 1960s, she was also a feminist crusader, helping women arrange illegal abortions in the days before Roe v. Wade. In 1970, she participated in a daylong occupation of The Ladies' Home Journal's editorial offices in New York to demand the opportunity to put out a 'liberated' version of the magazine.\n'She was a bit of a wild woman, a genuine nonconformist,' Phyllis Chesler, author of 'Women and Madness' (1972) and a longtime friend of Ms. Joans's, said in a phone interview. 'Yes, she was an academic and a nice Jewish girl from Brooklyn. But she was a little bit of a street hombre.'\nMs. Joans, born in Brooklyn, moved to Northern California in the 1970s after a divorce. Her motorcycle club, based in San Francisco, was called the Fog Hogs. Credit... Kenneth Harmon Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The Alabama Supreme Court's in vitro fertilization ruling this year, which held that frozen embryos should be considered children, raised a long list of questions for people worried about their future fertility treatments. My colleague Tara Siegel Bernard and I attempted to answer many of them in February.\nBut a few unusual ones linger for people all over who want to explore every option. What does the law say about what you can and can't do with your embryos? Can you sell them? And if you donate them ‚Äî say, to a university for research ‚Äî can you take a tax deduction?\nStraightforward answers to the questions about selling and donating are elusive.\nIt is not clear how many human embryos sit in storage across the United States, but plenty of people who put them there worry about losing control over them. Court cases like the one in Alabama, which all but shut down I.V.F. treatments there temporarily, will do that to a person. So will the increasing restrictions on abortion in many states ‚Äî and the concurrent discussions of when life begins.\nIt may make sense to act pre-emptively, if you possibly can. But to do what?\nSelling embryos seems outlandish, though it may not violate federal law. The 1984 National Organ Transplant Act outlaws the sale of things in or from the human body like kidneys, livers, bones and skin, but it makes no mention of embryos.\nAll legal considerations aside, there may not be a big market for anyone seeking to sell embryos. Plus, many potential sellers will probably be thinking hard about the feelings of any potential child and the questions that child might have years later.\n'The voice that hasn't been heard is the voice of the children,' said Dr. Sigal Klipstein, a physician and chair of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine's ethics committee. 'They may be the biggest stakeholders.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

She was 94.\nConcerned Women for America, which Mrs. LaHaye founded in 1979, announced her death in a statement.\nIn the 1980s, Mrs. LaHaye ran an office in Washington of more than 25 employees, including lawyers and lobbyists. She urged Congress to send military aid to the right-wing contras of Nicaragua; rallied her members to barrage the television networks to protest condom commercials; and testified in the Senate for President Ronald Reagan's Supreme Court nominees Antonin Scalia and Robert Bork.\nPresident Reagan appeared at Concerned Women of America's 1987 convention, as Judge Bork's nomination was facing fierce liberal opposition. He was greeted by signs stating, 'All Ladies Want Bork.' (The Senate rejected him.)\n'In just a few short years,' the president told Mrs. LaHaye's crowd, 'you've become the largest politically active women's group in the nation.' He called Mrs. LaHaye 'one of the powerhouses on the political scene today.'\nShe had arrived just two years earlier, moving her headquarters to Washington from California 'to be closer to the center of action,' she told The Arizona Republic in 1984.\nAt a news conference announcing her arrival, Mrs. LaHaye said that conservative women who turned to the Bible for guidance on women's role in the family and society ‚Äî and not to the writings of Betty Friedan and other feminists ‚Äî now had a public voice. 'This is our message: The feminists do not speak for all women in America, and C.W.A. is here in Washington to end the monopoly of feminists who claim to speak for all women,' she said.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "excerpt": "The departure of two Democratic representatives who won suburban mayoral posts last fall evenly split the Michigan House.",
            "summary": "Michigan Democrats started 2023 with full control of state government for the first time since the 1980s. They ended the year in a political bind after two House members left to become mayors of suburbs, leaving that chamber with an even partisan split and making it impossible for Democrats to pass bills without Republican support.\nOn Tuesday, five months after their House majority evaporated, Democrats won two special elections to reclaim those seats and full control at the Michigan Capitol. The Associated Press said the Democrats Mai Xiong, a Macomb County commissioner, and Peter Herzberg, a Westland City Council member, defeated their Republican opponents.\nThe results of the special elections had never been in great doubt. Both districts, situated in the Detroit area, are liberal strongholds that Democratic candidates had carried by large margins in 2022. But the details of scheduling and running special elections meant a long, slow winter for Democratic lawmakers in Lansing while the House was evenly divided between the two parties. Michigan's governor, Gretchen Whitmer, is a Democrat, and her party has a majority in the State Senate.\nRepublicans hope the Democrats' renewed House majority is short-lived. Michigan, long a swing state, is expected to be a pivotal presidential battleground again this year. President Biden is working to rebuild a coalition that helped him win the state in 2020, but early polling has been favorable to former President Donald J. Trump. Republicans see an opening to deliver Michigan for Mr. Trump in November and to win control of the Michigan House, a goal that could be helped by newly redrawn legislative maps in the Detroit area. All 110 Michigan House seats are up for election in November, including the two seats that were contested on Tuesday.\nBefore losing their House majority last year, Michigan Democrats raced through a list of longstanding policy goals that had been stymied during decades of divided government or Republican control of the state. In the span of several months in 2023, Ms. Whitmer and legislative Democrats enacted new gun laws, codified civil rights for L.G.B.T.Q. people, solidified abortion rights and undid Republican laws that they said weakened labor unions.\nThose efforts slowed in November after one House member, Kevin Coleman, was elected mayor of Westland and another, Lori M. Stone, was elected mayor of Warren. Under Michigan law, Mr. Coleman and Ms. Stone had to resign from the Legislature when they became mayor.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "excerpt": "Despite a juicy premise, this Colt Coeur production, starring Tim Daly and Jayne Atkinson, never manages to take off.",
            "summary": "In her essay 'The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction,' the novelist Ursula K. Le Guin hymned the bag as the proper shape for stories: it 'is full of beginnings without ends, of initiations, of losses, of transformations and translations, and far more tricks than conflicts.'\nOne of the characters in Lia Romeo's 'Still,' a writer, carries just such a bag ‚Äî a possible wink to her fellow novelist. The tote is large enough to house a ukulele, an avocado and a package of macadamia nuts ‚Äî all of which are divulged in the play's single moment of spontaneity ‚Äî but its owner can't seem to effect any Le Guinian 'transformations' or 'tricks.' There is a sense of stasis to the aptly named two-hander, which never ripens from a situation into a story.\n'Still,' a Colt Coeur production that opened recently at DR2 Theater in the East Village, begins with two characters, former flames, meeting in a bar. Mark (a suave Tim Daly) and Helen (Jayne Atkinson) are in their mid-60s and haven't seen each other in years. Sharing a bottle of wine, they shoot the breeze about their children and recent divorce (him) and new book and cancer diagnosis (her).\nAt first, they are content to pretend their past romance has subsided into a platonic relationship, but as the alcohol goes to their heads, they admit to carrying a torch for each other. A highlight of the show is their seduction scene: It's the first I've seen onstage that unabashedly invokes the corporeal indignities of aging. The director Adrienne Campbell-Holt has Mark and Helen walk slowly toward each other while making sotto voce confessions: 'I'm missing the nail on my right big toe,' 'I have three fake teeth,' 'I have arthritis in my knees.' Do I need to spell out what happens next?\nAlexander Woodward's softly lit set spins to reveal a hotel room. Resting against each other in bed, Mark and Helen proceed, post-coitally this time, with their confessions. Mark, who lives in Colorado, is considering relocating to Washington, D.C., to run for Congress, as a 'moderate' Republican. 'I wish you'd told me that before we ‚Äî‚Äî' Helen says, gesturing limply to the bed with rumpled sheets. She considers herself a liberal, but political differences aren't the only thing on her mind.\nPart of the reason their relationship ended was because she had an abortion. Despite what Mark told her decades ago, he wanted Helen to have the baby. She, on the other hand, had felt ‚Äî and still feels ‚Äî that it would have been a mistake. 'When we walked out of that clinic, I was ‚Äî scraped out, and I was sad. But I felt so light, knowing that ‚Ä¶ all my cells were my own again,' she tells him. The stage is thus set for a real conflict.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "excerpt": "A group of homeless plaintiffs argue that local laws aimed at banning sleeping outside violated their constitutional rights. The city claims that's not what the Eighth Amendment means.",
            "summary": "Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index The Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis. The case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces. The issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years. The dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces. The question before the justices is whether those laws went so far that they punished people for being homeless and violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. A group of homeless residents is challenging the city's enforcement of the ordinances as unconstitutional, arguing that they are involuntarily homeless in the city because there are not shelter beds available and that the city may not punish them without offering shelter. City officials in Grants Pass counter that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment. They warn that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would fuel homeless encampments across the country and hamstring the ability of local governments to respond. Here's what else to know: The case began in October 2018, when Debra Blake, a homeless woman in Grants Pass, sued the city, accusing officials of breaching the Constitution. 'The city of Grants Pass is trying to run homeless people out of town,' the lawsuit said. 'On any given day or night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, are forced to live outside due to the lack of emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.'\nThe plaintiffs' argument rests in part on a 1962 case, Robinson v. California, in which the Supreme Court held that laws imposing penalties on people for narcotics addiction violated the Eighth Amendment because they punished a state of being, not a specific action, like drug possession or sale. In a similar fashion, the plaintiffs contend, Grants Pass is punishing people for being involuntarily homeless, not for specific actions.\nThat argument held sway in a separate case, Martin v. Boise, in 2018. In that case, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Boise, Idaho, had violated the constitutional rights of homeless people by imposing criminal penalties for sleeping and camping outdoors, even though the city did not have enough shelter beds.\nLawyers for Grants Pass point to the Boise case as a cautionary tale. The decision only hastened 'sprawling encampments, rising deaths and widespread harms to the community, as localities are forced to surrender their public spaces,' the lawyers wrote in a brief. The lawyers added that lawmakers, not courts, were best suited to address homelessness and the complexity of its root causes.\nUnderlining the tricky balance inherent in the case, a number of groups have sought to strike something of a compromise. The Biden administration, the city and county of Los Angeles, the city and county of San Francisco, California and the state's governor have weighed in, all seeking to find a careful balance between support for homeless residents and for broader communities.\nThe Biden administration, which will participate in the oral arguments, has not chosen a side in the dispute. Even as it was sharply critical of laws that in effect criminalize homelessness ‚Äî policies that it argues can make it harder for people to escape their circumstances ‚Äî the administration said local governments had a basic responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces like parks and sidewalks. April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET The argument is scheduled for 65 minutes. But it will probably last more than twice that long. April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET The stakes are high. In San Francisco, which is embroiled in a lawsuit over encampments, city officials have complained for months that a sweeping injunction based on the Grants Pass decision and other Ninth Circuit rulings has complicated law enforcement around downtown tent camps. Over the weekend, I asked Senator Scott Wiener, a Democratic legislator who represents San Francisco, what he was hoping for from the Supreme Court. 'Certainty,' he told me, 'because things have been chaotic here.'  April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET In briefs on the case, California leaders have tried to take a nuanced position, arguing, in essence, that they don't want to criminalize homelessness but need more flexibility to clear the most dangerous encampments and compel people to take shelter when it is offered. This tricky balance was reflected in Gov. Gavin Newsom's brief 'in support of neither party.' April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET Outside the Supreme Court building this morning, activists hoping to protect the rights of homeless people have gathered with signs that call for 'Housing Not Handcuffs.' Many of them are draped in reflective thermal blankets. An encampment in Los Angeles in December. Credit... Mark Abramson for The New York Times Tent encampments lining public parks and city sidewalks. Piles of garbage, human waste and used needles. According to leaders across the political spectrum who have asked the Supreme Court to address homelessness, those are the consequences of a sharp increase in homelessness that have forced many cities to 'a breaking point.' Although the case before the court on Monday centers on the narrow issue of whether the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment shields homeless people with no options for shelter from fines, fees and jail time, officials and advocates across the country are watching the case closely for its potential to reshape homelessness policy. The case underscores deep divisions over how best to address homelessness and how much leeway to give to local and state officials to help solve the problem. Theane Evangelis, a lawyer for the city of Grants Pass, Ore., who also represented the city of Boise, Idaho, in a similar case in 2018, warned that 'the stakes could not be higher for every city in the country.' If the Supreme Court upheld an appeals court ruling on behalf of the homeless plaintiffs, she added, cities everywhere 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.' Those who side with the homeless plaintiffs counter that the issue before the court is a focused one, on how to interpret the Constitution. The cities' willingness to embrace solutions like more affordable housing will determine whether the homelessness crisis will begin to abate, they say. 'The first thing for folks who aren't in this field ‚Äî or understanding the nuances of this case ‚Äî to understand is that nobody wants a country where people are forced to sleep outside,' said Ann Oliva, chief executive of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, an advocacy group founded in the 1980s with bipartisan roots. In briefs, supporters of Grants Pass have contended that local and state policymakers, not judges, are best placed to devise homelessness policies. The cases from Grants Pass and Boise had allowed 'federal judges to serve as the nation's ‚Äòhomelessness policy czars,'' wrote the Cicero Institute, a Texas policy group critical of longstanding federal policy that channels funds to programs to provide the homeless with permanent housing without requiring people to undergo mental health or drug treatment. Lawyers for the National Alliance to End Homelessness say that imposing penalties, rather than providing housing and services, ignores the roots of the issue. In its brief to the court, the group said that the city of Grants Pass and its defenders, 'rather than working to end it,' sought 'to banish homeless people out of sight and out of mind.' 'The threat of criminal penalties does not reduce homelessness,' the brief argued. 'At most, it drives unsheltered homeless people into hiding, leading to greater health and safety concerns for localities. Criminal punishment for peaceably sleeping outside as an unsheltered homeless person is not only cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but unnecessary, expensive and counterproductive.'

California has about 12 percent of the nation's population, but roughly a third of the nation's homeless people. A lot of factors play into that, including the sunny weather to a crippling housing shortage. But rulings by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit constraining tent camp enforcement have made California's homelessness crisis particularly wrenching and visible.

Gavin Newsom of California has said that he opposes criminalizing homelessness but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass have impeded the ability of the local authorities to move people into shelters and temporary housing. Credit... Jeff Chiu/Associated Press The Goldwater Institute and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California ordinarily have little in common. One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation's most liberal states. But for the past six years, they have been aligned on one highly charged issue: the need for some legal way to clear homeless encampments that have proliferated in cities throughout the West. On Monday, the Supreme Court will consider an Oregon case that could reshape homelessness policy nationally. On its face, The City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks. More broadly, however, the case deals with one of the thorniest aspects of the homelessness crisis ‚Äî the balance between the government's responsibility to protect public health and the human right to exist without housing. The conflict has been particularly acute in the West, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has issued opinions over the past six years that officials blame for the sprawling tent encampments in public spaces that have spread since the pandemic. As voters' frustration has grown, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping, only to have the courts reject them. Advocates for homeless people, the American Psychiatric Association and several left-leaning states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, argue that criminalizing homelessness only worsens the problem. More effective, they say, is focusing on housing, treatment, education and jobs for people who are homeless. In the nine Western states in the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction, however, officials have increasingly begged the court to explicitly define the point at which a community can reclaim its shared spaces without triggering lawsuits. Some echo conservative appointees on the Ninth Circuit like Judge Daniel Bress, who issued a scathing response last year after the liberal majority voted not to give the Grants Pass case a rehearing before the full appeals court. (The three-judge had panel found that penalties for bunking outdoors violated the Constitution if the local population of homeless people exceeded the city's shelter capacity.) The Ninth Circuit, he wrote, need only look to its doorstep to see the fruit of its decision ‚Äî a dystopia of 'homelessness, drug addiction, barely concealed narcotics dealing, severe mental health impairment' and post-Covid 'hollowing out.' In Phoenix, where a massive encampment near the Arizona State Capitol consumed millions of state dollars and years of litigation, Timothy Sandefur, vice president for legal affairs of the Goldwater Institute, noted that both sides had asked the court for clarification. 'It just shows,' he said, 'that across the board, the Ninth Circuit ruling that you have a constitutional right to sleep in a public park is unworkable and has got to be reversed.' In California, where more than 180,000 people are homeless, Mr. Newsom wrote in his brief to the court that he opposes criminalizing homelessness, but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass 'have impeded not only the ability to enforce basic health and safety measures, but also the ability to move people into available shelter beds and temporary housing.' Since his election in 2018, California has pumped more than $20 billion into programs to address homelessness, including specialized housing, a new court-based approach for dealing with addiction and mental illness and a $6.38 billion bond. At a news conference last week, he recalled pitching in to dismantle one tent camp in Oakland that 'felt like a scene out of a ‚ÄòRaiders of the Lost Ark' where, you know, thousands and thousands of rats appeared running all around us.' 'This is to me just about common sense, not about ideology,' the governor said.  'Suddenly, I found myself homeless,' Laura Gutowski said. 'I never expected it to come to this.' Credit... Mason Trinca for The New York Times Inside a warming shelter, Laura Gutowski detailed how her life had changed since she became homeless two and a half years ago in Grants Pass, a former timber hub in the foothills of southern Oregon. Her husband's death left her without steady income. She lived in a sedan, and then in a tent, in sight of the elementary school where her son was once a student. She constantly scrambled to move her belongings to avoid racking up more fines from the police. 'I never expected it to come to this,' said Ms. Gutowski, 55. She is one of several hundred homeless people in this city of about 40,000 that is at the center of a major case before the Supreme Court on Monday with broad ramifications for the nationwide struggle with homelessness. After Grants Pass stepped up enforcement of local ordinances that banned sleeping and camping in public spaces by ticketing, fining and jailing homeless people, lower courts ruled that it amounted to 'cruel and unusual punishment' by penalizing people who had nowhere else to go. Many states and cities that are increasingly overwhelmed by homelessness are hoping the Supreme Court overturns that decision ‚Äî or severely limits it. They argue that it has crippled their efforts to address sprawling encampments, rampant public drug use and fearful constituents who say they cannot safely use public spaces. That prospect has alarmed homeless people and their advocates, who contend that a ruling against them would lead cities to fall back on jails, instead of solutions like affordable housing and social services. The case highlights the fierce divide over the thorny issue of how to regulate homelessness. Theane Evangelis, a lawyer representing Grants Pass, said the Supreme Court's decision would reverberate widely. If it does not overturn the lower-court decision, she said, cities around the United States 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.' Ed Johnson, a lawyer for the Oregon Law Center, a nonprofit legal aid group, who represents the homeless residents, said a ruling against them would strip them of their few protections. 'Can a city make it illegal on every inch of city land, every minute of the day, for people to live outside when they have nowhere else to go?' he said. Homelessness across the country climbed to the highest total on record last year, increasing by 12 percent to more than 650,000 people, according to a count by the federal government. Lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Credit... Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times At the core of the Supreme Court battle over a small Oregon town's treatment of its homeless people is a narrow question: Does the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual treatment apply to a city's efforts to crack down on public sleeping and camping? The Eighth Amendment is most commonly applied to punishments, not to laws themselves, and it is often the focus of litigation around the death penalty, solitary confinement and life without the possibility of parole. But in the case on Monday, lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Because the town, Grants Pass, has no homeless shelter, unaffiliated with any religious group, that is open to everyone, they argue, all homeless people there are involuntarily homeless and cannot be punished for having nowhere to go. To make that argument, the homeless plaintiffs have looked to rulings that apply the amendment beyond punishments themselves and to the concept that a person cannot be penalized for their state of being. In one landmark 1962 decision, Robinson v. California, the court found that a person could not be punished for being addicted to drugs, paving the way for subsequent applications. Because those rulings found that the Eighth Amendment prohibits punishing people for having 'an involuntary status,' the homeless plaintiffs say that it would also be relevant to their situation. They add that they are being disciplined for circumstances outside their control, in this instance 'universal biological necessities like sleeping and using a blanket to survive cold temperatures when they have no choice but to be outside.' The city argues that this is an inappropriate use of the Eighth Amendment and a fundamental misunderstanding of its purpose. Two legal experts, in filing a friend-of-the-court brief siding with Grants Pass, argued that the Constitution did bar criminalizing someone's state of being, rather than their specific conduct. But that prohibition, the law professors ‚Äî Peter W. Low of the University of Virginia and Joel S. Johnson of Pepperdine ‚Äî added, had a 'shaky Eighth Amendment footing.'  ¬© 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis.\nThe case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces.\nThe issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years.\nThe dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces. The question before the justices is whether those laws went so far that they punished people for being homeless and violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\nA group of homeless residents is challenging the city's enforcement of the ordinances as unconstitutional, arguing that they are involuntarily homeless in the city because there are not shelter beds available and that the city may not punish them without offering shelter.\nCity officials in Grants Pass counter that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment. They warn that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would fuel homeless encampments across the country and hamstring the ability of local governments to respond.\nHere's what else to know:\nThe case began in October 2018, when Debra Blake, a homeless woman in Grants Pass, sued the city, accusing officials of breaching the Constitution. 'The city of Grants Pass is trying to run homeless people out of town,' the lawsuit said. 'On any given day or night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, are forced to live outside due to the lack of emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.'\nThe plaintiffs' argument rests in part on a 1962 case, Robinson v. California, in which the Supreme Court held that laws imposing penalties on people for narcotics addiction violated the Eighth Amendment because they punished a state of being, not a specific action, like drug possession or sale. In a similar fashion, the plaintiffs contend, Grants Pass is punishing people for being involuntarily homeless, not for specific actions.\nThat argument held sway in a separate case, Martin v. Boise, in 2018. In that case, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Boise, Idaho, had violated the constitutional rights of homeless people by imposing criminal penalties for sleeping and camping outdoors, even though the city did not have enough shelter beds.\nLawyers for Grants Pass point to the Boise case as a cautionary tale. The decision only hastened 'sprawling encampments, rising deaths and widespread harms to the community, as localities are forced to surrender their public spaces,' the lawyers wrote in a brief. The lawyers added that lawmakers, not courts, were best suited to address homelessness and the complexity of its root causes.\nUnderlining the tricky balance inherent in the case, a number of groups have sought to strike something of a compromise. The Biden administration, the city and county of Los Angeles, the city and county of San Francisco, California and the state's governor have weighed in, all seeking to find a careful balance between support for homeless residents and for broader communities.\nThe Biden administration, which will participate in the oral arguments, has not chosen a side in the dispute. Even as it was sharply critical of laws that in effect criminalize homelessness ‚Äî policies that it argues can make it harder for people to escape their circumstances ‚Äî the administration said local governments had a basic responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces like parks and sidewalks.\nApril 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET The argument is scheduled for 65 minutes. But it will probably last more than twice that long.\nApril 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET The stakes are high. In San Francisco, which is embroiled in a lawsuit over encampments, city officials have complained for months that a sweeping injunction based on the Grants Pass decision and other Ninth Circuit rulings has complicated law enforcement around downtown tent camps. Over the weekend, I asked Senator Scott Wiener, a Democratic legislator who represents San Francisco, what he was hoping for from the Supreme Court. 'Certainty,' he told me, 'because things have been chaotic here.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET In briefs on the case, California leaders have tried to take a nuanced position, arguing, in essence, that they don't want to criminalize homelessness but need more flexibility to clear the most dangerous encampments and compel people to take shelter when it is offered. This tricky balance was reflected in Gov. Gavin Newsom's brief 'in support of neither party.'\nApril 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET Outside the Supreme Court building this morning, activists hoping to protect the rights of homeless people have gathered with signs that call for 'Housing Not Handcuffs.' Many of them are draped in reflective thermal blankets.\nAn encampment in Los Angeles in December. Credit...

According to leaders across the political spectrum who have asked the Supreme Court to address homelessness, those are the consequences of a sharp increase in homelessness that have forced many cities to 'a breaking point.'\nAlthough the case before the court on Monday centers on the narrow issue of whether the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment shields homeless people with no options for shelter from fines, fees and jail time, officials and advocates across the country are watching the case closely for its potential to reshape homelessness policy.\nThe case underscores deep divisions over how best to address homelessness and how much leeway to give to local and state officials to help solve the problem.\nTheane Evangelis, a lawyer for the city of Grants Pass, Ore., who also represented the city of Boise, Idaho, in a similar case in 2018, warned that 'the stakes could not be higher for every city in the country.'\nIf the Supreme Court upheld an appeals court ruling on behalf of the homeless plaintiffs, she added, cities everywhere 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.'\nThose who side with the homeless plaintiffs counter that the issue before the court is a focused one, on how to interpret the Constitution.

The case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces. The issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years. The dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces.

According to leaders across the political spectrum who have asked the Supreme Court to address homelessness, those are the consequences of a sharp increase in homelessness that have forced many cities to 'a breaking point.' Although the case before the court on Monday centers on the narrow issue of whether the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment shields homeless people with no options for shelter from fines, fees and jail time, officials and advocates across the country are watching the case closely for its potential to reshape homelessness policy. The case underscores deep divisions over how best to address homelessness and how much leeway to give to local and state officials to help solve the problem. Theane Evangelis, a lawyer for the city of Grants Pass, Ore., who also represented the city of Boise, Idaho, in a similar case in 2018, warned that 'the stakes could not be higher for every city in the country.' If the Supreme Court upheld an appeals court ruling on behalf of the homeless plaintiffs, she added, cities everywhere 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.' Those who side with the homeless plaintiffs counter that the issue before the court is a focused one, on how to interpret the Constitution. The cities' willingness to embrace solutions like more affordable housing will determine whether the homelessness crisis will begin to abate, they say. 'The first thing for folks who aren't in this field ‚Äî or understanding the nuances of this case ‚Äî to understand is that nobody wants a country where people are forced to sleep outside,' said Ann Oliva, chief executive of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, an advocacy group founded in the 1980s with bipartisan roots. In briefs, supporters of Grants Pass have contended that local and state policymakers, not judges, are best placed to devise homelessness policies. The cases from Grants Pass and Boise had allowed 'federal judges to serve as the nation's ‚Äòhomelessness policy czars,'' wrote the Cicero Institute, a Texas policy group critical of longstanding federal policy that channels funds to programs to provide the homeless with permanent housing without requiring people to undergo mental health or drug treatment. Lawyers for the National Alliance to End Homelessness say that imposing penalties, rather than providing housing and services, ignores the roots of the issue. In its brief to the court, the group said that the city of Grants Pass and its defenders, 'rather than working to end it,' sought 'to banish homeless people out of sight and out of mind.' 'The threat of criminal penalties does not reduce homelessness,' the brief argued. 'At most, it drives unsheltered homeless people into hiding, leading to greater health and safety concerns for localities. Criminal punishment for peaceably sleeping outside as an unsheltered homeless person is not only cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but unnecessary, expensive and counterproductive.'

Credit... Jeff Chiu/Associated Press The Goldwater Institute and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California ordinarily have little in common. One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation's most liberal states. But for the past six years, they have been aligned on one highly charged issue: the need for some legal way to clear homeless encampments that have proliferated in cities throughout the West. On Monday, the Supreme Court will consider an Oregon case that could reshape homelessness policy nationally. On its face, The City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks. More broadly, however, the case deals with one of the thorniest aspects of the homelessness crisis ‚Äî the balance between the government's responsibility to protect public health and the human right to exist without housing. The conflict has been particularly acute in the West, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has issued opinions over the past six years that officials blame for the sprawling tent encampments in public spaces that have spread since the pandemic. As voters' frustration has grown, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping, only to have the courts reject them. Advocates for homeless people, the American Psychiatric Association and several left-leaning states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, argue that criminalizing homelessness only worsens the problem. More effective, they say, is focusing on housing, treatment, education and jobs for people who are homeless. In the nine Western states in the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction, however, officials have increasingly begged the court to explicitly define the point at which a community can reclaim its shared spaces without triggering lawsuits. Some echo conservative appointees on the Ninth Circuit like Judge Daniel Bress, who issued a scathing response last year after the liberal majority voted not to give the Grants Pass case a rehearing before the full appeals court. (The three-judge had panel found that penalties for bunking outdoors violated the Constitution if the local population of homeless people exceeded the city's shelter capacity.) The Ninth Circuit, he wrote, need only look to its doorstep to see the fruit of its decision ‚Äî a dystopia of 'homelessness, drug addiction, barely concealed narcotics dealing, severe mental health impairment' and post-Covid 'hollowing out.' In Phoenix, where a massive encampment near the Arizona State Capitol consumed millions of state dollars and years of litigation, Timothy Sandefur, vice president for legal affairs of the Goldwater Institute, noted that both sides had asked the court for clarification. 'It just shows,' he said, 'that across the board, the Ninth Circuit ruling that you have a constitutional right to sleep in a public park is unworkable and has got to be reversed.' In California, where more than 180,000 people are homeless, Mr. Newsom wrote in his brief to the court that he opposes criminalizing homelessness, but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass 'have impeded not only the ability to enforce basic health and safety measures, but also the ability to move people into available shelter beds and temporary housing.' Since his election in 2018, California has pumped more than $20 billion into programs to address homelessness, including specialized housing, a new court-based approach for dealing with addiction and mental illness and a $6.38 billion bond. At a news conference last week, he recalled pitching in to dismantle one tent camp in Oakland that 'felt like a scene out of a ‚ÄòRaiders of the Lost Ark' where, you know, thousands and thousands of rats appeared running all around us.' 'This is to me just about common sense, not about ideology,' the governor said.  'Suddenly, I found myself homeless,' Laura Gutowski said. 'I never expected it to come to this.' Credit... Mason Trinca for The New York Times Inside a warming shelter, Laura Gutowski detailed how her life had changed since she became homeless two and a half years ago in Grants Pass, a former timber hub in the foothills of southern Oregon. Her husband's death left her without steady income. She lived in a sedan, and then in a tent, in sight of the elementary school where her son was once a student. She constantly scrambled to move her belongings to avoid racking up more fines from the police. 'I never expected it to come to this,' said Ms. Gutowski, 55. She is one of several hundred homeless people in this city of about 40,000 that is at the center of a major case before the Supreme Court on Monday with broad ramifications for the nationwide struggle with homelessness. After Grants Pass stepped up enforcement of local ordinances that banned sleeping and camping in public spaces by ticketing, fining and jailing homeless people, lower courts ruled that it amounted to 'cruel and unusual punishment' by penalizing people who had nowhere else to go. Many states and cities that are increasingly overwhelmed by homelessness are hoping the Supreme Court overturns that decision ‚Äî or severely limits it. They argue that it has crippled their efforts to address sprawling encampments, rampant public drug use and fearful constituents who say they cannot safely use public spaces. That prospect has alarmed homeless people and their advocates, who contend that a ruling against them would lead cities to fall back on jails, instead of solutions like affordable housing and social services. The case highlights the fierce divide over the thorny issue of how to regulate homelessness. Theane Evangelis, a lawyer representing Grants Pass, said the Supreme Court's decision would reverberate widely. If it does not overturn the lower-court decision, she said, cities around the United States 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.' Ed Johnson, a lawyer for the Oregon Law Center, a nonprofit legal aid group, who represents the homeless residents, said a ruling against them would strip them of their few protections. 'Can a city make it illegal on every inch of city land, every minute of the day, for people to live outside when they have nowhere else to go?' he said. Homelessness across the country climbed to the highest total on record last year, increasing by 12 percent to more than 650,000 people, according to a count by the federal government. Lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Credit... Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times At the core of the Supreme Court battle over a small Oregon town's treatment of its homeless people is a narrow question: Does the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual treatment apply to a city's efforts to crack down on public sleeping and camping? The Eighth Amendment is most commonly applied to punishments, not to laws themselves, and it is often the focus of litigation around the death penalty, solitary confinement and life without the possibility of parole. But in the case on Monday, lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Because the town, Grants Pass, has no homeless shelter, unaffiliated with any religious group, that is open to everyone, they argue, all homeless people there are involuntarily homeless and cannot be punished for having nowhere to go. To make that argument, the homeless plaintiffs have looked to rulings that apply the amendment beyond punishments themselves and to the concept that a person cannot be penalized for their state of being. In one landmark 1962 decision, Robinson v. California, the court found that a person could not be punished for being addicted to drugs, paving the way for subsequent applications. Because those rulings found that the Eighth Amendment prohibits punishing people for having 'an involuntary status,' the homeless plaintiffs say that it would also be relevant to their situation. They add that they are being disciplined for circumstances outside their control, in this instance 'universal biological necessities like sleeping and using a blanket to survive cold temperatures when they have no choice but to be outside.' The city argues that this is an inappropriate use of the Eighth Amendment and a fundamental misunderstanding of its purpose. Two legal experts, in filing a friend-of-the-court brief siding with Grants Pass, argued that the Constitution did bar criminalizing someone's state of being, rather than their specific conduct. But that prohibition, the law professors ‚Äî Peter W. Low of the University of Virginia and Joel S. Johnson of Pepperdine ‚Äî added, had a 'shaky Eighth Amendment footing.'  ¬© 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis.\nThe case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces.\nThe issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years.\nThe dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces. The question before the justices is whether those laws went so far that they punished people for being homeless and violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\nA group of homeless residents is challenging the city's enforcement of the ordinances as unconstitutional, arguing that they are involuntarily homeless in the city because there are not shelter beds available and that the city may not punish them without offering shelter.\nCity officials in Grants Pass counter that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment. They warn that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would fuel homeless encampments across the country and hamstring the ability of local governments to respond.\nHere's what else to know:\nThe case began in October 2018, when Debra Blake, a homeless woman in Grants Pass, sued the city, accusing officials of breaching the Constitution. 'The city of Grants Pass is trying to run homeless people out of town,' the lawsuit said. 'On any given day or night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, are forced to live outside due to the lack of emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.'\nThe plaintiffs' argument rests in part on a 1962 case, Robinson v. California, in which the Supreme Court held that laws imposing penalties on people for narcotics addiction violated the Eighth Amendment because they punished a state of being, not a specific action, like drug possession or sale. In a similar fashion, the plaintiffs contend, Grants Pass is punishing people for being involuntarily homeless, not for specific actions.\nThat argument held sway in a separate case, Martin v. Boise, in 2018. In that case, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Boise, Idaho, had violated the constitutional rights of homeless people by imposing criminal penalties for sleeping and camping outdoors, even though the city did not have enough shelter beds.\nLawyers for Grants Pass point to the Boise case as a cautionary tale. The decision only hastened 'sprawling encampments, rising deaths and widespread harms to the community, as localities are forced to surrender their public spaces,' the lawyers wrote in a brief. The lawyers added that lawmakers, not courts, were best suited to address homelessness and the complexity of its root causes.\nUnderlining the tricky balance inherent in the case, a number of groups have sought to strike something of a compromise. The Biden administration, the city and county of Los Angeles, the city and county of San Francisco, California and the state's governor have weighed in, all seeking to find a careful balance between support for homeless residents and for broader communities.\nThe Biden administration, which will participate in the oral arguments, has not chosen a side in the dispute.
