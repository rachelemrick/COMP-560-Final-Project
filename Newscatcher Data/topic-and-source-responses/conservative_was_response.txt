It's given to land with historic or cultural significance or that's important for wildlife conservation.\nAdvertisement\nThe land bureau has a history of industry-friendly policies and for more than a century has sold grazing permits and oil and gas leases. In addition to its surface land holdings, the bureau regulates publicly-owned underground mineral reserves \u2014 such as coal for power plants and lithium for renewable energy \u2014 across more than 1 million square miles (2.5 million square kilometers).\nInterior Secretary Deb Haaland said the changes would 'restore balance' to how the U.S. government manages its public lands. The new rule continues the administration's efforts to use science to restore habitats and guide 'strategic and responsible development,' Haaland said in a statement.\nBut Republican lawmakers and agriculture industry representatives have blasted the move as a backdoor way to exclude mining, energy development and agriculture. They assert the administration is violating the 'multiple use' mandate for Interior Department lands, by catapulting the 'non-use' of federal lands \u2014 meaning restoration leases \u2014 to a position of prominence.\nAdvertisement\nAbout 10% of all land in the U.S. falls under the Bureau of Land Management's jurisdiction, putting the agency at the center of arguments over how much development should be allowed on public property.\nEnvironmentalists largely embraced the changes, characterizing them as long overdue.\nTrout Unlimited President Chris Wood said conservation already was part of the bureau's mission under the 1976 Federal Lands Policy Management Act. The new rule, he said, was 'a re-statement of the obvious.'\n'We are pleased to see the agency recognizing what the law already states \u2014 conservation is a vital use of our public lands,' he said.\nRestoration leases will not be issued if they would conflict with activity already underway on a parcel of land, officials said. They also said private industry could benefit from the program, since companies could buy leases and restore that acreage to offset damage they might do to other government-owned properties.\nAdvertisement\nThose leases were referred to as 'conservation leases' in the agency's original proposal last year. That was changed to 'restoration leases' and 'mitigation leases' in the final rule, but their purpose appears largely the same.\nWhile the bureau previously issued leases for conservation purposes in limited cases, it has never had a dedicated program for it.\nBureau Director Tracy Stone-Manning has said the changes address the rising challenges of climate change and development. She told The Associated Press when the changes were announced last year that making conservation an 'equal' to other uses would not interfere with grazing, drilling and other activities.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Matthew Brown","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/U3OWPBX5VEI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.6817703,"_id":"b6fdae962235ff06976c676935df4ac0"},{"title":"Has the U.S. really conserved a third of its waters?

But not everyone agrees on what it means to protect it.\nThe United States is conserving approximately one-third of the country's ocean areas, according to an early analysis released Friday by the Biden administration \u2014 suggesting the president is meeting a key environmental goal laid out at the beginning of his term.\nBut others say that's not the case.\nSome of those areas still allow for commercial fishing, advocates say, and fall short of protections needed to save marine ecosystems facing dire threats.\n'It's padding the numbers,' said Brad Sewell, oceans director at the Natural Resources Defense Council.\nThe disagreement comes as the White House on Friday outlined how much progress the country has made in achieving President Biden's ambitious goal of conserving at least 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030.\nAdvertisement\nThe White House's Council on Environmental Quality said its preliminary count \u2014 outlined in a newly released atlas \u2014 shows that approximately 'one-third of U.S. marine areas are currently conserved.'\n'We are making bold progress to conserve our ocean,' Rick Spinrad, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said in a statement.\nYet precisely what areas on the map should count as protected has been a subject of considerable debate.\nThe White House said a majority of that ocean expanse \u2014 26 percent of U.S. waters \u2014 is officially designated as 'marine protected areas,' where human activity is typically restricted to protect wildlife.\nBut that one-third tally also includes parts of the ocean where only a type of fishing called bottom trawling is banned to protect coral and other bottom-dwelling creatures from nets that scrape the seafloor. Other types of commercial fishing in those areas, which include swaths of ocean off New England and the Mid-Atlantic, are still allowed.\nAdvertisement\n'These are partial measures,' he added. 'We're at a point in time where the biodiversity crisis is crying out for not partial measures, but full, complete, adequate measures.'\nMatt Lee-Ashley, chief of staff for the Council on Environmental Quality, said the Biden administration is using a 'more inclusive definition of conservation than strictly looking at protected areas' but added the work is not yet complete and the administration is open to feedback. The White House said the current atlas is in 'a beta version.'\n'We have a lot of work yet to do to develop the data and information needed' for more precise estimates, Lee-Ashley said.\nSewell said he was grateful the administration is 'open to listening to our view that they need a more accurate protective number.'\nJohn Hocevar, oceans campaign director at Greenpeace USA, warned that claiming that a third of U.S. waters are already protected is 'a huge mistake because we are definitely not there.' He worries about the example the United States may set for other countries as they try to meet their own conservation goals.\nAdvertisement\nBiden's 30 percent conservation goal, dubbed '30x30,' comes in tandem with international efforts to protect nearly a third of land and oceans globally as a refuge for the planet's wild plants and animals in the face of a growing extinction crisis.\n'It's bad enough to mislead the United States public with creative accounting,' Hocevar said. 'But this also risks opening a door for other countries to try to get away with similar shenanigans.'\nMarine ecosystems upon which people depend on for food face a multitude of threats, including rising temperatures, acidifying waters and growing waves of plastic debris.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Dino Grandoni","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JD4BTNIM5XLMNBL5UTHT54UPJA.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.641547,"_id":"dafdd4d2f3615cf7536b127433198e56"},{"title":"Religious Republicans' power grows as religion shrinks","author":"Perry Bacon Jr.","published_date":"2024-04-16 11:30:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/16/religion-politics-republicans-abortion-trump","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Here's why the religious right remains a potent force even as it grows smaller.","summary":"Former president Donald Trump's struggle to find a position on abortion that appeases religious activists in his party without offending more moderate and secular voters is perhaps the clearest example of one of the most important tensions in American politics today: Religion is declining in America overall but in some ways becoming an even more important force within the Republican Party . We have less religion but still very religiously influenced politics.\nwithin the Republican Party. We have less religion but still very religiously influenced politics.\nYou've no doubt read articles over the past two decades about the declining numbers of Christian Americans and the growing contingent who have no religious affiliation. And that's not just a story of Democrats and liberals leaving faith. The number of Republicans who attend church weekly and consider religion a core part of their lives is also shrinking.\nYet many policies enacted by local, state and federal Republican elected officials and conservative judges are straight from the religious right's agenda: vouchers and other initiatives to make it easier for parents to send their children to religious schools; limits on reproductive rights that ban abortion and could even threaten in vitro fertilization; restrictions on gay and particularly transgender Americans; provisions allowing religious Americans to cite their faith in declining to participate in various activities, such as getting vaccinated.\nAdvertisement\nLouisiana's House of Representatives last week passed a bill requiring the state's public schools and universities to display the Ten Commandments. Trump is promising to create a federal task force to root out what he describes as 'anti-Christian bias' in America. Some Republican operatives likely to play major roles in a second Trump term have openly stated that they believe government policies should be shaped in accordance with Christianity.\nFollow this author Perry Bacon Jr. 's opinions\nFollow this author\nPerry Bacon Jr.\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nHow are these trends \u2014 a secularizing America, a party increasingly tied to its religious wing \u2014 happening at once? In some ways, they are causal. Many Americans on the political left and center say they stopped identifying themselves as Christians in part because of the faith's vocal conservative bloc, particularly its anti-LGBTQ+ agenda. On the flip side, Robert P. Jones, founder of the Public Religion Research Institute (now known as PRRI), argues White Christians have become more radical in their policy goals and more deeply embedded in the Republican Party because of their alarm at how quickly America is becoming more racially diverse and secular.\nBut with a growing number of Republicans saying they aren't Christian or religious, another explanation is important: internal party politics. Polls suggest there are many Republican voters who would prefer a GOP that wasn't trying to make abortions impossible and ban books written by LGBTQ+ authors from public schools and libraries.\nRepublicans saying they aren't Christian or religious, another explanation is important: internal party politics. Polls suggest there are many Republican voters who would prefer a GOP that wasn't trying to make abortions impossible and ban books written by LGBTQ+ authors from public schools and libraries.\nAdvertisement\nBut those Republicans aren't organized into well-funded activist groups working at the local, state and federal levels. And the portion of the party wary of the religious right overwhelmingly falls in line and backs GOP candidates in general elections, even if those candidates have adopted the religious right's agenda.\nIn contrast, the party's religious bloc defends its priorities fiercely \u2014 and in moral terms. Groups such as the Family Research Council and the Alliance Defending Freedom are constantly pushing bills in state legislatures and filing lawsuits. They are creative and relentless in exploring methods to execute their agenda, such as their effort to get a future Republican president to invoke a once-obscure law from 1873 (the Comstock Act) to limit abortion.\nThose on the religious right argue that abortion, same-sex marriage, people changing their gender identities and other actions condoned by liberals are violations of core religious tenets. So they aren't willing to set aside those views just because they poll badly. It's hard for nonreligious Republicans to win intraparty arguments when the religious bloc is speaking with such passion.\nAdvertisement\nSo while America and even the Republican electorate is significantly less religious than in Ronald Reagan's or George W. Bush's heyday, the GOP is still dominated by the same two groups that have controlled it for decades: wealthy individuals and businesses who donate millions to conservative organizations and Republican campaigns because they want to keep taxes low and regulations limited; and religious groups that want to keep American culture conservative.\nOf course, the religious right has changed over time. Though the term 'evangelical' once described religious conservatives of prior eras, it was more precisely a movement led by White, male Southern Baptist leaders and activists. Today's religious right has a bigger role for Catholics, women and people of color, as well as Protestants who aren't Southern Baptists, including Pentecostals and those from America's growing ranks of nondenominational churches. (This is why I use the term 'religious right' rather than, say, 'Christian nationalists' or 'evangelicals.' There are many Christians who argue that the religious right's stances are a perversion of the faith. The exact meanings of 'Christian nationalism' and 'evangelicalism' are contested, but everyone agrees there is a bloc on the right that claims to be acting out of religious beliefs.)\nNevertheless, winning Republican primaries still requires courting both the party's business and religious wings. The former provides money for a campaign; the other voters and local organizers.\nAdvertisement\nThese two groups have an informal d\u00e9tente. Wealthy conservatives who are more interested in keeping taxes low don't trash the party's religious conservatives for being focused on abortion and school vouchers. And the religious conservatives go along with tax cuts for the wealthy.\nTrump is beholden to religious conservatives, too. The business wing of the party tried to break with him after the 2020 election and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, spending much of the past three years trying to elevate other potential Republican presidential nominees, particularly Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. But Trump's strong support among religious voters helped him easily win the Republican primaries this year.\nFor the general election, Trump's attempts to distance himself from recent antiabortion rulings from conservative judges in Arizona and Florida show he understands the problem: The religious right's agenda might be unacceptable to the rest of the country.\nAdvertisement","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Perry Bacon Jr.","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JNJIMEWDPYI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.416912,"_id":"235e951307a61e3e878b109fa61294e2"},{"title":"The U.S. just changed how it manages a tenth of its land","author":"Maxine Joselow","published_date":"2024-04-18 17:30:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/04/18/biden-public-lands-conservation-rule","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The Interior Department finalized a rule that puts conservation on equal footing with mining, grazing and drilling on public lands across the country.","summary":"For decades, the federal government has prioritized oil and gas drilling, hardrock mining and livestock grazing on public lands across the country. That could soon change under a far-reaching Interior Department rule that puts conservation, recreation and renewable energy development on equal footing with resource extraction.\nThe final rule released Thursday represents a seismic shift in the management of roughly 245 million acres of public property \u2014 about one-tenth of the nation's land mass. It is expected to draw praise from conservationists and legal challenges from fossil fuel industry groups and Republican officials, some of whom have lambasted the move as a 'land grab.'\nInterior's Bureau of Land Management, known as the nation's largest landlord, has long offered leases to oil and gas companies, mining firms and ranchers. Now, for the first time, the nearly 80-year-old agency will auction off 'restoration leases' and 'mitigation leases' to entities with plans to restore or conserve public lands.\nAdvertisement\n'Today's final rule helps restore balance to our public lands as we continue using the best-available science to restore habitats, guide strategic and responsible development, and sustain our public lands for generations to come,' Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement.\nUnder President Biden, the BLM has put a greater emphasis on protecting public lands from the twin threats of climate change and development. Tracy Stone-Manning, the bureau's director, has warned that hotter, drier climates are driving longer and more intense wildfires and drought across the American West. At the same time, development has fragmented and destroyed wildlife habitat and migratory corridors.\n'We oversee 245 million acres, and every land manager will tell you that climate change is already happening. It's already impacting our public lands,' Stone-Manning said during a Washington Post Live event last year. 'We see it in pretty obvious ways, through unprecedented wildfires.'\nAdvertisement\nThe fossil fuel industry, a frequent foe of the Biden administration, has chaffed at the BLM's approach. It has called the public lands rule an example of regulatory overreach that will stifle domestic energy production, even as the United States pumps more oil than any nation in history.\nKathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, which represents oil and gas companies, said the group plans to challenge the BLM rule in court. She said the policy appears to violate the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the 1976 law that tasked the bureau with overseeing 'multiple uses' of public lands for current and future generations.\n'We have no choice but to litigate,' Sgamma said. 'These conservation leases seem to be designed to preclude energy development on federal lands.'\nThe BLM's proposed rule released last year sparked especially intense outrage in Wyoming, an energy powerhouse that accounts for nearly one-tenth of U.S. fossil fuel production. Some Wyoming Republicans have claimed that the BLM is colluding with liberal environmental groups to put millions of acres off-limits to development \u2014 and to push a form of imperialism.\nAdvertisement\n'It does seem to me this is a very top-down, Washington-centric approach that has kind of cut the legs out from the local people,' Gov. Mark Gordon (R) told The Post last year. 'Unfortunately, Wyoming finds itself imposed upon by these colonial forces of national environmental groups who are pushing an agenda onto Wyoming.'\nAaron Weiss, deputy director of the Center for Western Priorities, an advocacy group, said some Republican officials have spread 'disinformation and the conspiracy theories' about the rule. He noted that during a House Natural Resources Committee hearing last year, South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem (R) claimed the draft rule would allow Chinese citizens to purchase leases on U.S. lands.\nUnlike the proposed rule, the final rule clarifies that 'leases cannot be held by foreign persons.' It also offers 'restoration leases' and 'mitigation leases' rather than 'conservation leases' \u2014 a linguistic tweak that seems designed to skirt the politicization of the word 'conservation,' Weiss said.\nAdvertisement\nMitigation leases will allow lease holders to offset the impact of their activities. For example, a rancher whose cattle grazing is degrading the land could be required to purchase a mitigation lease during the permitting process. The rancher could then work with a local conservation group to restore nearby habitat for the greater sage grouse, an imperiled bird of the West.\nto offset the impact of their activities. For example, a rancher whose cattle grazing is degrading the land could be required to purchase a mitigation lease during the permitting process. The rancher could then work with a local conservation group to restore nearby habitat for the greater sage grouse, an imperiled bird of the West.\nThe final rule also directs the BLM to prioritize landscape health for the first time and to incorporate Indigenous knowledge into its decision-making. The latter is a top priority of Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary and lead a department that once oversaw the removal of Indigenous people from their land.\nThe Trump administration took a vastly different approach to managing public lands than Biden officials. President Donald Trump briefly moved the BLM's headquarters from Washington to Grand Junction, Colo., a hot spot for natural gas production. More than 87 percent of the affected employees either resigned or retired rather than move to Colorado, depriving the agency of expertise and disrupting its operations.\nTo lead the BLM, Trump tapped William Perry Pendley, a conservative lawyer who had previously advocated for selling off public lands across the country. Pendley, who was never confirmed by the Senate, pushed the bureau to maximize oil, gas and mineral development.\ntapped William Perry Pendley, a conservative lawyer who had previously advocated for selling off public lands across the country.

But, she added, 'I'm frankly not going to let them get off the hook.'\nTraditionally, former British prime ministers keep quiet for an extended period after leaving office. Not Truss. In her grandly titled tome 'Ten Years to Save the West' \u2014 which is being released on Tuesday \u2014 the former prime minister defends her actions, excoriates her many critics and offers her prescription for a better world.\nAdvertisement\nHer ideas include abolishing the United Nations and backing Donald Trump for reelection \u2014 a departure from the convention that senior British politicians stay out of U.S. elections.\n'I believe that we need a strong America,' Truss told the BBC, adding that 'the world was safer' when Trump was president.\n'I think that our opponents feared the Trump presidency more than they fear the Democrats being in office,' she said.\nTim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, said Truss' media onslaught 'confirms her transformation into a radical right-wing populist.'\nTruss became prime minister in September 2022 when she was elected by the governing Conservative Party to replace Boris Johnson after he was toppled by scandals.\nHer promise to spur economic growth with tax cuts and deregulation enthused Tory members, but a budget containing 45 billion pounds ($54 billion) in unfunded tax cuts rocked the financial markets, drove up the cost of government borrowing and sent the pound to its lowest-ever level against the dollar.\nAdvertisement\nThe Bank of England had to step in to prop up the bond market and prevent a wider economic meltdown.

The salad leaf won, and the nickname 'Lettuce Liz' was born.\nIn October 2022, Truss resigned and was replaced by Rishi Sunak, the rival she'd defeated just a couple of months earlier.\nTruss has found plenty of other people to blame. She said that the central bank had kept interest rates too low, while the Office for Budget Responsibility \u2014 which provides the government with economic forecasts \u2014 had failed to warn her that British pension funds were heavily exposed to interest-rate fluctuations.\nAdvertisement\nShe is calling for the OBR to be abolished and for Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey to resign.\nOpposition parties are incredulous \u2014 though also quietly pleased that Truss has popped up to remind voters of the mayhem the Conservative Party has presided over. A national election is due to be held later this year.\n'Liz Truss blaming others for the economic chaos she caused will just add insult to injury for families suffering from soaring mortgage costs,' said Liberal Democrat economy spokeswoman Sarah Olney.\nGiven ample airtime this week to expound on her political views, Truss has railed against 'extremist environmentalist dogma and wokeism' and said Britain's institutions 'have been captured by leftist ideas.'\nHer targets include judges who have disagreed with government decisions. Truss wants to abolish the U.K.'s Supreme Court and let the government appoint the judiciary.\nAdvertisement\nShe's also called for the abolition of Britain's Human Rights Act and urged the United Kingdom to leave the European Convention on Human Rights. She also wants to ax the U.N, whose security council, she told the BBC, is 'positively damaging.'\nBale, author of 'The Conservative Party After Brexit: Turmoil and Transformation,' said Truss is 'a human hand grenade at the moment that the Conservative Party can't seem to bury or defuse.'\nTruss, 48, remains a lawmaker, and plans to run for reelection. She has a good chance of holding on to her seat, even if the Conservatives are defeated nationwide, as polls suggest they will.\nShe does not rule out running for the party leadership again.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jill Lawless","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ENOQMJH374I65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.100374,"_id":"6a6aec50bed469ca53cfd76c4577a456"},{"title":"Book review: \u2018Coming Out Republican' by Neil J.

Young's 'Coming Out Republican' offers the history of a movement that may not have actually been that influential.","summary":"History may be written by the victors, but Neil J. Young's excellent new book, 'Coming Out Republican,' is a sympathetic look at one of the past century's losers: the gay conservative. Young, a historian by training, has spent his career explaining the heterogeneity of the conservative movement. His first book, 'We Gather Together,' was about the alliances and rivalries among Catholics, Mormons and evangelicals that birthed the Christian right, and Young has written about religion and politics for the New York Times and CNN.\n'Coming Out Republican' moves from the 1950s to the present, telling the stories of the closeted operators and buttoned-up political clubs that often served as the Myrtle Wilson to the Christian right's Daisy Buchanan, their sense of entitlement out of proportion to the way their supposed allies treated them. Sometimes these gay men acted gallantly to expand the individual freedoms of their queer countrymen. But there are also many instances in the book of them selling out the other civil rights movements in whose wake they traveled. 'Coming Out Republican' is less about an interest group than a self-interest group, one that has long been unable to envision a liberation project more ambitious than expanding the sexual prerogatives of White men.\nmoves from the 1950s to the present, telling the stories of the closeted operators and buttoned-up political clubs that often served as the Myrtle Wilson to the Christian right's Daisy Buchanan, their sense of entitlement out of proportion to the way their supposed allies treated them. Sometimes these gay men acted gallantly to expand the individual freedoms of their queer countrymen. But there are also many instances in the book of them selling out the other civil rights movements in whose wake they traveled. 'Coming Out Republican' is less about an interest group than a self-interest group, one that has long been unable to envision a liberation project more ambitious than expanding the sexual prerogatives of White men.\n'Coming Out Republican' is at its best when using profiles of individual men to depict the eras in which they lived. Leonard Matlovich, a Vietnam War hero, came out in 1975 and sued the federal government to reenlist after he was kicked out of the military. Conservative and macho, Matlovich claimed that 'everything I am and everything I hope to be I owe to the United States Air Force.' He relied on Frank Kameny, of the gay advocacy group the Mattachine Society, and a lawyer from the ACLU to sue on his behalf. Appearing on the cover of Time magazine, he had a dark mustache from central casting, but he was an imperfect poster boy, all-American but naive about gay life. He once bashfully asked a reporter from the Advocate \u2014 an eminent gay magazine \u2014 what the publication was.\nAdvertisement\nIn his study of Matlovich, Young deftly, if a little dryly, parses the cross currents of imperialism, respectability and internecine gay resentment. His prose is at times as vanilla as the men he writes about, relying on ventriloquism of vulgar gay patois for color. In other illuminating sketches, we meet figures such as Jon Hinson, the Bible-thumping congressman from Mississippi who resigned after getting caught performing oral sex on a Black Library of Congress technician in a bathroom in the Capitol, and Terry Dolan, Ronald Reagan's whiz kid pollster who bragged about purging moderates from Congress, bulldozing a path for the Christian right's ascension in the 1980s. They are but two of the legions of closeted Republicans who believed in privacy for a man's sex life but not, among other things, a woman's right to an abortion. Young takes so much care describing the different ways Matlovich, Hinson and Dolan conceived of themselves, and the roles they played in the politics of their era, that their deaths feel like a gut-punch. Each one died of AIDS.\nLess successful are Young's sections on gay Republican groups \u2014 the Log Cabin Republicans, the Teddy Roosevelt Republican Club, the Lincoln Republican Club, Concerned Republicans for Individual Rights, GOProud \u2014 whose sheer number of names reflects how often they split off from one another. Most of the book's colorful characters were better at acting out and working covertly than they were at building large coalitions, so the stakes of their collective action \u2014 like persuading a few thousand San Francisco Republicans to oppose a California ballot initiative \u2014 feel low.\nYoung also has the credulous habit of, for example, describing a group whose membership 'doubled that year to over 150' and citing the growth as evidence of its strength, when such crowds would barely match a modest gay bar's Saturday night or a Baptist church's Sunday services. In instances when gay Republican groups have wielded influence in a decisive way \u2014 say, by whipping up a handful of votes to pass civil rights protections in the California legislature and marriage equality in the New York legislature \u2014 it is not because they had power that could not be ignored. It is because in the eyes of Republican lawmakers in very liberal states, gay Republicans could, like a mistress that doesn't ask or expect too much, be indulged from time to time.\nBut that's state politics. At the national level, gay Republicans have been betrayed and insulted by every Republican presidential candidate since Reagan. In 1980, they had reasons for optimism. Despite Reagan's conservative bona fides, two years earlier he helped defeat a California referendum that would have barred gay people from teaching in public schools. But as president, his embrace of the religious right was so close, and his administration's antipathy for people with AIDS so pronounced, that it further stained the Republican Party's reputation with gay people. George H.W. Bush ran as a moderate and even signed gay-friendly legislation like the Ryan White Care Act and the Americans With Disabilities Act before abandoning tolerance to court the religious right. Less than a decade after he left office, his son campaigned as a compassionate conservative, and then ran for reelection supporting a constitutional amendment to forbid same-sex marriage. Donald Trump also seemed to embrace LGBTQ people as he campaigned for the 2016 election, but as president he nominated judges hostile to LGBTQ rights and supported policies that made it easier for people claiming religious exemptions to discriminate against sexual minorities.\nAdvertisement\nYoung makes a persuasive case that gay Republicans contributed to the civil rights progress of the last few decades. Intellectuals like Andrew Sullivan and operators like Ken Mehlman, who ran George W. Bush's 2004 campaign from the closet, contributed to the push for marriage equality and military participation. But neither man \u2014 or really any conservative advocate \u2014 did nearly as much as Evan Wolfson, the Lambda Legal lawyer, who articulated the intellectual foundations of same-sex marriage and executed the political strategy to make it a reality. The simple fact is that liberal gays have been more clear-eyed about power than their conservative counterparts, better at building coalitions and more wary of placating the Christian conservatives who do not believe there is a place for sexual minorities in public life.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nYoung could have more forcefully thought through the reluctance of gay Republicans to find common cause with members of other minority groups. The obvious answer is the most uncomfortable one: Gay Republicans see themselves as having more in common with other White people, rich people and men. Unfortunately, the only way that the numerically few can wield power is through solidarity with other minorities, but that requires insight that does not always come easily to White gay men, especially conservative White gay men: None of us is that special, and trying to be 'not that kind of gay' comes at a cost. One of the most heartbreaking themes of 'Coming Out Republican' is how unfamiliar many conservative gays are with the varying joys of gay life \u2014 writing it off as too 'PC' or too promiscuous. Being gay can be quite fun, not despite but because of our endless squabbles and struggles over how to keep this life distinct and ours, and open to as many people as want to partake.\nAnyone could benefit from reading this book. Straight people will learn how the puritanical impulse to control other people's ' sex lives has defined politics for nearly a century, an impulse as old as it is futile. Queer people \u2014 who often must teach ourselves our own history \u2014 will learn how respectability remains an empty promise. But it is gay Republicans themselves who most need to read Young's book. If they are not too vain, the Peter Thiels and George Santoses of the world might find in these pages a warning that having power is not the same thing as being tolerated until you are no longer useful.\nNathan Kohrman is a writer covering medicine, politics and culture.

We cannot allow Vladimir Putin to roll through another country and take it,' he said about the Russian president's invasion of Ukraine. 'These are very serious matters with global implications.'\nAdvertisement\nAfter months of delay, the House worked slowly but deliberately once Johnson made up his mind this week to plough ahead. President Joe Biden sent a swift endorsement of the speaker's plan and, in a rare moment, Donald Trump, the Republican presumed presidential nominee who opposes most overseas aid for Ukraine, has not derailed the speaker's work.\n'The world is watching what the Congress does,' the White House said in a statement. 'Passing this legislation would send a powerful message about the strength of American leadership at a pivotal moment.'\nIn an extremely rare step, the members of the House Rules Committee joined forces late Thursday in a near midnight vote, the four Democrats giving their support on a procedural step, to push past the Republican majority's three hardline holdouts to send the package to the House floor for debate on a 9-3 vote. It was a moment unseen in recent House memory.\nAdvertisement\nJohnson will need to rely on Democrats again Friday to clear the next procedural vote and turn back amendments Republicans have offered that could kill the package. One from hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene would reduce spending for Ukraine to zero.\nGreene has filed the 'motion to vacate' the speaker from office, and has drawn at least one other Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky as a co-sponsor. It could launch a bid to evict Johnson from the speaker's office, should she call it up for a vote, much the way Republicans booted Kevin McCarthy from the position last fall.\nWith one of the most narrow House majorities in modern times, Johnson can only afford to lose a single vote or two from his Republican ranks to pass any bill. That dynamic has thrust him into the arms of Democrats as he searches for votes to pass the package.\nAdvertisement\nWithout his Republican majority fully behind him, Johnson cannot shape the package as the ultra-conservatives demand lest he lose Democratic backing. It has forced him to leave behind tough security measures to clamp down on migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border and other priorities.\nAt best, Johnson has been able to carve up a Senate-passed version of the bill into separate parts, as is the preference among House Republicans, and the final votes will be on distinct measures \u2014 for Ukraine, Israel and Indo-Pacific allies.\nThe package would also include a fourth provision that includes many Republican priorities that Democrats endorse, or at least are willing to accept. Those include proposals that allow the U.S. to seize frozen Russian central bank assets to rebuild Ukraine; impose sanctions on Iran, Russia, China and criminal organizations that traffic fentanyl, and potentially ban the video app TikTok if its China-based owner doesn't sell its stake within a year.\nAdvertisement\nPassing each bill, in votes expected Saturday, will require Johnson to form complicated bipartisan coalitions on each, with Democrats for example ensuring Ukraine aid is approved, but some left-leaning progressives refusing to back military aid for Israel over the destruction of Gaza.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Lisa Mascaro,Stephen Groves,Kevin Freking","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EZISKPX6LEI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.732296,"_id":"39582bf6fef670ac0154996a1c7ab279"},{"title":"Croatia's conservative PM convinced his party will soon form a new majority after inconclusive vote","author":"Darko Bandic","published_date":"2024-04-18 13:11:11","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/04/18/croatia-election-european-union-plenkovic-government/2008fd70-fd85-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Croatia's ruling conservatives says that talks are already underway on the formation of a new governing majority following a highly contested parliamentary election that saw a far-right party emerge\u2026","summary":"ZAGREB, Croatia \u2014 Croatia 's ruling conservatives said Thursday that talks have already started about the formation of a new governing majority following a highly contested parliamentary election that saw a far-right party emerge as a potential kingmaker.\nPrime Minister Andrej Plenkovi\u0107, who is the leader of the Croatian Democratic Union party, or HDZ, said that the party has contacted some of the potential future partners and more talks will take place on Thursday.\nPreliminary results of the vote on Wednesday showed that Plenkovi\u0107's HDZ won 61 seats in the 151-seat parliament, which means the party has to form a coalition government to stay in power.\nThe main opponent, center-left Social Democratic Party, backed by President Zoran Milanovi\u0107, got 42 seats while the far-right Homeland Movement was third, with 14 seats, according to the tally released by the State Election Commission.\nAdvertisement\nPlenkovi\u0107 offered no details about the potential future alliance.

Once thought to be extinct, today's wild ferret population descends from just seven individuals, representing a severe lack of genetic diversity that threatens the long-term survival of the species.\nNow with these two new black-masked balls of fuzz added to the mix, conservationists hope to begin breeding the two females later this year to inject some new blood into the population.\nAdvertisement\n'Genetic diversity is critical for resilience to environmental change,' said Megan Owen, vice president of conservation science at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, one of Fish and Wildlife's partners in the cloning effort. 'It's basically the raw material of adaptive evolution.'\nWith hundreds of thousands of plants and animals at risk of extinction, scientists and policymakers are increasingly turning to extraordinary technological means to rescue sea stars, songbirds and other species near the edge of oblivion.\nUp to a million black-footed ferrets once romped across the mountain basins and grasslands of a dozen states before farming, diseases such as the plague and the eradication of their prey, the prairie dog, caused their numbers to plummet. In 1979, what was believed to be the last black-footed ferret died in captivity.\nAdvertisement\nOr so people thought. In 1981, a Wyoming cattle rancher stumbled upon a small group of black-footed ferrets. Brought into captivity, biologists began breeding them again but only had a handful of individuals with which to work.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'Conservationists have worked very hard to bring them back,' said Ben Novak, lead scientist at the biotechnology nonprofit Revive & Restore, which also partnered with Fish and Wildlife on the cloning project. 'They're doing a very good job. But due to that historic bottleneck in the '80s for black-footed ferrets, they just have an extremely limited gene pool.'\nOne of the female ferrets, named Willa, didn't leave any living descendants. So in 1988, scientists collected some of her cells and froze them at San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, where the genetic material of some 1,200 species are kept on ice in its 'Frozen Zoo.'\nAdvertisement\nThe first of Willa's clones was born in 2020. Initially, that ferret, named Elizabeth Ann, appeared healthy. But she never took interest in the suitors presented to her. 'She didn't like the males, and she didn't even let them into her tunnel,' Novak said. 'She bit one of them on the nose.'\nWhen her handlers tried to artificially inseminate her, there was another problem: part of her uterus was filled with fluid, requiring a hysterectomy. Elizabeth Ann is still alive and kicking, but can't give birth. Agency officials don't think her health problems are linked to cloning since the condition can occur in naturally born ferrets, too.\nNow Noreen and Antonia, both born last May, represent a second attempt at reviving Willa's genetically distinct lineage. The cloned animals were made by injecting one of Willa's cells into an egg from a domesticated ferret.\nNoreen was born at the National Black-footed Ferret Conservation Center in Colorado while Antonia lives across the country at the Smithsonian's National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute in Virginia.\nAdvertisement\nWhile officials don't plan to release the clones into the wild anytime soon, conservationists have reintroduced other black-footed ferrets across the Great Plains. But to sustain those populations, wildlife managers regularly apply insecticide to kill plague-carrying fleas and take other measures to control the deadly disease.\nRight now, Noreen and Antonia are feisty and appear healthy. As the pair near their first birthday in May, officials hope to start breeding them later this year.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Dino Grandoni","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7XUKN3AQ7CPCFQQVN73ECPCXD4.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.294046,"_id":"7cd3401eef2d2966372b700e9b767de7"},{"title":"How humans are hurting Africa's wildebeests","author":"Erin Blakemore","published_date":"2024-04-21 10:30:14","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/04/21/fences-human-wildebest-gnu-migration","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Fences and other structures interfere with wildebeests' migration, weakening 'their chances of long-term survival,' a lead scientist on a new study said.","summary":"Massive migrations of wildebeests have fallen in recent years, casualties of human-built fences, roads and cities.

Now, analysis of the magnificent animals' genomes reveals that those barriers are likely to be affecting the genetic diversity of populations blocked from migrating.\nAlso known as gnus, wildebeests are a type of antelope. There are two species: blue wildebeests, native to southern and eastern Africa, and black wildebeests, found in southern Africa.\nBlue wildebeests are abundant and migratory, traveling en masse during huge annual migrations. But black wildebeests are much less abundant; by the early 20th century, just a few hundred remained because of overhunting. They no longer migrate and have a much smaller range than the one they historically occupied, likely a consequence of both hunting and conservation efforts that confined them to game reserves. Nonetheless, conservation has increased their numbers in recent years.\nAdvertisement\nThe new study, published in Nature Communications, looked at the genomes of 121 blue and 22 black wildebeests. The analysis revealed that though the two species probably mixed during the late Pleistocene, between about 129,000 and 11,700 years ago, they have distinct genetic structures and do not now interbreed in large numbers.\nThe analysis also compared the genes of blue wildebeests that migrate and those in regions where migration has been blocked by human-built infrastructure. The migratory blue wildebeests had more genetic diversity, less inbreeding and signs pointing to larger population sizes compared with non-migrating blue wildebeests.\n'No one ever knew that [disruptions in migration] affected the genetics of wildebeest,' Rasmus Heller, an associate professor in the University of Copenhagen's biology department and one of the study's lead authors, said in a news release. 'But our results clearly show that wildebeest populations which no longer migrate, but have historically done so, are simply less genetically healthy than those that continue to migrate. And this weakens their chances of long-term survival.'\nTo better protect wildebeests, the researchers write, migration routes should be maintained and wildlife managers should consider the potential pitfalls of building infrastructure in important migration areas like the Serengeti-Mara. Other migratory ungulates \u2014 hoofed mammals \u2014 may be affected in similar ways, they warn.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Erin Blakemore","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JF56F72GIZCZAGSF7B6L75YEGI.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.2487693,"_id":"e68f345153270bb631261ca6f697d8fc"},{"title":"Smartmatic and OANN settle lawsuit over 2020 coverage","author":"Jeremy Barr","published_date":"2024-04-16 18:46:42","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/04/16/smartmatic-oann-one-america-news-network-lawsuit-settlement","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The voting technology company still has ongoing cases against other media, including Fox News Channel.","summary":"The voting technology company Smartmatic agreed Tuesday to settle its lawsuit against the conservative cable television network One America News over its coverage of the 2020 election.\nThe terms of the settlement, including any compensation involved, were not announced.\n'Smartmatic has resolved its litigation against OANN through a confidential settlement,' Smartmatic's lead attorney, J.

But there are also a few differences with the Senate bill designed to win over some House conservatives.\nHere's a look at what is in the bills that Johnson hopes to pass by this weekend.\nUKRAINE\nThe aid to support Ukraine totals about $61 billion. Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee said that more than a third of that amount would be dedicated to replenishing weapons and ammunition systems for the U.S. military.\nThe overall amount of money provided to Ukraine for the purchase of weapons from the U.S. is roughly the same in the House and Senate bills \u2014 $13.8 billion.\nAdvertisement\nThe main difference between the two packages is that the House bill provides more than $9 billion in economic assistance to Ukraine in the form of 'forgivable loans.' The Senate bill included no such provision seeking repayment.\nThe president would be authorized to set the terms of the loan to Ukraine and also be given the power to cancel it. Congress could override the cancellation but would have to generate enough votes to override a veto, a high bar considering how the two chambers are so evenly divided.\nJohnson, as he seeks GOP support for the package, noted that former President Donald Trump has endorsed a 'loan concept.'\nHe also noted that the House package includes a requirement for the Biden administration to provide a plan and a strategy to Congress for what it seeks to achieve in Ukraine. The plan would be required within 45 days of the bill being signed into law. House Republicans frequently complain that they have yet to see a strategy from Biden for winning the war.\nAdvertisement\nThe bill said the report from the administration must be a multiyear plan that spells out 'specific and achievable objectives.' It also asked for an estimate of the resources required to achieve the U.S. objectives and a description of the national security implications if the objectives are not met.\nISRAEL\nAid in the legislation to support Israel and provide humanitarian relief to citizens of Gaza comes to more than $26 billion. The amount of money dedicated to replenishing Israel's missile defense systems totals about $4 billion in the House and Senate bills. An additional $2.4 billion for current U.S. military operations in the regions is also the same in both bills.\nSome conservatives have been critical of the aid for Gaza. At the end of the day, though, Johnson risked losing critical Democratic support for the package if Republicans had excluded it. The humanitarian assistance comes to more than $9 billion for Gaza, where millions of Palestinians face starvation, lack of clean water and disease outbreaks.\nINDO-PACIFIC","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Kevin Freking","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GBTLSCX5BUI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.0997314,"_id":"1b9333b74ddc07b53a951be55c99960b"},{"title":"Having remade Twitter, Musk takes his speech fight global","author":"Elizabeth Dwoskin","published_date":"2024-04-18 10:00:04","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/18/musk-moraes-brazil-free-speech","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The X owner's dispute over disinformation with a Brazilian judge could influence social media use everywhere.","summary":"SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 To Elon Musk, the Brazilian Supreme Court justice is a 'dictator.'\nIn the justice's view, Musk is allowing his social media platform to support the 'digital militias' that are using disinformation to threaten democracy.\nTogether, they're making this South American nation the battleground for the global debate on free speech and fake news, a dispute that could affect how people everywhere communicate information, ideas and opinions online.\nOn one side, there's Alexandre de Moraes, one of the world's most aggressive prosecutors of disinformation.

Jan. 6, 2021, had been a breaking point. He thought about not voting for president. Or writing someone in, as he'd done in 2016. Then, on March 25, the United States abstained from vetoing a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. Three days later, Levine was at his keyboard typing an email to 1,600 of his contacts.\nAdvertisement\nSubject line: 'NEVER SAY NEVER; WHY I WILL VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP.'\n'I remain concerned about Trump's relationship with the truth,' Levine wrote in the email.

The question becomes: as between the two, who will leave a better, safer, and more prosperous America for my grandchildren? Hands down, the answer is Trump.'\nIn an interview, Levine cited a laundry list of Biden's shortcomings, beyond the U.N. vote, to justify his support of Trump: the 'catastrophic' withdrawal from Afghanistan, 'the open border,' 'failed Bidenomics,' and a 'social justice agenda' that's 'particularly damaging to America's Jews.' And he was upset about how the Biden administration had been trying to use its influence to undermine Israel's military offensive in Gaza.

'And by doing that it created a situation where I think voters thought, \u2018Well, it must not be that he's that dangerous, because if he were, then you would have more people saying so.'' (McCarthy, who's also endorsed Trump, recently explained that visit by saying he just wanted to check up on Trump because 'when something bad happens in your life, everybody abandons you.')\nBut this all really may have started before Jan. 6, says Alyssa Farah Griffin, who worked in Trump's White House and later turned on him.\n'He was smart about consolidating power before he lost the election,' she says. 'He was so entrenched in the RNC, he was so entrenched in the party committees and at the state level, that I think for politicians who care first and foremost about self-preservation, it made it pretty much impossible to walk away from him.'\n'It used to be that Republicans fell in line with whoever the party chose,' Hemmer says.

The plan has been challenged in the courts, and no one has yet been sent to Rwanda under an agreement that has cost the U.K. at least 370 million pounds ($470 million).\nAdvertisement\nIn November, the U.K. Supreme Court ruled that the Rwanda plan was illegal because the nation wasn't a safe destination for asylum-seekers. For decades, human rights groups and governments have documented alleged repression of dissent by Rwanda's government both inside the country and abroad, as well as serious restrictions on internet freedom, assembly and expression.\nIn response to the ruling, Britain and Rwanda signed a treaty pledging to strengthen protections for migrants. Sunak's government argues the treaty allows it to pass a law declaring Rwanda a safe destination.\nThe Safety of Rwanda Bill pronounces the country safe, making it harder for migrants to challenge deportation and allows the British government to ignore injunctions from the European Court of Human Rights that forbid removals.\nAdvertisement\nHuman rights groups, refugee charities, senior Church of England clerics and many legal experts have criticized the legislation.

But it's also being held up by conservative activists intent on dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, who say it will give them added firepower to quash workplace programs reserved for minorities, women and other underrepresented groups.\nAmerica First Legal, which has filed more than a dozen complaints over DEI policies at such companies as McDonald's, Morgan Stanley and the National Football League, is already factoring the ruling into its strategy, according to general counsel Gene Hamilton. The nonprofit, founded by a former White House adviser to Donald Trump, will be 'citing this decision in cases as we continue to dismantle so-called DEI programs, which almost always overtly discriminate against American citizens based on their race and sex,' he said.\nBut civil rights groups such as American Civil Liberties Union dismissed such interpretations as fearmongering with no grounding in law. 'These scare-tactics are trying to chill employers' commitment and investment in expanding workplace opportunity,' Ming-Qi Chu, deputy director of the ACLU's Women's Rights Project, said in a statement following the decision. 'We won't let them.'\nAdvertisement\nThe split screen on Muldrow v. City of St. Louis parallels the partisan divide over DEI and affirmative action programs in business, government and academia.

City of St. Louis parallels the partisan divide over DEI and affirmative action programs in business, government and academia. Proponents contend such initiatives are necessary to foster diversity and reach groups that historically have been denied advancement or locked out altogether. Critics contend they discriminate against White people and men, and are designed to advance a liberal worldview.\nTensions have only intensified since the Supreme Court struck down the use of race-conscious college admissions last June, overturning more than four decades of precedent. Soon after, Harvard's first Black president resigned amid plagiarism allegations and her much-criticized comments about antisemitism on campus \u2014 an event that conservatives cast as a win against DEI. Moreover, legal challenges have been lobbed against multiple federal and state government diversity programs, forcing some to open their services to people of all racial backgrounds.\nBut the case of Jatonya Clayborn Muldrow, a Black woman and a longtime veteran of the St. Louis Police Department, drew particular attention from employment attorneys and DEI experts, who viewed it as a potential flash point in the legal battle over diversity efforts.\nAdvertisement\nMuldrow sued the department in 2018, alleging that she was transferred to less prestigious role because she was a woman. Though her rank and pay did not change, she alleges the move from an investigative unit to supervising patrol officers resulted in a more haphazard schedule, less prestigious responsibilities and fewer perks. But lower courts dismissed Muldrow's discrimination claims under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, saying they did not amount to 'significant' harm, meaning a lesser title or a loss in salary or benefits.\nThe Supreme Court was asked to consider whether Muldrow and other employees needed to show 'significant harm' to bring a discrimination claim in a job transfer. On Wednesday, the high court ruled 9-0 that it was not necessary to show significant harm, merely 'some harm.'\nLegal experts largely agreed that the ruling lowered the bar for bringing workplace discrimination claims beyond lateral transfers, though views diverged about whether that lower standard would apply to claims against DEI programs. Ahead of the ruling, some DEI proponents feared the justices might well decide that plaintiffs didn't need to show any harm, an outcome they said would leave a slew diversity programs vulnerable to litigants who merely felt the programs discriminated against them.\nAdvertisement\n'This is a narrow decision, and I think for those who are watching this case closely to see how it could affect the legal landscape around DEI programs, this is not the broad decision that DEI opponents were hoping for,' said Lauren Hartz, partner at Jenner & Block and co-chair of the law firm's DEI Protection Task Force. 'I have no doubt they'll look for ways to weaponize the decision in service of their agenda, but they're not going to find a lot of ammunition.'\nBut Andrea Lucas, a commissioner on the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, contends that DEI programs already were vulnerable to challenges and even more susceptible now that the high court has lowered the standard of harm. Lucas, who was appointed to the panel in 2020 by Trump, said that leadership development or training programs that are restricted to certain racial groups are 'high-risk,' especially in light of the high court's ruling this week.\nShe also predicted the ruling could make it easier to challenge a practice known as diverse hiring slates, such as the NFL's Rooney Rule, in which employers require a certain number of job candidates to be from underrepresented backgrounds.\nAdvertisement\n'If a DEI program posed problems before, and continues to, I think [the court's decision] further solidifies the possibility that some will be viably challenged,' Lucas said. 'I don't think the \u2018some harm' standard will be the saving grace for a DEI program.'\nMany attorneys toed the line, explaining that while the ruling does not represent a death knell for DEI practices, it could spark a greater number of challenges to programs previously thought safe.\n'Big picture: a lot of employment decisions that may not have been considered actionable could now be considered actionable,' said Lindsay Burke, a partner at Covington and co-chair of the firm's Employment Practice Group. 'And so plaintiffs of all varieties could bring more claims if they think an employment decision is based on their protected characteristic.'\nAdvertisement\nThat includes employees who believe certain DEI programs discriminate against them, Burke said.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nChallenges to DEI programs under the 1964 Civil Rights Act represent only a portion of those filed in recent months. Conservative activists have also challenged grant and scholarship programs using the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which prohibits discrimination in private contracts. Government programs, meanwhile, have been successfully challenged under the Constitution's equal protection clause, resulting federal programs for minorities being opened to all races, including White people. The Muldrow decision only concerned Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination in employment.\nKenji Yoshino, a professor at New York University and director of the school's Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, said that the impact of the high court's decision this week will take time to take shape.\n'Because it's going to take a lot of litigation to figure out what \u2018some harm' is and how different it is from \u2018significant harm,'' Yoshino said.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Julian Mark","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EPQWIAL3BNZ3NGFPN776VTC6PI_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.5541954,"_id":"a91f5c2d1c3ba3b193702576ecf7e43a"},{"title":"An adored ostrich at a Kansas zoo has died after swallowing a staff member's keys","author":"Associated Press","published_date":"2024-04-22 20:05:05","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2024/04/22/topeka-zoo-ostrich-dies/9c510f24-00e3-11ef-8eac-39c6dcb59eb5_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"A beloved zoo ostrich named Karen has died after swallowing a staff member's keys","summary":"TOPEKA, Kan. \u2014 A beloved ostrich at the Topeka Zoo & Conservation Center in Kansas has died after swallowing a staff member's keys.\nThe zoo announced in a social media post on Friday that the 5-year-old ostrich named Karen had reached beyond her exhibit's fence and grabbed and swallowed the employee's keys.

Those fears have been used to justify bans on medical treatment, preferred pronoun use and access to public facilities for both transgender children and adults. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit said broad political disagreements were irrelevant to the specific reality of 13-year-old Becky Pepper-Jackson in Bridgeport, W.Va.\nNow in eighth grade, Pepper-Jackson has identified as female for five years \u2014 nearly half her life, the court noted. Since elementary school, she has only participated in girls' sports. She has a birth certificate that identifies her as female. And she takes medication to block male puberty and undergo female puberty, which the court said was key to its decision.\nAdvertisement\nPepper-Jackson 'has never felt the effects of increased levels of circulating testosterone,' so 'the fact that those who do benefit from increased strength and speed provides no justification \u2014 much less a substantial one \u2014 for excluding [her] from the girls cross country and track teams,' the judges wrote. To force her to play on a boys' team or not play at all 'would expose [her] to the same risk of unfair competition \u2014 and, in some sports, physical danger \u2014 from which the defendants claim to be shielding cisgender girls,' the court said, as she would be 'sharing the field with boys who are larger, stronger, and faster than her because of the elevated levels of circulating testosterone she lacks.'\nRequiring her to do that violates federal civil rights law, the court said. That does not mean 'we do not hold that government officials are forbidden from creating separate sports teams for boys and girls or that they lack power to police the line drawn between those teams,' the judges added. Nor does it mean that federal law 'requires schools to allow every transgender girl to play on girls teams, regardless of whether they have gone through puberty and experienced elevated levels of circulating testosterone.' Only in Pepper-Jackson's 'particular case' is the ban discriminatory, it said.\nThat does not mean 'we do not hold that government officials are forbidden from creating separate sports teams for boys and girls or that they lack power to police the line drawn between those teams,' the judges added.

Heytens, a Biden appointee, and joined by Judge Pamela Harris, an Obama appointee. Judge G. Steven Agee, an appointee of George W. Bush, dissented and said he 'hope[d] that the Supreme Court will take the opportunity with all deliberate speed to resolve these questions of national importance.'\nAdvertisement\nThe Christian conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom, which backed this law and others restricting trans rights, indicated that an appeal may be coming. The ruling 'undermines equal opportunities and contradicts both biological reality and common sense,' legal counsel Rachel Rouleau said.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nWhat the Supreme Court might do is unclear, despite its conservative slant. On Monday the high court allowed Idaho to enforce a criminal ban on gender-affirming medical treatment for trans minors. But the court also declined last year to let West Virginia's law be enforced while it was being challenged in the 4th Circuit.\nThe 4th Circuit \u2014 which also handles appeals from federal courts in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina \u2014 was once the most conservative appellate court in the country; now it is a trailblazer in the realm of trans rights. It was the first appellate court to recognize a trans student's right to use the bathroom that reflected his gender, a ruling the Supreme Court let stand. It was also the first to label gender dysphoria, or a disconnect between one's gender and assigned sex, as a disability protected under federal law. The court is also considering whether state health plans must cover gender-affirming treatments.\nAdvertisement\nJoshua Block of the ACLU, which represented Pepper-Jackson, said the case was part of 'a string of federal courts ruling against bans on the participation of transgender athletes and in favor of their equal participation as the gender they know themselves to be.' Courts from Arizona to Connecticut have sided with transgender students. While some of those rulings have been put on hold on appeal, he said, no appellate court has ruled against trans athletes on the merits.\nWhile a majority of Americans support laws protecting trans rights in schools and elsewhere, according to a 2023 Washington Post-KFF poll, most also believe trans women and girls should not be allowed to compete in sports with other women and girls and that gender is determined at birth. Republicans have seized on those fissures, supporting laws at the state and federal level that limit trans rights. While there was national outrage in 2016 when North Carolina banned trans people from using the bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity, recent legislation in the state targeting trans minors provoked little reaction. West Virginia passed its law in 2021, declaring that students 'whose biological sex determined at birth is male' cannot compete on girls' teams.\nTrans advocates say the question of who should play women's sports, while politically heated, is blown out of proportion. In Kentucky, a state law similar to the one in West Virginia affected only a single student athlete. Competitive sports leagues have their own rules regarding trans athletes.\nAdvertisement\nWhen she first sued over the ban, Pepper-Jackson said she 'regularly finishes near the back of the pack' in track-and-field. By the time the decision came out, she was placing higher in some events while remaining behind in others. Agee argued that those results were evidence of a biological advantage and of unfairness.

Ron DeSantis has acknowledged that a law he enacted two years ago making it easier for people to challenge books in schools and libraries has caused problems for school districts","summary":"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Two years ago, Democrats repeatedly and forcefully warned Republicans and Gov. Ron DeSantis that a new law making it easier to challenge school books was so broadly worded that it would create havoc across the state.\nNow they can say, 'I told you so.'\nDeSantis backtracked on the 2022 law on Tuesday when he signed a bill narrowing its focus. He blamed liberal activists for abusing the law, not the citizens whose objections to certain books account for the majority of book removals from school libraries and classrooms.\n'The idea that someone can use the parents rights and the curriculum transparency to start objecting to every single book to try to make a mockery of this is just wrong,' DeSantis said the day before the bill signing. 'That's performative. That's political.'\nCoincidentally, PEN America, a group that fights book bans, issued a report Tuesday saying Florida is responsible for 72% of the books that have been pulled from the nation's schools in the first half of the current school year.\nAdvertisement\nThe organization said liberal activists are not the ones who should be blamed for abusing the law.\n'The majority of books that we see being removed are books that talk about LBTQ+ identities, that include characters of color, that talk about race and racism, that include depictions of sexual experiences in the most broadest interpretation of that understanding,' said Kasey Meehan, Pen America's Freedom to Read program director.\nThose challenges are being made by conservative individuals and groups such as Moms For Liberty, Meehan said.\nThe original law allowed any person \u2014 parent or not, district resident or not \u2014 to challenge books as often as they wanted. Once challenged, a book has to be pulled from shelves until the school district resolves the complaint. The new law limits people who don't have students in a school district to one challenge per month.\nAdvertisement\nThe PEN America report says Florida is responsible for 3,135 of the 4,349 school book bans in the United States so far this school year. Just this week in conservative Clay County, one person challenged 40 books, Meehan said.\nBefore dropping out of the Republican presidential primary, DeSantis campaigned heavily on his education platform, including the law giving people more power to challenge books.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'It's just a big mess that DeSantis created and now he's trying to disown it, but I don't know if he'll be able to distance himself from this because he campaigned on it so hard,' said House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell.\nIt's not the only example of the tough-talking governor having to make adjustments to ideology he championed while seeking the White House.\nHe also has made concessions in the settlement of several lawsuits involving the state and Walt Disney World. The dispute between them erupted in 2022 after the company spoke out against a DeSantis-backed law that opponents dubbed 'Don't Say Gay.' The law bans classroom lessons on gender identity and sexual orientation.\nAdvertisement\nThe Associated Press asked DeSantis' office for examples of liberal activists abusing the law and it provided one: Chaz Stevens, a South Florida resident who has often lampooned government. Stevens raised challenges in dozens of school districts over the Bible, dictionaries and thesauruses.\nThe change to the law 'ensures that book challenges are limited for individuals, like Chaz, who do not have children with access to the school district's materials,' DeSantis spokeswoman Julia Friedland said in an email. She didn't reply to follow-up emails requesting more examples.\nStevens, who 11 years ago made national news when he installed a Festivus pole made out of beer cans across from a nativity scene displayed in the Capitol, was delighted DeSantis' office singled him out.\n'When they need to make stupid stupider, they send me up. I'm part comedian, I'm part activist, I'm part artist. I just want a better society,' Stevens said. 'I'm an idiot, but a smart guy at the same time.'\nAdvertisement\nWhile DeSantis' predecessor, current Republican Sen. Rick Scott, allowed what was then called the 'free speech zone' in the Capitol rotunda, the rules changed under DeSantis and new barriers were put in place to use Capitol space for political expression. The League of Women Voters and Stevens are among the applicants who have been denied access under the new rules.\n'I didn't realize that I have the power of millions!' Stevens said. 'I'm just one guy. I'm an agitator. I know my role in this.'\nDriskell pointed out that DeSantis was warned there would be problems when the book ban law passed in 2022.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brendan Farrington","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IZKOFRH4HII65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.408683,"_id":"9d37fa83e5d318a5cc11b6eec9e40bf6"},{"title":"UK lawmakers will vote on a landmark bill aiming to create the country's first smoke-free generation","author":"Associated Press","published_date":"2024-04-16 11:44:33","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/16/britain-smoking-ban/b18fd246-fbe6-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"British lawmakers are set to vote on the government's plans to introduce a landmark smoking ban that aims to stop young people from ever smoking","summary":"LONDON \u2014 British lawmakers will on Tuesday debate and vote on the government's plans to introduce a landmark smoking ban that aims to stop young people from ever smoking.\nThe bill, a key policy announced by Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak last year, will make it illegal to sell tobacco products to anyone born after January 1, 2009.

All 63 national parks sit on what were once Indigenous lands. And for thousands of years, before the National Park Service was created, people carefully tended these ecosystems and stewarded these resources.\nIn the course of my research and reporting for The Post's 'Field Trip' podcast, I discovered many people whose efforts during more than over 150 years of land management helped change how these fragile and dynamic landscapes will be protected into the future. Out of them, here are seven whose unique contributions captivated me.\nGeorge Mel\u00e9ndez Wright\nOne of the first Hispanic park rangers, George Mel\u00e9ndez Wright had studied zoology at the University of California at Berkeley and was appalled at what he saw in Yosemite during the 1920s: The National Park Service was feeding bears from trash cans for visitors' entertainment. Park employees were also killing mountain lions as part of a broader predator eradication effort across U.S. public lands.\nplay\nPlay now\nNaN min\nFollow on\nPodcast episode\nSpotify\nApple\nGoogle\nAmazon\n'For him, that was all so completely unnatural and against why national parks were created,' said Jerry Emory, author of the biography 'George Mel\u00e9ndez Wright: The Fight for Wildlife and Wilderness in the National Parks.'\nAlthough only in his early 20s, Wright became one of the first major surveyors of wildlife in the national parks. In addition to Yosemite, he traveled across the western United States, using his own money to finance the National Park Service's first coordinated wildlife survey. He documented those findings in a seminal report called 'Fauna No. 1.'\nAdvertisement\nIn 1933, the National Park Service appointed Wright the leader of its new Wildlife Division, and he thus also became the first Hispanic person to hold a leadership role within the service. A few years later, at the age of 31, he died in a car accident when leaving what would become Big Bend National Park in Texas.\nDespite his brief career, Wright's recommendations laid the foundation for many of the core wildlife conservation policies the Park Service has adopted.\nMardy Murie\nIn many ways, Mardy Murie continued Wright's efforts, advocating for the National Park Service to make wildlife its central priority and to preserve ecosystems for their own sake.\n'In order to be successful in protecting wildlife, you have to protect land,' said Bill Meadows, former president of the Wilderness Society. 'And she knew this.'\nMurie initially found her way into conservation work through her husband, a prominent wildlife biologist named Olaus Murie who studied the migration of elk and caribou. Together, they became vocal advocates both for adding new areas to the national park system \u2014 such as the Grand Tetons \u2014 and for redrawing the boundaries of existing national parks to keep whole ecosystems intact.\nAn expedition the Muries led in 1956 to northeastern Alaska helped convince President Dwight D. Eisenhower to establish what is now called the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. After Murie's husband died in 1963, she began lobbying for legislation \u2014 later signed into law by President Jimmy Carter in 1980 \u2014 that turned enormous parts of Alaska into federally protected lands, doubling the total footprint managed by the National Park Service. And in 1998, at the age of 96, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her decades of work to protect wildlife.\n'She was in awe of her husband and those around him,' Meadows said, 'and grew to a place where people were in awe of her.'\nAdvertisement\nGeorge Masa\nMany know the work of Ansel Adams and the role his stunning landscape photography played in helping to protect Yosemite National Park, but few people are aware of similar efforts on the other side of the country at around the same time.\nGeorge Masa, a Japanese immigrant living in North Carolina during the 1920s, spent years hiking deep into the woods with his large-format cameras and documenting the beauty of the Great Smoky Mountains: storm clouds gathering over an undulating ridgeline of mountains, sunshine glaring off a still lake.\n'Anyone who's spent time in the Smokies knows the haze, knows the rain showers,' said Janet McCue, co-author of an upcoming biography of Masa. 'Not unless you've been there do you understand how hard they are to photograph and also how hard Masa worked in order to get those views.'\nAt a time when trails were barely marked, camera equipment was extremely heavy and even a modest photograph demanded exact conditions, Masa was able to create images that stirred a public reverence for Appalachia. His photographs accompanied numerous articles advocating for protecting the Smokies from the logging industry. They played an important role in persuading President Calvin Coolidge and Congress to establish the Great Smoky Mountains as a national park, and they also played a crucial role in convincing donors like the Rockefellers to spend millions of dollars to purchase the land and then turn it over to the federal government.\nToday, roughly 100 years after Masa hiked among its oaks and hemlocks, Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most popular of all 63 national parks in the system. More than 13 million people visited it in 2023, experiencing much of the same magic in its ever-shifting forests. As McCue said, 'It was Masa who was able to capture that better than anyone else.'\nPolly Dyer\nFor national park aficionados, Polly Dyer's name is synonymous with environmental activism in the Pacific Northwest. Starting in the 1950s, she became a central champion of the region's natural wonders \u2014 from its dramatic coastlines to its temperate rainforests to its subalpine meadows.\n'Polly was a very strong, articulate, forceful advocate for doing the right thing,' said Destry Jarvis, a former assistant director for the National Park Service. 'She was a presence.'\nIn 1953, Dyer's powers of persuasion helped end an effort to open part of Olympic National Park to logging. In 1958, she also helped quash a proposal for a road in the park that would have damaged miles of Pacific coastline.\nAs a founding member of the North Cascades Conservation Council, she convinced members of Congress to create North Cascades National Park in 1968, protecting more than 500,000 acres of mountains, glaciers and alpine forest.\n'There was a fair amount of opposition to establishing North Cascades,' Jarvis said. But, he added, 'she was extremely persistent.'\nAdvertisement\nHoward Zahniser\nThere are few pieces of conservation legislation as significant as the Wilderness Act, which created high levels of protection for some of the most pristine areas in the United States. Howard Zahniser envisioned the plan, wrote the legislation and then advocated for it.\nWorking at the Wilderness Society, Zahniser drafted the bill in 1956 after he had participated in an effort to prevent a dam from being built within Dinosaur National Monument, a landscape of rivers, deserts and canyons on the border between Colorado and Utah. The political struggle convinced him that better legal safeguards should exist to protect land from development.\nThe road to establishing the Wilderness Act was a long one, though. Zahniser would spend eight years revising the potential bill's language. He wrote 66 drafts before Congress finally passed it in 1964 \u2014 just a few months after his death.\n'He didn't give up,' said Meadows, the former Wilderness Society president. 'And he did it through words. Some people call it the most lyrical legislation that's ever been passed.'\nAdvertisement\nThanks to the Wilderness Act, more than 100 million acres of land \u2014 many of which sit within national parks \u2014 are now off-limits to any development, including industrial projects like dams but also basic infrastructure such as visitor centers, roads and even campgrounds.\nDesignated wilderness areas currently make up more than 80 percent of all land managed by the National Park Service. So even as visitation to the national parks continues to increase, large parts of their ecosystems remain shielded from excessive human impact.\n'This has affected the makeup of the Park Service,' Meadows said. 'It really put in place the values that parks need to be protected, as well as open to the public.'\nCarl Stokes\nCarl Stokes was the mayor of Cleveland, and the first elected Black mayor of a major U.S. city, when the Cuyahoga River caught fire in 1969 because of pollution. A story in Time magazine that summer described the river as 'chocolate-brown, oily, bubbling with subsurface gases, it oozes rather than flows.'\nWhile the fire did relatively minimal damage, Stokes used the incident to help draw national media attention to the environmental hazards facing urban and minority communities, including the lack of clean water. His outspokenness about the state of the Cuyahoga River helped push forward the Clean Water Act a couple of years later and also set the stage for the nearby Cuyahoga Valley to be managed by the National Park Service starting in 1974 as a national recreation area. (It would later become the rare national park to have a superfund site within it.)\nAnd yet, on the first Earth Day, which occurred less than a year after the Cuyahoga River fire, Stokes also urged that current environmental efforts not 'come at the expense' of other priorities that affect low-income communities. An early voice in the environmental justice movement, Stokes convinced people that urban places deserve just as much protection as remote places of unadulterated beauty.\nGerard Baker\nThe National Park Service manages roughly 400 areas other than the 63 large national parks. They include places that have historical as well as environmental significance, including Montana's Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument \u2014 the site of a famous showdown between the U.S. Army and several tribes of Plains Indians.\nFor nearly 50 years, it bore the name Custer Battlefield National Monument, commemorating the Army officer and his troops on the losing side of the fight. Then in 1989, Barbara Sutteer became the first Native American superintendent of the site and began the process of changing its name. That work continued under the following superintendent, Gerard Baker, a member of the Mandan-Hidatsa Tribe of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, who oversaw both the official renaming and several additional efforts to make the park unit more inclusive of Indigenous perspectives.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Lillian Cunningham","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JZJEU2O27ZDDBEA3HQ57QMRZL4.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.3195877,"_id":"b4b3b3b18549fea7b2aa039c687802fe"},{"title":"NPR suspends editor who criticized his employer for what he calls an unquestioned liberal worldview","author":"Associated Press","published_date":"2024-04-16 23:22:03","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/16/npr-liberals-suspension-editor/21b7b65e-fc48-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"National Public Radio has reportedly suspended a veteran editor who wrote an essay for an outside outlet that criticized his employer for what he says is an unquestioned liberal point of view","summary":"NEW YORK \u2014 National Public Radio has suspended a veteran editor who wrote an outside essay criticizing his employer for, in his view, journalism that reflects a liberal viewpoint with little tolerance for contrary opinions.\nUri Berliner, a senior editor on NPR's business desk, was suspended five days without pay, according to an article posted Tuesday by NPR's media correspondent, David Folkenflik.

That was not a foregone conclusion on the day he was elected speaker.'\nPath to yes\nEarly this year, Johnson started to suggest in conference meetings that he was open to funding Ukraine, making statements about being a 'Reagan Republican' who believed in 'peace through strength.' That's when a far-right whisper campaign started as early as January about ousting Johnson if he dared move on Ukraine without first securing the southern border.\nMeanwhile, the Senate was haggling over a bipartisan border security measure as part of its foreign aid package, including help for Ukraine. Those months-long negotiations bought Johnson time. But when Republicans in both the House and the Senate, led by Trump, immediately rejected the bipartisan border security plan, it became clear there was no chance such a measure could pass Congress.\na measure could pass Congress.\nThat meant Johnson would have to choose whether to rely on support from the sizable pro-foreign aid faction of House Republicans and Democrats to back Ukraine aid or acquiesce to demands by his right flank and do nothing.\nThe Senate passed a $95 billion foreign aid bill in February with 70 votes, significant bipartisan support omitting any border security component.

Mindful of the politics, the administration is delaying action on the contentious issue of whether transgender girls and women should be allowed to compete in women's and girls' sports.\nThe long-awaited regulation represents the administration's interpretation of Title IX, a 1972 law that bars sex discrimination in schools that receive federal funding. Title IX is best known for ushering in equal treatment for women in sports, but it also governs how schools handle complaints of sexual harassment and assault, a huge issue on many college campuses.\nAdvertisement\nNow the Biden administration is deploying the regulation to formalize its long-standing view that sex discrimination includes discrimination based on gender identity as well as sexual orientation, a direct challenge to conservative policies across the country.\nTen states, for instance, require transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their biological sex identified at birth, according to tracking by the Movement Advancement Project. Some school districts will not use the pronouns corresponding with a trans student's gender identity. Both situations might constitute violations of Title IX under the new regulation. In addition, if a school failed to properly address bullying based on gender identity or sexual orientation, that, too, could be a violation of federal law.\n'No one should face bullying or discrimination just because of who they are or who they love. Sadly, this happens all too often,' Education Secretary Miguel Cardona told reporters in a conference call.\nAdvertisement\nThe Education Department's Office for Civil Rights investigates allegations of sex discrimination, among other things, and schools that fail to come into compliance risk losing federal funding. A senior administration official said that the office could investigate cases where schools were potentially discriminating, even if they were following their own state's law.\nThe final regulation also includes provisions barring discrimination based on pregnancy, including childbirth, abortion and lactation. For instance, schools must accommodate students' need to attend medical appointments, as well as provide students and workers who are nursing a clean, private space to pump milk.\nThe combination of these two issues \u2014 sexual assault and transgender rights \u2014 drew enormous public interest, with some 240,000 public comments submitted in response to the proposed version published in 2022. The new rules take effect Aug. 1, in time for the start of next school year.\nAdvertisement\nThe final regulation unravels a Trump-era system for handling sexual assault complaints, discarding some of the rules that bolstered due process rights of the accused. Supporters said those rules were critical to ensuring that students had the opportunity to defend themselves; critics said they discouraged sexual assault survivors from reporting incidents and turned colleges into quasi-courtrooms.\nEducation Department officials said they had retained the elements that made sense but created a better overall framework that gave equal treatment and balanced the rights of all involved. 'A fair process will help ensure that investigations lead to accurate, reliable and effective resolution of sex discrimination complaints,' Cardona said.\nUnder the Trump administration's regulation, finalized in 2020, colleges were required to stage live hearings to adjudicate complaints, where the accused could cross-examine witnesses \u2014 including the students who were alleging assault. Supporters said that live hearings were critical to ascertaining what actually happened when facts are contested, but others argued cross-examination could retraumatize assault survivors.\nAdvertisement\nUnder the new Biden rules, colleges will have more flexibility. The investigator or person adjudicating the case may question witnesses in separate meetings or employ a live hearing.\nThe new rules also will allow schools to use a lower bar for adjudicating guilt. In weighing evidence, they are now directed to use a 'preponderance of the evidence' standard, though they may opt for a higher standard of 'clear and convincing evidence' if they use that standard in other similar proceedings. Under the Trump version, universities had a choice, but they were required to use the higher standard if they did so in other settings.\nThe proposal also expands the definition of what constitutes sexual harassment, discarding a narrower definition used under President Donald Trump, and broadens who on campus has a responsibility to respond to allegations.\nAdvertisement\nSome of the Trump provisions were retained. Schools, for instance, will continue to have the option to use informal resolution of discrimination complaints, unless the allegation involves an employee of a K-12 school.\nThe Biden administration's approach was welcomed by advocates for sexual assault survivors.\nThe rules 'will make schools safer and more accessible for young people, many of whom experienced irreparable harm while they fought for protection and support,' said Emma Grasso Levine, senior manager of Title IX policy and programs at Know Your IX, a project of the advocacy group Advocates for Youth.\n'Now, it's up to school administrators to act quickly to implement and enforce' the new rules, she added.\nSexual assault has been a serious issue on college campuses for years, and in releasing the regulation, the Biden administration said the rates were still 'unacceptably high.'\nAdvertisement\nBut the most controversial element of the regulation involves the rights of transgender students, and it came under immediate fire.\nAdministration officials point to a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that sex discrimination in employment includes gender identity and sexual orientation to bolster their interpretation of the law. But conservatives contend that Title IX does not include these elements and argue that accommodations for transgender students can create situations that put other students at risk. They object, for instance, to having a transgender woman \u2014 someone they refer to as a 'biological man' \u2014 using women's bathrooms or locker rooms.\nRep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), chairwoman of the House Education Committee, called the regulation an escalation of Democrats' 'contemptuous culture war that aims to radically redefine sex and gender.' The department, she said, has put decades of advancement for women and girls 'squarely on the chopping block.'\n'Evidently, the acceptance of biological reality, and the faithful implementation of the law, are just pills too big for the Department to swallow \u2014 and it shows,' she said in a statement.\nAdvertisement\nStill, the administration sidestepped the contentious issue of athletics, at least for now. A separate regulation governing how and when schools may exclude transgender students from women and girls teams remains under review, and administration officials offered no timetable for when it would be finalized. People familiar with their thinking said it was being delayed to avoid injecting the matter into the presidential campaign, where President Biden faces a close race against Trump.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nA senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in a briefing with reporters Thursday, declined to comment on the politics of this decision but noted that the athletics rule was proposed after the main Title IX regulation.\nPolling shows that clear majorities of Americans, including a sizable slice of Democrats, oppose allowing transgender athletes to compete on girls' and women's teams. Twenty-five states have statewide bans on their participation.\nAdvertisement\nThe proposed sports regulation disallows these statewide, blanket bans, but it allows school districts to restrict participation more narrowly defined \u2014 for instance on competitive high school or college teams. The main Title IX regulation does not address the issue, and an administration official said the status quo would remain. Still, some have argued that the new general ban on discrimination could apply to sports even though the administration does not intend it to.\nThe rules governing how campuses deal with harassment complaints have changed repeatedly in recent years.\nThe Obama administration issued detailed guidance in 2014 for schools in handling complaints, but that was later tossed out by Trump Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Her department went through its own laborious rulemaking process to put a new system in place.\nAs a candidate for president in 2020, Biden promised to put a 'quick end' to that version if elected, saying it gave colleges 'a green light to ignore sexual violence and strip survivors of their rights.' Friday's action makes good on his promise.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Laura Meckler","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NVFXSUWGEFVERF7YSNCTF53MOQ.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.205599,"_id":"7226bd922d2e47cf22b62cd490a4c0ed"},{"title":"British climate protester won't be charged for sign telling jurors to vote their conscience","author":"Associated Press","published_date":"2024-04-22 18:13:55","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/22/climate-activist-charge-protest-jurors-outside-court-england/14757d4c-00d4-11ef-8eac-39c6dcb59eb5_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"A London judge says a climate protester who could have faced up to two years in prison for holding a sign outside a courthouse reminding jurors of their right to acquit defendants should not be\u2026","summary":"LONDON \u2014 A climate protester who could have faced up to two years in prison for holding a sign outside a courthouse reminding jurors of their right to acquit defendants cannot be charged with contempt of court, a London judge ruled Monday.\nTrudi Warner had been arrested last March and accused of 'deliberately targeting' jurors before a trial of climate activists from the group Insulate Britain.\nShe held a sign in front of Inner London Crown Court that said: 'Jurors you have an absolute right to acquit a defendant according to your conscience.'\nHigh Court Justice Pushpinder Saini said her act was not a crime because jurors can reach a verdict based on their conscience and Warner had not interfered with jurors.\n'It is fanciful to suggest that Ms. Warner's behavior falls into this category of contempt,' Saini said.

Six workers said they were undecided and two were opposed.\n'I'm pretty vocal about the union at work, and I usually ask a lot of people how they feel,' Collins said, en route to his shift building Atlas SUVs and electric ID.4 vehicles. 'And from all the people I talk to, I've only come across three people who are against it.'\nThose who spoke with The Post are a small fraction of the more than 4,000 workers eligible to vote in the ballot. And the UAW has failed in two previous efforts to organize the factory, in 2014 and 2019. But the union is expressing optimism this time around, saying that a supermajority of workers signed union authorization cards supporting UAW membership.\nVolkswagen Chattanooga would be the first auto plant in the South to unionize through an election since the 1940s, although there are other unionized auto factories in the South.\nThe union drive in Chattanooga is happening as both President Biden and former president Trump vie to make the case that they can deliver for blue-collar factory workers. A yes vote, even in red Tennessee, could help shore up Biden's support among union voters across the United States, including those still dubious about the improved economy. Biden's staunch support of union workers has earned him the UAW's endorsement and assistance on the campaign trail from its fiery president, Shawn Fain.\nTennessee Republicans have seized on that relationship in their efforts to thwart the unionization drive. In an impromptu news conference next to the factory this month, local Republicans warned that workers in this right-leaning county would be aligning themselves with the Democrats by voting yes.\n'I hope that the Tennessee workers will recognize that the UAW represents the party of President Joe Biden, and their values and political contributions, which are completely inconsistent with the people of southeast Tennessee,' state Sen. Bo Watson told attendees.\nAdvertisement\nThe conservative editorial page of the Chattanooga Times Free Press has carried similar messages, as has a mysterious website that workers say appeared recently, stillnouaw.com, which features photos of Biden and Fain and a social media post from former president Donald Trump attacking the UAW president. During a visit to Chattanooga last week, Republican Gov. Bill Lee cautioned that joining the union would be 'a big mistake.'\nSome conservative VW workers say they wish politicians would butt out.\n'I really don't appreciate what our local leaders have said about the UAW. I think they should have stayed out of it,' Ethan Triplett, a VW worker who votes Republican, said as he arrived for his shift. 'I've seen what the UAW can do for all the plants up north and everything. \u2026 And I feel like they can do some good down here.'\nTriplett and others said their main complaints include the factory's inflexible sick-day policies and its tendency to haul in workers for compulsory overtime shifts on Saturdays. They also want better retirement and health-care benefits.\nThe election stakes are high for the UAW and its new president. The union scored big contract wins after striking against Ford, General Motors and Stellantis last year, but union membership has fallen precipitously in recent decades and continued to drop by 3.3 percent last year, to 370,000 workers. A team of UAW staffers has decamped to Chattanooga to help run the election drive, working on laptops at the union hall of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), where the UAW is renting space.\nAlthough this would be the UAW's first foray in the South at a foreign auto plant, both GM and Ford have UAW factories in Kentucky, Tennessee and Texas. Those had an easier path to unionization through procedures included in the automakers' national agreements with the union.\nVW says it is remaining neutral on the unionization effort. The union has disputed that, accusing the company of destroying union materials in a factory break room and other union-busting behavior. The company refutes the allegations, saying it is standard VW procedure to clear break rooms of all stray materials every day.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe factory is VW's only plant worldwide that isn't represented by a union or a similar body that advocates for workers. 'We respect our employees' right to decide who represents them in the workplace and have throughout this process,' Volkswagen said in a statement about the Chattanooga vote, adding that it is proud of the working conditions and pay it offers.\nThe average production worker in Chattanooga will earn more than $60,000 this year before overtime and bonuses, with hourly wages ranging from $23.40 to $32.40, the company said. Skilled team leaders earn up to $42.25 an hour. Since 2009, VW has invested more than $4.3 billion in the factory, making it one of the biggest employers in this picturesque city on the Tennessee River, in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.\nCharles Wood, head of the local chamber of commerce, said he worries that unionization could cause VW to shift more investment to its factory in Puebla, Mexico. That plant is unionized, but its workers earn less, making it a cheaper place to produce.\n'The risk for Chattanooga is we become less competitive long-term,' he said, adding that VW has played a huge role in helping the region recover from factory closures and tough economic times that started in the 1960s.\nAdvertisement\nSarah Roberts, who works in the factory's logistics department, said she plans to vote no, because she developed negative views of unions while growing up in Michigan. Her father, an automotive engineer, worked stints in various auto factories, trying to improve their manufacturing processes, she said. 'Out of all the plants he's been in, every one that has been under the UAW for more than 10 years is now shut down,' she said.\nAmong some conservative workers, the UAW's endorsement of Biden is not helping the union's case.\nMembers of a worker committee helping organize the drive say some workers have bashed the Biden endorsement. Kelcey Smith, one of dozens on the committee, said he heard a colleague tell a union meeting a few months ago that some people on the factory floor were upset about it.\n'He believed that it was having an effect on some of the minds of some of the workers as far as voting for the union was concerned,' Smith said in an interview. UAW staffers at the meeting advised workers to reassure colleagues that they can vote for whomever they like.\nMost workers who spoke with The Post said they are focusing more on workplace issues than politics.\nThe union 'can support whoever they want,' said Krantzsy Boursiquot, a worker who described himself as apolitical and a nonvoter. Like others, he is most concerned about mandatory overtime on Saturdays, which the company sometimes calls with only two days' notice, and managers' refusal at times to approve sick days.\n'I feel like, as they're pushing for excellence every year, coming up with a new model every year, trying to increase profits for their shareholders, they should have that same energy when it comes down to their employees. And they don't,' Boursiquot said.\nVolkswagen spokesman Michael Lowder said the company has several channels for employee feedback and takes worker input seriously.\nGathering on a recent evening at the IBEW union hall, workers on the unionization organizing committee said they are pushing for stronger benefits.\nAdvertisement\nYolanda Peoples, who used to belong to the UAW when she worked at a now closed General Motors factory in Doraville, Ga., says she wants better health-care coverage that will reduce her out-of-pocket costs for medication. She would also like a defined-benefit pension instead of the 401(k) that VW provides.\n'The 401(k) is based on the stock market \u2026 and whether it's up or down,' she said. 'I want more stability.'\nVW contributes 4 percent of an employee's pay to the 401(k) if the worker contributes 5 percent, VW spokesman Lowder said. The company also contributes 5 percent of each employee's paycheck to a separate defined contribution plan, with no employee contribution required, he said.\nRobert Soderstrom, who builds car doors, hopes a union can help protect workers from having to do the jobs of two people when someone calls in sick. 'Oftentimes we won't have a full crew,' he said. 'If we're a man short, they'll be like, well, Robert, today you're working two [jobs] \u2026 they're not slowing the line down.'\nOutside the factory gates, Justin DeLong stopped briefly to voice his support for the UAW, saying that many of his relatives in Upstate New York are union workers.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jeanne Whalen","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NY2NZ6DP2K2JAY3JMGER3VDHO4_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.0898714,"_id":"44ea004fc87818e8cee117be7f6781f2"},{"title":"Opening statements set for Monday in Trump's New York hush money trial","author":"Rachel Weiner","published_date":"2024-04-19 22:23:40","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/19/trump-new-york-trial-jury-selection-emotional","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Some prospective jurors grew emotional during questioning Friday; the 12 jurors and six alternates picked said they can be impartial in judging Donald Trump.","summary":"NEW YORK \u2014 A jury is set to hear opening statements Monday on whether Donald Trump falsified bank records in connection with his effort to hide an alleged affair from voters in the 2016 election.\nThe historic trial began this week with a speedy but emotional jury selection. A few potential jurors cried as they considered whether they could handle the first-ever trial of a former president \u2014 one who is known for his tirades against the U.S. justice system and is also the presumptive Republican nominee in this year's presidential election.\nNew York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan thanked participants for their bravery as several shared painful details of their pasts in front of scores of reporters during the jury screening process. He praised others for their honesty in saying that Trump's rhetoric would make it hard for them to judge Trump fairly.\nAdvertisement\nSkip to end of carousel\nThe jurors in Trump's New York hush money trial\nThe jurors in Trump's New York hush money trial (Sophia Deng/For The Washington Post) A look at the 12 jurors and six alternates seated in the historic hush money trial of former president Donald Trump.\nEnd of carousel\n'I feel so overcome, nervous and anxious,' one potential juror told the judge Friday morning. 'This is so much more stressful than I thought it was going to be.' A couple of hours later, a man who had been protesting outside the courthouse all week in opposition to both Trump and President Biden set himself on fire; he was hospitalized in critical condition.\nThrough questions designed to root out bias among the jury pool, both sides have started to signal their trial strategies.\nAssistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass told prospective jurors that the government would prove not just bank fraud but an implicit conspiracy to 'commit election fraud' and 'pull the wool over the eyes of the American voters.' In prosecutors' formulation, Trump skirted campaign finance laws by funneling a $130,000 payment to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels though Michael Cohen, his attorney and fixer, then falsely claiming the money used to repay Cohen was for legal work.\nAdvertisement\nDefense attorney Susan Necheles laid the groundwork for impeaching the testimony of Cohen, a convicted perjurer, by asking potential jurors if they could 'use your common sense' and 'understand that if two witnesses \u2026 say two diametrically opposed things, someone is lying.'\nShe added that jurors should agree that 'if somebody tells a story a number of different ways over time and changes the details, that might be a sign that they are lying.'\nThe first of four criminal prosecutions Trump faces, the New York state case is generally seen as the weakest in part because of the players involved. Cohen admits he has lied to Congress as well as federal tax and election officials. Daniels, who is also known as Stephanie Clifford, previously denied she had an affair with Trump; she has said she felt she had no choice because of the nondisclosure agreement she signed.\nAdvertisement\nAnother prosecutor suggested the government would try to compensate for those potential weaknesses by presenting paperwork in court that would back up their accounts. 'Documents don't lie,' Assistant District Attorney Susan Hoffinger told the group. 'They corroborate testimony.'\nSusan Hoffinger told the group. 'They corroborate testimony.'\nBefore leaving court Friday, the 12 jurors and six alternates were admonished not to read, listen to or watch anything about the case, or discuss it with anyone. That will be a particular challenge in what may become the most closely-covered case in American history, featuring a presidential candidate and reality television star who speaks to the television cameras daily from a hallway inside the courthouse.\ndaily from a hallway inside the courthouse.\nOn Friday, Trump engaged in the same kind of vitriol that many potential jurors said had colored their views of him, declaring that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (D), who graduated from Harvard for college and law school, was 'probably not smart enough to' handle the trial himself.\nAdvertisement\nIn fact, elected leaders of prosecutors' offices rarely appear in court, and it is almost always assistant district attorneys like Steinglass and Hoffinger who present the case to jurors.\nOne member of the jury pool said Friday that growing up in New Jersey, Trump was his image of big city success. He told himself that one day he would live in Trump Tower, the Fifth Avenue landmark Trump built in the early 1980s: 'That was a powerful symbol for me.'\nNow, the man said, he associated Trump with 'harmful' and 'divisive' politics. Worse, he said, he did not think Trump really believed the biased things he said \u2014 'I think he just pushes it to stay in power.'\nThe man was eliminated from the group after it came out that he had referred to Trump on social media as 'the devil.' So was a woman who said Trump's rise had 'emboldened' homophobic, racist and sexist commentary at the gym where she used to box.\nAdvertisement\nOthers were excluded for reasons having nothing to do with the famous defendant.

But many of those picked said they did not engage on such platforms or follow politics closely, preferring news about sports, technology and business.

Even a former warden and chaplain there were convicted on sexual abuse charges.\nAdvertisement\nInstead of calling for new facilities or big staffing increases, the bill focuses on transparency and an 'inspection regime' bolstered by an empowered Justice Department inspector general and a new ombudsman position exclusively for the prison agency. With 'access to all Bureau facilities' at any time, without prior notice, as the bill provides, they could shine light on the system's dark and dangerous practices.\nRep. Lucy McBath's motivation to introduce the bill was personal, but not in the way you might expect.\n'My son, Jordan Davis, was killed at just 17 years old by a man with a gun who is now serving a life sentence in prison,' the Georgia Democrat said by email. 'Through my family's pain, I have found the strength to forgive my son's killer. I heard from advocates and leadership within the Department of Justice and Bureau of Prisons that additional reforms were needed to protect staff and incarcerated individuals in our prison system, so I introduced this bill in the House.'\nAdvertisement\nIn March, David C. Fathi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union National Prison Project, lambasted the BOP as 'a profoundly broken agency' in a Post interview. Now he is more optimistic, describing the bill in a phone interview as 'a major step forward for transparency. \u2026 Prison oversight is just essential. Prisons are closed institutions, and they house people who are unpopular and politically powerless. So, without some kind of oversight, that is a recipe for neglect and mistreatment and abuse.'\nUnder the bill, which must be approved by the full House and Senate before becoming law, the Justice Department's inspector general would conduct periodic prison inspections. The attorney general would be mandated to ensure the inspectors have 'access to any covered facility, including the incarcerated people, detainees, staff, bargaining unit representative organization, and any other information' needed.\nThe legislation says the assessments 'may include' incarceration conditions; staff adequacy and working conditions; availability of recidivism-reduction programs; solitary- and restrictive-confinement practices; prison medical and mental health services; and violence, sexual abuse and excessive-force allegations.\nAdvertisement\nAfter the inspections, a report on the findings would be available to Congress, employee organizations and the public. Prison officials would have 60 days to respond in writing to the report, which must include a 'corrective action plan.'\nA 'risk score' based on a variety of issues would be developed for each facility by the inspector general's office and sent to the House and Senate judiciary committees. Higher-risk prisons would be inspected more frequently.\nOne new element in prison accountability would be a dedicated prison ombudsman who takes complaints from inmates, employees or others 'regarding issues that may adversely affect the health, safety, welfare, or rights of incarcerated people or staff.' The ombudsman would decide the merits of each complaint and report the findings to the BOP. If the ombudsman believes there are ongoing, 'significant health, safety, welfare, working conditions, or rehabilitation' issues, the official would report that to the attorney general and Congress. The ombudsman also would be empowered to monitor internal disciplinary actions 'to ensure a fair and objective process.'\nAdvertisement\nThe oversight act also calls for reporting tools such as an online form and a telephone hotline for 'representatives of incarcerated people' and 'multiple internal ways for incarcerated individuals' to privately submit complaints.\nAs with Fathi, other strong critics of the BOP welcomed the legislation.\nAfter describing problems from his years as a federal inmate in two facilities, including inadequate health and emotional care, dirty conditions, and poor diets, Eddie Ellis, a 48-year-old resident of Montgomery County, Md., praised the bill for creating a 'check box on making sure that you humanize the people in those spaces.' He's been out 18 years and now is a co-director of the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth.\nBut it's not just a check box, he added, pointing to measures that included input from families so that 'if something is not happening right, something can take place before it gets too bad or worse than what it is.'\nAdvertisement\nDaniel Landsman, a vice president of the criminal justice organization FAMM (formerly Families Against Mandatory Minimums), said that 'this bill would give us, for the first time, really comprehensive, and well fleshed out, independent oversight of our federal prison system.'\nThe bipartisan nature of the bill was indicated by the Conservative Political Action Conference's endorsement. David Safavian, general counsel for the American Conservative Union, CPAC's parent organization, praised 'increased prison oversight,' saying the BOP 'spends $8 billion of taxpayer money each year \u2014 with little meaningful oversight by policymakers .'\npraised 'increased prison oversight,' saying the BOP 'spends $8 billion of taxpayer money each year \u2014 with little meaningful oversight by policymakers.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Joe Davidson","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IM6SZGIKTHNMU2Y3BWUW6YZCTU.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.080294,"_id":"05f8f954c63d7de5d6a92f8bd0a3350d"},{"title":"A rape took place in Parliament, judge rules in case that consumed Australia","author":"Frances Vinall","published_date":"2024-04-17 11:24:14","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/17/australia-parliament-rape-brittany-higgins","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"After Brittany Higgins accused her colleague Bruce Lehrmann of rape, he sued a TV network for airing her story. The case's dismissal caps a years-long legal saga.","summary":"For three years, Australians have been consumed by a rape allegation that sparked a criminal trial; a slew of civil cases; legislative change; reviews of police, a prosecutor and workplace conduct; tens of thousands marching to protest gendered violence; and a national reckoning over the treatment of women.\nIn 2021, former political staffer Brittany Higgins came forward in media interviews, alleging that about two years earlier she had been raped by a colleague inside Australia's Parliament House, on a couch in the office of their mutual boss Linda Reynolds, a high-ranking lawmaker.\nThis week, a federal judge ruled that she was telling the truth. The finding concluded an at-times salacious trial that gripped the country and its media \u2014 including the accusation that one outlet, Seven Network, paid for drugs and sex work services to secure an interview with the man accused of rape, Bruce Lehrmann. The network has denied those claims.\nAdvertisement\nThe ruling Monday was in a defamation suit brought by Lehrmann against a journalist, Lisa Wilkinson, and the television channel, Network 10, that had aired Higgins's story. Lehrmann continues to deny the allegation.\nWilkinson told reporters outside the court: 'I feel glad for the women of Australia today.' She and Network 10 had relied on a truth defense, meaning they could not have defamed Lehrmann if the court concluded their story was correct.\nHiggins's allegation was central to Australia's #MeToo moment, with outrage laser-focused on goings-on at Parliament.

A former producer testified that Lehrmann received perks from the network including reimbursement for cocaine and services from sex workers \u2014 which Seven denies. Lehrmann testified that he received a year's rent worth about $65,000 from the channel, public broadcaster ABC reported.\nLee did not rule on the veracity of the producer's claims, which he thought were tangential to the central legal question.\nSeven and Lehrmann's attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.\nPeter Bartlett, a defamation law expert who successfully represented a media outlet in another recent headline-grabbing trial, said the ruling against Lehrmann could 'be a boost for freedom of speech in Australia,' which is not constitutionally protected there.\nAdvertisement\nIn Australia, editors and in-house lawyers tend to be more conservative than in the United States when deciding what to publish, Bartlett said. Under Australian law, someone sued for defamation usually must prove that a claim was true \u2014 rather than the aggrieved party proving it was false \u2014 except in limited protected contexts.\nBartlett defended Fairfax Media when it was sued by a decorated soldier, Ben Roberts-Smith, over stories that alleged he had illegally killed unarmed prisoners in Afghanistan. In June, the judge in that case also found the stories were substantially true.\n'In the two most recent high-profile decisions in Australia, Roberts-Smith and Lehrmann, the plaintiffs have both failed,' Bartlett said, calling it a 'very rare' period in the Australian defamation world. In both cases, 'the trials have been far more damaging than the original publication,' he added.\nAdvertisement\nHiggins's allegation also became a political issue. She and Lehrmann were both employed by the Liberal Party \u2014 which heads Australia's conservative coalition, in government at the time \u2014 when the rape happened. In 2022, Prime Minister Scott Morrison issued a public apology to Higgins for 'the terrible things that took place' in Parliament.\nBurgin said that the question of what happened in the early hours of March 23, 2019, in Reynolds's office has been 'omnipresent' in Australia, the subject of 'arguments around the dinner table, disagreements among friends.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"world","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Frances Vinall","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3367PWMX433H44MWTOJCJGERF4.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.080294,"_id":"645e867cd4f0f14a24c29a2b123ceb34"},{"title":"Police threaten to shut down conference of Europe's far-right elites","author":"Emily Rauhala","published_date":"2024-04-16 14:42:10","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/16/police-threaten-shut-down-conference-europes-far-right-elites","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The U.K.'s Nigel Farage and Suella Braverman, Hungary's Viktor Orban and France's Eric Zemmour were on the speaker lineup at the National Conservatism Conference.","summary":"BRUSSELS \u2014 Police on Tuesday threatened to shut down a gathering on 'national conservatism' that was underway in the Belgian capital, giving Europe's hard-right elites a further opportunity to rail against cancel culture and Brussels overreach.\nThe event was supposed to be a two-day conference featuring the likes of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, former British politician Nigel Farage and other far-right, Euroskeptic officials and thinkers.\nBut several hours in, just as Farage took the stage for his keynote, Belgian police arrived outside.\nEmir Kir, the mayor of the district where the event was being held, said he had issued a shutdown order 'to guarantee public safety.'

As the Republican speaker faced an outright rebellion from his right flank and growing threats for his ouster, it became clear that House Democrat Leader Hakeem Jeffries would have to lend help to Johnson every step of the way.\n'This is a very important message we are going to send to the world this week, and I'm anxious to get it done,' Johnson said earlier Wednesday announcing his strategy.\nAdvertisement\nThe growing momentum for a bipartisanship dynamic, a rarity in the deeply divided Congress, brought rare scenes of Republicans and Democrats working together to assert U.S. standing on the global stage and help American allies. But it also sent Johnson's House Republican majority into fresh rounds of chaos.\nJohnson's Republican leadership team, seizing on the opportunity to outflank hardline conservatives with Democratic support, raised the idea of quickly changing the procedural rules to make it harder to oust the speaker from office.\nThe idea being floated would be to tuck a rules change into the emerging national security package that would raise the threshold on the so-called 'motion to vacate' vote that right now can be called by any single lawmaker to remove the speaker.\nUltra-conservatives reacted with fury, angrily confronting Johnson on the House floor in a tense scene.\nAdvertisement\n'If he wants to change the motion to vacate, he needs to come before Republican conference that elected him and tell us of his intentions,' said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a top ally of Donald Trump, who is leading the campaign to oust him.\nGreene said if Johnson goes through with his plan, 'he's going to prove exactly what I've been saying is correct: He is the Democrat speaker.'\nFollowing the exchange with Johnson on the House floor, Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican who instigated the ouster of Rep. Kevin McCarthy as speaker last year but has so far refrained from joining Greene's effort, said it was pushing him towards also wanting Johnson out as speaker.\n'It's my red line now,' added Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Colorado Republican. 'I told him there's nothing that will get you to a motion to vacate faster than changing the threshold.'\nAdvertisement\nAt the same time, one floor above the turmoil in the House chamber a rare image of bipartisan statesmanship was on display as the procedural Rules committee began debate launching the steps needed to push the foreign aid package forward toward weekend voting.\nThe Republican chairmen of the powerful Appropriations and Foreign Affairs committees alongside their top Democratic counterparts spoke in evocative language, some drawing on World War II history, to make the case for ensuring the U.S. stand with its allies against aggressors.\nChairman Michael McCaul of the Foreign Affairs Committee cast this as a 'pivotal' time in world history, comparing the current images of people fleeing the conflict in Europe to the situation in 1939 as Hitler's Germany rose to power.\n'Time is not on our side,' he told the panel.\nAdvertisement\nThe top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Greg Meeks of New York, followed through on McCaul's urgency: 'The camera of history is rolling.'\nJohnson is trying to advance a complex plan to hold individual votes this weekend on the funds for Ukraine, Israel and allies in the Asia-Pacific, then stitch the package back together.\nThe package would also include legislation that allows the U.S. to seize frozen Russian central bank assets to rebuild Ukraine; impose sanctions on Iran, Russia, China and criminal organizations that traffic fentanyl; and potentially ban the video app TikTok if its China-based owner doesn't sell its stake within a year.\nWhile Johnson is trying to remain close to Trump, and positioning the national security package as a way to assert U.S. strength in the world in the mold of Ronald Reagan-era Republicans, that puts the speaker politically at odds with the anti-interventionists powering the former president's bid to return to the White House.\nAdvertisement\nEarlier, behind closed doors, Democratic leaders huddled with their caucus to discuss the foreign aid package and the extent to which they would help advance it through the procedural maneuvers in the Rules committee to bring it to the floor.\nDemocratic Whip Rep. Katherine Clark told reporters after the meeting that Democrats were 'open to helping.'\n'This is a moment in history where we need to ensure that at long last we are bringing this critical aid to Ukraine to the floor,' she said.\nRarely, if ever, does the minority party help the majority through the procedural hoops, particularly at the House Rules committee or during the various floor votes before final passage. It would be a level of bipartisanship unseen in this Congress, even as Republican leaders watched their own priority bills defeated on procedural votes by their own members.\nAdvertisement\nBut given the high stakes of the moment for Ukraine, Israel and other allies, and the inability of Johnson to marshal enough Republican support, the speaker will have no other choice if he intends to see the national security package to passage.\nYet Democrats were also trying to apply maximum leverage as Johnson's job comes under threat.\nPrivately, Clark advised rank and file lawmakers not to divulge their positions on whether they would vote to help defeat a motion to vacate Johnson as speaker, though a handful of Democrats have already publicly said they would likely do so.\n'Do not box yourself in with a public statement,' Clark told them according to a person familiar with the remarks.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Lisa Mascaro,Stephen Groves,Kevin Freking","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PHUP26X5WQI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.06219,"_id":"cace974fb9d0c6b96332de6d01a27cfd"},{"title":"New rules for Pregnant Workers Fairness Act include divisive accommodations for abortion","author":"Claire Savage","published_date":"2024-04-15 17:50:34","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/15/pregnant-workers-fairness-act-abortion/a8fae0bc-fb50-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Workers are entitled to time off and other job accommodations for abortions under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, according to finalized federal regulations published Monday","summary":"NEW YORK \u2014 Workers are entitled to time off and other job accommodations for abortions \u2014 along with pregnancy-related medical conditions like miscarriage, stillbirth and lactation \u2014 under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, according to finalized federal regulations published Monday.\nThe regulations provide guidance for employers and workers on how to implement the law, which passed with robust bipartisan Congressional support in December 2022 but sparked controversy last year when the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission included abortions in its draft rules. The language means that workers can ask for time off to obtain an abortion and recover from the procedure.\nThe EEOC says its decision to keep the abortion provisions in its final rules despite criticism from some conservatives is consistent with its own longstanding interpretation of Title VII, as well as court rulings. The federal agency added that the new law does not obligate employers or employer-sponsored health plans to cover abortion-related costs, and that the type of accommodation that most likely will be sought under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act regarding an abortion is time off to attend a medical appointment or for recovery, which does not have to be paid.\nAdvertisement\nThe act requires most employers with 15 or more employees to provide 'reasonable accommodations' for a worker's known limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions \u2014 including fertility and infertility treatments in some cases \u2014 unless the accommodation will cause the employer an undue hardship. The EEOC's regulations, which will be used as a framework to enforce the law, will go into effect on June 18.\nLabor advocates hailed the new law as especially important for women of color who are most likely to work in low-wage, physically demanding jobs but are often denied accommodations for everything from time off for medical appointments to the ability to sit or stand on the job. Major business groups also supported the law, citing the need for clarity about the accommodations that employers are required to give pregnant workers.\n'No one should have to risk their job for their health just because they are pregnant, recovering from childbirth, or dealing with a related medical condition,' said EEOC Chair Charlotte A. Burrows on Monday.\nAdvertisement\nBut Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion activists denounced the EEOC's inclusion of abortion after the agency first released its proposed rule in August for a monthslong public commentary period. Abortion rights proponents, meanwhile, applauded the provision as critical at time when abortion rights have been curtailed in many states following the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The EEOC is composed of three Democratic commissioners and two Republican commissioners.\nSen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the lead Republican sponsor of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Law, accused the Biden administration on Monday of 'shocking and illegal' disregard of the legislative process to promote a political agenda. The Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal organization, said the Biden administration was trying to 'smuggle an abortion mandate' into the law.\nBut in comments submitted to the EEOC, the American Civil Liberties Union applauded the agency for 'recognizing that abortion has for decades been approved under the law as a \u2018related medical condition' to pregnancy that entitles workers to reasonable accommodations, including time off to obtain abortion care.'\nAdvertisement\nThe EEOC said it had received 54,000 comments urging the commission to exclude abortion from its definition of medical condition related to pregnancy, but it also received 40,000 comments supporting its inclusion. While the commission said it understood that both sides were expressing 'sincere, deeply held convictions,' it cited numerous federal cases that it said supported its interpretation that abortion is a pregnancy-related condition deserving of protection.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe new rules include extensive details on the types of accommodations that pregnant workers can request, from temporary exemption from jobs duties like heavy lifting to considerations for morning sickness.\nWomen's right advocates had campaigned for years for the law, arguing that the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act offered inadequate protection for pregnant workers. The 1978 law, which amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibited discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and marked a major shift for gender equality at time when pregnant women were routinely denied or pushed out of jobs.\nAdvertisement\nBut in order to receive workplace accommodations, pregnant women had to demonstrate that co-workers had received similar benefits for comparable needs, since the act stated only that pregnant workers must be treated similarly to other employees, not that they deserved special consideration. That put a burden of proof that many women found impossible to meet, forcing them to work in unsafe conditions or quit their jobs, according to A Better Balance, one of the most vocal advocates for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.\nThe new law makes clear that that pregnant workers are entitled to accommodations to keep doing their jobs, mirroring the process for workers with disabilities. It places the burden on employers to prove 'undue hardship' if they deny requests for modifications.\nThe EEOC typically handles between 2,000 and 4,000 pregnancy discrimination charges a year, many involving denial of workplace accommodations. A study conducted by A Better Balance found that in two-thirds of pregnancy discrimination cases that followed the 2015 Supreme Court ruling, courts determined the employers were allowed to deny accommodations under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.\nAdvertisement\nIn a prepared statement, A Better Balance Co-President Dina Bakst applauded the EEOC 'for issuing robust final regulations that appropriately recognize the broad scope of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.'\n____","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"science","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Alexandra Olson,Claire Savage","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/URLPJJX3KAI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.06219,"_id":"8ff6433771c44641e4961fffe19510aa"},{"title":"Oklahoma officials tell trans pro wrestler not to compete in their state","author":"Ben Brasch","published_date":"2024-04-18 19:03:45","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/04/18/aew-nyla-rose-oklahoma-trans","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The state's sports commission went out of its way to threaten Nyla Rose, a former AEW women's champion, if she wrestled women in the state again.","summary":"Oklahoma's sports commission has asked a nationally televised professional wrestling promotion to not have a transgender wrestler face off against other women wrestlers again.\nWashington native Nyla Rose \u2014 who works for All Elite Wrestling (AEW) \u2014 was warned by the Oklahoma State Athletic Commission not to wrestle another woman, according to the minutes of the Commission's Jan. 3 meeting.

Rose won after landing a power bomb.

The former AEW Women's World Champion has logged 99 wins and 47 losses while in AEW, according to the promotion's website.\nTransgender athletes have become a hotly debated topic in the broader culture wars, divided roughly into conservatives often arguing it isn't fair to other competitors and liberals saying it invalidates gender identities when people who identify as women can't compete against women. Battles over roster makeups have made their way into the courts, and to the desk of President Biden.\nNow, the debate has made it to a place that subverts the binary of supposed reality every week on television: professional wrestling, where the outcomes are predetermined. It is theater, not sport.

Videos showed them on the interior walls of portable toilets at the center's shelter near Mexico's border with Texas.\nResource Center Matamoros founder Gaby Zavala told The Associated Press the organization doesn't know who made the flyers and said her group 'does not encourage immigrants to register to vote or cast ballots in the U.S.'\nAdvertisement\nThe provenance of the flyers was still unknown Wednesday. They contained errors in spelling and grammar, and appeared to include verbatim paragraphs from the organization's English-language website that were translated into Spanish using online translation software.\nDespite the flyers' uncertain origin, unverified claims about them have proliferated online this week and came up during a congressional hearing Tuesday, when House Republicans raised them in their questioning of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\nThe episode reflects how rapidly claims related to the migrant surge at the border can spread and influence the political debate as the presidential election approaches. Former President Donald Trump and his allies have used the surge to say, without evidence, that Democrats are allowing migrants into country as a way to boost Biden's re-election chances. Only U.S. citizens are permitted to vote in federal elections and historically the number of noncitizens caught attempting to cast a ballot illegally is extremely small.\nAdvertisement\nImages and videos of the flyers at the Matamoros center erupted online after the Heritage Foundation's oversight arm posted them on the social platform X on Monday evening.\nThe conservative think tank shared an image of one of the flyers, which was labeled as coming from Zavala and contained both the Resource Center Matamoros logo and another logo in Spanish reading, 'all with Biden.' It also shared a video that showed multiple flyers posted inside portable toilets where migrants might see them.\nThe letter misspelled the Spanish word for welcome, 'bienvenidos,' as 'bienvedinos.' It also contained minor grammatical errors in Spanish, including an incorrect tense ('mientras esperan' should be 'mientras esperen') and the United States in lower case ('estados unidos').\nThe text appeared to lift a paragraph from Resource Center Matamoros' English-language website, reciting the first two sentences verbatim, but translated to Spanish. The flyer added two sentences \u2014 which do not appear on the group's website \u2014 saying migrants need to vote for Biden.\nAdvertisement\n'This flyer obviously seeks to prey on unsophisticated illegals and encourages them to illegally vote,' the Heritage Foundation wrote on one of its social posts.\nHeritage also published a short audio clip of Zavala having a conversation with an unidentified male. After the male says he is trying to help as many people as possible before Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, gets re-elected, Zavala can be heard saying, 'Believe me, we're in the same boat.' The nine-second exchange did not include any further mention of voting or elections.\nZavala did not answer detailed questions about the exchange and told the AP that her organization does not support political campaigns for or against candidates. She said such activity would be 'outside the scope of our mission.'\nThe Heritage Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAdvertisement\nAs of Wednesday it was not clear when the video was shot, who created and posted the flyers, how long they remained inside the portable toilets or whether any migrants saw them. The think-tank credited the discovery of the flyers to a website that frequently posts about border issues, and whose founder regularly appears on streaming programs that promote conspiracy theories.\nThe claims that Resource Center Matamoros was behind the flyers were shared far and wide online, amassing millions of views across social media platforms. Threats appeared on a pro-Trump website, calling for Zavala's neck to be snapped and for members of her organization to be hanged.\nA flurry of partisan researchers online dug into the group's background, trying to identify potential links to a variety of U.S. and left-wing campaigns and causes. The flyers briefly mentioned the Jewish humanitarian organization HIAS, on whose board Mayorkas once sat. That connection drove additional claims that both HIAS and the Biden administration were using the flyers to try to rig the election.\nAdvertisement\nHIAS told AP it did not produce the flyers, does not support their message and has not rented space from or had any ties to Resource Center Matamoros since 2022.\n'These flyers are a clear attempt to spread misinformation about HIAS' work to support refugees,' its statement read.\nBiden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa called the flyers disinformation and said they should be labeled that way on social platforms and websites.\nRepublican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Dan Bishop of North Carolina brought up the flyers during a congressional hearing with Mayorkas on Tuesday, the same day as the House sent articles of impeachment against him to the Senate.\nGreene accused Mayorkas of 'aiding NGOs (non-governmental organizations) to steal our elections through your budget.' She didn't pause to allow him to respond.\nAdvertisement\nMayorkas didn't immediately respond on Wednesday to the AP's request for comment.\nThe claims exploded online as Trump and other Republicans are claiming that the surge of migrants at the country's southern border increases the risk that some of them living in the country without documentation will vote illegally.\nWhen people in the U.S. register to vote, they confirm under penalty of perjury that they are U.S. citizens. Several states also verify that registration against federal and state databases.\nWhile there have been anecdotal instances of noncitizens casting ballots, various states have examined their voter rolls and found no indication of significant numbers of noncitizens voting in federal elections. Studies also have shown the incidence is exceedingly rare.\n___\nAssociated Press immigration writer Elliot Spagat contributed to this report.\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Valerie Gonzalez,Ali Swenson","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PYEOOLX4EYI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":4.938193,"_id":"599d7dbe7a88a81fbbc8e1082503ebef"},{"title":"Newsom proposes law to help Arizonans get abortions in California","author":"Mariana Alfaro","published_date":"2024-04-21 22:25:16","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/21/gavin-newsom-abortion-arizona","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The emergency legislation the governor is seeking would expedite the licenses of Arizona abortion providers to let them treat their patients in neighboring California.","summary":"California Gov.

It could help the president's reelection campaign court young voters, a key Democratic constituency, after many youth climate activists criticized the administration's approval of a massive drilling project on Alaska's North Slope last year.\nIn a separate move, Interior announced Friday that it will block a controversial road crucial to operating a planned copper and zinc mine in northern Alaska, saying it would threaten Indigenous communities and fragment wildlife habitat. Together, the two decisions are aimed at safeguarding some of Alaska's last wild places from development.\nAdvertisement\nIn a statement, Biden said he was proud of his administration's efforts to protect the Arctic for current and future generations.\n'Alaska's majestic and rugged lands and waters are among the most remarkable and healthy landscapes in the world, sustaining a vibrant subsistence economy for Alaska Native communities,' Biden said. 'These natural wonders demand our protection.'\nBoth moves carry political and legal risks for the administration. In particular, the protections for the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska are expected to face lawsuits from fossil fuel companies and fierce opposition from Alaskan lawmakers, including Rep. Mary Peltola, a popular Democrat who faces a tough reelection contest.\nPeltola, whose race will help determine which party controls the House, wrote in a social media post last week that the administration was ignoring Alaskans' preferences for drilling in the reserve.\nAdvertisement\n'In the end it should be up to Alaskans to decide what they want developed in their regions,' Peltola wrote. 'I'm calling on the Biden Administration to rethink this misguided action that would only hurt Alaskans and our domestic energy production.'\nThe roughly 23 million-acre National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska is one of the most ecologically valuable tracts of federal land. It provides a critical refuge for tens of thousands of migrating caribou, as well as polar bears, grizzly bears, walruses and waterfowl.\nTeshekpuk Lake, in the eastern part of the reserve, is one of the most important places for waterfowl in the entire Arctic. Up to 100,000 geese converge on the area each summer, seeking safety from predators as they molt and become flightless. The adjacent wetlands serve as breeding grounds for several types of shorebirds, including dunlins, sandpipers and black-bellied plovers.\nYet the reserve, about the size of Indiana, is also one of the most promising onshore oil prospects in the country. Two weeks before leaving office, President Donald Trump sought to open up the reserve to oil and gas leasing, saying it would make the United States less dependent on foreign sources of energy.\nAdvertisement\nThe Biden administration has reversed course. In a proposed rule released last year, the Interior Department called for designating approximately 13 million acres of the reserve as 'special areas' where future oil and gas leasing would be limited. The agency also recommended an outright ban on new leasing across 10.6 million acres \u2014 more than 40 percent of the reserve.\nThe final rule closely resembles the proposed rule. Like the proposal, it would not affect ConocoPhillips's controversial Willow oil drilling project or other existing leases in the reserve. Willow alone could produce between 576 million and 614 million barrels of oil over the next 30 years.\n'The approval of Willow was certainly disappointing to many of us who recognize the climate impact of oil and gas development,' said Rachael Hamby, policy director at the Center for Western Priorities, a conservation group. 'With the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska rule, I think we see a more balanced approach to managing public lands for multiple uses, including conservation.'\nAdvertisement\nFossil fuel companies disagree. In public comments on the proposed rule, ConocoPhillips wrote that it could 'significantly and adversely affect future proposals for new activities and developments' in the reserve. Armstrong Oil & Gas, which has leases in the reserve spanning 1.1 million acres, said the proposal could prevent it from building the infrastructure needed to access those tracts.\nThe final rule drew a mixed reaction from Alaska Natives, who have lived on the North Slope for millennia and subsist on its caribou.\nDoreen Leavitt, director of natural resources for the I\u00f1upiat Community of the Arctic Slope, said the administration did not adequately consult Alaska Natives about the economic benefits of fossil fuel development in this remote region. Taxes on oil and gas infrastructure have funded local schools, police officers, firefighters and sanitation services.\nAdvertisement\n'We're barely 50 years away from getting indoor plumbing, and that was brought by oil and gas,' Leavitt said, adding, 'We feel that our voices haven't been listened to.'\nRosemary Ahtuangaruak, the former mayor of Nuiqsut, a town of roughly 500 people on the North Slope, said oil drilling has brought both prosperity and peril to her community. The region around Nuiqsut (pronounced noo-IK-sut) is one of the fastest-warming places on Earth. Its average temperature has risen 4 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels \u2014 more than three times the global average, according to a Washington Post analysis of temperature data.\nThe warmer climate has taken a toll on caribou populations near Nuiqsut, where residents get half their food through hunting. Warmer waters and less sea ice have also shifted the migration patterns of bowhead whales and derailed the fall whale hunt, an essential tradition for the Inupiat of the North Slope.\nAdvertisement\n'We want to protect our cultural traditions,' Ahtuangaruak said. 'And we want to give future generations hope that they won't be continually fighting to protect our way of life.'\nInterior's decision to block Ambler Road is intended to safeguard such lifestyles. In an analysis released Friday, the agency found that the road could threaten the subsistence activities of more than 60 Alaska Native communities, up from 27 communities in a highly contested 2020 analysis completed during the Trump administration. It also found that the road could cause irreparable harm to caribou and permafrost.\nAs a result, Interior recommended that there should be 'no action' on the federal land where the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (AIDEA) wants to build Ambler Road. If finalized, the decision will prevent AIDEA from receiving a permit to construct the road, and it will effectively block the mining venture Ambler Metals from accessing the planned open-pit mine. The company has yet to seek or obtain permits for the mine.\nAdvertisement\nAIDEA, the state's publicly owned development corporation, had planned for Ambler Road to extend 211 miles, crossing 11 major rivers and breaking apart unspoiled tundra. Twenty-six of those miles would have carved through Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, sending giant trucks rumbling through wild lands where tens of thousands of caribou migrate.\nThe Trump administration approved a right-of-way permit for Ambler Road in 2020, saying it could provide access to significant copper and cobalt deposits. But after Biden took office, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland ordered a fresh review of the road, saying the previous administration had not adequately studied its environmental impact.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Maxine Joselow","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T5HTZWDTHMI6ZCYKXT5LQAGEGA_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":4.674777,"_id":"707c9213380426f154322c03b5eb2713"},{"title":"Karlie Kloss: Missouri should be allowed to vote on abortion","author":"Karlie Kloss","published_date":"2024-04-17 10:15:24","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/17/kloss-model-abortion-missouri","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Our fundamental freedoms are on the line \u2014 the right to abortion, and now, the right to have our voices heard at the ballot box.","summary":"Karlie Kloss is a model, entrepreneur and advocate.

It's fundamentally about freedom, dignity and bodily autonomy. That's why I've been engaged on this issue since I was a teenager. In 2012, I trained as a clinic escort to protect patients arriving for appointments at Planned Parenthood in St. Louis. Years later, I became involved with the incredible team at CHOICES in Carbondale, Ill. \u2014 across the state line from Missouri \u2014 and dozens of other clinics. When Roe fell, these clinics were overwhelmed. To help fill the gap, I launched an organization called Gateway Coalition to direct funding to various Midwest groups to provide accessible abortion care.

To help fill the gap, I launched an organization called Gateway Coalition to direct funding to various Midwest groups to provide accessible abortion care. And I continue to learn from organizations such as the Abortion Bridge Collaborative Fund advisory council and Abortion Care Network.\nThrough clinic visits and meetings with providers, center operators, and movement leaders across the country, I've learned how desperately patients need abortion care and what clinics go through to provide it. Clinics are being closed down, doctors are being blocked from providing care, and women are being forced to carry pregnancies against their will.\nAdvertisement\nThe Missouri I know supports freedom. Missourians know that decisions around pregnancy \u2014 including abortion, birth control, IVF and miscarriage care \u2014 are personal and private, and should be left up to patients and their families. As a mother, sister, daughter, friend and someone who cares deeply about the dignity of others, I'm working toward a future where everyone has the freedom to access abortion affordably and on a timeline that meets their needs. The Missouri Right to Reproductive Freedom Amendment is an important step toward that future. We have to pass it, and then we have to build on it. I'm committed to staying in this fight until abortion is safely and affordably available for every patient nationwide.\nIf you agree that patients, not politicians, should make their own health-care decisions \u2014 or simply that a small minority should not prevent a majority from winning at the ballot box \u2014 make your voice heard this election cycle.\nIf you're in Missouri, that means signing the petition for the Missouri Right to Reproductive Freedom Amendment by May 5, volunteering to gather signatures from others and then voting for the ballot initiative in the general election. Across the country, that means showing up at the polls when politicians try to twist the rules to serve their anti-choice agenda. And, this November, it means voting for candidates for president and Congress who will codify the protections of Roe v.

Brian Fitzpatrick in Tuesday's primary could offer hints about swing-district Republican sentiment in one of the most volatile White House races in years.\nAdvertisement\nWith few truly competitive House seats in play, the 1st Congressional District that Fitzpatrick represents is one of 16 districts nationwide that Democrat Joe Biden carried in the 2020 presidential election where voters also sent Republicans to Washington. By comparison, five seats won that year by Donald Trump, then the incumbent and now his party's presumptive 2024 nominee, are now held occupied by a Democrat.\nThe Republicans' House majority is so slim that Democrats need to flip just four seats in November to retake control. That makes the 'Biden 16' a significant group of competitive seats and they could go a long way in determining whether the next president has a friendly or hostile House next year.\nFifteen of those seats are in states that Biden won in 2020. The exception is Nebraska's 2nd District, represented by GOP Rep. Don Bacon. There are five seats in California, four in New York, two in Arizona and one apiece in New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia.\nAdvertisement\nSeveral of the 'Biden 16' are like Fitzgerald, winning year after year by tightrope-walking between challengers in primaries and general elections. Nine of them won a first term in in 2022, when Republicans took control of the House for the first time in four years.\nIn the fall, many will face the same Democrat they beat last time, sometimes narrowly.\nThe Fitzpatrick-Houck winner will face Democrat Ashley Ehasz, a former Army helicopter pilot who is uncontested in her primary. Fitzpatrick, a former FBI supervisory agent who beat Ehasz by 10 percentage points in 2022, is outraising Houck and Ehasz by millions of dollars, combined.\nBefore November, several others among the 'Biden 16' must beat back primary challenges from the conservative wing of the GOP.\nIn Nebraska, Bacon is facing perhaps his strongest primary test yet. If he wins, he will take on the same Democratic opponent, state Sen. Tony Vargas, whom he defeated two years ago by fewer than 3 percentage points.\nAdvertisement\nBacon has been a vocal supporter of sending more military aid to Ukraine, something opposed by his primary opponent, second-time congressional candidate Dan Frei.\nFrei, who contends the GOP base is fed up with Bacon, accuses the incumbent of flouting campaign promises by voting to increase spending and for bills that do nothing to stem the flow of immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.\nNearly all of the 16 races are considered toss-ups.\nRepublicans intend to hammer home a message about lax border security and high inflation under Biden. Democrats are warning that Republicans will pursue a national abortion ban as Democrats invoke an issue that has consistently worked in their favor at the ballot box since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022.\nAdvertisement\nNorth Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson, chair of the House Republicans' campaign arm, said the 'Biden 16' have formed strong identities in their districts and are emphasizing local issues.\nHudson said Biden's unpopularity and presidential turnout models are increasingly giving an edge to Republicans, with the GOP attracting more working-class voters who more likely to vote in presidential elections and help flip these districts to Trump.\n'The presidential turnout dynamics actually favor Republicans,' Hudson said in an interview. 'And then if you look, state by state, where our battlegrounds are, the presidential turnout is going to help us.'\nWashington Rep. Suzan DelBene, who leads the House Democrats' campaign arm, said Democrats will highlight what they say is the chaos at the highest levels of government when Republicans are charge of the House and Trump is in the White House. They will say Trump is a threat to democracy and Republicans are extremists and hypocrites who voted against major spending bills under Biden and then tried to take credit for the projects that landed in their districts.\nAdvertisement\nVoters 'want folks who are there to govern,' DelBene said in an interview. 'They're not looking for extremism. And so all we have to do is make sure that voters are aware of what they're doing. ... Holding them accountable for their actual votes, even though their rhetoric sometimes tries to be more moderate.'\nIn Pennsylvania, Houck's bid to unseat Fitzpatrick, who is backed by some labor unions and business groups, has a visceral feel that some Republicans say resonates with them.\nAt the Solebury Republicans' meeting on the grounds of a luxury hotel and wedding venue, Houck unwound the story of his arrest, describing federal agents with guns drawn as they descended on his Bucks County home in 2022.\nThey arrested him, in connection with the incident outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Philadelphia. Houck defended his actions, saying he acted to protect his 12-year-old son from abusive comments made by the clinic volunteer. The trial ended in an acquittal in 2023, and Houck, who runs a Catholic ministry group, said he began fielding requests to run for office.\nAdvertisement\nHouck's story struck a chord with Rose Cipriano, who came to hear him speak. Her husband picked up a Houck yard sign and Cipriano, who had previously supported Fitzpatrick, said Houck has changed her mind in the approaching primary.\n'I'm looking for fresh ideas, and I'm willing to take a chance and vote for him on Tuesday,' Cipriano said 'I've known his story since it happened, and I support him.'\nHouck's campaign echoes Trump's own defense against the criminal cases against him. It centers on the slogan 'Faith Family Freedom' while Houck talks about defunding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the federal departments of Agriculture, Education and Justice, calling them all unconstitutional.\nHouck has raised more campaign cash than any previous Fitzpatrick primary challenger. But he is well behind Fitzpatrick's fundraising and name recognition in a county where his brother previously held the congressional seat.\nAdvertisement\nFitzpatrick has the support of the county party and the backing of police and fire unions, whose large campaign signs endorsing him crop up every two years.\nBob Brooks, president of the Pennsylvania Professional Firefighters Association, said Fitzpatrick represents blue-collar workers like his union members.\n'And, if there was more blue-collar legislators, I think they would find more support from firefighters,' Brooks said in an interview. 'We support those who support us, and Brian has supported us on many levels.'\nRepublicans at the Solebury meeting encouraged Houck to stay involved in party politics.\nHouck said he will back Fitzpatrick in the general election if Fitzpatrick wins the primary but won't campaign for him, put off by what he said was Fitzpatrick failure to check on Houck's family after his arrest. Fitzpatrick didn't respond to interview requests.\nCipriano said she is disappointed in Fitzpatrick but said the stakes are too high for the party to be divided in November. She pledged to support Fitzpatrick should he win the primary.\n'I am behind the Republican Party 100%,' she said. 'So whoever's running, from the top down, gets my support.'\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Marc Levy,Mike Catalini","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BL5OW3H7DQI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":4.557456,"_id":"bc3cc116dd966a745a3e21420062eaf8"},{"title":"Timber companies claim carbon credits for trees they don't cut down","author":"Simeon Tegel","published_date":"2024-04-21 10:00:14","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/21/redd-carbon-credits-amazon-peru","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Whether and how much the approach helps the environment is hotly debated. Critics say it creates the impression of benefit at the expensive of more effective efforts.","summary":"I\u00d1APARI, Peru \u2014 At the entrance to its sprawling tract of virgin Amazon rainforest, the Peruvian timber company Maderacre turns ancient hardwood trees into flooring on an industrial scale.\nBeside the vast, modern facility, a reddish dirt road leads into the jungle where workers harvest wood that takes centuries to mature.\nwood that takes centuries to mature.\nAs it systematically removes the oldest trees from this stunning wilderness, Maderacre might seem an improbable seller of carbon credits, the financial instrument that in theory allows consumers and corporations to 'offset' their greenhouse gas emissions from air travel, ride-hailing apps, fashion purchases and other pollution-producing activities.\nAdvertisement\nThe company isn't earning credits by planting trees to absorb carbon dioxide. The offsets it sells are based on a hypothetical: An estimate of how many existing trees it prevents from being cut down.\nThere's a logic to this. Maderacre argues that unlike its neighbors \u2014 illegal loggers and homesteaders \u2014 it's carrying out selective, sustainable logging on its 1,000-square-mile timber concession that maintains the forest's ecological balance.\nBut the approach, known as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, or REDD+, raises questions about how to protect the world's forests, which sequester billions of tons of carbon, and about the booming carbon credit market. As the window to avoid catastrophic climate change closes, scientists are questioning the intricate methodologies used to calculate this lucrative counterfactual, known as 'avoided deforestation.'\nSome warn that it might actually be accelerating the climate crisis, as consumers, instead of curbing their emissions, buy credits that do not deliver on their green promises.\nThe stark contrast between Maderacre's lush concession and the barren land around it makes the benefits of offsets seem obvious. Pressing up against the forest's perimeter is a patchwork of dusty fields cleared by unregulated deforesters in a chaotic rush to settle this remote region.\nHousehold brands such as Shell, Southwest Airlines, Disney and Gucci all have used credits generated this way.\nSouthwest stressed that it offered credits to passengers on an optional basis but was not using them as part of its net zero strategy. Shell declined to comment. Disney and Gucci did not respond to requests to comment.\nAccording to S&P Global Commodity Insights, REDD+ represents nearly a third of the voluntary carbon market, worth $2 billion in 2021 but predicted to hit as much as $40 billion a year by 2030.\nBut Britaldo Soares, the professor at Brazil's Minas Gerais Federal University who created the software used by Maderacre, calls REDD+ a 'climate scam.'\n'This is a logging concession,' he said. He developed his Dinamica EGO program to measure the impact of government policies, he said, not to calculate credits. That's the equivalent, he said, of 'predicting the future with a crystal ball.'\nBarbara Haya, who heads the Carbon Trading Project at the University of California at Berkeley, said REDD+ projects around the world are generating 'phantom' credits.\nThe reason, she said, is simple: 'Everyone at the table benefits from more credits. There's over-crediting every which way you turn. It's systematic.'\nBy 'everyone,' she means project developers, the certification companies who set the rules, and the third-party auditors who determine whether a project is preventing forest loss.\nThe latter two, she stressed, have an incentive to approve projects, because rejecting them could deter others from contracting their services.\nWith some projects generating millions of credits, each representing a metric ton of carbon and trading for about $1.40 \u2014 sometimes significantly more \u2014 the temptation to exaggerate avoided emissions is powerful.\nVerra, the nonprofit that holds a 70 percent share of the global carbon project verification market, has to date issued 1.23 billion credits. But it isn't paid only for certification. The group also gets 20 cents per credit sold. Haya calls that a conflict of interest.\nDoubts exist around the baselines, the predictions of deforestation that would occur without a carbon concession. These are calculated in various ways, including projections from historical forest loss and comparisons with other parts of the forest.\n'Maybe they're deliberately exaggerated,' said Erin Sills, an environmental economist at North Carolina State University. 'But it's also perhaps because project developers are trying to predict the future. That's never possible.'\nThen there's 'additionality,' the concept that for emissions to have been avoided, the revenue generated by carbon credits must make the difference between the forest being saved or destroyed.\nAdditionality is difficult to calculate because most carbon projects are layered onto preexisting uses of the land: sustainable logging such as Maderacre's, ecotourism, Brazil-nut gathering \u2014 even protected areas with bans on extractive activities. Many should already have safeguards, such as security guards or perimeter fencing.\nAdvertisement\nSills is one of eight researchers who examined dozens of forest carbon concessions in Africa, Asia and Latin America. In a paper published last year in Science they found most reduced far less deforestation than was claimed.\nOf the 89 million carbon credits that the projects generated, they concluded, only 5.4 million represented genuine reductions in emissions.\nMaderacre had generated nearly 9.7 million credits by late 2021 for buyers including Canada's Scotiabank and the gas-guzzling Dakar Rally. The researchers said they found no evidence that the effort had achieved the deforestation claimed. (Scotiabank declined to comment; the Dakar Rally did not respond to a request for comment.)\nThat analysis is backed by Soares. 'Since it's already a [timber] concession and they have the obligation of conserving it,' he said, 'there's no additionality at all.'\nNelson Kroll, a manager at Maderacre, disagrees. 'Timber is timber, not oil or gold,' he said. 'A business based just on logging can't pay for everything you need to conserve the forest.'\nVerra acknowledges that calculating avoided emissions is complex and imperfect but disputes the researchers' conclusions. The organization stresses that the 'voluntary' carbon market was created by the private sector, pushed by consumer demand, to plug a gap left by governments' failure to set compulsory offset standards in the U.N. climate negotiations.\n'The best hasn't happened, but the good's done a lot of good,' Verra spokesman Joel Finkelstein said. The group constantly updates its methodologies, sometimes in response to harsh criticism from academics and environmentalists.\n'The science 15 years ago was very different to the science now,' Finkelstein said. 'At every point, we've been aiming for the best standard.'\nOn Maderacre's concession, squawking red and blue macaws swoop overhead as capuchin monkeys frolic in the canopy. The jaguar population is so dense that the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance runs a research project on the alpha predator.\nBut on the neighboring plots, Cebu cattle dot brown fields of low-quality pasture. Small, in many cases failed and abandoned, plantations of teak \u2014 not native to the Amazon \u2014 break up the terrain. Columns of smoke tower on the horizon.\nThe ecocide has been driven by the Interoceanic Highway. The 1,600-mile road, completed in 2011, was intended to connect Brazilian commodities to Peru's Pacific ports to feed China's insatiable economy.\nLittle freight now passes along the highway. Former Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo, who launched the highway with Brazilian President Luis In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, is now in pretrial detention, accused of taking a $25-million bribe in return for contracts to build it.\nYet the road has, literally, paved the way to destruction for this corner of the Amazon. Maderacre has at least kept the deforestation from overwhelming its concession.\n'The deforestation's real, and someone has to do the work,' said Kroll, a forestry engineer who previously worked as an Amazon park guard.\nHe stresses that Maderacre harvests one tree per hectare every 30 years, and takes only shihuahaco trunks with diameters more than 75 centimeters, a stricter standard than the legal minimum of 51 centimeters.\nAdvertisement\n'This isn't a timber concession. It's a nature concession,' Kroll said. 'Until we find ways for living forests to be economically competitive, they're going to continue being decimated.'\nSills believes sweeping change is needed.\n'We rely on these offsets to reduce our own footprints, but the result is net higher emissions,' she said. 'The climate's the real loser.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Simeon Tegel","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/33RFJXYDQGMGN75AXTAYZICJ7A.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":4.555319,"_id":"10471c6826cadb2eae6af1b76f2a7e49"},{"title":"Will there be a 'superbloom' this year in California?

There is no single definition of the event, but so far this year's blooms haven't been as vibrant or abundant as those that took over swaths of California last spring following drought-busting rains. This year, too, the state received ample winter rains.\nAfter especially wet winters, bursts of color may appear in the spring, drawing droves of visitors to California and other parts of the Southwest to glimpse the flowering fields and pose for pictures.\nHere are some key facts about the natural spectacle:\nWHAT'S A SUPERBLOOM?\nScientists don't agree on any one definition. Across California and Arizona, there are stretches of desert that can quickly transform into dense fields of wildflowers, since seeds lie dormant in the soil and then germinate and blossom at around the same time.\nAdvertisement\nA recent study found that such widespread blooms, which have been visible by satellite imagery in some years, take place after seasons with greater than 30% average precipitation, said Naomi Fraga, director of conservation programs at the California Botanic Garden, east of Los Angeles.\nDOES THIS YEAR COUNT?\nNo, according to Fraga. That's because there isn't a huge diversity in the flowers that have blossomed in places like California's Death Valley.\nThis year's blooms aren't as large or as dense as wildflowers in past years, she said.\n'When I think of superblooms, I think of a bloom that is so extraordinary, that's a once in a lifetime event,' Fraga said, adding that the wildflower display this year 'still makes a beautiful show.'\nLast spring, early April visitors to Southern California's Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve were treated to dazzling orange displays of the state flower. But around the same time this year, the fields were absent of the orange blooms, with the reserve's officials posting that the window for an impressive show was becoming 'increasingly narrow.'\nAdvertisement\nIn Death Valley, one of the driest places on earth, stretches of desert are dotted with gold thanks to sunflowers that emerged after an especially wet winter and spring.\nWhether that constitutes a superbloom is 'really in the eye of the beholder,' said Evan Meyer, executive director of the California-based nonprofit Theodore Payne Foundation, which works to preserve California's native plants.\nWHEN DOES IT HAPPEN?\nApril is typically the peak month for spring wildflowers, but in high-elevation places they can continue to blossom later into the spring.\nSuperblooms generally refer to low-elevation desert regions, Fraga said.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'It's much more geographic than seasonal,' Meyer said. 'Spring in the mountains hasn't started, and in the low desert, it's past its peak.'\nWhen temperatures rise in the desert, the flowers can quickly dry out.\nHOW DOES CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECT THE SUPERBLOOM?\nExperts say it might be too soon to tell.\nAdvertisement\nClimate change is making precipitation patterns more erratic, but the effects on wildflowers could play out over decades or even centuries, Fraga said, since seeds stay dormant in the soil for long periods of time.\nSouthern California received heavy rain last summer, unlike its usually dry summers, which she said probably stimulated flowers to germinate out of season. Winter temperatures also were higher than average, so many of them were able to stay in bloom through the spring season.\n'That made for a very unusual bloom,' Fraga said.\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Suman Naishadham","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PKAA7AX7TQI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":4.49561,"_id":"4898c4eaf38047127c0a68514280db62"},{"title":"They quit liberal public schools.

'Hello, Exodus students,' she said, addressing the group of 90 fifth- through 12th-graders who would eventually watch the video as part of their lessons from the Exodus Institute, an online Christian K-12 school Kali and her husband founded in 2021 with the motto 'Exit Public Education.' The video, which Kali was recording in her guest bedroom-turned-office, was the latest in a special enrichment program dubbed the 'Young Patriots Academy,' which aims to 'debunk the \u2018woke' lies taught in most public schools,' per the Exodus website.\nAdvertisement\nKali, who is half Black and half White, had a particular target that Friday: what she calls the left's unquestioning advocacy of reparations, the theory that the government should pay restitution to descendants of enslaved Americans.\nShe told her virtual class they were about to learn of the Quakers, and how White members of that religion helped fight slavery. She said that, throughout American history, there were good people and bad people. But focusing only on the bad, like she believes many public school teachers do, would be wrong.\n'Whenever you learn history,' she said, 'it's important to learn the full context of it.'\nKali Fontanilla leads 'Young Patriots Academy,' a program that aims to counter 'left-wing indoctrination' and the 'lies taught in most public schools.\" (Video: TWP)\nKali's online job marked a sharp departure from the years she and her husband, Joshua Fontanilla, spent teaching middle- and high school English in California's deep-blue Salinas district. The couple quit their jobs a year after the coronavirus pandemic began, disillusioned by school shutdowns and displeased by some colleagues' embrace of the Black Lives Matter movement, which both thought was wrongheaded and hateful for what they saw as its anti-police stance.\nKali, 41, and Joshua, who is 42 and of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent, had also grown convinced their school was teaching harmful ideas about race and history, including what they believe is the false theory America is systemically racist. Across the nation, mostly conservative mothers and fathers were raising similar alarms \u2014 anxiety that soon fueled an explosion of legislation restricting how educators can teach about race, sex and gender.\nBy April 2024, such laws had spread to affect half the nation's students. The claim that public schools teach left-wing 'indoctrination, not education' had become a commonplace on the right, repeated by parents, politicians and pundits.\nBut not, usually, by teachers. And that's why the Fontanillas felt compelled to act: They came direct from the classroom. They had seen firsthand what was happening. Now, they wanted to expose the propaganda they felt had infiltrated public schools \u2014 and offer families an alternative.\nIn 2021, eager to fulfill their mission, the couple moved to Florida to found their own Christian school in a state which, under Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), had become a haven for people with views like theirs. In the years since, they have grown their school to nearly 200 students, partly through Kali's appearances on conservative media like Fox News \u2014 but mostly through her social media.\nKali's Instagram videos, filled with right-wing rhetoric and delivered almost daily to her 333,000 followers, proved a powerful recruiting tool. But they also spurred thousands of critical messages from online observers who contended she was indoctrinating students into a skewed, conservative worldview. 'RACIST, ONE SIDED, WHITEWASHED OPINION,' one wrote on a recent post, just above someone else who declared: 'No one [is] impressed by the trash you are trying to sell.'\nNow, half an hour into her lesson on slavery, Kali told students how some Quakers risked prison time to assist people fleeing enslavement.\n'There are certain people that are saying, \u2018oh, White people owe Black people for slavery,'' Kali said. 'But what about the White people who were descendants of the Quakers, who actually had a lot of negative consequences that happened to them for helping free the slaves?'\nShe urged her students to keep pondering the question as they turned to their next assignment.\nK ali was a few years into studying for her master's degree in education at the University of California at Santa Cruz when, she recalled, a professor told her class to take a 'privilege walk.'\nKali was a few years into studying for her master's degree in education at the University of California at Santa Cruz when, she recalled, a professor told her class to take a 'privilege walk.'\nHe formed the students into a line, Kali said, and asked a series of questions: Have you ever seen a play? What about a concert? Students stepped forward if the answer was 'yes,' backward if the answer was 'no.'\nKali hated it. Although she came from a challenging background \u2014 her Jamaican father left her White mother early on, she said, and the family was always strapped for money \u2014 she wound up standing ahead of wealthier White classmates because her grandmother had insisted she be exposed to the arts. And she couldn't believe the professor didn't ask about sexual abuse. 'Even if you are the richest young person, White, whatever, if you've been sexually abused, that's the worst trauma you could ever receive,' Kali said.\nA spokesman for UC Santa Cruz confirmed Kali attended the school, but said he could not 'easily verify anything beyond that.'\nYears later, teaching English in Salinas, she was horrified when she saw other teachers giving students a 'privilege quiz' during a ninth-grade ethnic studies class. (The course became a statewide requirement a year later.) Curious and worried, Kali looked up the ethnic studies lesson plans in the school's internal systems and found evidence some colleagues were using the class to introduce students to 'critical race theory,' a college-level academic framework that holds racism is baked into American institutions. Kali had encountered the theory in graduate school \u2014 and loathed it, fearing it would convert students into victims who lay blame on racist systems rather than accept any individual responsibility.\nAdvertisement\nIn the ethnic studies class, teachers were urging students to study school policies 'through a Critical Race Theory framework,' according to screenshots of a presentation that Kali shared with The Washington Post, meaning they should analyze how 'race affects our experiences.' Students were told to take three 'Steps Against Hegemony,' per the power point: 'Analyze \u2018hidden curriculum.'' 'Use Critical Race Theory.' 'Be Active participants.'\nAsked about the ethnic studies course, district officials wrote in a statement that 'embedded in the lesson outcomes was the question for students to analyze whether or not race may be viewed as a contributor to one's experiences.' The district surveyed students who completed the class in 2022, officials wrote, and their 'feedback was overwhelmingly positive.'\nAround the same time, Joshua Fontanilla said he was also spotting what he perceived as bias at school. His suspicions stirred, he said, when he noticed his high school always announced meetings of the Gay-Straight Alliance club over the loud speakers \u2014 but not those of other clubs, like his chess group.\nbias at school. His suspicions stirred, he said, when he noticed his high school always announced meetings of the Gay-Straight Alliance club over the loud speakers \u2014 but not those of other clubs, like his chess group.\nJoshua then began combing through the 'American Dream' unit of the English curriculum, researching the politics of every author. He concluded that too many (at least 12 of 19) were 'left-leaning,' including \u2014 as Joshua saw it \u2014 'leftist' historian Studs Terkel, 'socialist' poet Langston Hughes and 'Dem' Walt Whitman.\nDistrict officials wrote in a statement that 'there is no evidence nor complaint ever brought forward regarding inequity in clubs being recognized during the announcements' and noted that the English curriculum conforms to California state standards. Officials added that the Fontanillas 'never made a complaint formally or informally to any district official.'\nA decade ago, Kali and Joshua said, they would have agreed with what their school was teaching. Both were raised in a blue slice of California by what they described as liberal families, and for a long time accepted those views without question.\nWhen Sira Taylor hired Kali to tutor her son in 2012, Kali was 'definitely left-leaning in her politics,' Taylor recalled. But Taylor, a Santa Cruz-area mother of two and self-professed independent, didn't care: She just knew Kali was good for her son, who was struggling to read and focus. Under Kali's tutelage, Taylor said, the boy's reading skills and academic performance soared. She still remembers how Kali let him run around the block whenever he got antsy.\n'She just really got the fact he was a young little boy who had a lot of energy,' Taylor said. 'He's a sophomore in college and an amazing student now, and he wouldn't be without her.'\nBy the time Kali finished tutoring Taylor's son, she and Joshua had begun to reconsider their Democratic allegiances.\nKali grew disillusioned with President Barack Obama when he signed a 2014 law cutting $8.7 billion in food stamps \u2014 a benefit that she, her mother and two siblings relied on throughout her childhood, she said. Joshua came to realize he agreed with many of President Donald Trump's policies, including his hard line stance on immigration.\nAnd both were disgusted with liberal politicians' response to the pandemic, especially their willingness to shut down schools, which Kali and Josh believed should have been last to close. The couple's concern over curricula, most notably the ethnic studies class, was the final straw.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIn summer 2021, her mind made up, Kali wrote a letter to the school board.\n'If the district continues to move forward with all these divisive teachings, it will only harden the hearts of many of our students,' she wrote in the letter, which the superintendent read aloud at a June board meeting after she submitted it for public comment. 'I have decided to resign from the district, which is the only reason I feel brave enough to speak out without fear of repercussions.'\nSalinas Union School District Superintendent, Dan Burns, reads a letter by Kali Fontanilla at a school board meeting on June 22, 2021. (Video: TWP)\nAt the board meeting following the letter-reading, several students gave speeches in favor of the ethnic studies course that helped prompt Kali's resignation. 'I would like to be able to learn my people's history at schools,' said one student, noting she is of Mexican and Latina heritage.\n'I feel like ethnic studies unites us more because we have a new understanding,' another student told a local reporter. It 'makes us understand why certain stereotypes are in our communities and how to fix them.'\nBut Kali wasn't there to hear them. Before that summer ended, she and Joshua packed their bags, put their chihuahua in a travel crate and headed for the Sunshine State.\nT he couple cashed out their California teacher retirement pensions to start up Exodus \u2014 and more than two years later, the school is just profitable enough to break even. Students pay between $2,000 and $8,000, based on need, for the standard K-12 offerings at Exodus, which include lessons on a wide variety of subjects including math, science, horticulture, French, business and the Christian faith. The Fontanillas said their student body is 50 percent Hispanic and Black, and 60 percent non-Christian. The degree Exodus confers counts as a regular high school diploma.\nThe couple cashed out their California teacher retirement pensions to start up Exodus \u2014 and more than two years later, the school is just profitable enough to break even.

Joshua said he discovered Southlands in 2019 at an event for the California chapter of Blexit, right-wing commentator Candace Owens' campaign to make Black Americans leave the Democratic Party.\nAt the event, Joshua met Joshua Duncan, an employee of Cornerstone Education Management Organization Inc., the company Southlands pays to manage the logistics of its online schooling arm \u2014 including hiring teachers and finding people, like the Fontanillas, who want to start their own schools.\nThe two Joshuas hit it off, and eventually, the Fontanillas won approval to launch the Exodus Institute. 'Josh and Kali are good people, they have a good message, there is definitely a market for what they're doing,' Duncan said.\nUnder the deal, the Fontanillas use the Southlands standard K-12 curriculum and teachers provided by Cornerstone. Tuition payments go directly to the companies, and the Fontanillas get a commission for every pupil, Duncan said.\nAdvertisement\nThe Fontanillas also offer their 'Young Patriots Academy,' which Kali leads, as a special enrichment program. Classes cost $29 a month and revolve around topics of the couple's choosing. The first class asked 'The American Dream: Is it just a dream?'\n'There's actually people in America, and some of them are teachers, that are teaching kids that the American Dream is not real,' Kali said in that video, which she shared with The Post. 'We're going to look at that and see if that's true or not.'\nKali and Joshua declined to make students and parents available for interviews, citing worries over privacy, but shared screenshots of enrollees' reviews of academy lessons.\n'I love love LOVE your teaching Ms. Fontanilla,' one student wrote. 'It is so encouraging that you explain and exposing [sic] the stupid things on the internet in a logical way.'\nThe couple have ambitions to scale up: Kali and Joshua hope to eventually cross 1,000 students, at which point, they calculate, they will no longer have to pursue side jobs like Kali's current gig as a senior fellow at the Capital Research Center, a conservative think tank. So far, Kali has found most success attracting clients through Instagram, despite the fact her account is regularly suspended for 'community violations,' she said.\nThe more right-wing and 'out there' Kali's commentary, the more attention and families she draws to Exodus, she said. In one recent video, she complained that 'Black history month has turned into Black idolatry month.' In another, she exhorted her followers to be 'preppers' and stock up on food and medicine in case 'all hell breaks loose' after what she predicted will be Trump's victory in November.\nafter what she predicted will be Trump's victory in November.\nBut the videos also inspire hate \u2014 messages by the dozen every day telling Kali to shut up, according to screenshots she shared with The Post. Online commenters regularly sling racial slurs and derogatory names: 'slave sellout roach.' 'dumb fukn bitch.' 'wish dot com Candice Owen.' 'Auntie Tomella.'\nThe harassment got so bad last year that, coupled with her chihuahua's death and an injury that prevented her daily workouts, it proved too much for Kali. She went into a depressive spiral and had to take a break from social media. She barely managed to film her lessons.\nJoshua and her faith pulled her through.

Authorities are looking for information on the vandals.","summary":"Earlier this month, a video posted to social media captured two men destroying ancient rock formations at Lake Mead National Recreation Area in Nevada. National park rangers are asking for the public's help in identifying the visitors, who could face federal charges for vandalizing protected land.\nIn the footage from April 7, a large man in a long-sleeve red shirt and another man in a black T-shirt stand atop a rock formation at Redstone Trail, one of the protected site's most popular hiking trails. The pair can be seen dislodging and shoving the boulders over the edge while a frightened girl screams and pleads with her father to not fall. The sandstone chunks crumble on their descent, millions of years of geologic history pulverized in seconds.\n'These aren't just rocks. They're ancient resources. They were formed millions of years ago,' said Neal Desai, senior director of the National Parks Conservation Association. 'That's why we as a country have set them aside and have ensured that they will be equally owned by all of us forever.'\nOn social media, Lake Mead officials shared incriminating images of the perpetrators defacing the rocks and requested information about the pair. Authorities are accusing the men of vandalism, which the National Park Service describes as 'an act of cultural violence.' It is also illegal.\nAn NPS spokesman said law enforcement rangers are investigating the case. The penalty depends on the type of damage and level of severity, and can range from a misdemeanor to a felony.\nAdvertisement\nJohn Haynes, the recreation area's public information officer, told Fox 5 KVVU-TV the vandals could face six months of jail time and a $5,000 fine. Lake Mead officials did not respond to a request for information.\nThe agency urges anyone who witnesses an illegal or irresponsible act on protected public land to take a video or photos of the infraction. They can anonymously share the information through the NPS tips line (888-653-0009), an online form or via email (nps_isb@nps.gov).\nDesai said the majority of visitors respect the sanctity of national park sites, but a few bad apples do roll through every so often.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAdvertisement\nState parks are equally vulnerable to vandalism. In 2013, three men leading a Boy Scout outing in Utah's Goblin Valley State Park pushed a boulder off its spindly rock pedestal. Two of the culprits were initially charged with third-degree felonies but pleaded guilty to misdemeanors.\nAccording to the NPS, 5.8 million people visited Lake Mead last year. The 1.5-million-acre natural playground features the largest reservoir on the Colorado River and a trove of geologic features sculpted over millions of years.\n'Geologically, it's really interesting because it has rocks spanning from really old \u2014 480 million-year-old sand dunes \u2014 to much more recent volcanic rocks that are 5 to 7 million years old,' said Matthew Lachniet, a geology professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\nLachniet said the defiled rocks originated from the Aztec sandstone unit that dates from the early Jurassic period. The rocks are roughly 180 million years old, and the formations are younger \u2014 only a couple million years old.\nAdvertisement\nThough common in the Southwest, he said, the red sandstone is unique to desert environments. Over time, the confluence of rain, frost and erosion shapes the rock into castle-like spires, delicate arches and sculptural shapes with peek-a-boo holes. These formations are typically weaker and easier to break, but they would not have shattered without human intervention.\n'They would have slowly disintegrated away, sand grain by sand grain, over hundreds of thousands to millions of years,' Lachniet said.\nThe destruction of the rocks will permanently alter Lake Mead's distinctive landscape, one of the primary reasons the recreation area was established in 1964. Park officials can't patch up the fallen rocks and perch them back on their original site. Once people intervene, the attraction is no longer a product made by Mother Nature.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Andrea Sachs","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IIUBDKW4EREJAFY3HFVX54XQQQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":4.2873974,"_id":"a8d89b52ed7527a3ea94b7a6725a41e4"},{"title":"Mississippi legislators won't smooth the path this year to restore voting rights after some felonies","author":"Emily Wagster Pettus","published_date":"2024-04-17 21:47:22","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/17/mississippi-felony-voting-rights/1139d6ba-fd04-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Civil rights advocates say Mississippi needs to simplify the process of restoring voting rights to people convicted of some felonies","summary":"JACKSON, Miss. \u2014 Kenneth Almons says he began a 23-year sentence in a Mississippi prison just two weeks after graduating from high school, and one of his felony convictions \u2014 for armed robbery \u2014 stripped away voting rights that he still has not regained decades later.\nNow 51, Almons told lawmakers Wednesday that he has worked hard and remained law-abiding since his release, and he wants to be able to vote.\n'It would mean I am no longer considered a nobody,' Almons said.

The state's previous attorney general, a Democrat, issued a ruling in 2009 that expanded the list to 22 crimes, including timber larceny and carjacking.\nIn 1950, Mississippi dropped burglary from the list of disenfranchising crimes. Murder and rape were added in 1968. Attorneys representing the state in one lawsuit argued that those changes 'cured any discriminatory taint,' and the conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals court agreed in 2022.\nTo have voting rights restored, people convicted of any of the crimes must get a pardon from the governor or persuade lawmakers to pass individual bills just for them, with two-thirds approval of the House and Senate. Lawmakers in recent years have passed few of those bills, and they passed none in 2023.\nAdvertisement\nTwo lawsuits in recent years have challenged Mississippi's felony disenfranchisement.

The restoration would occur five years after conviction or after release from prison, whichever is later.\nSenate Constitution Committee Chairwoman Angela Hill, a Republican from Picayune, killed the bill when she didn't bring it up for consideration before a March 21 deadline. In response to questions Wednesday, Hill told The Associated Press she blocked it because 'we already have some processes in place' to restore voting rights person by person.\nAdvertisement\nRep. Kabir Karriem, a Democrat from Columbus, led a House hearing Wednesday and said restoring voting rights 'is a fundamental human rights issue.'\n'Let us remember that the fight for voting rights is a fight for justice, equality and democracy itself,' Karriem said.\nRep. Zakiya Summers, a Democrat from Jackson, served as an election commissioner before winning a House seat in 2019. She said a constituent called her upset one year because he went to his longtime precinct and his name had been removed from the list of registered voters. Summers found out the man had been convicted of a disenfranchising felony.\nDemocratic Sen. Hillman Frazier of Jackson filed a bill to restore the man's voting rights, and the Legislature passed it. But Summers said some 55,000 Mississippians with felony convictions remain disenfranchised.\n'It shouldn't matter if you have a relationship with your legislator that you can get your voting rights restored,' Summers said.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Emily Wagster Pettus","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CECPXVH5AQI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":4.2863708,"_id":"794aa9ba2280c5d1ad6be51aad00ed07"},{"title":"Columbia leaders face scrutiny from lawmakers on campus antisemitism","author":"Susan Svrluga","published_date":"2024-04-17 09:30:20","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/04/17/columbia-congress-hearing-antisemitism-campus-protests-israel-gaza","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The House Committee on Education and the Workforce summoned the school's president and other leaders to testify on campus antisemitism.","summary":"Columbia University leaders will face scrutiny from lawmakers Wednesday about what they have done to combat campus antisemitism since the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza war, which has touched off intense protests at colleges across the country.\nIn December, the presidents of MIT, Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania testified on campus antisemitism before the Republican-led House Committee on Education and the Workforce. Lawmakers repeatedly asked whether calls for the genocide of Jews violated their campus policies, and the presidents' cautious, legalistic responses shocked many when they declined to say yes.

Indeed, to many in our community, Israel's very survival appeared to be at stake.' For others, 'Oct. 7 and the ensuing war in Gaza were part of a larger story of Palestinian displacement, as well as a continuing and escalating humanitarian catastrophe.'\nShe wrote about the difficulty of balancing the free speech rights of pro-Palestinian protesters and the impact their demonstrations had on Jewish students, and said the university is figuring out boundaries, such as designating appropriate space for protests.\nAdvertisement\nShe said official university statements should be limited to issues about life on campus, and 'the university should return to its core mission of fostering a range of perspectives and the scholarship, discoveries and good citizenship that flow from it. At the same time, students and faculty should feel unconstrained in developing their own opinions.'\nColumbia's website already states the answer to a question that tripped up the other presidents: 'Calls for genocide against the Jewish community or any other group are abhorrent, inconsistent with our values and against our rules.

Tammy Baldwin in the race that is essential for Democrats to win in order to maintain their majority in the Senate. A Marquette University Law School poll this week showed the race is about even among likely voters.\nBaldwin and Democrats have been attacking Hovde over comments he first made April 5 on a Fox News radio show about nursing home voting. Who can vote in a nursing home, and how they cast their ballots, has been a hot issue in Wisconsin since 2020 when supporters of former President Donald Trump alleged that people were voting illegally.\nAdvertisement\nNo charges were brought, and President Joe Biden's victory over Trump has withstood a nonpartisan audit, numerous lawsuits, a partial recount and a review by a conservative law firm.\nBut Hovde has been raising the issue of nursing home voting when discussing what he said were problems with the 2020 election.\n'We had nursing homes where the sheriff of Racine investigated, where you had 100 percent voting in nursing homes,' Hovde said.\nThat claim of 100% voting in nursing homes, first made by former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman in a discredited report, has never been verified. Voting data has shown that participation in nursing homes across the state was much lower than 100%.\n'If you're in a nursing home, you only have a five, six-month life expectancy,' Hovde said last week on the 'Guy Benson Show.' 'Almost nobody in a nursing home is in a point to vote.'\nAdvertisement\nBaldwin, in reaction to Hovde's comments, said last week that 'thousands of Wisconsinites live in nursing homes.'\n'Eric Hovde does not have a clue what he's talking about,' she said on MSNBC.\nIn two subsequent interviews this week, when asked to clarify his comments in the wake of Democratic criticism, Hovde accused his opponents and the media of 'political hits.'\n'They tried to say I didn't want elderly people to vote,' Hovde said Monday on WISN-AM. 'I don't even know how they came up with that.'\nHovde reiterated that his issue was based on reports of people who questioned how their severely ill relatives in nursing homes had voted.\nRacine County Sheriff Christopher Shmaling, a Trump backer, said in 2021 that the families of eight residents told investigators they believed their love ones did not have the capacity to vote but ballots were cast for them.\nAdvertisement\nHovde this week said 'a large percentage' of nursing home residents 'are not in the mental capacity to (vote).'\nBut he said that does not mean he thinks elderly people should not be allowed to vote.\n'I think elderly should absolutely vote,' he said Wednesday on WSAU-AM.\nNursing home voting became a focus for Trump supporters following his narrow loss in Wisconsin in 2020.\nState law requires local election clerks to send so-called special voting deputies to nursing homes to give residents an opportunity to vote.\nThe Wisconsin Elections Commission, in a bipartisan 5-1 vote in March 2020, determined that poll workers could not be sent into nursing homes to help with voting due to a safer-at-home order issued by Gov. Tony Evers early in the COVID-19 pandemic. The order came at a time when nursing homes were severely limiting who could come into their facilities, often not even allowing immediate family members inside.\nAdvertisement\nAn audit by the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau determined that the elections commission broke the law when it told clerks not to send or attempt to send deputies into nursing homes.\nSchmaling, the sheriff and a Trump backer, called for criminal charges against the commissioners who voted not to send in voting deputies. But the Racine County district attorney declined to charge, citing lack of jurisdiction.

Indeed, the uncertainty extends well beyond those directly embattled countries to other traditional U.S. allies such as Japan, South Korea and Europe.\nThe reasons for this uncertainty are many, but all trace to one main source: a sense that the United States' own post-World War II bipartisan foreign policy consensus is fraying around the edges. That challenge was both exposed and accelerated by the rise of Donald Trump and a selfish, simplistic, 'America First' ideology in the Republican Party. Parallel to that, the progressive wing of the Democratic Party increasingly questions the U.S.-Israel relationship, as well as long-standing commitments to other Middle East partners such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\nFor now, U.S. allies can breathe easier, thanks in large part to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and his willingness \u2014 albeit much too belated \u2014 to resist far-right forces in his own party at the risk of his position. With his support and skillful management of the legislative process, large majorities of the House got an opportunity to work their will, which was to support $95 billion in aid to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and others in the Indo-Pacific. (Crucially, the package includes not only $17 billion to help Israel defeat Hamas and hold off Iran and its proxies, but also $9 billion in humanitarian aid, much of it destined to help Palestinian civilians.) President Biden can soon sign the legislation.\nAdvertisement\nThe Ukraine measure is by far the most important of the three, since the country faces the most immediate threat. It is low on ammunition and under relentless Russian military pressure that might lead to major losses or even defeat. The $60.8 billion worth of assistance will provide Ukraine with much-needed artillery shells and air-defense assets, without which it might not be able to withstand President Vladimir Putin's bid to subjugate a neighbor, likely followed by similar aggression against others.\nA core U.S. interest \u2014 Europe's security \u2014 is at risk. Though it's unconscionable that 112 of the 214 GOP representatives voting were 'nays' on the Ukraine aid (all 210 Democrats who voted were 'ayes'), the House's top Democrat, Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), was right to acknowledge that 'traditional conservatives, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, have risen to the occasion.' Mr. Jeffries, too, rose to the occasion by allowing Democrats to vote for a procedural rule that advanced the measures. He intimated that Democrats would help Mr. Johnson if he faced a far-right revolt over Ukraine. This deft hint at what would have been a remarkable bipartisan rescue of a GOP speaker seems to have helped ultimately defuse Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's (R-Ga.) threats to unseat Mr. Johnson.\nThis is a historic moment. A de facto bipartisan coalition government has maintained U.S. global credibility. Yet it feels more like an inflection point than a conclusion. The world, and the United States, are changing. It is changing so fast, in fact, that part of what happened over the weekend was a vote to force eventual Chinese divestment of TikTok or an outright ban. This cellphone app, which 150 million Americans, generally young people, use for information and entertainment, barely existed a decade ago. Now U.S. politicians from both parties regard it as a possible means for the People's Republic to exercise malign influence over U.S. public opinion.\nAdvertisement\nMore conflict over foreign policy priorities, both between and within the two parties, seems inevitable. Mr. Trump has suffered a setback but still controls the GOP. Progressive Democrats are far from done pressing their case against unconditional aid to Israel; 37 of them voted against helping Israel this time, in rare agreement with 21 right-wing Republicans, albeit for different reasons.\nFollow this author Editorial Board 's opinions\nFollow this author\nEditorial Board\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nU.S. alliances endure, but the stage is set for a recalibration of their terms.

King's April 6 op-ed, 'D.C. has a truancy problem. Solutions must include the home.':\nMr. King has done D.C. a service on this vexing and chronic issue once again. He very correctly points out the shortcomings of the D.C. government's policies in this problem area. Clearly, the deputy mayor for education and the schools need to play a crucial role in dealing with this. But, as Mr. King points out, unless and until the parents are required (and helped) to meet their responsibilities, major improvements are unlikely to happen. Two issues remain unaddressed, however: First, does the deputy mayor have the will and capacity to take the needed actions? And second, to what degree are poverty and, say, single-mother households behind the problem, and if so what problem-solving options do we have?\nRichard Moore , Washington\nRichard Moore, Washington\nFocusing on children's health\nThe April 11 news article 'Ohio GOP governor sells public health by focusing on kids' has an important undertone. Investing in children's health is our most powerful lever to create a healthier society and stronger economy. Gov. Mike DeWine (R) says, 'It's hard to sell stuff on the basis of public health.' I know the feeling. As a pediatric surgeon and CEO of a children's health system, I fight the uphill battle of selling public health every day.\nAdvertisement\nI believe Mr. DeWine has got it right. In this country, we mistakenly equate health with medical care. Medical care is an important but relatively small part of health. The governor's health agenda is built around children, as it should be. It includes safety, good nutrition, freedom from violence, early education and more. All these factors are major determinants of health, and all can be markedly affected by small investments during childhood.\nBeyond improving our population's health, this agenda's economic benefits are enough to appeal to both sides of the aisle. Studies show that spending a dollar now to set a child up for lifelong health yields shockingly high returns to taxpayers and the broader economy for years, decades and even generations to come. Mr. DeWine is correct in saying, 'Everyone wants to see kids do better.' I couldn't agree more. It is time to prioritize public health by investing in our children.\nR.

We saw this vividly during the pandemic beginning in 2020, when urban dwellers relied on green spaces as a rare source of beautiful and socially distanced outdoor respite.\nClimate change gives us the clear imperative \u2014 and opportunity \u2014 to prioritize nature in the urban planning of U.S. cities. What does this look like? A study from the Global Center for Clean Air Research finds that the unique infrastructure of botanical gardens has a measurable cooling effect on city air temperatures. This emphasizes the importance of plants, including trees, in greening our cities. By restoring and conserving a diverse array of plant life, especially in dense urban environments, we create much more livable cities for people, wildlife and future generations.\nAdvertisement\nNo less valuable are the communities that green spaces cultivate. Urban farms and community gardens are a powerful way to plant social connections, while also spreading nature within cities.\nWe urge all city leaders and urban planners to support well-managed urban conservation projects and green spaces. As the percentage of Americans living in cities rises sharply, doing so has the potential to be transformational.\nJennifer Bernstein , New York\nJennifer Bernstein, New York\nThe writer is president and CEO of the New York Botanical Garden.\nThe writer is president and CEO of the New York Botanical Garden.\nNot all experiences are the same\nRegarding Ariel Dorfman's April 11 Thursday Opinion commentary, 'Ecuador takes a page from Pinochet with embassy assault':\nBefore we condemn Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa to purgatory for violating Mexico's sovereignty by storming its embassy in Quito to arrest former vice president Jorge Glas, let's look at what Mr. Dorfman did not say in his piece. Mr. Dorfman compares this action with his own experience of escaping a certain death at the hands of oppressive military dictator Augusto Pinochet by finding refuge in the Argentine Embassy in Santiago, Chile, in 1973.\nAdvertisement\nBut Mr. Dorfman was truly vulnerable, and his refugee status saved his life. Mr. Glas, on the other hand, was convicted twice for corruption, receiving prison sentences of six and eight years. In one case, he was convicted of taking millions of dollars from a Brazilian construction company and, in the other, he was found guilty for his role in a scheme that collected bribes for public procurement.\nTo further question whether Mr. Glas was even worthy of asylum, he was released from prison early in a controversial ruling by Judge Emerson Curipallo. Judge Curipallo is now in custody pending an investigation into his alleged role in a bribery scheme involving favorable rulings for a drug lord and others.\nMr. Dorfman cites the importance of respecting the 20th-century refugee protections that are included in a series of agreements and laws. Are these protections designed for convicted criminals? If so, where then does the search for asylum by bad people end?\nAdvertisement\nMaybe it's time to revisit these agreements and laws to ensure that those most vulnerable are protected in their time of need while not giving protection to convicted criminals such as Mr. Glas.\nCurtis Schaeffer , Falls Church\nCurtis Schaeffer, Falls Church\nThe need for Ukraine aid\nRegarding the April 15 news article 'Iran attacks add urgency to stalled aid efforts for Israel':\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nWithout reservation, I support Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. I agree entirely that Israel is of central political and historical importance to the United States. This said, I take issue with Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) when he states that 'Israel's a much closer ally, is a much more core American national security interest' than Ukraine.\nMr. Vance is dead wrong. When Israel is attacked, we must surely support it with the weapons and materiel needed to secure their self-defense. To my knowledge, however, we are not bound by treaty to place troops in Israel, nor to make war directly against another nation on Israel's behalf. The same cannot be said of Europe.\nAdvertisement\nRussia has made clear that it aspires eventually to reconquer those European countries once comprising the Soviet empire. Ukraine stands in the way of that aspiration. Some countries of the old U.S.S.R. are now our NATO allies, whom we are formally required to defend in the event of attack. Should Ukraine fall, and history be a guide, Russia would gain borders with its former vassal states and then could pick its spots to begin snatching territory from NATO's easternmost members. In this case, more U.S. troops would have to be deployed to Europe at incalculable risk to us and the entire world.\nIn a real sense, the United States is already fighting its war with Russia. Ukrainian citizens, however, are doing the fighting for us; their lives and their blood, not ours, are lost. What do we gain for the money and equipment supplied to NATO or to Ukraine? We gain the privilege of watching a war fought on European ground, at massive cost to its people and not so much to ours \u2014 in my view, a pretty good bargain.\nMr. Vance and his some of his Republican colleagues in Congress seem to be advocating for Russia, in effect making arguments for the Russian cause. My response: It is neither fair nor accurate to compare the gravity and enormity of our obligation to NATO (or Ukraine) with our close ties to Israel or, please, to connect any of this with our problems at the border with Mexico.\nAdvertisement\nBill Coe , Washington\nBill Coe, Washington\nThree parties aren't a crowd\nIn the April 9 Prompt 2024 newsletter, 'Why is it so hard to find a winning third-party candidate?,' Alexi McCammond and her colleagues made several meritorious points. However, it is important to note that third-party and independent candidates must contend with various built-in roadblocks from state sore-loser and disaffiliation laws to debate rules controlled by the two-party duopoly and designed to stifle competition.\nAdditionally, in the case of No Labels' recent attempt to recruit a 'unity ticket,' potential candidates were fearful of playing the role of spoiler and tipping the election to Donald Trump. Enactment by each state of a unified, nonpartisan/open primary system in conjunction with ranked-choice voting (RCV) as practiced in Alaska would render moot that major criticism of the No Labels ballot access effort. RCV shuts down the spoiler argument by eliminating the candidate with the least number of votes round by round until a majority of votes is obtained by one candidate. Such a reform offers a long-term solution to reduce polarization in our politics, and serves fairness as opposed to disenfranchisement by allowing independent/unaffiliated voters to participate in state-funded primaries. No Labels and other like-minded groups can work together to advocate such reforms and need not win an election to win the day.\nKenneth F. Cerullo , Mahwah, N.J.\nKenneth F.

Biden endorsed the package and last month said he would sign an earlier version of the TikTok legislation that the House passed.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2020, Trump issued an executive order to ban TikTok if its parent company did not sell it within 45 days. The order was later blocked in court.\n'As far as TikTok is concerned, we're banning them from the United States,' Trump said in July 2020.\nBut Trump's public stance on the social media app swung in the other direction in recent months, with the former president arguing in March that a TikTok ban would only empower Facebook, which he has called 'an enemy of the people.' Trump's post on Monday appeared to be the first time he explicitly referenced Biden while railing against proposals to force a TikTok sale.\nAsked for comment on Trump's post, Biden's reelection campaign referred to the White House, which denied it was working to shut down TikTok.\n'We've been clear: we do not want to ban apps like TikTok,' White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said in a statement. 'What we want \u2014 and what the legislation we support would do \u2014 is ensure that TikTok becomes owned by an American company so that our and our children's sensitive personal data stays here instead of going to China and so that Americans' understandings and views can't be manipulated by algorithms potentially controlled by the [People's Republic of China].'\nAdvertisement\nTrump accused Biden of wanting to shut down TikTok to 'help his friends over at Facebook' become more powerful and 'be able to continue to fight, perhaps illegally, the Republican Party.' Under the bill passed on a 360-58 vote by the House Saturday, TikTok's owner would have up to 360 days to divest, meaning any ban is not likely to happen until after Election Day.\nThe chamber in March passed an earlier version of the bill trying to force a TikTok sale on a shorter timeline, but it has languished in the Senate. The latest proposal's attachment to the foreign aid package could boost its chances in the upper chamber.\nTrump's reversal on TikTok raised questions about his relationship with Jeff Yass, a Republican megadonor from Pennsylvania who is also a TikTok investor. Trump, who is working to cultivate more heavyweight GOP donors as Biden builds a large fundraising advantage, met earlier this year with Yass but said afterward that they did not discuss TikTok.\nAdvertisement\nA former top aide in Trump's White House, Kellyanne Conway, is advocating for TikTok in Congress and has spoken to Trump about the importance of defending the application, The Washington Post reported last month. Conway is being paid by the Club for Growth, the conservative group that counts Yass as one of its biggest donors.\nTrump has called TikTok a national security threat but also touted its popularity, saying in a March interview with CNBC that there is 'a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok.'\n'As you know, I was at a point where I could have gotten it done if I wanted to,' Trump said, suggesting he ultimately wanted to leave the matter to Congress. 'I sort of said, \u2018You guys decide, you make that decision,' because it's a tough decision to make. Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Patrick Svitek","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4C5JJT7HLI2E5DL5MSNO5CGQUI_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":4.169421,"_id":"e1e587ec6ac0052af84253b0b3f420c0"},{"title":"How the election feels around the country","author":"Dave Barry","published_date":"2024-04-16 10:00:05","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/16/election-postcards-2024","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Here's how the 2024 election is manifesting in communities coast to coast.","summary":"This election cycle, we've invited talented writers from around the country to reflect on how the political contests are manifesting in their communities.

We'll be publishing accounts from these writers at key moments leading up to Election Day. Dave Barry: We Floridians are hopeful (for a meteor strike)\nGreetings from the Sunshine State! The mood down here, as we anticipate the 2024 presidential election, is one of hopefulness. Specifically, we're hoping that a large, previously undetected meteor will strike the planet before November. Granted, this would mean the end of human civilization, but at least we wouldn't have to go through with the election.\nHa ha! I'm kidding, of course. No, wait, I'm not. Floridians are wildly unexcited about this election. I know this because I have personally spoken to nearly six of the state's 23 million residents \u2014 in professional journalism, we call this 'assessing the public mood' \u2014 and in every single case, when the election came up, these residents assumed the facial expression of a person who has just opened the door to a port-a-potty on the last day of a midsummer chili festival.\nThis is not to say Floridians don't care about the issues. For example, we're deeply concerned about the border. I don't mean the border with Mexico; I mean the border with Georgia. That's how the New Yorkers are getting in. Tens of thousands of them move to Florida every year, lured by our abundant sunshine, our low taxes, our relaxed standards regarding the storage of highly classified government documents and our policy of permitting people to continue to legally drive long past the point where they have essentially the same neural reaction time as a zucchini.\nAdvertisement\nThe problem is, the New Yorkers are buying property down here, and they're very aggressive. If you go to a party and have too much to drink, you could very well wake up the next morning to discover you sold your house to a New Yorker. I myself have done this a half-dozen times, and it has to stop.\nAnother issue we have in Florida is bears on crack. I am not making this issue up. The Florida legislature recently passed a bill that would relax the penalties for killing bears, and one of the sponsors, Rep. Jason Shoaf (R), made the following statement (Google it if you don't believe me): 'We're talking about the ones that are on crack, and they break your door down, and they're standing in your living room growling and tearing your house apart. When you run into one of these crack bears, you should be able to shoot it, period.'\nPeriod!\nOf course, these are not the only issues we Floridians care about. We don't live in a bubble down here. We're well aware that the nation faces critical challenges, both at home and abroad, and as the presidential election approaches, we share the same concern felt by all Americans in these uncertain times, namely: What happens if some New Yorkers buy a house occupied by crack bears? In that scenario, my money would be 100 percent on the New Yorkers. But I think we can agree, as a nation, that it would be fun to find out.\nDave Barry is a novelist and a former humor columnist for the Miami Herald.\nDave Barry is a novelist and a former humor columnist for the Miami Herald.\nAngela Garbes: This election is as exciting as Washington's dreary weather\nIn much of Washington state, winter consists of approximately six months of interminable gray and drizzle. Survival means endurance \u2014 living in perpetual dampness and managing your expectations. When the sun makes its brief, brilliant appearance in March, you mustn't get your hopes up; it will be months before you can reliably count on sunshine and blue skies.\nIt seems a little basic to turn the weather of the Pacific Northwest into a metaphor for this year's presidential election, but if the cloud cover fits \u2026\nAny buzz surrounding the state primaries, which were settled weeks ago, has mostly faded. Both President Biden and Donald Trump won handily. The prevailing sentiment of Washingtonians runs along the lines of 'Meh, what does it matter, they don't even campaign here.' Indeed, neither candidate visited Washington state ahead of its primary elections, and it's unlikely they will spend much time campaigning here for the general.\nThough Biden garnered 84 percent of the Democratic vote, 10 percent of party voters marked 'uncommitted delegates' as a way of officially registering their discontent with the president's financial and military support of the Israeli genocide of Palestinians. It was another tactic in the regular series of nonviolent protests in the past five months that have shut down Seattle's Space Needle; clogged Interstate 5, the highway that runs through Seattle's city center; disrupted city council meetings in Spokane; and seen high school and university students walk out of classrooms across the state.\nAdvertisement\nTrump won the Republican primary easily with 76 percent, though Nikki Haley \u2014 who dropped out of the race a week before the primary \u2014 still garnered nearly 20 percent of party votes. The familiar liberal-conservative divide found across the United States corresponds to urban-rural areas of Washington. In small towns across Washington, where properties are bigger, Trump flags and banners also tend to be large. But if you look closely, many are weathered and dirty, having endured four years of elements and hanging outside. They flap in the wind, passive, with the same sort of resignation found in voters.\nBiden will almost certainly win Washington in the general, but there's no sense of pride, excitement or energy around this fact. 'We've been reading for months how the election will come down to 10,000 votes in like six states,' a father at an elementary school pickup said. Washingtonians, like so many Americans, understand this as a rematch between two old men no one seems to particularly like. The election will come down to the same battleground states far from our corner of the country, and we'll sit back and watch. Summer will come and go, warming our skin and spirits. But by November, we'll have settled back into the familiar gloom.\nAngela Garbes is a nonfiction author based in Seattle.\nAngela Garbes is a nonfiction author based in Seattle.\nMelissa Fay Greene: Look to Atlanta's ever-changing suburbs\nAriel Baverman, an agent for Coldwell Banker Realty, sells homes north of Atlanta to a diverse array of clients in neighborhoods that once epitomized White flight. Her territory includes counties her Jewish parents once felt uncomfortable driving through. It includes long-ago 'sundown towns,' so named because Black people would find themselves in extreme peril if still in the vicinity after dark.\nReal estate promotions now describe these towns \u2014 with their boutiques, coffee shops, breweries and alfresco dining \u2014 as 'cute.' 'You know, they'll have the cute railroad tracks that go through downtown,' Baverman says. 'You can have brunch and walk around and shop. The bookstores host children's authors. There's live music.'\nBig houses with front porches and deep backyards are more affordable out here than their equivalents near most big cities. With nearly 328,000 transplants in 2022, Georgia ranks fifth-highest in the number of residents who lived in a different state the previous year. Thousands are unpacking in precincts that voted for Donald Trump in a landslide in 2016 and in 2020 delivered Georgia to Joe Biden. 'Republicans like breweries and walkable neighborhoods, too,' says Bernard Fraga, associate professor of political science at Emory University. 'But young people move more and highly educated young people move even more \u2014 they're the ones who have the money to move around \u2014 and those cohorts are, on average, more liberal. Outsiders still see these counties as conservative strongholds, like in the 1980s. As they turn purple, some observers mistakenly conclude: \u2018Older white voters must be rejecting Trump and favoring Democrats again.' That's not the case.'\nAdvertisement\nThey're turning purple because older White voters are being swamped by newcomers. 'Georgia is purple at the federal level,' Fraga continues, 'and still very red at the state level, but people from East Coast and West Coast cities see Atlanta now as one of these cool destinations where they'll be okay. Atlanta is a beacon.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBaverman recently helped a Seattle couple buy a spacious house in Acworth, northwest of Atlanta.

Three feet tall and some 15 feet long, it stretched across the garage of a modest house a few blocks from mine in our little town. The banner featured just two words: a giant obscenity, the action verb of choice for the profane, followed by the name of the president of this country of ours. ' Blank Biden.'

A big 'F you' to not only the president of the United States but to every member of our community? I am not easily offended, but this offended me. And it made me angry and sad.

We locals like to brag that we live in the purplest region of one of the purplest states. The valley is home to a diverse blend of union workers and college students; hunters and gun enthusiasts; townies and tech workers; farmers and back-to-the-earth hippies. Our Pennsylvania Dutch roots run deep, but so do our vibrant Hispanic, Middle Eastern and African communities.\nAdvertisement\nI've lived here for a quarter of a century and always considered my adopted home to be a place of moderate, mild-mannered folks who all got along pretty well. Conversations tended to focus on family and our tomato harvests. Then came 2016 and the ascension of Donald Trump as divider in chief and normalizer of egregious behavior. I have watched dinner parties devolve into shouting matches, friendships end and neighbors stop talking. It's a new age of hostility and incivility. From my observation, most of the vitriol is coming from the die-hard defenders of Trump and is aimed at anyone who dares disagree. As yet another yard sign in my town put it: ' Blank your feelings.'\nBlank your feelings.'\nFor months, on my walks, I considered knocking on my neighbor's door and having a respectful conversation. 'Knock yourself out with your Trump signs,' I wanted to say, 'but could you please cool it with the angry obscenities? Could you show a little respect?' But, of course, like all the mild-mannered among us, I avoided what I knew would be an uncomfortable confrontation.\nAnd then one day, I walked by, and the weathered banner was gone. Could it be? Could my neighbor have finally realized there are more constructive ways to voice a political point? The answer, I regret to report, is no. Within days, a new banner was up in its place. This one proclaimed: 'Biden Sucks.' Which I will take as a small victory in the decency wars. At least these words I can repeat in a family newspaper.\nJohn Grogan is a nonfiction author and former columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer.\nJohn Grogan is a nonfiction author and former columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer.\nCharles Yu: In Orange County, the 2024 campaign goes on spring break\nSeven months out, the election is everywhere, but it comes to me largely through my phone. As the survivors of California's jungle primaries look toward November, the waves of emails and texts \u2014 bolded and capped and full of exclamation points \u2014 have subsided. For now.\nTraveling from Orange County to Los Angeles International Airport to D.C. not long ago, I did not see a single MAGA hat. No bumper stickers, either, for President Biden or Donald Trump. I did not overhear one conversation about the election in the security line, the boarding line, on the plane, in the hotel, in the hotel gym, in a restaurant. In the airport shuttle, the driver was listening to show tunes.\nFriends, wanting to stay friends, have learned the lessons of 2016 and 2020. We talk about it behind closed doors, with spouses and children. Or we just talk less about it because we already discussed it. And what good did it do? Did anything any of us said actually change anyone's mind? It's hard to continue a conversation when the starting point is: 'I just don't really like either of them.' Eight years ago, I was looking to argue. Four years ago, I was watching the news at home. This year, I'm staying mostly quiet. Because what do I know? About anything? Am I so sure I'm right?\nEveryone's shouting online and on television. As Irvine (and the rest of this formerly solid red county) continues its shift from purple to blue, the talk is of local races, not national, and the chatter is about Shohei Ohtani, or college admissions, or the rain.\nAt the National Archives, my family and I shuffled through security, climbed the stairs to the rotunda, waited in line to see the founding documents. It was the longest line we encountered. The atmosphere was electric. The crowd was comprised almost entirely of student groups and families. Museum staff directed us: You all are forming lines. Why?\nThere is no line. Just human nature. It's funny and true, but I can't figure out which way it cuts. Are we sheep? Or just self-organizing? Don't be shy, they tell us. Get in there, get a good look and move on so the next person can see.\nWhen it was our turn, we found ourselves being crowded out by an eager family. The dad kept pushing through, taking and retaking photos. For his personal collection? For posterity? His daughter recited portions of the text from memory. Others waited patiently while these folks got what they needed from this experience. And I was momentarily irritated by their lack of awareness until I realized: This is what exclamation points look like in real life. These people are just really excited about the Constitution.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"John Grogan,Charles Yu,Angela Garbes,Dave Barry,Melissa Fay Green","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S22GNGMJKYNYQDBR322BVYSTFM.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":4.1579776,"_id":"84cd00c577313b6d5bdc959eb2d3d09c"},{"title":"As Supreme Court takes up homeless ban, a city's unhoused feel abandoned","author":"Reis Thebault","published_date":"2024-04-20 19:35:17","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/04/20/supreme-court-homelessness-oregon-camping-ban","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"A consequential Oregon case, opening Monday, will decide whether governments can enforce laws against people sleeping outside when they have nowhere else to go.","summary":"GRANTS PASS, Ore. \u2014 Laura Gutowski pitches her tent in the same park where her son grew up playing Little League Baseball.

Even so, Grants Pass now finds itself in a unique position: This city of 40,000 will have a chance to shape policy decisions countrywide when it defends its anti-camping regulations in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday.\nThe case will decide whether governments can enforce laws against people sleeping outside when they have nowhere else to go. The decision, expected in late June, could be the most consequential ruling on the rights of the unhoused in decades, and either sanction or derail increasingly punitive efforts across the country that seek to deal with homelessness.\nMore than 60 government entities large and small \u2014 from Honolulu to Maryland to the United States Department of Justice \u2014 along with dozens of advocacy organizations, academics and lawmakers, have filed court briefs in the case, underscoring the widespread interest in the outcome and its potentially sweeping implications for the nation's state capitals and city streets.\nBut in the public parks of Grants Pass, where residents with no access to shelter beds take refuge in tents each night, the case is about something much more elemental: Whether they'll be able to continue to survive in a city many have called home for most of their lives.\n'It wasn't that long ago that I was part of the community,' said Gutowski, sitting at a picnic table in a park about a mile from her old house. 'But the more I'm out here, the more angry I get. \u2026 They're not trying to make things better for us, or help us have another shelter, or keep us safe \u2014 or help us even medically or mentally. They're just trying to push, push, push until we give up and say, \u2018Fine, I'll leave town.''\nA political paralysis\nThe events that sparked the Grants Pass case unfolded with little fanfare.\nevents that sparked the Grants Pass case unfolded with little fanfare.\nIn 2013, city leaders convened a roundtable meeting to address complaints from businesses and residents about increased crime they blamed on the local unhoused population, which they said had spiked after steep budget cuts reduced jail capacity. Officials floated a range of responses, including compiling a 'most unwanted list' that would exclude homeless people who break the law from social services and loading offenders onto a bus and shipping them out of town, according to a copy of the meeting's minutes.\nFollowing the roundtable, the city began strictly enforcing measures, most of which were already on the books, that outlawed sleeping or camping in public spaces like parks and in parked cars, imposing fines ranging from $75 to $295 that increase substantially when unpaid and that could eventually result in jail time or a park ban. That sparked an initial legal complaint, which was filed in 2018 on behalf of Debra Blake, Gloria Johnson and John Logan, three unhoused individuals, who said the city was punishing them unconstitutionally 'based on their status of being involuntarily homeless.'\nsparked an initial legal complaint, which was filed in 2018 on behalf of Debra Blake, Gloria Johnson and John Logan, three unhoused individuals, who said the city was punishing them unconstitutionally 'based on their status of being involuntarily homeless.'\nJust as the city stepped up enforcement, its population soared and housing construction fell behind. Over the past decade, the city has built roughly half the number of units it needs to house everyone, said Doug Walker, a member of the Grants Pass Housing Advisory Committee. The average rental price for a studio apartment hovers around $1,000 per month.\nto house everyone, said Doug Walker, a member of the Grants Pass Housing Advisory Committee. The average rental price for a studio apartment hovers around $1,000 per month.\n'The homeless crisis is a symptom of the housing crisis,' Walker said. 'We have very little housing and the housing we do have is very expensive, and that drives people onto the street.'\nThe most recent reliable estimate puts the number of unhoused Grants Pass residents at more than 600, with another 1,000 living on the edge of homelessness, but local service providers say at least twice as many are homeless.\nMaking matters worse, Grants Pass does not have a homeless shelter. Its only large-scale transitional housing program, the Gospel Rescue Mission, is a privately run religious facility with 138 beds and stringent requirements for participants, such as twice-daily chapel attendance and abstinence from substances and romantic relationships.\nThe mission's executive director, Brian Bouteller, supports the city's position in the case because he believes an outright camping ban will drive more people into the organization's program and off the street. Allowing unhoused people to stay in the parks, he said, was akin to enabling unlawful behavior. He said he would also welcome additional, privately funded shelters in the city.\n'I believe that lawbreakers should be coerced into being law-abiding citizens,' Bouteller said.\nIn 2020, a district court judge sided with the unhoused individuals behind the lawsuit and barred the city from enforcing its anti-camping ban in parks at night if no other shelter was available. Grants Pass Mayor Sara Bristol said the ruling plunged the city into political paralysis.\nBristol said if it were up to her, the city would spend less time fighting this legal battle and more time building new housing and shelters. But that decision rests with the city council, she said, and a majority has wanted to push ahead with the case. The council president, Vanessa Ogier, declined to comment and directed questions to the city's legal representatives.\nAdvertisement\nGrants Pass residents have also opposed proposed locations for new shelters and outdoor campsites, and some backed a recall petition that unsuccessfully sought to oust Bristol over her handling of the crisis. A neighborhood watch group has continued to raise alarms about conditions in the city's cherished green spaces.\nAt one park on a recent Saturday, parents combed a baseball diamond for drug paraphernalia before their kids took the field and recovered several used needles, said Grants Pass police chief Warren Hensman.\n'What we're seeing from a lot of people in the unhoused community,' Hensman said, 'is we have this unpredictable behavior' when individuals are using drugs or experiencing a mental health episode.\nBristol, for her part, said she knows the situation in the parks is untenable, which is why, no matter what the Supreme Court decides, she wants the city to build more shelters fast.\n'I want our public spaces to be safe and clean and used as they were intended,' Bristol said. 'And I also want to make sure that homeless people have a place where they can be safe and sleep and get help if they want to get help. And I think we can have both, but not everybody thinks that.'\nHigh legal stakes\nThe Supreme Court agreed to weigh in on this case after hearing pleas from an unlikely coalition that spanned the political spectrum, including liberal standard-bearers such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and officials in deep-red states such as Montana and Alabama. Their legal briefs described governments overwhelmed by the scale and complexity of the problem: Across the country, more than 600,000 people are homeless, according to federal data, and nearly half sleep outside.\ndeep-red states such as Montana and Alabama. Their legal briefs described governments overwhelmed by the scale and complexity of the problem: Across the country, more than 600,000 people are homeless, according to federal data, and nearly half sleep outside.\nIn most places, there are not enough shelter beds to accommodate everyone who needs one. That gap between the need for services and their availability is at the heart of the Supreme Court case. Lawyers for the homeless residents say the Grants Pass laws violate Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment when applied to individuals who have no access to shelter.\n'This combination of ordinances makes it unlawful for people to live outside on every inch of public property in Grants Pass 24 hours a day,' said Ed Johnson, the director of litigation at the Oregon Law Center and lead attorney for the plaintiffs. 'It's terrible policy, it's morally wrong and it's unconstitutional.'\nAdvertisement\nJohnson has insisted that state and local officials are still free to restrict tents in public spaces, clear encampments and even fine homeless people who decline other shelter options, which some do for a range of reasons. The issue, he said, is when a city punishes people who have no alternatives.\nMeanwhile, the Grants Pass legal team has maintained that fines and short jail terms for camping on public property are neither cruel nor unusual, but instead are tools used by governments throughout the country to preserve public spaces and protect public health.\n'These laws are essential to running a city, and cities across the country, as well as the federal government, rely on camping laws just like the ones in Grants Pass,' said Theane D. Evangelis, the city's lead attorney. If the court were to rule in favor of the plaintiffs, she said, 'cities across the country would find their hands tied as they work to address the urgent homelessness crisis.'\nIn a legal brief filed in advance of the oral arguments, the Biden administration charted something of a middle path. Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar told the court that anti-camping laws are unconstitutional when they target homeless people who have no access to indoor shelter.\nBut Prelogar urged the justices to return the case to the lower courts to ensure that the city's laws are not blocked across the board. Such bans should still be allowable, she argued, if an investigation shows that a given person does in fact have access to shelter.\nGarrett Epps, a law professor at the University of Oregon, said he expects a majority of the court to be sympathetic to the city's arguments, but cautioned that the justices could issue a more narrow decision than Grants Pass is advocating.\nA ruling that allows cities wide discretion to pass restrictive homelessness laws, Epps said, could touch off 'a race to the bottom,' where neighboring localities pass increasingly severe policies to drive unhoused residents into other jurisdictions.\n'The stakes in that sense are pretty high,' Epps said. 'Anybody who lives out here understands how important this issue is and how important the precedent being tested here is.'\nSmall victories\nCassy Leach is a near-constant, indefatigable presence among the unhoused in Grants Pass.

But after mulling for two months how to advance such a package through the political divides in the House, Johnson has revealed little of his strategy, including whether he will try to push the funding for Israel separately or keep it packaged with the aid for the other U.S. allies.\nAs the House has struggled to act, conflicts around the globe have escalated. Israel's military chief said Monday that Israel will respond to Iran's weekend missile strike. And Ukraine's military head over the weekend warned that the battlefield situation in the country's east has 'significantly worsened in recent days,' as warming weather has allowed Russian forces to launch a fresh offensive.\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden, hosting Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala at the White House, called on the House to take up the funding package immediately.

But with no plan set, time was running short for Johnson, who is learning the job of speaker as he goes.\nThe speaker planned to huddle with his fellow House Republicans on Monday evening. But the meeting will be filled with lawmakers strongly opposed on Ukraine: Republican defense hawks, including the top lawmakers on national security committees, who want Johnson to finally take up the national security supplemental package as a bundle, are pitted against populist conservatives who are fiercely opposed to continued support for Kyiv's fight at all.\nAdvertisement\nAhead of the meeting on Monday, Johnson revealed little on his decision after saying over the weekend that he would bring Israel aid to the floor this week. Johnson has expressed support for aiding Ukraine, but ignored questions from reporters on Monday about whether he would bundle funding for the two nations together.

A bill renewing the program passed the House last week after a dramatic showdown on the floor over whether the FBI should be restricted from using the program to search for Americans' data.\nBut the same concerns that nearly derailed the bill in the House are flaring again in the Senate, with both progressives and conservative lawmakers agitating for further changes. It's a dynamic that could ultimately jeopardize the bill's passage in the upper chamber, though supporters remain optimistic that the program will be reauthorized without much deal.\nAdvertisement\nThe Biden administration has spent the week on Capitol Hill providing classified briefings to senators on the crucial role they say the spy program plays in protecting national security. Officials warn that some of the changes being proposed to the tool could handicap the FBI's efforts to thwart threats to the U.S.\nOpponents remain unfazed and have demanded that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer allow votes on amendments to the legislation that would seek to address what they see as civil liberty loopholes in the bill.\n'The administration is making the case that if there's any changes, it's going to jeopardize the program,' Democratic Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont said Thursday. 'That's asking a lot of the Senate to basically abdicate its responsibility.'\nThe legislation in its current form has the backing of not only the Biden administration but also the leaders of the national security committees in Congress, who have urged detractors to accept the mild reforms to the program. Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that the changes being proposed by the various groups are 'unnecessary' and would 'destroy the purpose' of the program.\nAdvertisement\n'If certain amendments like that were to pass, the bill would go back to the House and I just don't know what posture the House is going to be in to be able to take up legislation because we've got so much going on,' Rubio said.\nThough the spy program is technically set to expire Friday, the Biden administration has said it expects its authority to collect intelligence to remain operational for at least another year, thanks to an opinion earlier this month from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which receives surveillance applications.\nStill, officials say that court approval shouldn't be a substitute for congressional authorization, especially since communications companies could cease cooperation with the government if the program is allowed to lapse.\nOverall skepticism of the government's spy powers has grown dramatically in recent years, particularly on the right. Republicans clashed for months over what a legislative overhaul of the FISA surveillance program should look like, creating divisions that spilled onto the House floor last week as 19 Republicans broke with their party to prevent the bill from coming up for a vote.\nAdvertisement\nIn the end, House Speaker Mike Johnson managed to appease some critics of the reauthorization bill by shortening the extension of the program from five years to two years.\nFirst authorized in 2008, the spy tool has been renewed several times since then as U.S. officials see it as crucial in disrupting terror attacks, cyber intrusions and foreign espionage. It has also produced intelligence that the U.S. has relied on for specific operations.\nBut the administration's efforts to secure reauthorization of the program have repeatedly encountered fierce, and bipartisan, pushback, with Democrats like Sen. Ron Wyden who have long championed civil liberties aligning with Republican supporters of former President Donald Trump, who in a post on Truth Social on Wednesday stated incorrectly that Section 702 had been used to spy on his presidential campaign.\nAdvertisement\nA specific area of concern for lawmakers is the FBI's use of the vast intelligence repository to search for information about Americans and others in the U.S. Though the surveillance program only targets non-Americans in other countries, it also collects communications of Americans when they are in contact with those targeted foreigners.\nIn the past year, U.S. officials have revealed a series of abuses and mistakes by FBI analysts in improperly querying the intelligence repository for information about Americans or others in the U.S., including about a member of Congress and participants in the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Farnoush Amiri","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QAYAARX5ZII65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":4.102586,"_id":"846c0acb5174c1dd9d83fa24d85674f9"},{"title":"U.S. officials scramble to stop major Internet firms from ditching FISA obligations","author":"Ellen Nakashima","published_date":"2024-04-20 01:22:53","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/04/19/fisa-702-surveillance-internet","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"As Congress moves to vote on the reauthorization of federal surveillance powers, two major U.S. communications providers said they would stop complying with orders set to expire at midnight, according to people familiar with the matter.","summary":"U.S. government officials were scrambling Friday night to prevent what they fear could be a significant loss of access to critical national security information, after two major U.S. communications providers said they would stop complying with orders under a controversial surveillance law that is set to expire at midnight, according to five people familiar with the matter.\nOne communications provider informed the National Security Agency that it would stop complying on Monday with orders under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which enables U.S. intelligence agencies to gather without a warrant the digital communications of foreigners overseas \u2014 including when they text or email people inside the United States.\nAnother provider suggested that it would cease complying at midnight Friday unless the law is reauthorized, according to the people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations.\ncondition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations.\nAdvertisement\nThe companies' decisions, which were conveyed privately and have not previously been reported, have alarmed national security officials, who strongly disagree with their position and argue that the law requires the providers to continue complying with the government's surveillance orders even after the statute expires.

Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) is among a dying breed in Congress: Of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Donald Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, just Newhouse and one other remain in the chamber.\nIf Trump has his way, that won't be the case much longer.\nThe former president last week endorsed Jerrod Sessler, a conservative Republican who has never held public office but who is once again challenging Newhouse in the race for the 4th District in Washington state.\nIn a post shared on his social media site Truth Social, Trump said Sessler is 'MAGA all the way, and has my complete and total endorsement \u2014 he will never let you down.'\nNewhouse, Trump said, 'has to go.'\nSpeaking to The Washington Post this week, Newhouse declined to comment on Trump's endorsement of his challenger, suggesting only that he expected that the former president would do that. Newhouse, however, remained optimistic that he will prevail in the primary.\nAdvertisement\n'I'm going to win,' he said. 'I'll work as hard as I can.'\nOf the 10 House Republicans who voted with Democrats to impeach Trump after a mob of his supporters broke into the Capitol on Jan. 6, only Newhouse and Rep. David Valadeo (R-Calif.) remain in the House. Valadeo faces a difficult general election in the 22nd District of California \u2014 a district that President Biden won by about 13 points in 2020.\nTrump has long sought revenge against the Republicans who turned against him in the wake of the Capitol attack.\nIn 2022, four of the 10 Republicans \u2014 then-Reps. Tom Rice (S.C.), Jaime Herrera Beutler (Wash.), Liz Cheney (Wyo.) and Peter Meijer (Mich.) \u2014 lost their primary races to challengers from the right.\nFour others \u2014 then-Reps. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), John Katko (N.Y.), Anthony Gonzalez (Ohio) and Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) \u2014 chose to retire. Only Newhouse and Valadao were able to hold on to their seats.\nAdvertisement\nUpton \u2014 who did not run for reelection in 2022 after his Michigan district was redrawn in a way that would've likely pushed him out in the general \u2014 told The Washington Post on Wednesday that he's sure Trump's decision to endorse Newhouse's challenger is 'more vengeance.'\nUpton said that 'everyone had their own reason to vote the way that they did' on Trump's impeachment charges.\n'Some were worried for their own safety. Some said, 'You know, this is what my district would want' versus perhaps what I saw first hand,' he said. 'And some were, frankly, just scared of this bully.'\nNewhouse's district, Washington's 4th, is a solidly red seat. The congressman has easily won reelection there by wide margins since 2014, most recently in 2022, when he defeated his Democratic opponent by 35 points. Trump won the district by 19 points in 2020. These numbers probably make the primary election the de facto general.\nAdvertisement\nIn his endorsement of Sessler, Trump called Newhouse a 'weak and pathetic RINO' \u2014 short for 'Republican in name only.'\nThis is not the first time Sessler, a Navy veteran and businessman, has challenged Newhouse. In 2022, Sessler and five other Republicans tried to unseat Newhouse, a farmer, but Newhouse prevailed. This time, however, Sessler is the only candidate challenging Newhouse in the GOP primary.\nIn a post shared on X after Trump's endorsement, Sessler said, '#Honored.' Online, Sessler often shares messages from some of the most right-wing members of Congress and touts his credentials as a political firebrand.\nIn an interview with The Washington Post last month, Newhouse said that while many of his moderate Republican colleagues in the House are leaving Congress \u2014 citing their conference's inability to collaborate and strike successful legislative deals \u2014 he still has unfinished business in the chamber, and he will not let himself be discouraged from being in office by the more extreme wing of his party.\nAdvertisement\n'I've still got some things I want to accomplish, some issues that are important to me. It is a difficult environment, but it's always hard, it's never easy to get legislation through,' he said. 'One of my biggest priorities is making some positive changes to our agricultural labor laws, and we've been getting we've been making progress. I don't want to leave before that's done.'\nUpton said he is optimistic about his former colleague's chances and said he believes Newhouse is the type of lawmaker who should remain in Congress.\n'He's got an unblemished record. He's honest as the day is long. He's the type of people that voters ought to want in a responsible position like a member of Congress,' Upton said. 'He'll be able to sell that back home. But it's likely going to be a rough couple of months. And it raises questions on the personal side: Is it worth it?'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Mariana Alfaro","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OFTHCNOLGZ5JQLP5A2BDRFDAHI_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":4.100803,"_id":"aa0a87ee7aee43590cfc33893e2d9b8d"},{"title":"House speaker Mike Johnson's Ukraine vote leadership showed courage","author":"Karen Tumulty","published_date":"2024-04-21 14:12:45","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/21/house-speaker-mike-johnson-courage","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Praising the House speaker for doing what's right, or even normal, is warranted, given how the Republican Party, locked in Donald Trump's grip, rolls these days.","summary":"It's a sad thing that acts of political bravery are so rare these days, but that makes it all the more important to recognize them when they happen.\nSo let's pause to appreciate how much courage it took, along with legislative skill, for House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) to defy the hardliner bullies of his own party and put forward the $95 billion package of foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan that passed the House on Saturday.\nAnd by doing so, to reclaim \u2014 at least for this moment \u2014 what Republicans once believed about America's essential place in the world.\nThe hardest part was the badly needed $60 billion for Kyiv, which is struggling to fend off Russia's invasion. As Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) put it on the House floor: 'Traditional conservatives, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, have risen to the occasion.' Moments after the overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also singled out the speaker, writing on his Telegram channel: 'I am grateful to the United States House of Representatives, both parties, and personally Speaker Mike Johnson for the decision that keeps history on the right track.'\nAdvertisement\nAll of this praise might seem excessive, given that allowing the House to work its collective will is the essence of a speaker's role. But doing what's right, or even normal, is not how the Republican Party, locked in the grip of Donald Trump, rolls these days. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) \u2014 who, like others on the far right, parrots Kremlin propaganda \u2014 has already filed a 'motion to vacate\" that could remove Johnson from the job if she calls for a vote on it.\n'If I operated out of fear over motion to vacate, I would never be able to do my job. Look, history judges us for what we do. This is a critical time right now,' Johnson told reporters last week. 'I can make a selfish decision and do something that is different, but I'm doing here what I believe to be the right thing. I think providing aid to Ukraine right now is critically important.'\nFollow this author Karen Tumulty 's opinions\nFollow this author\nKaren Tumulty\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nWhat convinced him, Johnson noted, was 'I really do believe the intel and the briefings that we've gotten' \u2014 something that in itself is heresy these days in the GOP, given how Trump has savaged the credibility of the 'deep state.'\nAdvertisement\nIn all of this, some Democrats see hopeful signs in Johnson's leadership. 'What we get caught up in, and it's a reality, is the obstruction of a small group of people who take the institution hostage,' Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, told me Saturday. 'I have to believe, at some level, the speaker made the decision he was not going to be held hostage by these people.'\nExpectations could hardly have been lower for Johnson when he was plucked from obscurity last fall to become speaker after 21 days of chaos in which his predecessor Kevin McCarthy had been cast out and a handful of right-wingers used their leverage to deny the job to three top leaders who sought to replace McCarthy.\nTo the degree that Johnson was known at all, it was for his alignment with Trump in his efforts to oppose the certification of the 2020 election results. Nor have some of Johnson's moves since taking the gavel inspired confidence \u2014 among them, smothering a border security deal that Trump opposed and pursuing the impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on the flimsiest of grounds. Less than two weeks ago, Johnson was kissing the ring at Mar-a-Lago, appearing with Trump at an event to promote an unnecessary, conspiracy-theory-driven measure to require proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections.\nAdvertisement\nAll of this, however, reflected in no small measure the degree of difficulty Johnson faces in leading what is a GOP majority in name only, shrunken to the point where the speaker can afford to lose no more than one vote to prevail on party-line measures.\nLess noticed have been some early moves to restore at least a semblance of normalcy to how the House operates. 'He has done what many thought was impossible,' Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) told me, ticking off how Johnson has gotten appropriations bills unstuck, found his way to a complicated deal to keep the government open, defied his party's hardliners to pass the annual National Defense Authorization Act, and, just last week, overcame far-right objections to win reauthorization of a government surveillance program.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Karen Tumulty,Associate Editor","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SN4MBQJZFNEMPFHPEVH2BISZ4U.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":4.0937777,"_id":"6ce2f134b2692cae0e5e32b61f4f6f5e"},{"title":"Speaker Johnson moves on foreign aid, possibly triggering vote to oust him","author":"Marianna Sotomayor","published_date":"2024-04-17 16:36:05","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/17/house-speaker-mike-johnson-ukraine-israel-motion-to-vacate","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The speaker has introduced a complex five-part plan requiring separate floor votes on Israel and Ukraine, as well as a stand-alone proposal to assuage far-right members who want to strengthen the U.S. southern border.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's (Ga.) promise to move a motion to topple Johnson (R-La.) if he puts Ukraine aid on the floor, something many far-right Republicans object to.\nAdvertisement\nJohnson told Republicans in a letter to colleagues Wednesday morning, 'After significant Member feedback and discussion' this week, the House will move ahead with his plan, with some significant changes. He intends to release bill text on Ukraine, Israel and for Indo-Pacific allies earlier Wednesday, and language for the GOP wish list and border later Wednesday.\nSuccess is anything but guaranteed, both on the foreign aid package and keeping his job. Timing on the votes, also, is up in the air \u2014 even as members were slated to head home for a one-week recess on Thursday.\nThis is all happening against the backdrop of an extremely slender House majority that Republicans argue should be expanded by voters in November to better their chances of advancing a conservative agenda. The GOP currently has a two-vote majority, meaning that if Democrats do not help keep Johnson in the speaker role, only three Republicans would be needed to wrest his gavel. But two Republicans suddenly become enough after Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) resigns. He was supposed to leave Friday, putting the GOP majority at just one vote, but now is expected to leave once foreign aid bill passes.\nAdvertisement\n'The congressman has the flexibility to stay and support the aid package on Saturday,' his office said on Wednesday.\nIt is clear Republicans are growing increasingly fed up with Johnson's leadership, and the far-right flank had already signaled they will not support Johnson's plan even before text of the legislation was released. It's unclear how they will respond to the idea of moving a separate border package \u2014 which will, according to the speaker's office \u2014 will include the 'core components of H.R. 2,' a harsh immigration bill restricting migrants from entering the United States.\nEarly signals were not good.\nThe House Freedom Caucus has already panned the proposal. Johnson is 'surrendering' on the border, the far-right group tweeted in response to Johnson's plan. 'This flies in the face of every promise Republicans have told you' and they care more about 'funding Ukraine than they do securing our own borders.'\nAdvertisement\nYet Johnson is moving the separate border package in an attempt to appease his unruly conference, many of whom have demanded the border be secure before funding is sent to Ukraine and other allies. Republicans did have a chance to consider a tough bipartisan security bill earlier in the year, but declined to do so as Donald Trump vocally attacked it.\nKeeping border security separate from the foreign aid package may give both pieces of legislation a greater chance of passing. The national security bill will likely need Democratic support because of the large number of Republicans who don't want to fund Ukraine \u2014 while Johnson aims to pass the border security bill with just Republican support, hoping to satisfy demands from all corners of his conference and send all bills to the Senate.\nBut in an almost four-hour meeting between Johnson and his allies Tuesday night \u2014 before this latest plan was released \u2014 Republicans left demoralized after failing to concoct a plan that would ensure enough of them support sending the package to the floor without having to rely on Democrats. Multiple people familiar with the meeting, who were granted anonymity to discuss internal dynamics, said the meeting enlightened them and Johnson about what moving on his plan would mean for his future.\nAdvertisement\nWhile Johnson is officially moving on his foreign aid plan, it could all lead to his ouster.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'The battle lines were very clear at the end,' one Republican said.

MONTEZUMA COUNTY, Colo. \u2014 The key to finding the right person for a long-term relationship, according to intimacy expert Emily Nagoski, is to 'meet a lot of people a small number of times.' That helps explain common symptoms of today's online dating scene: swiping fatigue and perpetually feeling like you could do better. Or at least those are the complaints from people in cities and suburbs.\nBut how can you meet a lot of people if there are not a lot of people to meet?\nThat's the question here in the rural West, where \u2014 along with the skills of driving in spring mud and building a fire \u2014 being okay with being alone is a prerequisite for getting by and finding, if not a partner, contentment.\nAdvertisement\nI live in Montezuma County, Colo., which has a population of about 26,000, but that's spread across 2,000 square miles \u2014 or 13 people per square mile.

Research shows that the more options you have, the harder it is to decide and the less satisfied you are with your choice. Maybe fewer choices could be better, Lewis suggests.

Shawnna Bolick and Reps. Tim Dunn and Matt Gress \u2014 as well as Arizona U.S. Senate candidate Kari Lake \u2014 lays bare a larger crisis within the Republican party over how to handle the abortion issue ahead of November. The U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade passed the practical decision of whether to allow access to abortion to state lawmakers, and many Republicans are now caught between long-held, often religiously rooted views that have defined the GOP for generations and a more practical desire to win elections.\nRoe v. Wade passed the practical decision of whether to allow access to abortion to state lawmakers, and many Republicans are now caught between long-held, often religiously rooted views that have defined the GOP for generations and a more practical desire to win elections.\nIn recent days, Lake, who once described the 160-year-old measure as a 'great law,' has been personally lobbying some Republicans to repeal the ban, highlighting the political stakes of the looming vote. According to one lawmaker who received such a call and spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, Lake made it clear that she 'understands [the pre-Roe ban] will be bad for her and for Trump.' They discussed how Arizona is essential for Trump to secure the presidency, the lawmaker said. Trump lost the state to President Biden in 2020 by only 10,457 votes.\nThe dilemma facing Republicans on abortion has grown even more acute since last Wednesday, when Trump said Arizona's abortion ban goes too far and promised it would be 'straightened out' by 'the governor and everybody else.' Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee who has bragged about his role in the overturning of Roe, made a similar promise about a pending six-week abortion ban in Florida, even as he has argued the abortion issue should be left to the states.\nthe abortion issue should be left to the states.\nAdvertisement\nTwo Republicans in the Arizona House of Representatives and two in the Senate would have to join all of both chambers' Democrats to repeal the ban, which could take effect as early as June 8 without legislative action. If the legislature agrees to repeal the 1864 ban, the current law banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy prevails, legislative staffers and lawmakers said.

Alex Kolodin (R), who sees the 1864 law as a victory for the party's core ideological position as well as a major humanitarian triumph.\nAdvertisement\nSeveral GOP lawmakers and operatives said Trump's comments could ease the decision to vote for a repeal for some Republicans who were on the fence, granting them permission to go against their values for a better chance at securing victory in November.\n'It gave them cover,' said one prominent Arizona Republican who supports the repeal and spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss internal party dynamics.

Democrats are trying to get an initiative on the November ballot that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution and allow the procedure to the point of fetal viability, or about 24 weeks. These Republicans argue that supporting the repeal could demonstrate they are attuned to voter sentiments while lending credibility to GOP opposition to the ballot measure.\n'What's going to save the most lives?

In 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed a lower court's ruling that Grants Pass's actions violated the Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments.\n'Can you imagine anything more cruel and usual than throwing somebody in jail for having a blanket?' Jesse Rabinowitz, the National Homelessness Law Center's communications director and the emcee for Monday's demonstration, told the crowd outside the court. 'Does that seem fair to you?'\nIn the morning chill, hundreds of demonstrators lay near the Supreme Court steps under emergency blankets that caught the sun \u2014 a symbolic nod to the $295 ticket for sleeping outside with a blanket that Grants Pass's authorities were handing out, Rabinowitz said in his remarks before Monday's crowd. Many of the protesters had come from New York City, Philadelphia and elsewhere to join the rally in D.C.\nThe arguments before the country's highest court come as homelessness policy nationwide has become electrified. Last year the country saw a spike in homeless numbers, the fallout from record inflation and the end of covid-era eviction protections and rent relief. Conservative activist groups have since mobilized in state legislatures to pass aggressive criminalization laws similar to Grants Pass's approach. Housing activists have countered by advocating about spiking rents and a lack of affordable housing.\nAdvertisement\nSpeakers at the rally included the heads of leading advocacy organizations such as the National Low Income Housing Coalition's Diane Yentel, the National Alliance to End Homelessness's Ann Oliva, and the National Coalition for the Homeless's Donald Whitehead.\n'You know the president is in public housing, so we should be able to do it for everyone,' said Rev.

'Debra died without housing in the richest country in the world.'\n'No she was murdered!,' a woman pushing a walker in the crowd shouted. 'She was murdered!

'They put me in housing where they are housing drug addicts. Why would you put me there? I can't stay there. I'm scared. So now I got to make myself homeless again?'\nDeborah Woolford, a social worker from Baltimore, came with fellow advocates for the rally. 'We are here to make sure the clients we serve that are chronically homeless have a right to affordable, sustainable housing,' she said.

LOUIS \u2014 Republican attorneys general attacked the Biden administration's stated goal of pursuing environmental justice, calling it a form of 'racial engineering.\u2018'\nFlorida Attorney General Ashley Moody and 22 other GOP officials asked the EPA Tuesday to stop using civil rights laws to investigate actions and policies that result in harm to Black people or other minority groups \u2014 even unintentionally \u2014 more than white residents.\n'The EPA should be focusing on enforcing the environmental laws passed by Congress, not so called \u2018environmental justice,' which is a euphemism for Biden's extreme agenda,\u2018' Moody said. Their petition demands that the EPA change decades-old rules, though the civil rights law could still be used where discrimination was intentional.\nThe petition is unlikely to convince the Biden administration to back away from an issue EPA Administrator Michael Regan has taken pains to highlight. Regan, for example, went on a 'Journey to Justice' tour to places like the industrial stretch of Louisiana typically called Cancer Alley to show how majority-Black communities living near polluters were being hurt. To address such harms, the EPA has turned in part to a section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 called Title VI to open investigations and pressure states to make changes.\nAdvertisement\nThe petition in an election year is the latest in Republicans' expanding fight against federal policies aimed at addressing historic racial discrimination and they believe courts are on their side. They cited the recent Supreme Court decision that eliminated affirmative action in college admissions, arguing it shows the court is wary of race-conscious federal policies.\n'Because the EPA's regulations prohibit any action that results in racial disparities, a funding recipient must set demographic targets for their projects to maintain compliance,' the attorneys general wrote. 'This kind of allocation based on group membership is a constitutional nonstarter.'\nThe Florida attorney general's office, which took the lead on the petition, said the states would sue if the EPA does not amend its rules.\nAdvertisement\nEPA declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation around the issue.\nTitle VI aims to prevent discrimination in programs that receive federal funds. The agency can investigate allegations of discrimination, publish their findings and pressure states and local governments to agree to change policies. The federal government can yank funding if they find a Title VI violation.\nDebbie Chizewer, managing attorney in the Midwest office at the environmental group Earthjustice, said Title VI is part of the country's historic fight against discrimination and is still a critical tool. Elected officials across the county permitted numerous polluting factories, chemical plants and refineries near minority communities that now are burdened with the effects, including poorer health, lower property values and economic blight.\nAdvertisement\n'I think it is a perversion of our civil rights laws to say otherwise, to say that you can't account for these past harms by creating policies that protect communities that are disproportionately harmed,' she said.\nPreviously, Title VI has been a relatively weak environmental weapon, rarely resulting in significant changes to environmental policy. Under the Biden administration, however, environmental and civil rights groups were hopeful it could be used to do more.\nThose groups asked the EPA to investigate Louisiana's regulation of air pollution, arguing that it disproportionately hurt majority-Black communities near heavy industry. They highlighted the Denka Performance Elastomer plant that makes synthetic rubber and emits harmful chloroprene. It's located a half-mile from an elementary school. The agency agreed to investigate and released initial findings saying there was evidence of discrimination.\nAdvertisement\nBut before the state agreed to any changes, the EPA dropped its investigation. The end came soon after Louisiana sued the agency, arguing that focusing on policies that may harm one group more than another but weren't intentionally discriminatory went too far.\nThat lawsuit has so far seen success. In January, a federal judge in Louisiana put a temporary halt on the EPA's power to investigate discrimination that had a so-called 'disparate impact.' A final decision in the case hasn't come yet.\nEnvironmental groups have worried that the EPA's move in Louisiana amounts to a pullback on the Biden administration's commitment to fighting environmental discrimination.\nEPA officials are wary of unfavorable court rulings and a conservative Supreme Court that has already curtailed its regulatory power. The Supreme Court restricted the EPA's authority to fight air and water pollution \u2014 including a landmark 2022 ruling that limited the EPA's authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants that contribute to global warming.\nAdvertisement\nRegan said earlier this month that he believes strongly in using Title VI to fight environmental discrimination, but it's complicated.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'It is not just on this issue, we face headwinds in the courts on a lot of issues,' Regan said. He added that the EPA is trying to ensure every action it takes can withstand a court challenge.\nBut the agency has other options to hold polluters accountable, he said. Recently, for example, the EPA finalized new, tougher, emissions limits for more than 200 chemical plants, including the Denka facility under scrutiny in Louisiana.\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Michael Phillis","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":3.937439,"_id":"9308b3418cf650ba1d959001db579742"},{"title":"Senate passes reauthorization of key US surveillance program after midnight deadline","author":"Farnoush Amiri","published_date":"2024-04-20 04:47:46","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/04/20/fisa-donald-trump-surveillance-congress-johnson/21c82f3a-fed1-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The Senate has voted to reauthorize a key U.S. surveillance law after divisions over whether the FBI should be restricted from using the program to search for Americans' data nearly forced the statute to lapse","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 After its midnight deadline, the Senate voted early Saturday to reauthorize a key U.S. surveillance law after divisions over whether the FBI should be restricted from using the program to search for Americans' data nearly forced the statute to lapse.\nThe legislation approved 60-34 with bipartisan support would extend for two years the program known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It now goes to President Joe Biden's desk to become law.\n'In the nick of time, we are reauthorizing FISA right before it expires at midnight,' Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said when voting on final passage began 15 minutes before the deadline. 'All day long, we persisted and we persisted in trying to reach a breakthrough and in the end, we have succeeded.'\nU.S. officials have said the surveillance tool, first authorized in 2008 and renewed several times since then, is crucial in disrupting terror attacks, cyber intrusions, and foreign espionage and has also produced intelligence that the U.S. has relied on for specific operations, such as the 2022 killing of al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri.\nAdvertisement\n'If you miss a key piece of intelligence, you may miss some event overseas or put troops in harm's way,' Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said. 'You may miss a plot to harm the country here, domestically, or somewhere else. So in this particular case, there's real-life implications.'\nThe proposal would renew the program, which permits the U.S. government to collect without a warrant the communications of non-Americans located outside the country to gather foreign intelligence. The reauthorization faced a long and bumpy road to final passage Friday after months of clashes between privacy advocates and national security hawks pushed consideration of the legislation to the brink of expiration.\nThough the spy program was technically set to expire at midnight, the Biden administration had said it expected its authority to collect intelligence to remain operational for at least another year, thanks to an opinion earlier this month from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which receives surveillance applications.\nAdvertisement\nStill, officials had said that court approval shouldn't be a substitute for congressional authorization, especially since communications companies could cease cooperation with the government if the program is allowed to lapse.\nHouse before the law was set to expire, U.S. officials were already scrambling after two major U.S. communication providers said they would stop complying with orders through the surveillance program, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations.\nAttorney General Merrick Garland praised the reauthorization and reiterated how 'indispensable' the tool is to the Justice Department.\n'This reauthorization of Section 702 gives the United States the authority to continue to collect foreign intelligence information about non-U.S. persons located outside the United States, while at the same time codifying important reforms the Justice Department has adopted to ensure the protection of Americans' privacy and civil liberties,' Garland said in a statement Saturday.\nAdvertisement\nBut despite the Biden administration's urging and classified briefings to senators this week on the crucial role they say the spy program plays in protecting national security, a group of progressive and conservative lawmakers who were agitating for further changes had refused to accept the version of the bill the House sent over last week.\nThe lawmakers had demanded that Majority Leader Chuck Schumer allow votes on amendments to the legislation that would seek to address what they see as civil liberty loopholes in the bill. In the end, Schumer was able to cut a deal that would allow critics to receive floor votes on their amendments in exchange for speeding up the process for passage.\nThe six amendments ultimately failed to garner the necessary support on the floor to be included in the final passage.\nAdvertisement\nOne of the major changes detractors had proposed centered around restricting the FBI's access to information about Americans through the program. Though the surveillance tool only targets non-Americans in other countries, it also collects communications of Americans when they are in contact with those targeted foreigners. Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber, had been pushing a proposal that would require U.S. officials to get a warrant before accessing American communications.\n'If the government wants to spy on my private communications or the private communications of any American, they should be required to get approval from a judge, just as our Founding Fathers intended in writing the Constitution,' Durbin said.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIn the past year, U.S. officials have revealed a series of abuses and mistakes by FBI analysts in improperly querying the intelligence repository for information about Americans or others in the U.S., including a member of Congress and participants in the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\nAdvertisement\nBut members on both the House and Senate intelligence committees as well as the Justice Department warned requiring a warrant would severely handicap officials from quickly responding to imminent national security threats.\n'I think that is a risk that we cannot afford to take with the vast array of challenges our nation faces around the world,' Democratic Sen.

Not by eating something gross or visiting a new country. He wanted to risk death \u2014 with not one but three extreme sports.\nThe Peacock series'Orlando Bloom: To the Edge' sees the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' star shoot through the sky thousands of feet above the ground, dive into a deep sinkhole and rock climb hundreds of feet.\n'While I was at moments scared for my life during the show, having come out the other end of it I feel way more capable,' Bloom tells The Associated Press.\nThe series, which debuts Thursday, was born from the pandemic, which made outside adventures even more alluring. It met the perfect host in a man who is a natural risk-taker. When he made his Broadway debut in 'Romeo and Juliet,' he roared onto the stage on a Triumph motorcycle.\nAdvertisement\n'I'm like a collector of experiences in some ways,' he says. 'I've been remarkably gifted and fortunate to have some unique ones, but this was definitely like, \u2018Oh, wow, I'm capable of this. Therefore I can do anything.''\nFirst up was wingsuiting \u2014 skydiving in a special jumpsuit that adds lift so you can glide longer before opening your parachute. Bloom's goal was to jump out of plane at 13,000 feet (3,962 meters) fly 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) over the Pacific Ocean and land on the beach.\nThen he heads to the Bahamas, to a 663-foot-deep (202 meters) hole in the ocean, with the aim of plunging to 100 feet (30.5 meters) on just one breath. After that, it's off to Utah to climb a 400-foot (122 meter) tower and stand on a summit the size of a pizza box.\n'We all experience fear. It's how we face this fear that defines us,' Bloom says in the first episode. 'I never feel so alive being so close to death.'\nAdvertisement\nThere were some heart-in-your throat moments, like on his seventh skydiving jump, where Bloom needed to activate his reserve chute, something that is necessary just 1 in 1,000 times. And for his 21st jump, he did it holding hands with his 80-year-old uncle, Christopher Copeland, a master skydiver.\nUsually it takes 200 solo skydives before anyone is allowed to wingsuit but Bloom convinces his instructor in just two weeks. Katy Perry, his partner, is on hand for the first wobbly flight, embracing her man after he lands and lovingly calling him 'a flying wombat.'\nBloom battles ear pain to attempt the 100-foot (30.5 meter) freedive and practicing a breath exercise leaves him in tears, struggling and sweating. Freediving turns out to require a slowing heart, conserving energy and relaxing \u2014 the opposite of most sports.\nAdvertisement\nThe rock climbing challenge sees a usual 2-3 year training process condensed into a week. There was added stress because Bloom broke his back in a fall in his 20s and really didn't want to do that again.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'Just remember if everything hurts and you want to puke, you're doing it right,' an instructor helpfully tells him. Bloom also leans into his Buddhist belief, meditating and chanting in the run-up to each daredevil step.\nBloom joins a crowded field of adventure-seeking celeb TV hosts, which includes Eugene Levy, Zac Efron, Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, Chris Hemsworth, Will Smith, Stanley Tucci, Macaulay Culkin and Ewan McGregor.\nBloom, already a guy who went to the gym twice a day, was a quick learner and even emerged with a skydiving license. But he had one-on-one help from experts usually out of the reach of regular thrillseekers, like Maureen 'Mo' Beck, a gold medal at the 2014 Spanish Paraclimbing World Championships, and Camila Jaber, the youngest female freediver to break records.\nAdvertisement\nBloom credits his instructors for their patience, expertise and teaching him to trust them and their gear. His life was in their hands but very often, their lives were in his hands.\n'It wasn't just as simple as like, \u2018I'm just going to go with the flow here.' No, I learned the tools. There are protocols,' he says. 'There is a framework with which I was working. And while I was doing that, I was able to get into a rhythm, into a flow, and achieve things that I never thought I would ever do in my lifetime.'\nBloom hopes viewers will tune in to see a novice achieve remarkable feats but also to inspire them to get outside their comfort zones, be it perhaps by managing public speaking or learning a new language.\n'For me, the idea of the show was like, 'Well, what is it for you?' he asks. 'What is your version of jumping out of a plane? It doesn't have to be physical or death defying in some form or another.'\nBloom says he's in a happy place, with a good career, a loving partner and great children. That made the stakes even higher for the new series.\n'I'm very grateful for my life,' he says.

In reality, there are profoundly dissonant chords in the democracy chorus.\nStart with the seemingly good news: A New York Times/Sienna poll from fall 2022, for example, found that 71 percent of Americans agreed that 'democracy is currently under threat.' There was hardly a wisp of difference across party lines: 74 percent of Democrats agreed, but so did 72 percent of Republicans and 71 percent of independents. Kumbaya, my lord!\nSuch data has encouraged conservatives to dismiss the effort of Democrats, starting with President Biden, to insist that in the 2024 election, 'democracy is on the ballot.' The Wall Street Journal's Holman W. Jenkins Jr., for instance, recently referenced a February NBC News poll showing Biden and Donald Trump essentially tied on the issue of who would best protect democracy \u2014 43 percent of voters preferred Biden, 41 percent picked the former president. He concluded, 'pollsters find Trump voters every bit as concerned about democracy as Biden voters.'\nAdvertisement\nIf only that were true. In reality, only on one side of politics is democracy a voting issue, and the other would render our system less democratic by making it harder for voters to cast ballots.\nThat Times/Sienna poll was instructive here. It asked voters what concerned them more about elections: 'that some people will cast votes illegally' or that 'some eligible voters won't have a fair chance to vote.'\nThe country split right down the middle: 46 percent worried about illegal voting, 48 percent about voter suppression. That's because partisans were entirely at odds: 82 percent of Republicans were more concerned about voters casting illegal ballots while 76 percent of Democrats were more concerned about voters not getting a fair chance to vote.\nThis divide has led to radically different voting policies, state by state, depending on which party holds sway. The Post's Patrick Marley reported that in Michigan, controlled by Democrats, voting will be easier in 2024 than it was in 2020, whereas North Carolina, where Republicans hold a veto-proof legislative majority, has erected new barriers to the ballot box.\nAdvertisement\nAnd during his recent pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago to earn kudos from Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) pitched a federal bill to require proof of citizenship from those who would register to vote. Since Trump believes that any election he loses must have been rigged, Johnson's effort must have warmed the former president's heart.\nFollow this author E.J. Dionne Jr. 's opinions\nFollow this author\nE.J. Dionne Jr.\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nThis is not some honest disagreement about whether voting should be easier or harder. New barriers to voting and voter purges are being rationalized to solve problems that don't exist because there is no evidence \u2014 zip \u2014 that fraud is a problem in our system.\nNoncitizen voting in federal and state elections is already illegal everywhere, and studies by the Brennan Center for Justice concluded that 'votes by non-citizens account for between 0.0003 percent and 0.001 percent of all votes cast.' A separate Brennan Center report estimated incident rates for overall voter fraud between 0.0003 percent and 0.0025 percent.\nAdvertisement\nWhen someone offers policy changes based on claims devoid of any factual support, it's fair to suspect that something other than solving a real problem is motivating their proposals. On this, the Times/Sienna poll provided an important clue: It found that while 95 percent of Democrats said Biden was the 'legitimate winner' in 2020, only 31 percent of Republicans said this. Their objection is to the outcome, not the process.\nBear in mind that the voting changes introduced to make it easier to vote during the pandemic \u2014 simpler early and mail voting, widely available ballot drop boxes and the like \u2014 produced by far the largest numerical turnout in our history. Holding a successful election in a health crisis was a great victory for democracy and, by the way, the emergency reforms helped Trump get 11.2 million more votes in 2020 than he got in 2016. Yet Republicans seem eager to roll back participation.\nThe acid test of whether both sides are equally concerned about an issue is the degree to which it motivates their respective electoral coalitions. And here, the data is unambiguous: Democracy is a core concern for Democrats in a way it is not for Republicans. It's not even close.\nAdvertisement\nIn a March Quinnipiac poll, voters who listed preserving democracy as the most urgent issue facing the country favored Biden over Trump in a head-to-head matchup by 85 percent to 12 percent. That's because 32 percent of Democrats listed preserving democracy as the campaign's most important issue; only 5 percent of Republicans did.\nIn his book 'Democracy and Its Critics,' the legendary political scientist Robert A. Dahl argued that democracy was inspired by 'the vision of people governing themselves as political equals, and possessing all the resources and institutions necessary to do so.' Tearing down barriers to participation is more consistent with this goal than erecting them.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"E.J.

Kennedy Jr., the longshot independent hopeful with a famous family name whose candidacy has centered heavily on his skepticism of vaccines, barely mentions abortion.","summary":"For many Americans, November's presidential election is about one issue: abortion. President Biden hopes that a pro-abortion rights message will carry him to reelection, and Donald Trump regularly brags about his role in the end of Roe v. Wade , the Supreme Court decision that protected abortion rights nationwide.\nPresident Biden hopes that a pro-abortion rights message will carry him to reelection, and Donald Trump regularly brags about his role in the end of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that protected abortion rights nationwide.\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., the longshot independent hopeful with a famous family name whose candidacy has centered heavily on his skepticism of vaccines, barely mentions abortion. When he does, he often sends mixed signals.\nKennedy has said he believes the decision to seek an abortion should be left to women and their doctors. But he has held just one campaign event focused on abortion, an October visit to an Atlanta facility founded by Angela Stanton King \u2014 an anti-abortion and criminal justice reform activist and former Trump supporter whom the ex-president pardoned for her role in a car theft ring. In the months that followed Kennedy's appearance at Stanton King's facility, which aims to convince women to carry their pregnancies to term, he has repeated her false and inflammatory claims that abortion providers systematically target Black women.\nAdvertisement\nKennedy has avoided taking a concrete stance on the nation's patchwork of abortion bans and U.S. House Republicans' efforts to pass federal restrictions, calling abortion a 'culture war issue' used to divide people. He has said that 'every abortion is a tragedy,' but has few plans to take on the issue in the White House.\nKennedy mentioned abortion just twice in the 11 speeches and campaign events that appear on his YouTube page. He mentioned the word 'vaccine' 10 times. On X, formerly Twitter, he's mentioned the word 'abortion' five times since the start of last year. He posted the word 'vaccine' 64 times in the same period.\nTwitter, he's mentioned the word 'abortion' five times since the start of last year. He posted the word 'vaccine' 64 times in the same period.\n'He's trying to avoid what's probably the most salient issue right now,' Roy Behr, the author of 'Third Parties in America: Citizen Response to Major Party Failure.\"\nKennedy's ambiguity on abortion \u2014 an issue many voters say is a major motivator for them this race \u2014 may not hurt him in November. Kennedy, the nephew of a former president and son of a former U.S. attorney general, has appealed to a politically diverse group of supporters with nuanced views, including some who identify as conservative but weary of Trump and others who describe themselves as liberals unenthused with Biden. Outlining a clearer abortion position could hurt his standing with one or more of those groups.\nAdvertisement\nKennedy doesn't focus on abortion in speeches because it is a divisive issue, his campaign told The Washington Post.\n'Mr. Kennedy does not want to add fuel to the fire,' campaign spokeswoman Stefanie Spear wrote in an email, citing issues including chronic disease, infrastructure, disarmament and farming practices that protect the environment. 'These issues also have the potential to unify the country, unlike abortion, which is fundamentally divisive. So, Mr. Kennedy makes his position plain, but does not dwell on the subject.'\nSpear said Kennedy, who has not previously shared his thoughts on Arizona's state Supreme Court decision to revive a near-total ban on abortion earlier this month, opposes the ruling. She said he also disagreed with Trump's proposal to leave abortion restrictions up to the states.\nAdvertisement\nAfter The Post enquired about Kennedy's abortion position, the campaign added a new abortion policy page to its website, proposing 'a massive subsidized daycare initiative' paid for by funds Kennedy would reroute from Ukraine war aid. The page doesn't provide any more information about how Kennedy would respond to abortion bans in states.\nTwelve percent of voters, including two-thirds of Democrats, say abortion is the 'most important issue' in their 2024 vote, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll last month. Down the ballot, voters have signaled their disapproval of strict bans on abortion, supporting statewide referendums and candidates that would protect or expand abortion access.\nThis election marks the first time many voters will be able to weigh in post-Roe, and Kennedy's opponents could use his near-silence on abortion rights to cast doubt on his commitment to them, Democratic pollster Nancy Zdunkewicz said. New stories of women in dangerous, difficult circumstances who are unable to get abortions resonate with voters, she argued.\nAdvertisement\n'It's all way too real for people in a way that it just wasn't before,' Zdunkewicz said.\nKennedy is likely to attract voters who agree with him on vaccines and feel disaffected with the two major political parties, but will face more difficulty attracting people who aren't interested in one of his primary concerns such as vaccine safety, said Bernard Tamas, a political science professor at Valdosta State University and author of 'The Demise and Rebirth of American Third Parties.'\nvaccines and feel disaffected with the two major political parties, but will face more difficulty attracting people who aren't interested in one of his primary concerns such as vaccine safety, said Bernard Tamas, a political science professor at Valdosta State University and author of 'The Demise and Rebirth of American Third Parties.'\n'I don't think that very many people are going to make decisions for or against Kennedy based on abortion,' he said.\nKennedy's lone campaign stop focused on abortion was an October visit to Auntie Angie's House, a center for pregnant women in a Black community in Atlanta run by Stanton King. When Trump pardoned Stanton King, he cited her advocacy for people reentering society after being released from prison.\nAdvertisement\nKennedy's campaign says he 'misspoke' when he referred to the percent of Black women receiving abortions, but neither of the claims he repeated is correct according to multiple research studies.\nMore than 6 in 10 abortion clinics were located in predominantly White neighborhoods and about 1 in 10 clinics were in predominantly Black neighborhoods, according to a 2014 report from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy group that favors abortion rights. The group told The Post that post-Roe abortion bans in states with large Black populations have likely led to fewer clinics in Black neighborhoods since that analysis was completed.\nAdvertisement\nStanton King told The Post she did not ask Kennedy during his visit when he believes life begins, whether he would sign an abortion ban or his thoughts on the abortion restrictions passed in neighboring states. But Stanton King came away with the belief that Kennedy could do a better job than the major party candidates in bridging the partisan divide, and she later joined his campaign as an advisor. She said she appreciated Kennedy's promise to invest the same amount of federal resources that are committed to abortion services in social safety net programs for new mothers who need aid.\nMany of Kennedy's rare comments about abortion have come during media interviews, providing a patchy view of his policy and personal beliefs.\nAt the Iowa State Fair in August 2023, Kennedy said he would support a federal ban on abortion after 15 weeks of gestation, then said he would not 'personally' restrict abortion but added, 'I think the states have a right to protect a child once the child becomes viable, and that right, it increases.' (His campaign later clarified that he would not sign a ban.)\nIn an interview with PBS News in November, Kennedy said he didn't know what Biden could do to help protect women's access to abortions.\nAdvertisement\nIn a video released the same day as Biden's State of the Union address, in which the president called for Congress to restore Roe , Kennedy didn't mention abortion rights at all.\nRoe, Kennedy didn't mention abortion rights at all.\nBiden's allies have emphasized the president's efforts to expand access to contraception, abortion medication and emergency abortion care and point out the stark contrast with Trump's work to restrict abortion access. When Kerry Kennedy, Kennedy's sister, endorsed Biden along with more than a dozen other members of her family at a campaign rally Thursday, she cited Biden's support for abortion rights as one of the main reasons to back him.\nKennedy's running mate, Nicole Shanahan, funded research into the longevity of women's reproductive health and criticized in-vitro fertilization as 'one of the biggest lies that's being told about women's health today.' In a lengthy post on X on April 9, after Arizona's state Supreme Court decision, Shanahan wrote she 'can hold both beliefs,' suggesting bans are 'coercive' and 'wrong' but that women should carry pregnancies to term unless the mother or baby's health is at risk.\nMost voters who have already said they plan to vote for Kennedy said he talks about abortion enough.\nMike Roy, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel in Annapolis, Md., said he is voting for Kennedy because he believes the independent can keep America out of other countries' wars, close the Southern border and more aggressively regulate polluters. Abortion is not a top issue for the 46-year-old, but he agrees with Kennedy that women should have the right to choose the procedure. Still, he sees little point in Kennedy focusing on the topic.\nAdvertisement\n'I don't think he needs to talk about it more,' Roy said. 'It's such a polarizing issue and the theme of the campaign is to heal the divide.'\nLori Spencer, a Kennedy campaign volunteer in Oklahoma City who voted for the libertarian candidates in the last two presidential elections, disagrees. The 54-year-old was once a loyal Democratic voter but she left the party in 1996 after she felt like its leaders weren't keeping their promises, arguing Democrats could have protected Roe when they had the chance. Biden is no different, she believes.\nRoe when they had the chance. Biden is no different, she believes.\n'He talks the talk, but he doesn't walk the walk,' she said.\nSpencer said Kennedy might benefit from talking about abortion rights more and appealing more to voters like her who believe the government should not be involved in medical decisions.\n'I personally would like to see him be more vocal about his pro-choice beliefs,' Spencer said. 'But he'll talk about it when asked and he'll give you a clear answer. I don't think there's any ambiguity or misunderstanding of his position. He's very clear. So I'm happy enough with that.'\nKennedy's campaign has also used his abortion position to appeal to conservative voters. Rita Palma, who worked for Kennedy gathering ballot access signatures in New York, told voters in this month that the candidate's position was comparable to Trump's. Palma was later fired after being caught on video saying Kennedy could help Trump win.\n'Bobby believes and I heard this out of his own mouth: \u2018Every abortion is a tragedy,'' she said in the video. 'He's definitely not, you know, 100% pro-life. But none of the candidates are. Even Trump is saying that they have to find that, quote-unquote sweet spot in order to win elections.' Palma declined to comment for this story.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Meryl Kornfield","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DSBCT7QIG4OU74JJHQNZCX73RI_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":3.8732638,"_id":"e6624e58c5cb9a45658962484f67ec68"},{"title":"Melania Trump \u2014 and her clothes \u2014 inch back into the spotlight","author":"Rachel Tashjian","published_date":"2024-04-22 22:15:21","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/fashion/2024/04/22/melania-trump-fashion","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The former first lady appeared Saturday for her first political event since her husband, Donald Trump, became the unofficial Republican front-runner in the 2024 race.","summary":"Perhaps no political figure in history has said as much with her clothes as Melania Trump.\nRarely giving interviews and making few public appearances even when her husband was in office, the former first lady showed support for the Trump administration and stoked controversy largely through her choice of ensembles. She fed an era obsessed with uncovering secret messages and conspiracies: She infamously wore a jacket inscribed with a phrase that was ambivalently hostile for a visit to a migrant shelter in Texas, for example, and a pink pussy-bow blouse after the release in 2016 of a 2005 tape in which her husband is heard boasting about groping women.\nWhether conscious or not \u2014 she continued to pay the stylist she relied on during her time in the White House, Herv\u00e9 Pierre Braillard, through her husband's Save America PAC at least through the middle of last year \u2014 Melania speaks with her clothes, even when the messages aren't quite clear.\nAdvertisement\nSo when she appeared Saturday evening for her first political event since her husband, Donald Trump, became the unofficial Republican front-runner in the 2024 presidential race, it felt impossible to resist asking: What is she trying to say?\nWhile the former president prepared for the first day of hearings in his Manhattan criminal trial, Melania hosted a closed-door fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago for the Log Cabin Republicans, a conservative LGBT advocacy group.\nSkip to end of carousel\nThe Style section\nThe Style section Style is where The Washington Post covers happenings on the front lines of culture and what it all means, including the arts, media, social trends, politics and yes, fashion, all told with personality and deep reporting.

Melania is a longtime friend of the group, which gave her its Spirit of Lincoln Award in 2021. She posted a rare message on her mostly dormant X account, along with an image of her at the event, calling for political unity 'around the principles of liberty, justice and patriotism.' Curiously, she stands at a remove from the microphone, posing beside it rather than speaking into it, suggesting she remains more comfortable being looked at than being heard.\nAdvertisement\nWas her ensemble a gesture of sobriety? A spirit of sleek unity? A cloud of somberness?\nMost likely, she just wanted to look fantastic, and by that measure \u2014 she succeeded.\nInching back into the spotlight as the former president's inevitable candidacy congeals, Melania has made the psychology behind her clothing choices more difficult to divine.\nIn recent appearances, she dresses more like a woman who enjoys a good afternoon at Neiman Marcus. On March 19, when Florida cast its primary votes, she accompanied her husband to the polls in a white shirtdress by Alexander McQueen featuring an enormous orchid.\nIn mid-April, she attended a fundraiser for the campaign at Mar-a-Lago, wearing a purple floral jumpsuit by Valentino. Her McQueen dress was part of the finale collection of designer Sarah Burton, one of the rare female talents in fashion whose send-off show emphasized feminine beauty. And Valentino, under then-creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli, emphasizes diversity and body positivity in its runway shows and campaigns. But those marketing gestures are probably of little interest to Melania; she is not attempting to conjure any of that messaging by wearing those brands.\nJill Biden is a practitioner of classical sartorial diplomacy. Though she resists conversation about her clothes, her choices are always thoughtful: Oscar de la Renta dresses are chosen because the brand's designers are immigrants; a Gabriela Hearst dress is decorated with flowers from every U.S. state and territory; a coat and dress she wore to the inauguration champions the work of a young American designer.\nMelania is not so traditional, though observers have long debated whether she plays these games. In her 2019 book 'Free, Melania,' former CNN correspondent Kate Bennett wrote that Melania probably scoffs at those who attempt deep readings of her Instagram posts: 'to read into these glamour shots is an exercise in futility,' Bennett wrote. But she also acknowledged how savvily the former first lady wears her clothes: 'I think she wanted [the pink pussy-bow blouse] to land in that gray area between Trump supporters thinking she's on the side of her husband and anti-Trumpers thinking she's sending them a silent signal acknowledging their rage.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIf anything, her clothes remain on costume-y.

Such listings would make harvesting the fish illegal, but without them, popular sturgeon harvest seasons in states such as Wisconsin and Michigan can continue.\nThe center argued that overharvesting and deteriorating habitat have 'severely depleted' the species. Dams block access to spawning and rearing habitat and water pollution and diversions have done 'irreparable harm,' the center said.\nAdvertisement\n'This is a disappointing decision because though some populations are well managed, overall the lake sturgeon has suffered a drastic decline,' said Tierra Curry, a senior scientist at the center. 'Endangered Species Act protection would bring a comprehensive recovery plan and ongoing funding to restore these iconic fish across their former range.'\nChuck Traxler, the wildlife service's Midwest deputy regional director, said stocking has helped grow adult lake sturgeon populations and increase spawning, agency officials said. Putting the creatures on the list would be like going to the emergency room, and the rebounding species doesn't need that level of protection, said\n'It doesn't mean everything is good right now,' he said. 'It means keep up the good work.'\nPopulations aren't at historical highs, the agency acknowledged in a December assessment, but stocking returned them to the Red River of the North between Minnesota and North Dakota, the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers, portions of the Mississippi River and the Coosa River.\nAdvertisement\nDam removals and habitat restoration efforts also have helped, the agency has said, citing work in 2015 to retrofit a dam on Wisconsin's Menominee River to allow spawning sturgeon to travel upstream and the removal of the Brecksville Dam on Ohio's Cuyahoga River in 2020.\nThe agency also pointed to reef restoration work in the corridor connecting Lake Huron and Lake Erie that has created a place for sturgeon to lay eggs and noted that nine of 43 toxic spots along Great Lakes shorelines have been cleaned up.\nThe assessment also noted the adaptable species should be able to withstand warmer water due to climate change.\nLake sturgeon are ancient North American freshwater fish. They're essentially living fossils, first appearing about 136 million years ago when dinosaurs ruled the planet. They resemble torpedoes, with dorsal ridges and snouts. They can grow up to 7 feet (2 meters) long and weigh up to 300 pounds (136 kilograms). Males typically live about 50 years. Females can live anywhere between 80 and 150 years.\nAdvertisement\nThey're found in the upper and lower Mississippi River basin as well as the Great Lakes. Commercial anglers considered lake sturgeon a nuisance because they tore their nets, leading to widespread over-harvesting in the 1800s that continued into the 20th century.\nLake sturgeon can't reproduce fast enough to replace the losses. It takes up to three decades before they reach spawning age, and even then they don't spawn annually. And many don't survive the trip back to their birth waters to spawn. The wildlife service has compared lake sturgeon losses to the mass destruction of the American buffalo.\nTwenty states have outlawed sturgeon harvesting. Fourteen of those states have listed lake sturgeon as threatened or endangered. Volunteers and Wisconsin natural resources officials have been guarding spawning sturgeon from poachers on the Wolf River for 30 years.\nAdvertisement\nMichigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin still hold hook-and-line lake sturgeon fishing seasons. Michigan and Wisconsin hold sturgeon spearing seasons each winter as well where anglers drill holes through lake ice and impale sturgeon as they swim past.\nThe Wisconsin natural resources department reported 432 sturgeon were taken in February, down from 1,405 in 2023. Warm weather and poor ice conditions led to the diminished return, according to the department. Michigan officials set the total harvest limit at just six sturgeon but ended up canceling due to warm weather and unsafe ice conditions.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThose states' seasons are so tightly regulated that the harvests don't impact the species overall, said Lori Nordstrom, the wildlife service's Midwest assistant regional director of ecological services.\nMichigan and Wisconsin, for example, allow an angler to take only one sturgeon per year. Minnesota anglers must release any sturgeon they catch in inland waters. Wisconsin regulations are designed to keep the harvest rate below 5%, with all tag fees going to the state's sturgeon conservation program, according to the wildlife service.\nAdvertisement\nLeaders of Sturgeon for Tomorrow, a nonprofit organization that works to rehabilitate sturgeon in Wisconsin and Michigan and supports harvesting the fish, praised the wildlife service's decision Monday. They said the ruling enables the states to continue managing sturgeon and allows harvesting to continue, which in turn helps researchers learn more about the ancient creatures.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Todd Richmond","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MNW5FTAAVAI67DVMHHDNZNM6WU.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":3.8341732,"_id":"00e8938a4d9bc557606901151d184f83"}],"user_input":{"q":"conservative","search_in":["title_summary_en"],"lang":["en"],"not_lang":null,"countries":null,"not_countries":null,"from":"2024-04-15 00:00:00","to":null,"ranked_only":"True","from_rank":null,"to_rank":null,"sort_by":"relevancy","page":1,"size":100,"sources":["washingtonpost.com"],"not_sources":[],"topic":null,"published_date_precision":null}}
