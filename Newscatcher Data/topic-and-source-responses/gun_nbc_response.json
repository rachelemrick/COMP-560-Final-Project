            "excerpt": "The latest gun rights dispute concerns the Biden administration's effort to regulate gun-making kits the same way as commercially available firearms.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to consider whether the Biden administration can lawfully regulate so-called ghost guns — firearms that are made from kits available online that people can assemble at home.\nThe justices took up a Biden administration appeal in defense of regulations that a lower court invalidated. The provisions in question are currently in effect while litigation continues.\nIn August of last year, the Supreme Court allowed the regulation to be enforced on a 5-4 vote, with Chief Justice John Roberts and fellow conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the three liberal justices in the majority.\nThe federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, commonly known as ATF, issued the regulations in 2022 to tackle what it claims has been an abrupt increase in the availability of ghost guns. The guns are difficult for law enforcement to trace, with the administration calling them a major threat to public safety.\nThe rule clarified that the parts used to make ghost guns fit within the definition of 'firearm' under the federal Gun Control Act, meaning the government has the power to regulate them the same way it regulates firearms manufactured and sold through the traditional process.\nThe regulations require manufacturers and sellers of the kits to obtain licenses, mark the products with serial numbers, conduct background checks and maintain records.\nTexas-based U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor last year ruled in favor of Jennifer VanDerStok and Michael Andren, who own components they want to use to build guns. Plaintiffs also include gun rights groups and makers and sellers of ghost guns.\nAfter the Supreme Court allowed the regulation to remain in effect while litigation moved forward, the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals mostly ruled for the challengers.\n\"Because Congress has neither authorized the expansion of firearm regulation nor permitted the criminalization of previously lawful conduct, the proposed rule constitutes unlawful agency action, in direct contravention of the legislature's will,\" the ruling said.\nIf that decision were allowed to go into effect, \"anyone could buy a kit online and assemble a fully functional gun in minutes — no background check, records, or serial number required,\" Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in court papers.\n\"The result would be a flood of untraceable ghost guns into our nation's communities, endangering the public and thwarting law-enforcement efforts to solve violent crimes,\" she added.\nThe challengers agreed with the Biden administration that the Supreme Court should take up the case, citing its nationwide importance.\nTheir lawyers wrote that it is not the job of the ATF to expand the meaning of \"firearm\" under the Gun Control Act.\n\"If that definition has become obsolete or unsatisfactory in any way, that is an issue for Congress to address,\" they wrote.\nThe Supreme Court's conservative majority has backed gun rights in multiple cases, including the landmark 2022 ruling that for the first time recognized that the Constitution's Second Amendment includes a right to bear arms outside the home.\nThe court is currently weighing the scope of that decision in a case concerning whether people accused of domestic violence have a right to own firearms.\nThe ghost guns case, however, is on a separate legal question related to ATF's regulatory authority, not the right to bear arms.\nThe justices are set to decide a similar case in the coming weeks, a challenge to another ATF regulation that banned \"bump stocks,\" an accessory that allows semi-automatic rifles to be fired rapidly.\nLawrence Hurley",

            "summary": "A former Philadelphia police officer who killed a 12-year-old boy and allegedly fired two of the shots during a foot chase after the boy had discarded his gun pleaded guilty to murder Friday, the prosecutors' office said.\nEdsaul Mendoza, 28, pleaded guilty to third-degree murder and possession of an instrument of crime in the March 1, 2022, death of Thomas 'TJ' Siderio, the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office said.\n'Justice must be even-handed. Everyone must be accountable under the law,' District Attorney Larry Krasner said in a statement.\nA possible sentence was not disclosed. Sentencing was scheduled for July 22.\nMendoza was fired by the Philadelphia Police Department and was charged with first-degree murder, third-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and possession of an instrument of a crime in May 2022.\nA grand jury said in a court document that Mendoza and three other officers, who were on-duty but in plain clothes, stopped Siderio and his 17-year-old friend as they were riding bikes at around 7:30 p.m., after they recognized the 17-year-old as \"tangentially connected\" to a stolen gun case.\nThe unmarked police car's lights were activated, and a shot went off that broke the police car passenger side window.\nand a shot went off that broke the police car passenger side window. The boys ran and split up. Mendoza chased Siderio, who had a gun at the time, on foot, according to the grand jury document.\nMendoza fired three times — but the last two shots were after Siderio had discarded the gun, prosecutors said. The final and fatal shot was fired from about 10 feet away, according to the grand jury document.\nThe gun Siderio threw was later found, and the grand jury concluded that he likely fired a Taurus 9mm handgun at the unmarked car before the fatal chase.\nSiderio was shot in the back when he was unarmed, and died within 90 seconds, according to the grand jury document.\nIt said Siderio 'had certainly stopped running and was possibly surrendering,' when he was killed.\nKrasner has described the foot chase as 'tactically unsound' and called the boy's death a tragedy.\nWhen Siderio was struck by the third shot, he had either fallen or dove to the ground, the grand jury said in the document. If Mendoza thought the boy was armed, the tactically correct thing to do would be to take cover and approach, and Mendoza did not do that and ran up the street completely exposed, it says.\n'PO Mendoza's approach to Thomas Siderio was then completely inconsistent with P0 Mendoza believing that Thomas Siderio was armed,' the grand jury said in the document.\nMendoza's attorney did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment left after business hours Friday evening.\nPhil Helsel",

'I feel scared. Even right now, my heart is still hurt.'\nThe robbery happened at about 12:30 p.m. just as the store was opening. As Trinh ducked for cover, she yelled for her husband, who came out with a gun. It was enough to scare the robbers out of the door but not before stealing the store's most expensive inventory.\n'They took the special diamonds right here,' Trinh said. 'They took a lot. Then gold, 18 karat gold, 34 karat gold.'\nTrinh's son, Tony, said the thieves 'knew exactly what they wanted.'\n'They went after the main core items that is pretty much 85 to 90% of the value of our entire inventory,' he said.\nThe group got in after Trinh said one man pretended to be a customer.\nIn total, she said nine people were involved.\nShe also said the chaos is bringing back trauma for the family.

But it definitely brought back that.'\nTony is the executive director of Oakland's Chinatown Improvement Council. He said the break-in also brings an added burden because the store is no longer insured.\n'Insurance costs so much with jewelry, especially in Oakland Chinatown,' he said. 'A lot of businesses here don't even qualify.'\nA GoFundMe campaign has been set up to help the 40-year-old store recover and keep its doors open, something customers said is critically important for the entire community.\n'Hopefully they stay,' customer Joey Golaw said. 'It will be a big loss for the city and for the people like us who come here year in and year out.'\nAs the family works to keep their legacy alive, they said they are committed to not letting crime drive them out of Oakland.\n'I think we need to be strong,' Tony said.

The gold was melted down and used to purchase illegal firearms, police said.\nThose charged include a Air Canada warehouse employee and a former Air Canada manager who gave police a tour of cargo of the facility after the theft. A jewelry store owner is also charged.\n'This story is a sensational one and which probably, we jokingly say, belongs in a Netflix series,' Peel Regional Chief Nishan Duraiappah said.\nPeel Reginal Detective Sgt. Mike Mavity said the gold bars, weighing 419 kilograms (923 pounds), and foreign currency, ordered from a refinery in Zurich, Switzerland, were transported in the haul of a Air Canada flight on April 17 last year.\nHe said that late afternoon a truck driver arrived at the airline's cargo warehouse with a fraudulent bill that was provided to a airline warehouse attendant.\nMavity said a bill for seafood that was picked up the day before was used to pick up the gold. The duplicate bill was printed off at the Air Canada warehouse, he said.\n'They needed people within Air Canada to facilitate this theft,' Mavity said in front of the truck police say was used in the theft.\nMavity said police are searching for the Air Canada manager who gave police a tour of the facility in the days after the theft. He said that manager left his job last summer and said they have an idea of where he is.\nMavity said some of the suspects were known to police and some were not. He said they seized six crudely made bracelets made of gold.\n'I don't think I ever imagined they would have to deal with the largest gold heist in Canadian history,' said Patrick Brown, the mayor of Brampton, Ontario. 'It's almost out of an ‘Ocean's Eleven' movie or CSI.'\nAir Canada employee Parmpal Sidhu, 54, from Brampton, Ontario, jewelry store owner Ali Raza, 37, from Toronto, Amit Jalota, 40, a Oakville, Ontario resident, Ammad Chaudhary, 43, from Georgetown, Ontario and Prasath Paramalingam, 35, from Brampton are among those that have been arrested. Mavity said they have been released on bail conditions and will be in court at a later date.\nMavity said the truck driver that allegedly picked up the gold, Durante King-Mclean, a 25-year-old from Brampton, is currently in custody in the U.S. on firearms and trafficking related charges.\nPolice are searching for former Air Canada manager Simran Preet Panesar, 31, from Brampton as well as Archit Grover, 36, from Brampton and Arsalan Chaudhary, 42, from Mississauga Ontario.\nPeel Regional Deputy Chief Nick Milinovich said only CA$90,000 ($65,00) of the more than CA$20 million has been recovered.\nU.S. ATF Special Agent, Eric DeGree, said King-Mclean, was arrested in Pennsylvania after a traffic stop and that led to the seizure of 65 illegal firearms that were allegedly destined to be smuggled into Canada. DeGree said he tried to flee after police discovered the firearms in his rental car.\nBrinks, an American cash handling company, arrived at the airport cargo facility the night of April 17 to pick up the gold and were told the gold and currency was missing after a search.\nBrinks sued Air Canada over the theft last year. According to the company's filing last year, a thief walked away with the costly cargo after presenting a fake document at an Air Canada warehouse on April 17.\nIn a Nov. 8 statement of defense, Air Canada rejected 'each and every allegation' in the Brink's lawsuit, saying it fulfilled its carriage contracts and denying any improper or 'careless' conduct.\nThe country's largest airline also said Brink's failed to note the value of the haul on the waybill — a document typically issued by a carrier with details of the shipment — and that if Brink's did suffer losses, a multilateral treaty known as the Montreal Convention would cap Air Canada's liability.\nIn Federal Court filings that claim breach of contract and millions of dollars in damages, Brinks said an 'unidentified individual' gained access to the airline's cargo warehouse and presented a 'fraudulent' waybill shortly after an Air Canada flight from Zurich landed at Pearson.\nThe statement of the claim says the staff then handed over 400 kilograms of gold in the form of 24 bars plus nearly $2 million in cash to the thief, who promptly 'absconded with the cargo.'\nDeGree said dozens of firearms authorities were seized, including two fully automatic weapons and five guns that were untraceable.\n'I'm proud to say that we successfully put an international gun trafficking operation out of business. We kept 65 firearms off the streets of Canada and prevented them from being used in any number of crimes,' DeGree said.\nMavity said that 'we believe they melted down the gold and with the profits they got from the gold they used to purchase illegal firearms.'\nThe Associated Press",

            "excerpt": "Anderson chronicled his abduction and torturous imprisonment by Islamic militants in his best-selling 1993 memoir 'Den of Lions.' He died Sunday at his home, his daughter said.",
            "summary": "LOS ANGELES — Terry Anderson, the globe-trotting Associated Press correspondent who became one of America's longest-held hostages after he was snatched from a street in war-torn Lebanon in 1985 and held for nearly seven years, has died at 76.\nAnderson, who chronicled his abduction and torturous imprisonment by Islamic militants in his best-selling 1993 memoir 'Den of Lions,' died on Sunday in at his home in Greenwood Lake, New York, said his daughter, Sulome Anderson.\nThe cause of death was unknown, though his daughter said Anderson recently had heart surgery.\nAfter returning to the United States in 1991, Anderson led a peripatetic life, giving public speeches, teaching journalism at several prominent universities and, at various times, operating a blues bar, Cajun restaurant, horse ranch and gourmet restaurant.\nHe also struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder, won millions of dollars in frozen Iranian assets after a federal court concluded that country played a role in his capture, then lost most of it to bad investments. He filed for bankruptcy in 2009.\nUpon retiring from the University of Florida in 2015, Anderson settled on a small horse farm in a quiet, rural section of northern Virginia he had discovered while camping with friends. `\n'I live in the country and it's reasonably good weather and quiet out here and a nice place, so I'm doing all right,' he said with a chuckle during a 2018 interview with The Associated Press.\nIn 1985 he became one of several Westerners abducted by members of the Shia Muslim group Hezbollah during a time of war that had plunged Lebanon into chaos.\nAfter his release, he returned to a hero's welcome at AP's New York headquarters.\nAs the AP's chief Middle East correspondent, Anderson had been reporting for several years on the rising violence gripping Lebanon as the country fought a war with Israel, while Iran funded militant groups trying to topple its government.\nOn March 16, 1985, a day off, he had taken a break to play tennis with former AP photographer Don Mell and was dropping Mell off at his home when gun-toting kidnappers dragged him from his car.\nHe was likely targeted, he said, because he was one of the few Westerners still in Lebanon and because his role as a journalist aroused suspicion among members of Hezbollah.\n'Because in their terms, people who go around asking questions in awkward and dangerous places have to be spies,' he told the Virginia newspaper The Review of Orange County in 2018.\nWhat followed was nearly seven years of brutality during which he was beaten, chained to a wall, threatened with death, often had guns held to his head and often was kept in solitary confinement for long periods of time.\nAnderson was the longest held of several Western hostages Hezbollah abducted over the years, including Terry Waite, the former envoy to the Archbishop of Canterbury, who had arrived to try to negotiate his release.\nBy his and other hostages' accounts, he was also their most hostile prisoner, constantly demanding better food and treatment, arguing religion and politics with his captors, and teaching other hostages sign language and where to hide messages so they could communicate privately.\nHe managed to retain a quick wit and biting sense of humor during his long ordeal. On his last day in Beirut he called the leader of his kidnappers into his room to tell him he'd just heard an erroneous radio report saying he'd been freed and was in Syria.\n'I said, ‘Mahmound, listen to this, I'm not here. I'm gone, babes. I'm on my way to Damascus.' And we both laughed,' he told Giovanna DellÓrto, author of 'AP Foreign Correspondents in Action: World War II to the Present.'\nHe learned later his release was delayed when a third party who his kidnappers planned to turn him over to left for a tryst with his mistress and they had to find someone else.\nAnderson's humor often hid the PTSD he acknowledged suffering for years afterward.\n'The AP got a couple of British experts in hostage decompression, clinical psychiatrists, to counsel my wife and myself and they were very useful,' he said in 2018. 'But one of the problems I had was I did not recognize sufficiently the damage that had been done.\n'So, when people ask me, you know, ‘Are you over it?' Well, I don't know. No, not really. It's there. I don't think about it much these days, it's not central to my life. But it's there.'\nAt the time of his abduction, Anderson was engaged to be married and his future wife was six months pregnant with their daughter, Sulome.\nThe couple married soon after his release but divorced a few years later, and although they remained on friendly terms Anderson and his daughter were estranged for years.\n'I love my dad very much. My dad has always loved me. I just didn't know that because he wasn't able to show it to me.,' Sulome Anderson told the AP in 2017.\nFather and daughter reconciled after the publication of her critically acclaimed 2017 book, 'The Hostage's Daughter,' in which she told of traveling to Lebanon to confront and eventually forgive one of her father's kidnappers.\nTerry Anderson arrives to a festive welcome at Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Va., on Dec. 12, 1991. Barry Thumma / AP 'I think she did some extraordinary things, went on a very difficult personal journey, but also accomplished a pretty important piece of journalism doing it,' Anderson said. 'She's now a better journalist than I ever was.'\nTerry Alan Anderson was born Oct. 27, 1947. He spent his early childhood years in the small Lake Erie town of Vermillion, Ohio, where his father was a police officer.\nAfter graduating from high school, he turned down a scholarship to the University of Michigan in favor of enlisting in the Marines, where he rose to the rank of staff sergeant while seeing combat during the Vietnam War.\nAfter returning home, he enrolled at Iowa State University where he graduated with a double major in journalism and political science and soon after went to work for the AP. He reported from Kentucky, Japan and South Africa before arriving in Lebanon in 1982, just as the country was descending into chaos.\n'Actually, it was the most fascinating job I've ever had in my life,' he told The Review. 'It was intense. War's going on — it was very dangerous in Beirut. Vicious civil war, and I lasted about three years before I got kidnapped.'\nAnderson was married and divorced three times. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by another daughter, Gabrielle Anderson, from his first marriage.",

Kristopher Shultz said.\n\"Mr. Brock received some scam call by a person purporting to be someone from our courts who informed him a family member was incarcerated and that he had a bond of a significant amount of money,\" Shultz said. \"The calls turned from 'I'm an officer in the court' to 'We have this subject hostage, this is a ransom demand.'\"\nThe person who called Brock, or an accomplice, requested an Uber ride to his South Charleston home to pick up the money, Shultz said.\n\"Ms. Hall did not have any idea,\" he added.\nWhen Hall arrived at the home and approached the front door, Brock confronted her with a gun and asked her who she was working for, Shultz said. He took her cellphone and prevented her from getting in her vehicle and driving away.\n'When she tried to get away, he shot her once, then there was more exchange between them,\" Shultz said. \"Mr. Brock was at some point injured his head, and he shot Ms. Hall a second time.

Officials have not identified the person who requested the Uber, and have not said if they have made any additional arrests in connection with the case.\nIn a grand jury presentation Monday, Brock was indicted on three counts of murder, one count of felonious assault and one count of kidnapping, Shultz said. He will be arraigned on those charges later this week.\nIt was not immediately clear if he has an attorney.\nBrock was originally indicted on murder in the Municipal Court of Clark County on Wednesday and posted a $200,000 bond.\nMirna Alsharif Allison Burstein contributed.",

            "summary": "MEXICO CITY — Two mayoral candidates in Mexico were found dead Friday, bringing to 17 the number of contenders slain in the lead-up to the June 2 election.\nOne candidate was killed Friday in the northern Mexico border state of Tamaulipas. Noé Ramos Ferretiz was running for a coalition of the opposition National Action Party and Institutional Revolutionary Party, which had governed Mexico until 2000. He was running for reelection as mayor of the city of Ciudad Mante.\nAnother mayoral candidate in the southern state of Oaxaca was found dead a day after he was reported missing. Alberto García was running for mayor of the Oaxaca town of San José Independencia.\nOaxaca state prosecutors said García was found dead, apparently beaten to death, on an island in a reservoir near the town. In the past, drug gangs have been active in the area.\nThe June 2 national elections that are shaping up to be the country's most violent on record.\nProsecutors in Tamaulipas said Ramos Ferretiz was attacked on Friday, but did not give details beyond saying they're investigating.\nLocal media reported he had been stabbed and posted photos showing a bloodied body lying on a sidewalk. Tamaulipas has long been riven by drug cartel turf wars. Ciudad Mante is located in the southern part of the state, relatively far from border cities like Reynosa and Matamoros.\n'We will not allow violence to decide these elections,' PRI party leader Alejandro Moreno wrote on social media, where he confirmed the 'cowardly assassination' of Ramos Ferretiz.\nIn Oaxaca, the state electoral board condemned the death of García, who went missing along with his wife — the current mayor of San José Independencia — earlier this week. The wife was found alive.\nThe electoral board called García's death a 'killing,' and said such crimes 'should not occur during elections.'\nIn early April, mayoral candidate Bertha Gaytán was gunned down, hours after she requested protection and started campaigning. Gaytán was fatally shot on a street in a town outside the city of Celaya, in the north-central state of Guanajuato. She had just launched her campaign for Celaya mayor.\nMexico's drug cartels have often focused assassination attempts on mayors and mayoral candidates, in a bid to control local police or extort money from municipal governments.\nPresident Andrés Manuel López Obrador acknowledged in early April that drug cartels often seek to determine who will serve as mayor — either by running their own candidate or eliminating potential rivals.\n'They make an agreement and say, ‘this person is going to be mayor; we don't want anyone else to register to run,' and anybody who does, well, they know' what to expect, he said.\nThe recent slayings have prompted the government to provide bodyguards for about 250 candidates, but those running for municipal positions — while the most endangered — are the last in line for security.\nViolence against politicians is widespread in Mexico. In early April, the mayor of Churumuco, a town in the neighboring state of Michoacán, was shot to death at a taco restaurant in the state capital, Morelia.\nIn late February in another town in Michoacán, two mayoral hopefuls were shot to death within hours of each other.\nThe Associated Press",

            "summary": "India's Central Bureau of Investigation said last month that it was aware of at least 35 Indian nationals who had been trained for combat and sent to fight in Ukraine against their will after being recruited for jobs in Russia through agents or social media. Some of them have been 'grievously injured,' the agency said.\nThe agency said it had arrested 35 people on suspicion of being involved in human trafficking, and that it had seized about 50 million rupees ($600,000) in cash as well as incriminating documents and electronic records in searches around the country.\nThe Indian Ministry of External Affairs said officials were doing their best to get the men home as soon as possible.\n'We have also told people not to venture in the war zone or get caught into situations which are difficult,' ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, adding that India was in regular touch with Russian authorities in New Delhi and Moscow and was deeply committed to the 'welfare of all Indians.'\nIndia has ties with both Russia and the West and has tried to remain neutral in the Ukraine war, calling for peace talks while refraining from condemning President Vladimir Putin's invasion. It has also increased purchases of Russian oil that is steeply discounted amid Western sanctions.\nSajad Ahmad Kumar said his brother and others are now in Russian-occupied Ukraine after crossing the Black Sea under the command of two officers from the Russian army.\n'Things have eased a bit for them,' he said. 'He used to call from someone's phone but now he has got his own connection.'\nHe said Kumar and several other Indians had approached their embassy in Moscow for help getting home but that officials there 'are not taking things seriously.'\nThe Indian Embassy in Moscow did not respond to requests for comment.\nAt least two Indian citizens have been killed while fighting alongside the Russian army on the Russia-Ukraine border. They were identified last month as Hemil Ashvinbhai Mangukiya and Mohammad Asfan, from the states of Gujarat and Telangana.\nMangukiya's father, Ashvinbhai Mangukiya, said his son had been hired as a helper for the Russian army.\n'He was supposed to be stationed at Moscow, but he was forced to participate in the ongoing war between the two nations,' he said.\nMangukiya went to Russia to collect his son's body after he was killed in the Donetsk region in February. Like others, he has filed cases with the police against Khan and others associated with Baba Vlogs.\n'Baba Vlogs is running a nexus,' he said. 'The government should take cognizance and arrest all individuals involved in this criminal activity.'\nAbdul Rouf, whose son Abdul Nayeem left for Russia in December, said he had spoken to Khan and others at Baba Vlogs when Nayeem, 30, told him they had gotten him a similar job as an army helper in Russia when he approached them in Dubai.\n'The job agent assured me that he will not be handed a gun to fight in Ukraine or anywhere else,' said Rouf, a resident of Gulbarga city in the Indian state of Karnataka. His son has since told him that he is in Ukraine, and Rouf is planning to travel to Russia to try to help him.\nMohammad Mustafa, another Karnataka resident whose son is stranded in Russian-occupied Ukraine, said he was tired of waiting for news and was going to Russia himself.\n'We can go to any extent to retrieve our children,' he said.\n'Two Indian citizens have already been killed and we don't want to lose any other person.'\nMuheet Ul Islam",

            "summary": "PARIS — Meandering down the Seine River, the light breeze, gentle current and the sun's glistening rays weren't the only things the three kayakers were hoping to catch on a warm spring day — they were also on the hunt for garbage.\nBy attaching nylon stockings to the side of their kayaks, they scooped up even the smallest fragments of plastic, as well as the everyday detritus of life in the French capital that washes to the river's surface every time it rains. The members of the Arc en Seine Kayak club then sent what they had collected to be tested for bacterial levels.\n'My kayak capsized this morning and I'm OK,' a laughing Paul Maakad told NBC News on Sunday, at the Pont de Sevres in central Paris.\nBut while Maakad, 40, and his fellow boaters said they were not scared of getting into the river, with less than 100 days to go before the 2024 Paris Olympics, fears are growing that events like the marathon swim, the triathlon and the paratriathlon could be postponed or canceled because of high pollution levels, or that the flotilla-based opening ceremony could be affected.\nKayakers Paul Maakad, Sarah Birden and Vincent Darnet with the trash they collected from the Seine River. Joel Lawrence / NBC News Earlier this month, Tony Estanguet, the president of the Paris Organizing Committee, expressed confidence \"that it will be possible to use the Seine,' but admitted that the swimming leg of the triathlon could be canceled if pollution levels are too high. \"It's what we want to avoid, of course,' he said.\nHis comments came days after a French charity warned that bacteria, including 'pollution of fecal origin,' was far higher in the river than permitted.\nAs part of an ambitious plan to open up the Seine to public swimmers by 2025 — after being illegal for 100 years because of dangerously high pollution levels — France has spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) on altering and upgrading the city's antiquated sewage system, which now includes a 13-million-gallon overflow tank called the Austerlitz Basin.\nBut in August, the swim portion of the test marathon event was canceled because the river failed pollution tests.\nAs the starting gun to the games approaches, Fluidion, one of the companies contracted by the city of Paris to monitor bacteria in the water exclusively shared their findings with NBC News.\nexclusively shared their findings with NBC News. Paul Maakad and Vincent Darnet are members of the Arc en Seine Kayak club. Joel Lawrence / NBC News A sample of water collected by the Pont Alexander III bridge, in the city's center, showed e-coli levels two-and-a-half times the level considered safe for swimming.\nBut that in itself isn't necessarily a concern for the Games themselves, according to Dan Angelescu, the CEO of Fluidion, a tech company that develops water testing products.\n'In the summer when there is a lot of sunlight, when the water flow, river flow rate is really low, and when there is no rain for several weeks, let's say two or three weeks without rain, you can actually reach really good water quality conditions,' he said in an interview this month.\nBut he added that even a small rain event could make E. coli levels shoot up.\n'You may swim in very polluted water and nothing may happen to you, or you may swim and you may develop itches, or you may develop infections, or you may catch a strain of E. coli that may be pathogenic,\" he said. \"Those aren't very common, but they exist, and that could get you really sick.'",

            "excerpt": "With the chamber evenly divided, Democratic wins would restore the party's trifecta of power in the battleground state.",
            "summary": "Voters in Michigan will head to the polls Tuesday for a pair of state House special elections that will determine partisan control of the chamber.\nIn the race for the open seat in the 13th state House District — which encompasses a large part of the city of Warren, within purple Macomb County — Democrat Mai Xiong, a member of the Macomb County Board of Commissioners, is running against Republican Ronald Singer, who ran for the seat unsuccessfully in 2022. The seat, which leans Democratic, became vacant last fall when the incumbent Democrat, Lori Stone, resigned after she won an election to be the mayor of Warren.\nIn the race for the open seat in the 25th state House District — which includes, within Wayne County, some of the western suburbs of Detroit, like Westland and Sheldon — Democrat Peter Herzberg, a Westland City council member, is running against Republican Josh Powell, a U.S. Army veteran. The seat, which also leans Democratic, became vacant last fall when the incumbent Democrat, Kevin Coleman, resigned after winning an election to be the mayor of Westland.\nThe winner of each race will only serve the remainder of their predecessors' two-year terms through the end of 2024.\nPrior to the two lawmakers' resignations, Democrats had held a two-seat advantage in the state House. Their departures created a 54-54 tie in the chamber. Democrats also hold the governorship and the state Senate in Michigan, meaning that a pair of victories would again provide the party with a trifecta in state government.\nBoth districts heavily lean Democratic: In 2022, Stone won her seat with 67% support, while Coleman received 63% of the vote. But the races could still serve as a referendum on the Democratic trifecta — and on the long list of policy moves they made with it. Led by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, over the past two years Michigan Democrats have enacted laws protecting abortion rights, boosting union rights, combatting gun violence and expanding LGBTQ protections.\nFueled by continued success across the country on the issue of abortion, Democrats in the state have largely made the races about reproductive rights.\nXiong and Herzberg have emphasized their support for reproductive rights and the litany of moves made by the Democratic Legislature protecting them. Powell has said he opposes all abortion care 'without exception' and has suggested he'd try to repeal the state's abortion protections, while Singer has focused his campaign on economic issues.\n'It's significant,' Michigan Democratic state House Speaker Joe Tate said, referring to the role abortion rights is playing in both of the special elections. 'It's large — and for good reason.'\n'It's top of mind for voters,' he added.\nThe Democratic candidates have also run heavily on the accomplishments that the party achieved during its trifecta, betting that voters in these two districts within the pivotal presidential battleground will reward that list of progressive policies.\n'Michigan is a shining example of what Democrats do in leadership,' said Abhi Rahman, a spokesperson for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee — the national Democratic Party arm in charge of funding candidates for state legislative races — which invested about $48,000 in the pair of races.\n'Fundamental freedoms are at stake in Michigan,' he said. 'The Democratic trifecta is at stake.'\nDemocrats have enjoyed a solid record in special state legislative elections in recent months.\nIn February, Democrats won a state House special election in Pennsylvania, preserving the party's narrow majority in the closely watched battleground state. And last month, the Democratic candidate in a special election for a state House seat in Alabama won after she made in vitro fertilization and abortion rights central to her campaign.\nAdam Edelman",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — An alleged Jan. 6 participant charged with assaulting officers during the attack on the U.S. Capitol was identified with the help of facial recognition and a scar above his left eye.\nJoshua Lee Atwood was known as 'LeadPipeGuy' by online \"sedition hunters,\" who identified him to the bureau back in 2021. Court records show that Atwood was arrested by the FBI on Wednesday in Burgettstown, Pennsylvania, and charged with assaulting law enforcement on Jan. 6.\nA ten-year-old mugshot of Atwood 'included a ... scar on the left portion of ATWOOD's forehead,' according to the FBI, which said it matched the scar to photos of Atwood outside the Capitol on Jan. 6.\nLast year, Atwood was arrested in Pennsylvania in connection with an alleged armed robbery and assault at the Crazy Donkey restaurant in West Virginia. The Weirton Daily Times reported that Atwood \"allegedly grabbed money from the cash drawer at the restaurant during the argument and attempted to flee, stabbing the victim in his arm on his way out while retrieving a dropped firearm.\" A patrolman involved in that arrest helped confirm the ID to the FBI, according to the bureau. Court records show that Atwood's bond was set at $100,000 in that case before it was transferred to the Hancock County Circuit Court. The Hancock County Circuit Court told NBC News that Atwood was recently indicted in that case and has not yet entered a plea.\nVideos compiled by open-source investigators and cited by the FBI show \"multiple instances\" of Atwood \"attacking law enforcement officers defending the Tunnel between approximately 4:51 p.m. and 5:03 p.m.,\" the bureau said. He appears to have thrown a bottle that struck an officer, a long silver pole that struck an officer, a small square object, and another small object that appeared to be a bottle, according to the FBI. He also used a long wooden pole to \"strike multiple officers using a stabbing motion with a significant amount of force\" before he threw that pole, used a stolen police shield to strike another officer's shield and threw a metal pipe, the bureau said.\nJoshua Lee Atwood standing in front of a broken window at the Capitol. U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia 'F--- off, you guys are all pieces of s---,' Atwood said to law enforcement on Jan. 6 in one body-worn camera video cited by prosecutors. 'Everyone of you should be ashamed of yourself. Every one of you mother f----ers are pieces of s---. Betraying your country like this, why would you betray your country? Do you love our country ... communist f---.'\nMore than 1,387 people have been charged in connection with the Capitol attack, and more than 984 defendants have been convicted. Of the more than 859 defendants sentenced, more than 520 have been sentenced to periods of incarceration that have ranged from a few days behind bars to 22 years in federal prison. The overwhelming majority of Jan. 6 defendants currently in custody either admitted to their criminal conduct or were found guilty at trial; only 15 Jan. 6 defendants are currently in pre-trial custody.\nAtwood is far from the only Jan. 6 defendant charged with another crime after they allegedly participated in the Capitol attack. One Jan. 6 defendant who is charged with firing off a gun during the attack fatally stabbed a 19-year-old in a park, but was not charged in that case after claiming self-defense. Another Jan. 6 defendant, who the FBI says was just the fourth person to breach the Capitol building, allegedly plotted to murder the FBI employees investigating him while he was out on bail and awaiting trial; he is set to go on trial in that case later this year.\nRyan J.

            "summary": "RAFAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah overnight killed 18 people, including 14 children, health officials said Sunday, as the United States was on track to approve billions of dollars of additional military aid to its close ally.\nIsrael has carried out near-daily air raids on Rafah, where more than half of Gaza's population of 2.3 million has sought refuge from fighting elsewhere. It has also vowed to expand its ground offensive to the city on the border with Egypt despite international calls for restraint, including from the U.S.\nThe House of Representatives approved a $26 billion aid package on Saturday that includes around $9 billion in humanitarian assistance for Gaza.\nThe first strike killed a man, his wife and their 3-year-old child, according to the nearby Kuwaiti Hospital, which received the bodies. The woman was pregnant, and the doctors managed to save the baby, the hospital said.\nThe second strike killed 13 children and two women, all from the same family, according to hospital records. An airstrike in Rafah the night before killed nine people, including six children.\nThe Israel-Hamas war has killed over 34,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, devastated Gaza's two largest cities and left a swath of destruction across the territory. Around 80% of the population have fled their homes to other parts of the besieged coastal enclave, which experts say is on the brink of famine.\nThe conflict, now in its seventh month, has sparked regional unrest pitting Israel and the U.S. against Iran and allied militant groups across the Middle East. Israel and Iran traded fire directly earlier this month, raising fears of all-out war between the longtime foes.\nTensions have also spiked in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The Israeli military said troops 'neutralized' two Palestinians who attacked a checkpoint with a knife and a gun near the southern West Bank town of Hebron early Sunday. It was not immediately clear if they were killed. No Israeli forces were wounded.\nAt least 469 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers and settlers in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Most have been killed during Israeli military arrest raids, which often trigger gunbattles, or in violent protests.\nThe war in Gaza was sparked by an unprecedented Oct. 7 raid into southern Israel in which Hamas and other militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250 hostages. Israel says militants are still holding around 100 hostages and the remains of more than 30 others.\nThousands of Israelis have taken to the streets to call for new elections to replace Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a deal with Hamas to release the hostages. Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war until Hamas is destroyed and all the hostages are returned.\nThe war has killed at least 34,049 Palestinians and wounded another 76,901, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between combatants and civilians in its count but says at least two-thirds have been children and women. It also says the real toll is likely higher as many bodies are stuck beneath the rubble left by airstrikes or are in areas that are unreachable for medics.\nIsrael blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the militants fight in dense, residential neighborhoods, but the military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The military says it has killed over 13,000 Hamas fighters, without providing evidence.\nThe Associated Press",

One of their co-defendants, former California police chief Alan Hostetter, was sentenced to more than 11 years in federal prison in December. The trials featured testimony from co-defendant Russell Taylor, who pleaded guilty as part of a plea deal with the government.\nThe felony charge they were convicted of — obstruction of an official proceeding — is currently before the Supreme Court, where some of the justices seemed skeptical of the way the government had used the charge. A decision in that case is expected in the coming months. If the Supreme Court guts the charge, two of the defendants could end up only serving 12 months in prison on their misdemeanor convictions.\nThe men communicated over a \"The California Patriots — DC Brigade\" Telegram chat and brought weapons on their trip to Washington to participate in Jan. 6, according to evidence shown at trial. They kept a shotgun in their car, and Kinnison and Mele claimed they stored five handguns in their hotel room \"despite understanding that it was illegal,\" the government said. 'We're packing light just a scatter gun and a pistol a piece,\" Martinez joked, according to prosecutors.\nMele took photographs of the handguns, holsters, ammunition and magazines the group brought into their hotel room. U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Prosecutors had sought lengthy sentences for the foursome between 6.5 and eight years in federal prison, but Judge Royce Lamberth landed on much lower sentences within the guidelines range.\nWarner received 27 months after telling Lamberth that he \"got caught up\" in the mob and was sorry for his conduct. \"I shouldn't have been there,\" he said, apologizing to his family for putting them \"through hell.\"\nMartinez received 21 months in prison after he said he was \"very sorry\" and apologized for his conduct, telling Lamberth that he would \"never see me back here.\"\nKinnison was sentenced to 33 months in prison. He spoke about his love of God, family and country and said he admired the \"Judeo-Christian principles that the country was founded upon.\" He said that he did repent for his sins and ask forgiveness for his sins and that he was praying for Lamberth and the prosecutors on the case.\nMele was also sentenced to 33 months. Prosecutors said he \"awarded\" his co-conspirators a \"Capitol Action Badge\" a few weeks after Jan. 6, which prosecutors described as a \"crudely modified version of a real military reward.\" He said Jan. 6 \"gave this country a black eye\" that was still tender.

            "summary": "RAFAH, Gaza Strip — An Israeli airstrike on a house in Gaza's southernmost city killed at least nine people, six of them children, hospital authorities said Saturday, as Israel pursued its nearly seven-month offensive in the besieged Palestinian territory.\nIsrael's war against the Islamic militant group Hamas has led to a dramatic escalation of tensions in an already volatile Middle East.\nThe strike late Friday hit a residential building in the western Tel Sultan neighborhood of the city of Rafah, according to Gaza's civil defense. The bodies of the six children, two women and a man were taken to Rafah's Abu Yousef al-Najjar hospital, the hospital's records showed.\nAt the hospital, relatives cried and hugged the bodies of the children, wrapped in white shrouds, as others comforted them.\nThe fatalities included Abdel-Fattah Sobhi Radwan, his wife Najlaa Ahmed Aweidah and their three children, his brother-in-law Ahmed Barhoum said. Barhoum also lost his wife, Rawan Radwan, and their 5-year-old daughter Alaa.\n'This is a world devoid of all human values and morals,' Barhoum told The Associated Press Saturday morning, crying as he cradled and gently rocked the body of Alaa in his arms. 'They bombed a house full of displaced people, women and children. There were no martyrs but women and children.'\nNo victims were registered from a second overnight strike in the city.\nRafah, which lies on the border with Egypt, currently hosts more than half of Gaza's total population of about 2.3 million people, the vast majority of whom have been displaced by fighting further north in the territory.\nDespite calls for restraint from the international community, including Israel's staunchest ally, the United States, the Israeli government has insisted for months that it intends to push a ground offensive into the city, where it says many of the remaining Hamas militants are holed up.\nSuch a ground operation has not materialized so far, but the Israeli military has repeatedly carried out airstrikes on and around the city.\nThe war was sparked by an unprecedented raid into southern Israel by Hamas and other militant groups on Oct. 7 that left about 1,200 people dead, the vast majority of them civilians, and saw about 250 people kidnapped and taken into Gaza. Israel says about 130 hostages remain in Gaza, although more than 30 have been confirmed to now be dead, either killed on Oct. 7 or having died in captivity.\nThe Gaza Health Ministry said Saturday the bodies of 37 people killed by Israeli strikes were brought to hospitals in Gaza over the past 24 hours. Hospitals also received 68 wounded, it said. The latest figures bring the overall Palestinian death toll from the Israel-Hamas war to at least 34,049, and the number of wounded to 76,901, the ministry said. Although the Hamas-run health authorities do not differentiate between combatants and civilians in their count, they say at least two thirds have been children and women.\nThe war has sent regional tensions spiraling, leading to a dramatic eruption of violence between Israel and its archenemy Iran that threatened to escalate into a full-blown war.\nOn Friday, both Iran and Israel played down an apparent Israeli airstrike near a major air base and nuclear site in central Iran, indicating the two sides were pulling back from what could have become an all-out conflict. Over the past several weeks, an alleged Israeli strike killed two Iranian generals at an Iranian consulate in Syria and was followed by an unprecedented Iranian missile barrage on Israel.\nIsrael has also faced off with the Hezbollah militant group, an Iranian proxy operating from Lebanon, with the two sides there frequently trading rocket and drone attacks across the Lebanese-Israeli border. Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels have also joined the fray, launching strikes against merchant ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in what they say is a campaign of solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza.\nTension has also been high in the occupied West Bank, where an Israeli military raid Friday in the Nur Shams refugee camp killed at least four Palestinians, including three militants, according to the Israeli military, Palestinian health officials and a militant group.\nPalestinian health authorities said one of those killed was a 15-year-old boy shot dead by Israeli fire. The Islamic Jihad militant group confirmed the deaths of three members, including one who it said was a local military commander. The Israeli military said four Israeli soldiers were slightly wounded in the operation.\nSaraya al-Quds, the military arm of Islamic Jihad, said its fighters had engaged in heavy gun battles Saturday morning with Israeli forces in the town of Tulkarem, adjacent to Nur Shams. No further details were immediately available. Residents in Tulkarem went went on a general strike Saturday to protest the attack on Nur Shams, with shops, restaurants and government offices all closed.\nSince the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel, more than 460 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank, Palestinian health officials say. Israel stages frequent raids into towns and cities in the volatile territory. The dead have included militants, but also stone-throwers and bystanders. Some have also been killed in attacks by Israeli settlers.\nThe Associated Press",

            "summary": "TYBEE ISLAND, Ga. — Thousands of Black college students expected this weekend for an annual spring bash at Georgia's largest public beach will be greeted by dozens of extra police officers and barricades closing off neighborhood streets. While the beach will remain open, officials are blocking access to nearby parking.\nTybee Island east of Savannah has grappled with the April beach party known as Orange Crush since students at Savannah State University, a historically Black school, started it more than 30 years ago. Residents regularly groused about loud music, trash littering the sand and revelers urinating in yards.\nThose complaints boiled over into fear and outrage a year ago when record crowds estimated at more than 100,000 people overwhelmed the 3-mile island. That left a small police force scrambling to handle a flood of emergency calls reporting gunfire, drug overdoses, traffic jams and fist fights.\nMayor Brian West, elected last fall by Tybee Island's 3,100 residents, said roadblocks and added police aren't just for limiting crowds. He hopes the crackdown will drive Orange Crush away for good.\n'This has to stop. We can't have this crowd anymore,' West said. 'My goal is to end it.'\nCritics say local officials are overreacting and appear to be singling out Black visitors to a Southern beach that only white people could use until 1963. They note Tybee Island attracts vast crowds for the Fourth of July and other summer weekends when visitors are largely white, as are 92% of the island's residents.\n'Our weekends are packed with people all season, but when Orange Crush comes they shut down the parking, bring extra police and act like they have to take charge,' said Julia Pearce, one of the island's few Black residents and leader of a group called the Tybee MLK Human Rights Organization. She added: 'They believe Black folks to be criminals.'\nDuring the week, workers placed metal barricades to block off parking meters and residential streets along the main road parallel to the beach. Two large parking lots near a popular pier are being closed. And Tybee Island's roughly two dozen police officers will be augmented by about 100 sheriff's deputies, Georgia state troopers and other officers.\nSecurity plans were influenced by tactics used last month to reduce crowds and violence at spring break in Miami Beach, which was observed by Tybee Island's police chief.\nOfficials insist they're acting to avoid a repeat of last year's Orange Crush party, which they say became a public safety crisis with crowds at least double their typical size.\n'To me, it has nothing to do with race,' said West, who believes city officials previously haven't taken a stronger stand against Orange Crush because they feared being called racist. 'We can't let that be a reason to let our citizens be unsafe and so we're not.'\nTybee Island police reported 26 total arrests during Orange Crush last year. Charges included one armed robbery with a firearm, four counts of fighting in public and five DUIs. Two officers reported being pelted with bottles, and two women told police they were beaten and robbed of a purse.\nOn a gridlocked highway about a mile off the island, someone fired a gun a into a car and injured one person. A white man was charged in the shooting, which officials blamed on road rage.\nOrange Crush's supporters and detractors alike say it's not college students causing the worst problems.\nJoshua Miller, a 22-year-old Savannah State University senior who plans to attend this weekend, said he wouldn't be surprised if the crackdown was at least partly motivated by race.\n'I don't know what they have in store,' Miller said. 'I'm not going down there with any ill intent. I'm just going out there to have fun.'\nSavannah Mayor Van Johnson was one of the Black students from Savannah State who helped launch Orange Crush in 1988. The university dropped involvement in the 1990s, and Johnson said that over time the celebration 'got off the rails.' But he also told reporters he's concerned about 'over-representation of police' at the beach party.\nAt Nickie's 1971 Bar & Grill near the beach, general manager Sean Ensign said many neighboring shops and eateries will close for Orange Crush though his will stay open, selling to-go food orders like last year. But with nearby parking spaces closed, Ensign said his profits might take a hit, 'possibly a few thousand dollars.'\nIt's not the first time Tybee Island has targeted the Black beach party. In 2017, the city council banned alcohol and amplified music on the beach only during Orange Crush weekend. A discrimination complaint to the U.S. Justice Department resulted in city officials signing a non-binding agreement to impose uniform rules for large events.\nWest says Orange Crush is different because it's promoted on social media by people who haven't obtained permits. A new state law lets local governments recoup public safety expenses from organizers of unpermitted events.\nIn February, Britain Wigfall was denied an permit for space on the island for food trucks during Orange Crush. The mayor said Wigfall has continued to promote events on the island.\nWigfall, 30, said he's promoting a concert this weekend in Savannah, but nothing on Tybee Island involving Orange Crush.\n'I don't control it,' Wigfall said. 'Nobody controls the date that people go down there.'\nThe Associated Press",

            "summary": "LAS VEGAS — A conference for a far-right sheriffs group this week drew a parade of felons, disgraced politicians, election deniers, conspiracy theorists and, in the end, a few sheriffs.\nThe Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, or CSPOA, met in Las Vegas' Ahern Luxury Boutique Hotel conference center to publicly counter reports of extremism within the group and set a course for the coming election — one that involves sheriffs' investigating what they claim, despite a lack of evidence, is rampant voter fraud.\nThe group sees sheriffs as the highest authority in the U.S., more powerful than the federal government, and it wants these county officers to form posses to patrol polling places, seize voting machines and investigate the Democrats and foreign nations behind what they claim is a criminal effort to rig the vote by flooding the country with immigrants who vote illegally.\nCritics of the group — including voting rights advocates and extremism researchers — fear the CSPOA's new focus will amount to interference and legitimize disinformation about U.S. elections.\nBut the event Wednesday, which starred MAGA celebrities speaking to a half-empty audience made up of few actual sheriffs, pointed to just how fringe the group's ideas are — and how what once seemed like a movement on its way into the mainstream has lost political pull.\nThe conference opened a little behind schedule; the Pledge of Allegiance was delayed when organizers couldn't find a flag. After he searched the conference center's rooms, Tom Hamner, a Colorado man who served over two years in prison for the felony 'interfering with law enforcement' on Jan. 6, 2021, came forward with the scarf from his wife's neck. It wasn't exactly a flag, but it was emblazoned with stars and stripes.\n'That'll work!' emcee Alex Newman, an Epoch Times contributor, said before he led the crowd of dozens in the pledge. A smooth jazz rendition of 'The Star-Spangled Banner' followed, sung by a Las Vegas man awaiting trial on multiple felony charges who is accused of fraudulently posing as a certified firearms instructor.\nI sat with a small group of reporters at a table marked 'reserved,' a section Newman and other presenters pointed to throughout the day when they invoked, in Donald Trump's style, the 'fake media.'\nWe, along with candidates and elected officials, were admitted gratis. Others paid $49 for the day, which included breakfast, a box lunch and a 'pizza party.' Sponsors staffed booths advertising unofficial Trump merchandise, supplements, prepper gear and various patriot-themed swag.\nCSPOA's finances aren't public. It charges for events like this conference, offers a $99 yearly subscription for access to weekly webinars and solicits donations. It has also provided training sessions in nearly a dozen states, where police and sheriffs earn continuing education credits toward professional requirements. Last year, the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement ended the practice in the state.\nTo the extent that the 13-hour day was structured, it was broken roughly in two: the first half dedicated to the issue of encroaching federal power and the second to election denial and conspiracy theories.\nThe morning's sessions were the group's bread and butter. Former Arizona sheriff Richard Mack founded the CSPOA in 2011 to advocate for the belief that sheriffs — who generally operate independently with little to no oversight and are accountable only to voters — are the ultimate arbiters and enforcers of the Constitution and must act as a check on tyrannical federal power.\nIts early focus was on gun laws and other tea party pet causes, including immigration, the Affordable Care Act and attention-grabbing standoffs between ranchers and the Bureau of Land Management. 'The greatest threat we face today is not terrorists,' Mack's website read in 2012. 'It is our own federal government.'\nAfter two terms as sheriff in an Arizona border county, Mack lost re-election. He sought elected office multiple times but failed in bids for sheriff of a different county, governor and seats in the U.S. House and Senate.\nThere are no public rolls today, but Mack claims 10% of the country's 3,000 sheriffs are members, along with 10,000 ordinary citizens.\nWednesday's event drew a little over 100 people by midmorning. Attendees took notes, nodded along and offered somber 'Amens' and boisterous 'Nos!' when called for.\nJared Bosley, a farmer in South Dakota, told of his fight with the state over a pipeline company surveying his land without his permission. Two convicted Jan. 6 rioters said they were 'political prisoners.' Former Rep. Steve King of Iowa, his legacy a history of racist remarks, railed against the World Health Organization, the World Economic Forum and 'ringleader' George Soros. Another disgraced former congressman, Steve Stockman of Texas, sobbed as he shared his story of serving time in a federal prison for fraud and sobbed again when he got to the part where Trump commuted his 10-year sentence.\nThe supportive crowd felt like 'a warm bath,' Stockman said, his arms stretched toward heaven.\nRichard Fleming, a cardiologist who in 2009 pleaded guilty to felony charges of health care and mail fraud, gave a lengthy presentation alleging the Covid vaccines were bioweapons. Radio show host Wayne Allyn Root thundered into the microphone promoting the 'great replacement,' a racist conspiracy theory. 'They want to replace American citizens who love this country,' Root bellowed.\nIt was nearly lunchtime when the first active sheriff spoke. Bob Songer, a CSPOA board member and the sheriff of Klickitat County, Washington, said he enforces only laws he determines to be constitutional and talked about his 'posse,' a group of 150 armed community volunteers he relies on for tasks like hunting cougars and courtroom security and keeps at the ready, as a potential militia. He offered a copy of his posse plan to sheriffs in the audience.\nDuring the break, as CSPOA volunteer Kenneth Hall sang an original song, 'I Back the Sheriff,' to the music of the Bob Marley tune, I asked Mack why there weren't more sheriffs at his conference. Mack said that didn't matter.\n'There's several candidates,' Mack said, noting the political signs littering the room. He said he hoped to draw a 'new generation' of sheriffs, but, pointing to 78-year-old Songer, he added, 'there's one, and he's one of the best sheriffs in America!'\nIndeed, there are politicians — or would-bes — who see the constitutional sheriffs group as an important bloc of support. Twenty or so candidates for local office in the crowd from Nevada, Utah, Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Georgia and Idaho spent the morning shaking hands and passing out cards.\nIt's a model that has proven effective. Trump depended on support from sheriffs in the White House and continues to rely on them at campaign events, as he did in 2016 and 2020. At a presentation in Grand Rapids, Michigan, this month, a half-dozen uniformed sheriffs stood in the background decked out in gold stripes and braided ropes as Trump railed against immigration and stood before a sign that read 'Stop Biden's Border Bloodbath.'\nAfter lunch, former sheriff Glenn Hamilton, who lost his 2022 re-election bid in Sierra County, New Mexico, regaled the audience with the time he deputized an entire church congregation to permit a gathering in violation of the governor's Covid rules. Hamilton referred to 'this old tool that's in our box called Posse Comitatus. Who's ever heard of this?' he asked.\nThe Posse Comitatus movement in the 1970s and '80s held up the county sheriff as the only true law enforcement officer and urged vigilantism through local posse groups. Latin for 'power of the county,' Posse Comitatus was preached and popularized by white supremacist William Potter Gale, but it dissolved in the wake of a spate of violence and highly publicized prosecutions.\nThe CSPOA has recently sought to distance itself from that history, the kind of messaging that may have resonated with not only tea partiers but also anti-government groups and militias and caused national hate tracking groups and Mack's Republican political opponents to label him a far-right extremist.\nMack and CSPOA leaders have consistently decried the label, but their ties with extremist organizations are well-documented. Mack was a keynote speaker at the first national conference for the far-right Oath Keepers in 2009 and sat on the militia group's board until at least 2015. The CSPOA's current CEO since 2022, Sam Bushman, operates Liberty News Radio, which has syndicated programs hosted by white supremacists. Bushman has hosted Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes on his show, 'Liberty RoundTable,' over a dozen times, including after the attack on the Capitol, for which Rhodes is serving an 18-year sentence for seditious conspiracy.\nA frustrated and defiant Bushman said it was that kind of negative publicity that had most likely caused the conference's biggest speaker, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, to bail. Without notice, Bannon hadn't shown up, he said. Bannon didn't respond to a request for comment.\nWith Bannon out, the biggest star was Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser and retired three-star general who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI but was pardoned by Trump. After he promoted a new film about himself that would be released the next day, Flynn took photos with attendees near the stage. Seeing an NBC News photographer, Flynn demanded to know whom he worked for, and when he identified himself, Flynn became incensed and yelled, 'You're a liar!' The organizers then moved Flynn to a room walled off by curtains and two guards.\nThe CSPOA has always been considered a fringe movement, but the pandemic offered a boost. Constitutional sheriffs were suddenly a viable solution to what a growing slice of the GOP saw as tyrannical lockdown orders, mask requirements and vaccination mandates. Similar constitutional sheriffs organizations began to pop up, including Pinal County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Lamb's Protect America Now and a pro-Trump think tank, the Claremont Institute's Sheriffs Fellowship.\nThe 2020 election offered another opportunity. Pushing unfounded claims of a stolen election, the CSPOA collaborated with True the Vote, the Texas-based election conspiracy theorist group behind '2000 Mules,' a widely panned and debunked film that claimed to reveal widespread ballot drop-box fraud.\nMack called the film a 'smoking gun,' and at its 2022 conference, the CSPOA called upon its members to launch investigations. But results have been lackluster.\nThe most notable investigation came from Barry County, Michigan, Sheriff Dar Leaf, who partnered with a pro-Trump lawyer bent on overturning Michigan's election results. Leaf's investigation, which has involved seizing election equipment and grilling local clerks, has seemingly only impeded a criminal case against three Trump supporters indicted last year on state charges related to their alleged tampering with voting machines. Leaf hasn't been charged with a crime.\nOnstage, Leaf, bespectacled and boyish, was giddy. The investigation had faced setbacks, he acknowledged, but he believed there would soon be justice.\n'I'm getting goose-bumpy here,' Leaf said. Later, he told me he didn't pay any attention to the criticism from state election and law enforcement officials or from the media: 'I just keep my head down.'\nAs the day wore on at the conference, the rails began to wear.\nTina Peters, a former Mesa County, Colorado, clerk facing multiple criminal charges related to a suspected security breach of her county's election system in 2021, and fresh off a home confinement for obstructing government administration in a separate case, took the stage wearing a large white lei. She is fighting the latest charges, with a trial scheduled for this summer. She had recently been to Hawaii, she said, and she offered a slideshow of photographic evidence that she suggested proved the recent deadly wildfires were the result of an intentional laser attack.\nAs Mike Lindell, MyPillow's founder and a sponsor of the CSPOA event, spoke — election denial and his prowess with the media and in business were his main topics — a blond woman in a robin's egg suit jacket walked up behind me and handed me a note: 'I would like to give you some first hand info that will be helpful to you reaching a conclusion on election fraud in NV.' The note passer, Susan Proffitt, later told me that the room was full of operatives, 'and they are doing their best to destroy us.'\nPizza was put out on long tables under heat lamps. The audience, halved from the morning, milled about. A couple of women took off their high heels. Several small groups were forming around the bar. There was still an awards ceremony, and Mack and Bushman had planned a news conference, though by the time it started the members of the media had gone.\nAs I left, I checked in with a man who had been sitting in the back, watching attentively. Jeffrey Kadlowec, a local architect, hadn't heard of CSPOA before and wasn't sure what to expect. 'I thought it would be more about law enforcement,' he said excitedly. 'I didn't expect it to be so, so radical.'\nBrandy Zadrozny",

            "summary": "Memorial Day weekend 1998. It was a fun time for the Rutledge family -- full of laughter, memories, and catching up.\nDavid Rutledge remembers that time well. 'Great time, good fellowship, just good camaraderie,' he told Dateline. 'We had a little family gathering.'\nDavid's son, 23-year-old Tennessee State University student Marcus Rutledge, had flown to his hometown of Ypsilanti, Michigan for the holiday weekend. 'He had a break for the holiday,' David recalled. 'That was the last time we were together as a family.'\nWith classes starting up again on Tuesday, Marcus hopped on a flight back to Nashville, Tennessee.\nIt was the last time Marcus would make that trip from Michigan to Nashville. It was the last time he would visit his childhood home and hug his parents goodbye.\nBecause just a few weeks later, on June 8, 1998, Marcus disappeared…\nMarcus Rutledge Marcus was born and raised in Ypsilanti. 'I think you would describe it as a blue-collar town,' David said of Ypsilanti. 'A really thriving community.'\nGrowing up, Marcus took part in his fair share of activities. 'Marcus was in the band, so he loved playing instruments,' his older sister, Felicia Rutledge, told Dateline. 'He played football, he played soccer, he really enjoyed reading.'\nHe had his fair share of friends, too. 'He had his own neighborhood kids that he would hang out with,' David Rutledge said.\nOne of those kids was Edie Beach. Edie told Dateline that he went to middle and high school with Marcus. The two also played football together. 'He was a very, very funny person, but he was serious about everything and anything in school,' he said. 'Once he got to know you, and he trusted you, he would give you the shirt off his back. That was the type of person he was.'\nMarcus's father remembers his son's loving personality all too well. 'To know him was to like him,' David said. 'He was a good kid. He was helpful. He always had a smile on his face.'\nEdie Beach told Dateline that he and Marcus grew apart after graduating high school. Edie pursued his own endeavors and Marcus went off to Tennessee State University — the school he always knew he would attend.\n'It's my Alma Mater and his mother's and Felicia's,' David said.\nDavid told Dateline that he and his wife, Geraldine, met while attending Tennessee. After graduating, they decided to settle down in Geraldine's hometown of Ypsilanti.\nFelicia Rutledge recalled always wanting to follow in her parents' footsteps. 'We had always gone back and forth to Nashville to visit my dad and my mom's friends,' she said. 'So we would go there often before we went to school there.'\nBy 1998, Marcus was a senior at Tennessee State. He also had a 4-year-old son. 'His name is Darius. His mother was a student there at Tennessee State, as well,' David said.\nMarcus lived in Nashville and Darius lived in Knoxville with his mother. 'Marcus used to travel from Nashville to Knoxville every chance he'd get to visit Darius,' David said.\nAt the time of his disappearance, Marcus was no longer in a relationship with Darius's mother. David told Dateline his son had a girlfriend. 'When we would travel to Nashville, we'd often have dinner with the two of them,' David said, adding that Marcus also had a 2-year-old daughter with his girlfriend.\nOn the morning of June 8, 1998, Marcus was with his girlfriend. Metro Nashville Police Department Detective Matthew Filter told Dateline 'he had spent the night of June 7th with her and then he left the morning of June 8th,' and took his daughter to daycare.\n'The girlfriend last spoke to him at about 1:30 p.m. on June 8th by phone, but she didn't know exactly where he physically was at the time,' the detective said.\nDavid Rutledge told Dateline that on the evening of June 8, he and his wife got a concerning phone call from Marcus's girlfriend, who told them she couldn't get in touch with Marcus. 'We said, ‘Hey. No, we haven't heard from him,'' David recalled. He said he then tried calling Marcus himself and also got no response. They reached back out to his girlfriend asking if she'd heard from Marcus yet. 'She said, ‘No, I still haven't, and I'm getting worried, I want to go over to his apartment,'' David remembered.\nMarcus lived alone at a duplex in Nashville.\nAccording to David, Marcus's girlfriend called his former roommate and friend, Athan Gibbs, to help her get into his home. 'So, they essentially opened a window and climbed through to get into his house,' David said. 'It was after they got into the house that they said, ‘Nothing's here and the dog is in the bathroom with the door closed.''\nDavid's heart dropped. 'We said, ‘Call the police right away,'' he recalled. 'That's, to the best of my memory, how this whole thing unfolded. We call it a nightmare.'\nThe Metro Nashville Police Department started the search for Marcus. 'It seemed like a lot of emphasis was placed on searching the house since it was the last place he was believed to be,' Det. Filter told Dateline. 'And acquiring to his phone record to see who he was last in contact with. His car was also missing.'\nMarcus's car, a red four-door 1995 Plymouth Neon with Michigan plates, was also missing. 'So, there were a lot of search efforts to find the car,' the detective said.\nDavid Rutledge recalls the community support to find his son and the car. 'The police involved the newspaper and the TV networks, and they were constantly broadcasting the license plate to Marcus's car,' he said. 'I have to give kudos to the press and the media there for keeping this incident in front of the community for what I thought, was an unusually long time.'\nTheir efforts paid off. On July 1, 1998, a month after Marcus vanished, his car was found at the Riverwood Apartments on Cabot Drive in Nashville. 'That was actually on the opposite side of town from where Marcus lived at the time,' Det. Matthew Filter noted.\n'There was nothing found inside that car that helped investigators get any closer as to what happened to him,' Det. Filter said. 'There were some latent fingerprints developed but, to date, there have been no matches to those prints.'\nDetective Filter told Dateline that be believes foul play is involved in Marcus's disappearance. 'Based on the character portrayed by his family and friends, he would not have abruptly broken off contact with everyone,' he said. 'He would not have abandoned his property, including his dog, and I believe if he needed to lie low for some reason, he would've likely told his sister or his best friend at the time.'\nMarcus's family doesn't believe he would just have up and disappeared, either. 'We'd ask each other — we'd say, ‘You think Marcus got mixed up in something he didn't know how to get out of?'' David told Dateline. 'It haunts us, because we just don't understand how a person could just, like — the earth swallows them up and there's no trace.'\nLess than a year after Marcus disappeared, his friend and former roommate Athan Gibbs was murdered. According to a 1999 article published in The Tennessean, Athan was gunned down on February 23, 1999, at his duplex in Nashville. At the time, a man who was described as Athan's friend, was charged with the murder. 'They made an arrest but the charges got dropped for some reason,' Det. Filter told Dateline. 'So I don't know if the case was reopened for further investigation or what -- what the deal was with it.'\nFor Marcus's family, Athan's murder raised even more questions. 'I mean, I think there's some connection, but the police don't think so,' David said. Detective Filter told Dateline that a connection between the cases was investigated. 'Earlier investigators did look for a connection between the two, but they did not find one and did not believe the two cases were related,' he said.\nBut that doesn't mean the detective has given up looking for answers. 'I like to hold out hope that all of these cold cases could be solved one day,' he said. 'It's just a matter of getting that right information and us getting pointed in the right direction.'\nMarcus's family is still holding on to hope, too. In 2015, Geraldine Rutledge died before she could see a resolution in her son's case. 'She said to me, ‘Only thing I want you to do is take care of the kids,'' David recalled. He intends to live up to that promise. 'His mother passed away not losing hope and I haven't lost hope,' he said.\nAs for Felicia, she's remaining positive that, one day, she'll find out what happened to her baby brother. 'I hope so,' she said.\nMarcus is 6' with brown eyes. At the time of his disappearance, he had black hair and weighed 190 lbs.\nHe would be 49 years old today.\nAnyone with information about Marcus's case is asked to call the Metro Nashville Police Department Cold Case Unit at 615-862-7329.",

            "summary": "PITTSBURGH — In the heart of one of America's most prominent historically Jewish neighborhoods, Dan and Baila Cohen keep the front entrance of their 70-year-old Judaica store locked during business hours.\nIt's not how they'd prefer it. But in light of Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack in Israel, Israel's ongoing military campaign in Gaza and tensions at home, they said, the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh told them they needed to be vigilant about who enters their business.\n'That's the reality of the world,' Dan Cohen said.\nIt's not the first time they've had to take additional safety precautions. The couple completed their purchase of Pinsker's Books and Judaica in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood in 2018 just days after a white supremacist gunned down 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue a few blocks away in the deadliest antisemitic attack in American history. But this time feels different.\n'Oct. 27 really unified' Squirrel Hill and Pittsburgh, Baila Cohen said of the Tree of Life massacre. 'Oct. 7 … really started polarizing the community itself, because that's when we started seeing much more of the infighting and conflicts.'\nConversations with more than 30 political strategists, activists and voters outlined how that tension has put Jewish voters in an unfamiliar spot ahead of the 2024 elections: on the front lines of the fight for control of the White House and Congress. Nowhere is that more apparent than in Pennsylvania, the swing state with the largest Jewish population — about 300,000 voting-age Jews in a state President Joe Biden won by roughly 80,000 votes in 2020.\nWhat's more, the congressional district that includes Squirrel Hill features a primary Tuesday that is among the first electoral tests of sentiment on both sides of the conflict in Gaza and concerns over rising antisemitism in the U.S. Democratic Rep. Summer Lee, a 'squad'-aligned progressive critical of Israel's handling of the war and one of the first lawmakers to call for a cease-fire last year, will face Bhavini Patel, an Edgewood Borough Council member who has painted Lee's advocacy as harmful to Biden's re-election chances and out of step with her district.\n'We have communities that are hurting. The Jewish community is one of them. And there are people who are … not going to agree 100% on everything that you say,' Lee said in an interview, adding she has been 'very clear and very upfront' about her cease-fire position. 'I have condemned Hamas. We've worked with the families of hostages; we've done everything that I think is necessary to do that. And at the end of the day, we disagree.'\nA dozen Jewish voters in the district who spoke to NBC News, whether supporting Lee or Patel, almost universally said their votes in November would be driven by issues beyond Israel, saying that the Jewish electorate isn't a 'monolith' and that democracy, abortion rights and the economy weighed heavily on them.\nMost Jewish voters in Squirrel Hill — and nationally — align with the Democratic Party. A Pew Research Center survey released this month found 69% of Jews leaning Democratic, while 29% aligned Republican.\nBut Republicans aren't looking for a massive defection. GOP strategists and Republicans involved in Jewish outreach expressed confidence that Democratic divisions over Israel will help move a small but potentially significant number of Jewish voters into their camp in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona. They pointed to surveys showing President Donald Trump's improved performance among Jews in 2020, compared with his 2016 race, as evidence of a slow shift that could continue.\n'Before Oct. 7, most candidates would say this issue is so messy. … It's not necessarily something that I want to focus on in my campaign,' said Tali deGroot, political director for the liberal Jewish group J Street. 'And I would have said, ‘Absolutely, this isn't a voting issue for people we poll year after year.' And it's too soon to tell if it's going to be a voting issue. But not talking about it is not an option.'‘Playing with fire' In Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, the war and its impact at home took center stage last week at a campaign event where Lee launched her 'Jews for Summer' coalition.\nLee talked about 'how our liberation is tied together,' whether 'in western Pennsylvania or the West Bank.' She spoke about how the district still needs 'deep healing' following both the Oct. 7 attack and the killing of Jews at Tree of Life. And she framed her primary as a covert Republican effort to divide a multiethnic, cross-religious support base by using splits over Israel.\n'There are people who have to convince you that the only reason why I could believe in peace is because I actually hate some of our neighbors, not because we love each other,' said Lee, who overcame significant spending by groups aligned with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group, when she narrowly won her first congressional primary in 2022.\nIsrael didn't have the salience it does now. Lee has accused the Israeli government of committing 'war crimes,\" called for an end to unconditional military aid to the country and joined a handful of other progressives in mid-2022, before the Israel-Hamas war, who voted against a GOP-led resolution that said Israel wasn't 'a racist or apartheid state.' She has also condemned Hamas' attack and repeatedly spoken out against antisemitism.\nOn Saturday, she joined 36 Democrats and 21 Republicans in voting against an aid package to the country, which passed overwhelmingly. She and Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., were the only Pennsylvania members to vote against it.\nHer early call for a cease-fire is now largely in step with Democratic voters, but Jewish leaders have expressed unease with how Lee and some of her allies have discussed the issue. Last month, more than 40 Pittsburgh-area rabbis wrote in a letter, after an earlier meeting with Lee, that she has 'continued to use divisive rhetoric' that the group has at times 'perceived as openly antisemitic.'\nTheir letter didn't describe that rhetoric, but it said Lee opposed House measures to condemn antisemitism and criticized her calls for an 'unconditional cease-fire from one side,' which they said 'devalues the lives and beliefs of one group.' They also called on her to return campaign contributions 'from people who have voiced virulently antisemitic sentiments.' In February, Lee canceled an appearance before the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations amid backlash over other speakers' antisemitic and homophobic remarks, which she condemned.\nKaren Hochenberg, president of a local Democratic club that has endorsed Patel, said Lee has lost considerable support in the Jewish community, including hers. While Hochenberg aligns with Lee on many issues, she and others have been 'hurt' by some of her votes and actions, and she said she wished Lee had been more vocal about the Hamas attack.\n'Many Jews now are starting to question where are we on the road map of intersectionality,' Hochenberg said. 'Jews are starting to really take a look at how comfortable we are and if we're going to send candidates to Congress who's going to be there and have the voice of the Jewish community in mind, as well.'\nJeremy Kazzaz, a Pittsburgher leading a new Jewish voter group, said the pushback Lee faces isn't so much about Israel but about what he called an unwillingness to meet with constituents who don't share her views.\n'She finds the individuals who agree with her already who are anti-Zionist, who are extremist or fringe of the left of politics, and she will hold them up on a pedestal while spreading things' that, Kazzaz said, make local Jews 'less safe.'\nBut overall, Lee is looking stronger in her district now than in her first run, even to some opponents. AIPAC-linked groups aren't getting involved in her primary this time. Lee has framed her campaign around efforts to counter MAGA Republicans and bring federal dollars to the district.\nJonathan Mayo, a Squirrel Hill resident co-leading the Jews for Summer coalition, told NBC News he aligns with Lee's position on Israel but emphasized that he's not a single-issue voter.\n'It is so important to speak out and show that there are members of the Squirrel Hill Jewish community who still very much support Summer Lee,' he said.\nPatel, meanwhile, is framing her challenge to Lee around who offers Biden the most support, hitting Lee for not criticizing activists and groups calling for 'uncommitted' votes against the president in Tuesday's primary.\n'It's essentially playing with fire,' Patel said in an interview, arguing it could boost Trump.\nLee allies have countered that anti-Biden GOP megadonors support Patel's campaign. An outside group boosting Patel recently disclosed that it received an $800,000 donation from right-wing billionaire Jeffrey Yass. (Patel said she 'denounces' Yass, calling any focus on him a distraction.)\nLee has said she is supporting Biden in the fall. She's endorsed by congressional Democratic leadership and by Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who has become arguably the most staunchly pro-Israel Democrat in Congress. And in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, Biden shouted out Lee as someone 'who had my back.'\n'We're going to make sure that the person who's sitting in the White House is not going to be replaced,' Lee said at her event on a recent Sunday.\nSeveral attendees said they were casting anti-Biden protest votes Tuesday. But most said they would support him this fall.\nOne of them, Harry Hochheiser, said Biden 'is the only legitimate choice' against Trump. He said the divisions opened up in the Jewish community over the war have been devastating.\n'I don't think any of us enjoy these divisions,' Hochheiser, a University of Pittsburgh professor and pro-Palestinian activist voting uncommitted in the primary but backing Biden against Trump, said of tensions in the Jewish community over Israel.\n‘More salient than it has been' The fight for Jewish votes in Pittsburgh is only part of a bigger landscape. Across Pennsylvania, Republican Dave McCormick has put Israel at the forefront of his campaign against Democratic Sen. Bob Casey. Nationally, groups in both parties are preparing for what they say could be the largest investment ever made to court the Jewish vote at the presidential level.\nBiden's handling of the war is the main flashpoint. Initially, he was more deferential to Israel. But as the death toll mounted in Gaza and left-wing blowback intensified at home, he has sharpened his criticism of Israeli leadership, pushed for increased humanitarian aid and ramped-up efforts to reach a cease-fire agreement. Still, he hasn't gone as far as his critics to his left would like.\nAs for whether Republicans can pick up voters disaffected by the Democratic divide over Israel, Mark Mellman, president of Democratic Majority for Israel, said it's 'mostly noise' but cautioned 'there is a serious chance' depending how the coming months play out.\nJewish voters have 'been extraordinarily appreciative of the support that President Biden and Democratic leaders have given Israel over the course of this conflict,' he said. 'I hear from some people that is beginning to change as people perceive some change in the positions of those Democratic leaders. But look … Biden has been extraordinary.'\nA 2021 Pew Research Center survey found a wide split in partisanship among Jewish voters depending on which movement they aligned with. Orthodox Jews favored Republicans over Democrats by 75% to 20%, while 70% of Conservative Jews and 80% of Reform Jews backed Democrats.\nSam Markstein, national political director at the Republican Jewish Coalition, said much of the Jewish vote is based in states where Republicans have no shot at all, contributing to the gulf in support between Republicans and Democrats. Pointing to an Associated Press VoteCast survey after the 2020 election that found Trump improved on his 2016 performance among Jewish voters, Markstein predicts the Republican Jewish Coalition will make its 'largest investment at the top of the ticket ever' this cycle to target Jewish voters in battlegrounds.\n'That's where you're going to see the most success this year,' he said.\nSome other surveys had more positive trends for Democrats. This month's Pew survey found the share of Jewish voters who align with Democrats has increased 8 points since 2020.\nDan Siegel, who led Jewish outreach for Biden's 2020 campaign, said Jewish voters' foremost concerns are similar to those of any other voting group: the economy, health care and education.\n'I do think [Israel] may be a little bit more top of mind. But I also think at the end of the day, elections are a binary choice,' Siegel said, predicting Jewish voters 'are going to want that strong, steady hand, not an authoritarian demagogue who is unwieldy at best in a crisis.'\nTrump, who strongly favored Israel as president, has offered limited commentary on the war. Speaking last month with Israel Hayom, an Israeli newspaper, Trump said, 'You have to finish up your war. You have to get it done. We have to get to peace. We can't have this going on.'\nBiden's campaign has zoomed in on recent comments Trump has made about Jewish voters; he said on Real America's Voice that 'any Jewish person who votes for Biden does not love Israel and, frankly, should be spoken to.'\nIn a statement, Karoline Leavitt, Trump's national press secretary, slammed Democrats for caving in 'to the demands of far-left Palestinian extremists.\"\nAsked about Trump's comments on the war, Markstein said he believed Trump 'was just giving voice to the frustration of … people [who] want this to be concluded, with Israel defeating Hamas and rescuing the hostages.' On Trump's remarks about Jewish voters, Markstein said Trump 'was just trying to say in a Trumpian way … why haven't they been more vocal in their opposition to what their own leaders of their party are doing?'\nBack in Pittsburgh, Kipp Dawson, a Jewish civil rights activist backing Lee, said she would be horrified by Trump's re-election and expressed hope that Lee would be able to bring skeptical Democrats back on board with Biden this fall.\n'My sense is that things are extraordinarily in flux in this country right now,' she said. 'The big issue for November is who's going to come out to vote.'\nAt Pinsker's, the Cohens declined to say whom they'd support in next week's primary or the general election, though they said a number of Jews in Squirrel Hill were eager to back Patel.\n'The Jewish community really feels that if they don't take the stand now, [U.S. support for Israel] is not going to be assured,' Baila Cohen said. 'Everyone's very interested in getting actively involved and being part of the political scene in a way that doesn't always play out.'\nAllan Smith Emma Barnett",

After the first 96 prospective jurors were brought into a New York courtroom, Judge Juan Merchan asked if any of those assembled could not be 'fair and impartial.' More than half raised their hands and were excused from serving on the jury.\nThe jury selection process got off to a slow start because lawyers from both sides spent much of the day arguing over some of the more sensational evidence in the case. Prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office want to use material — including the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, headlines from the National Enquirer from the 2016 GOP presidential primary and the timing of Trump's alleged affair with another woman — to show why Trump was eager to bury negative stories about him during the 2016 presidential election.\nMerchan said prosecutors could use a transcript of the 'Access Hollywood' tape but not the tape itself. He also greenlit the request to show jurors Enquirer headlines and said he would allow testimony about the alleged affair.\nTrump, who spent much of the day seated at the defense table flanked by his attorneys, called the case 'an assault' on the nation and repeatedly attacked the prosecution for waging 'election interference.' Merchan said Trump must be in the courtroom for every day of the trial and warned that the former president risks jail time if he disrupts the proceedings.

Inside the courtroom, 'the solemn nature of the work ahead was evident.' Israel and Iran's longstanding conflict comes into full view Israel's war Cabinet convened yesterday to weigh its options for responding to Iran's unprecedented drone and missile attack. World leaders have urged restraint — and Israel could heed that call, four U.S. officials said.\nAccording to the officials, Israel's response will be limited in scope and will likely involve strikes against Iranian military forces and Iranian-backed proxies outside Iran. However, the U.S. assessment is based on conversations between American and Israeli officials that happened before Iran fired more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel on Saturday night, and the U.S. officials stressed that they have not been briefed on Israel's final decision . They also don't know when a response will happen; it could be any time, the officials said.\nhave not been briefed on Israel's final decision. They also don't know when a response will happen; it could be any time, the officials said. Whatever Israel decides, the stakes after Iran's attack could not be higher. In the eyes of some foreign policy hawks, the attacks could be perceived as a grave provocation that demands a furious rejoinder. Other analysts have warned that if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decides to hit back hard, it could plunge the wider Middle East into war.\nWhile Israel and Iran have been enemies since the late 1970s, the bitter conflict has long been confined to secret assassinations, audacious cyberattacks, nuclear sabotage and war-by-proxy. Neither side had openly and directly attacked the other before Saturday. Now, that subtly covert struggle is in full view .\nthat subtly covert struggle is in full view.

NBC News found that at least 150 paid 'Premium' subscriber X accounts and thousands of unpaid accounts have posted or amplified pro-Nazi content on X in recent months, often in apparent violation of X's rules. The paid accounts posting the content all consistently posted antisemitic or pro-Nazi material. Examples included praise of Nazi soldiers, sharing of Nazi symbols and denials of the Holocaust.\nThe findings are the latest evidence of a flourishing Nazi network on X under Musk's ownership, where Nazi sympathizers are brought in from dark corners of the internet to a massive platform where they can pay to amplify their content. And by failing to act against these accounts, X continues to earn income from pro-Nazi activity. Read the full story here.\nRead the full story here.

Ohio man, 81, fatally shoots Uber driver, 61, after scammers target both of them, officials say Clark County Sheriff's Office An 81-year-old Ohio man has been charged in the fatal shooting of an Uber driver he believed was working with a scammer, according to officials who said the victim was sent to the home by the same scammer.
