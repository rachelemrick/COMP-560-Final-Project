            "summary": "Editor's Note: Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and a member of the USA Today board of contributors. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

CNN —\nCNN — As Justice Sonia Sotomayor approaches the 15th anniversary of her historic appointment to the Supreme Court, some liberal pundits and lawmakers want her to consider stepping down. They think that Sotomayor's health, and the possibility that Democrats might lose the presidency and the Senate in November, put the future of the court's liberal wing at risk.\nThe worry is that the high court's 6-3 conservative majority could potentially become an emboldened 7-2 majority if former President Donald Trump were elected and filled a vacancy. These critics fear the scenario that played out with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. After resisting calls to retire, Ginsburg died in 2020, which allowed then-President Trump to appoint Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\nThe push for Sotomayor to retire is misguided and deeply flawed. It ignores political reality and reflects ignorance of the lives of people with disabilities. The arrogance of those who want the country's first Latina justice to abdicate her position is exceeded only by their wishful thinking that she will listen to them.\nWhile praising Sotomayor as 'the greatest liberal to sit on the Supreme Court in my adult lifetime,' The Guardian's Mehdi Hasan wonders, 'Why not retire now?' The answer is because the Constitution, which Sotomayor took an oath to uphold, says that justices 'shall hold their offices during good behavior.' Sotomayor's position is a lifetime appointment, not one to be cut short due to political vagaries.\nColumnist Josh Barro writes that Sotomayor's 'age problem can be dealt with very simply by her retiring.' But by modern Supreme Court standards, Sotomayor is relatively young. Consider that Ginsburg served on the court for 27 years and was a four-time cancer survivor before she passed away at 87. Justice John Paul Stevens was 90 when he retired in 2010. Justice Stephen Breyer stepped down in 2022, paving the way for the appointment of Ketanji Brown Jackson, but he was 83 when he did so.\nIn contrast, Sotomayor is only 69. She has yet to reach the average life expectancy for an American (76), for an American woman (79), or for a Hispanic woman (81). Sotomayor's mother lived to be 94.\nEven if Sotomayor stepped down tomorrow, there is no guarantee that President Joe Biden could successfully name her replacement. With Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) in the Senate, it's an open question as to whether Democrats have the votes to confirm a new justice, given that both are centrists with a history of bedeviling establishment leaders with their own agendas. Plus, it's doubtful that Biden would name a successor to Sotomayor who would be as strong a champion of marginalized people.\nBesides, people with type 1 diabetes can live long and healthy lives, so long as they have reliable access to health care and medication. Sotomayor's condition, shared by singer Nick Jonas, Olympians and NFL players, is no reason for her to give up one of the influential posts in the nation.\nThe fact that a few liberal pundits are so comfortable speculating about Sotomayor's medical issues is an insult to the 42 million Americans living with disabilities. Her health is her own business. And aren't progressives usually the ones criticizing conservatives for making decisions about women's bodies?\nUrging Sotomayor's retirement, Hasan and Barro mention her type 1 diabetes, pointing to a report that she travels with a medic. Yet it has not been established that Sotomayor travels with a medic. The HuffPost article cited as a source for this claim states that the Marshals Service incurred costs for traveling with 'baggage (medic),' while noting that this 'could refer to medical personnel or be a more benign reference to medical equipment in the justice's luggage.'\nSome of these same liberal writers declare that it will be better for 'ordinary Latina women' if Sotomayor retires, and that 'Latinas especially, will suffer most' with a more conservative court. No evidence is offered for these sweeping statements. In fact, the Latino community is home to both conservatives and liberals, and Latinas can make up their own minds about what is good for them.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook True, in 2018 paramedics were called to Sotomayor's home when she had a low blood sugar episode. She was treated and then returned to work. But Chief Justice John Roberts was hospitalized in 2020 for a fall and suffered seizures in 1993 and 2007. Justice Clarence Thomas spent a week in the hospital in 2022 for flu-like symptoms. They're still doing their jobs, and so can Sotomayor. In a January public appearance, she described how the impact of the court keeps her going. 'I live in frustration. Every loss truly traumatizes me in my stomach and in my heart,' she said. 'But I have to get up the next morning and keep on fighting.'\nJustice Sotomayor does not serve in fealty to the interests of the Democratic Party. Her responsibility is to the law — and calls for her retirement are disrespectful and unwarranted.",

CNN —\nCNN — Traveling between New York and Los Angeles in the 1960s, Trina Robbins hobnobbed with rock stars like Jim Morrison and Joni Mitchell, who even sang about her in 'Ladies of the Canyon.' 'Trina takes her paints and her threads/And she weaves a pattern all her own,' sang Mitchell.\nRobbins, arguably the most influential female comic book artist in history, died on April 10 in San Francisco following a stroke, at age 85. As a groundbreaking artist, writer, editor and activist, she helped reshape comics into a more inclusive place for women, as well as other underrepresented voices.\nTogether with Art Spiegelman, Harvey Pekar and Robert Crumb (with whom she would clash) she helped redefine what comics could be, as well as by and for whom. Born in Brooklyn in 1938 to Jewish immigrants from Belarus and raised in Queens, Robbins grew up reading comics but drawing fashion. By her mid-twenties she'd found success as a dress designer, opening her own boutique in the trendy East Village in 1966.\nRobbins started dabbling in comics around 1969, creating a handful of strips for the newspaper 'The East Village Other,' as well as designing the iconic costume for the horror-camp heroine Vampirella for Warren Publishing.\nIt wasn't until she moved to San Francisco in 1970 that she became a dedicated comic book artist. She joined the burgeoning underground 'comix' scene, which eschewed superheroes in favor of real-world topics like sex, drugs, racial and economic inequality, systematic injustice, urban decay, environmentalism and politics.\nBut comics were a boy's club, an industry that had always been male-dominated and by the 1960s had become male-oriented (this wasn't always the case), even in the indies. So together with cartoonist Barbara 'Willy' Mendes, in July 1970 Robbins published 'It Ain't Me, Babe,' a one-shot anthology that was the first comic completely made by women. The cover read 'womens liberation,' above a protest march of comic icons like Olive Oyl, Wonder Woman, Mary Marvel and Little Lulu.\nArtist Trina Robbins joined the staff of America's first Women's Liberation newspaper, the Berkeley-based 'It Ain't Me, Babe in 1970' showing past issues at Alta's home in Oakland, Calif., on Thursday, January 22, 2015.\nArtist Trina Robbins joined the staff of America's first Women's Liberation newspaper, the Berkeley-based 'It Ain't Me, Babe in 1970' showing past issues at Alta's home in Oakland, Calif., on Thursday, January 22, 2015. Liz Hafalia/The SanIt reportedly sold 40,000 copies, a massive hit for an independently produced comic. With the publisher's encouragement, Robbins then co-created 'Wimmen's Comix' in 1972, the first comic book series edited, written and drawn entirely by women. Published more or less annually, it was also the longest running, lasting until 1992.\nUnflinchingly feminist, the series included landmarks like 'Sandy Comes Out,' the first explicitly lesbian story in comics.\nIn 1986, Robbins made the jump to mainstream comics, becoming the first woman to draw Wonder Woman in her own comic — amazingly, more than four decades since the character's creation.\nYet, for all her success, it wasn't enough. Robbins wanted recognition for the female cartoonists who came before, but were overlooked by an industry focused on honoring male artists like Charles Schulz and Jack Kirby.\nShe started researching and writing, co-writing or editing books including: 'Women and the Comics' (1985), 'A Century of Women Cartoonists' (1993), 'The Great Women Superheroes' (1996), 'From Girls to Grrrlz: A History of Women's Comics from Teens to Zines' (1999), 'The Great Women Cartoonists' (2001), 'Pretty in Ink' (2013), 'Flapper Queens: Women Cartoonists of the Jazz Age' (2020) and 'Dauntless Dames: High-Heeled Heroes of the Comic Strips' (2023), becoming an influential historian of the field.\nRelated article Opinion: A superhero comic hits like magic lightning\nRelated article Opinion: A superhero comic hits like magic lightning She was also a pioneer of Jewish representation in comics. While largely created by Jews, the industry tended to avoid explicitly Jewish subject matter until the 1970s, when Robbins and other underground creators produced autobiographical and cultural works. 'I don't know if it's in the genes, I don't know if it's the heritage, but there's a thing about Jews and communication,' she told JWeekly in 2005.\nHighlights include a 1978 short comic on the Triangle Shirtwaist fire for the Jewish feminist magazine 'Lilith,' illustrating Hirsh Glick's poem 'The Partisans Song' about the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising for a 1985 issue of 'Wimmen's Comix,' the meta comic series 'Go Girl!' about a Jewish teen superhero in the 1990s, and graphic novels like 'Lily Renée, Escape Artist: From Holocaust Survivor to Comic Book Pioneer' (2011) and 'A Minyen Yidn: A Bunch of Jews (And Other Stuff)' (2017), an adaptation of her father's Yiddish short story collection.\nAll the while, Robbins was a dedicated and effective advocate for women artists, opening the door for creators and readers alike. In the early 1990s, she co-founded the nonprofit Friends of Lulu, which promoted female creators, pushed publishers to produce more comics for female readers and helped retailers attract more women as customers.\n'Trina was a trailblazer,' said Karen Berger, founding editor of DC Comics imprint Vertigo and editor of Dark Horse imprint Berger Books. 'She was at the forefront of advocating that more comics should be created by women, for girls and women. With the explosion of graphic novels aimed at female middle grade and young adult readers today, I'd say her vision came true, and then some.'\nRobbins tackled other social issues through her comics. In 1990 she edited the one-shot anthology 'Choices: A Pro-Choice Benefit Comic' for the National Organization for Women. She continued with several similar fundraisers, the last one being 2023's 'Won't Back Down: An Anthology of Pro-Choice Comics,' created in reaction to the overturn of Roe v. Wade, with profits donated to Planned Parenthood.\nIn fiction, her other socially-conscious works include 2008's 'Freedom Songs: A Tale of the Underground Railroad.'\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook 'Trina was a firebrand. She advocated for women in and out of comics,' said Alisa Kwitney, author and comic book writer and editor. 'She seemed as vibrant and enthusiastic and creative as a woman in her twenties.'\nRobbins was inducted into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame in 2013, the comic book industry's equivalent of the Academy Awards' Lifetime Achievement Award.\nShe was an exceptionally prolific artist, scholar and activist. 'Any of these accomplishments are enough to secure an iconic place in the story of comics, the combination is impressive beyond probability. And Trina led other lives, in other corners of popular culture as well,' Paul Levitz, former president and publisher of DC Comics, said. 'We won't see her like again.'\nRobbins is survived by her longtime partner Steve Leialoha, her sister Harriet, her daughter Casey and her granddaughter. She is also mourned by a community of professionals and fans who cherished her.\nThe next biography of a comic book icon, female or otherwise, should be of her: the trailblazer who weaved a pattern all her own.",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide whether the Biden administration overstepped a 1968 federal law by imposing new regulations on the makers of 'ghost guns,' mail-order kits that allow people to build untraceable guns at home.\nGhost guns are kits that a user can purchase online to assemble a fully functional firearm at home. They carry no serial numbers, do not require background checks and provide no transfer records for traceability. Critics say they are attractive to people who are otherwise legally prohibited from buying firearms.\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives approved a regulation in 2022 that required the manufacturers to have serial numbers on the kits and keep records of who purchased them. Advocacy groups and five companies that manufacture the kits sued, arguing the regulation wasn't permitted under law.\nThe rule does not prohibit the sale or possession of any ghost gun kit, nor does it block an individual from purchasing such a kit. Instead, it requires compliance with federal laws that impose conditions on the commercial sale of firearms.\nA US district court in Texas threw out the rule and the conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals mostly upheld that decision. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, has weighed into the case twice on its emergency docket, pausing lower court rulings that barred the regulation from taking effect.\nLast summer, a 5-4 court sided with the Biden administration in the first emergency request, allowing the regulations to remain in effect while legal challenges played out. At the time, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett sided with the liberal justices in the administration's favor.\nAfter the order was issued, the district court stepped in to block the regulations as applied to two manufacturers. The Supreme Court stepped in again last fall to allow the regulations to remain in effect.\nThe Biden administration said police departments have faced an 'explosion of crimes involving ghost guns' in recent years. In 2017, police submitted about 1,600 ghost guns for tracing. Four years later, the number had grown to more than 19,000.\nBoth sides – the administration and the manufacturers – asked the Supreme Court to take the case.\nThe kit makers said their product is intended to cater to 'law-abiding citizens making their own firearms' and accused the Biden administration of attempting to shut their companies down.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

            "summary": "Washington CNN —\nWashington CNN — A bill that reauthorizes Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act cleared a procedural hurdle on Thursday, paving the way for its passage ahead of a looming Friday night deadline when the intelligence community surveillance tool expires.\nThe test procedural vote passed 67-32, with a combination of liberals and conservatives voting against. It's unclear if the renewal will happen before the law lapses on Friday.\n'We will try as hard as we can to get reauthorization done today, if not, senators should expect votes tomorrow,' Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the floor.\nBipartisan critics of the bill could drag out the procedural clock until Sunday — meaning 702 would lapse temporarily over their weekend — unless they reach an agreement sooner, something they might do if they are allowed votes on amendments addressing their key concerns with the program.\nSchumer's efforts come as Senate critics have had a myriad of complaints about Section 702 of FISA, notably that the government can get access without a warrant to Americans' data when they are interacting with foreign targets of the law.\nUnder FISA's Section 702, the government hoovers up massive amounts of internet and cellphone data on foreign targets. Hundreds of thousands of Americans' information is incidentally collected during that process and then accessed each year without a warrant — down from millions of such queries the US government ran in past years. Critics refer to these queries as 'backdoor' searches.\nThe trove of data, including a large portion of US internet traffic, is meant to provide US intelligence agencies with quick access to data regarding foreigners in other countries.\nAccording to one assessment, it forms the basis of most of the intelligence the president views each morning and it has helped the US keep tabs on Russia's intentions in Ukraine, identify foreign efforts to access US infrastructure, uncover foreign terror networks and thwart terror attacks in the US.\nThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court recently OK'd procedures for the program through April 2025, but if the authority lapses on Friday, it is possible that some US companies could refuse to provide the government with data under that certification.\nCNN's Katie Bo Lillis contributed to this report.",

            "summary": "Georgian lawmakers came to blows in parliament on Monday as ruling party legislators looked set to advance a controversial bill on 'foreign agents' that has been criticized by Western countries and sparked protests at home.\nFootage broadcast on Georgian television showed Mamuka Mdinaradze, leader of the ruling Georgian Dream party's parliamentary faction and a driving force behind the bill, being punched in the face by opposition MP Aleko Elisashvili while speaking from the despatch box.\nThe incident prompted a wider brawl between several lawmakers, an occasional occurrence in Georgia's often raucous parliament. Footage showed Elisashvili being greeted with cheers by protesters outside the parliament building.\nGeorgian Dream said earlier this month it would reintroduce legislation requiring organizations that accept funds from abroad to register as foreign agents or face fines, 13 months after protests forced it to shelve the plan.\nThe bill has strained relations with European countries and the United States, who have said they oppose its passage. The European Union, which gave Georgia candidate status in December, has said the move is incompatible with the bloc's values.\nGeorgian Dream says it wants the country to join the EU and NATO, even as it has deepened ties with Russia and faced accusations of authoritarianism at home. It says the bill is necessary to combat what it calls 'pseudo-liberal values' imposed by foreigners, and to promote transparency.\nGeorgia's government said Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze held a meeting on Monday with the EU, British and US ambassadors at which they had discussed the bill.\nIn a statement, Kobakhidze defended the draft law as promoting accountability, and said it was 'not clear' why Western countries opposed it.\nGeorgian critics have labeled the bill 'the Russian law', comparing it to similar legislation used by the Kremlin to crack down on dissent in Russia.\nRussia is widely unpopular in Georgia, due to Moscow's support for the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Russia defeated Georgia in a short war in 2008.\nSeveral hundred demonstrators gathered outside the parliament building ahead of a mass protest that civil society organizations have called for Monday evening.\nOnce approved by members of the legislature's legal affairs committee, which is controlled by Georgian Dream and its allies, the foreign agent bill can proceed to a first reading in parliament.\nGeorgia is due to hold elections by October. Opinion polls show that Georgian Dream remains the most popular party, but has lost ground since 2020, when it won a narrow majority.",

            "excerpt": "The Supreme Court wrestled Monday for more than two and a half hours with the issue of ticketing homeless people is a 'cruel and unusual' punishment that violates the Eighth Amendment.",
            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — The Supreme Court wrestled Monday for more than two and a half hours with the question of whether ticketing homeless people is a 'cruel and unusual' punishment that violates the Eighth Amendment.\nSeveral of the justices appeared concerned about the prospect of criminalizing homelessness but they also worried about limiting a city's ability to regulate public health or fire hazards in homeless encampments across the country.\n'Sleeping is a biological necessity. It's sort of like breathing,' said Justice Elena Kagan. 'You can say breathing is conduct, too, but presumably you would not think that it's OK to criminalize breathing in public. And for a homeless person who has no place to go, sleeping in public is kind of like breathing in public.'\nMuch of the argument focused on whether the 'anti-camping' ordinances in Grants Pass, Oregon, prohibited conduct, such as sleeping with bedding in a public space, or the status of being homeless. The city of 38,000 argues that the rules are focused narrowly on conduct but the plaintiffs have argued that enforcement has been targeted at people who are unhoused.\nPolice regularly ticketed people who were sleeping in parks and other public spaces under those ordinances. Each violation carries a $295 fine, which increases to more than $500 if not paid.\nThe case is the most significant appeal involving unhoused Americans to reach the Supreme Court in decades, and it's being closely watched by cities and states across the nation that are wrestling with a sharp increase in homelessness.\nOn any given night, more than 650,000 people in the United States are experiencing homelessness, according to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. That number increased 12% from 2022 to 2023.\nChief Justice John Roberts and other members of the court's conservative majority raised a series of questions that noted the ordinance doesn't explicitly say anything about prohibiting homelessness – and that defining someone's status as 'homeless' can be tricky because it can change nightly.\n'Eating is a basic human function as well that people have to do – just like sleeping,' Roberts said. 'If someone is hungry and no one is giving him food, can you prosecute him if he breaks into a store to get something to eat?'\nEdwin Kneedler, representing the Biden administration in the case, said that the government could 'absolutely' prosecute someone in that situation.\nSeveral members of the court – both conservative and liberal – seemed to wrestle with how to draw the line between status and conduct. That distinction is especially important because a 1962 Supreme Court decision found that a California law that criminalized drug addiction – as opposed to drug possession – amounted to a 'cruel and unusual' punishment under the Eighth Amendment because the law was attempting to punish someone's status.\nSeveral city residents experiencing homelessness sued Grants Pass. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals sided with them, holding that it could not 'enforce its anticamping ordinances against homeless persons for the mere act of sleeping outside with rudimentary protection from the elements, or for sleeping in their car at night, when there was no other place in the city for them to go.'\nGrants Pass officials said the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on 'cruel and unusual' punishment was aimed at torture or hard labor sentences, not tickets.\nA decision in the case, City of Grants Pass v. Johnson, is expected by the end of June.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — The Supreme Court's conservative majority indicated Tuesday that it may toss out a charge prosecutors have lodged against hundreds of people who took part in the January 6, 2021, riot on the US Capitol, a decision that could force the Justice Department to reopen some of those cases.\nDuring over 90 minutes of arguments, most justices signaled concern with how the Justice Department is using the law enacted by Congress more than two decades ago in response to the Enron accounting scandal. Critics claimed the felony charge, which carries a prison sentence of up to 20 years, was intended to prevent evidence tampering – not an insurrection in support of a president who lost reelection.\nThe court's decision, expected by July, could have significant ramifications for some 350 people who were charged with 'obstructing' an official proceeding for their part in the Capitol attack – including more than 100 people who have already been convicted and received prison sentences.\nThe high court's ruling could also affect the federal election subversion criminal case pending against former President Donald Trump, who was also charged with the obstruction crime.\nHere's what to know about Tuesday's oral arguments:\nThe appeal was brought by a former Pennsylvania police officer, Joseph Fischer, who was charged with multiple crimes for pushing his way into the Capitol after attending Trump's rally outside the White House on January 6. Fischer's attorney told the justices that prosecutors overstepped by charging his client with what critics previously framed as an anti-shredding law.\nMostly absent from oral arguments Tuesday was recognition of the traumatic and deadly turn of events that took place just across the street from the Supreme Court three years ago after Trump ginned up a crowd with false claims of fraud and encouraged them to march on the Capitol and 'fight like hell.'\nInstead, the discussion turned largely on a technical and legalistic debate about the meaning of the words in the law – in particular the word 'otherwise.'\nThat 2002 law makes it a felony to 'corruptly' alter, destroy or mutilate a record with the intent of making it unavailable for use in an 'official proceeding,' or to 'otherwise' obstruct, influence, or impede such a proceeding. Fischer argued that, taken together, the law was geared toward prohibiting records destruction. But the Justice Department said it swept far more broadly than that, encompassing a wider range of actions – including physical intrusion – that would obstruct a proceeding.\nsaid it swept far more broadly than that, encompassing a wider range of actions – including physical intrusion – that would obstruct a proceeding. 'The key word is ‘otherwise,'' Justice Brett Kavanaugh, often a critical vote in high-profile cases, said at one point as he quizzed Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar. 'It would be odd to have such a broad provision tucked in and connected by the word ‘otherwise.''\nThat position seemed to draw attention from Chief Justice John Roberts as well, who at one point sharply pushed back on the government for trying to separate the 'evidence' portion of the law from a provision dealing with 'obstruction.'\n'You can't just tack it on and say, ‘Look at it as if it's standing alone,'' Roberts said. 'Because it's not.'\nSee how the Capitol Riot on January 6 unfolded\n04:49 - Source: CNN\n04:49 - Source: CNN Occasionally, Prelogar sought to remind the justices of the details of the case at hand. In one especially pointed response to a question from Kavanaugh about the other charges the DOJ can use in Capitol riot prosecutions, Prelogar argued that Fischer, in advance of the attack, had expressed an intent to storm the Capitol and use violence if necessary to disrupt the vote.\n'He said, ‘they can't vote if they can't breathe,'' Prelogar argued, referring to Fischer's texts from before January 6. 'And then he went to the Capitol on January 6, with that intent in mind, and took action – including assaulting a law enforcement officer – that did impede the ability of the officers to regain control of the Capitol and let Congress finish its work.'\n'And then he went to the Capitol on January 6, with that intent in mind, and took action – including assaulting a law enforcement officer – that did impede the ability of the officers to regain control of the Capitol and let Congress finish its work.' There was a heavy dose of 'whataboutism' from the conservative justices, who repeatedly brought up left-wing protests while pressing both sides about exactly which conduct they believed would – and wouldn't – be covered by the felony obstruction law.\nwould – and wouldn't – be covered by the felony obstruction law. Justice Neil Gorsuch posed several hypotheticals to Prelogar, asking if prosecutors could use the law to charge someone who participated in a sit-in that disrupted a trial 'at a federal courthouse' or who was caught 'pulling a fire alarm before a vote' in Congress.\nHe didn't mention Rep. Jamaal Bowman by name, but the allusion to the New York Democrat was clear: He pulled the fire alarm shortly before a critical vote on a government funding bill in September. Bowman later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor offense and was censured by the House.\nJustice Samuel Alito brought up the disruptions at the Golden Gate Bridge that occurred Monday. Pro-Palestinian protesters, angry about Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, blocked rush-hour traffic, leading to more than 30 arrests.\n'What if something similar to that happened all around the Capitol so that … all the bridges from Virginia were blocked and members from Virginia who needed to appear at a hearing couldn't get there, or were delayed in getting there?' Alito asked. 'Would that be a violation of this provision?'\nPrelogar differentiated those cases by pointing out that January 6 was a far more aggressive and multi-pronged assault, with direct aims to shut down a specific proceeding. She said many of the January 6 rioters violently breached multiple police lines, brought tactical gear and weapons, and made explicit threats before arriving in DC.\nmore aggressive and multi-pronged assault, with direct aims to shut down a specific proceeding. She said many of the January 6 rioters violently breached multiple police lines, brought tactical gear and weapons, and made explicit threats before arriving in DC. The Supreme Court's three liberals appeared to be lined up in favor of the Justice Department's position that the federal obstruction law is broad enough to include the rioters' conduct on January 6.\nThe law, Justice Elena Kagan said, could have been written by Congress to limit its prohibition to evidence tampering. But, she stressed, 'it doesn't do that.'\nKagan and Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson pressed Fischer's attorney, Jeffrey Green, on the plain text of the law – embracing a conservative notion of 'textualism,' or reading the law for its plain meaning without considering legislative history and other factors.\nJackson noted that the language in the statute 'does not use the term ‘evidence'' but rather 'uses the term ‘official proceeding,'' which is defined as including a congressional proceeding.\nThough Trump is not a party in the case, the appeal indirectly thrust him onto the Supreme Court's docket for the third time this election year. In March, the justices unanimously ruled that the former president should appear on the ballot in Colorado despite claims he violated the 14th Amendment's 'insurrectionist ban' because of his actions on January 6.\nappear on the ballot in Colorado despite claims he violated the 14th Amendment's 'insurrectionist ban' because of his actions on January 6. Special counsel Jack Smith has charged Trump with the same obstruction crime prosecutors filed against Fischer and more than 350 others involved in the attack. The former president and presumptive GOP nominee would almost certainly use a win for Fischer to try to further undermine the Justice Department's prosecution of the January 6 defendants.\nothers involved in the attack. The former president and presumptive GOP nominee would almost certainly use a win for Fischer to try to further undermine the Justice Department's prosecution of the January 6 defendants. How much Fischer's case would spill over to Trump's is open for debate. Smith has argued that the obstruction charge against Trump is based on the fake slate of electors the former president attempted to have submitted to Congress, not the riot itself. Unless the court rules broadly in a way that undermines the charge entirely, the case against Trump may still stick even if Fischer wins his case.\nJustice Clarence Thomas was absent from oral arguments on Monday, with the court refusing to explain his absence. He was back on Tuesday for a case that critics say he shouldn't be involved in at all.\nThe Fischer case has prompted some liberal critics of the court to demand that Thomas recuse himself. That's because Thomas' wife, Ginni Thomas, attended Trump's incendiary rally on January 6 and plotted with Trump allies on ways to keep him in power after he lost the election.\non January 6 and plotted with Trump allies on ways to keep him in power after he lost the election. Thomas has ignored the requests to recuse and posed a number of questions that challenged both sides in the case.\n'There have been many violent protests that have interfered with proceedings,' Thomas asked Prelogar, pressing on a theme he returned to repeatedly during the arguments. 'Has the government applied this provision to other protests in the past?'\nPrelogar said the Justice Department has applied the law more broadly than in evidence tampering cases but acknowledged it has not been used previously against 'a situation where people have violently stormed' a building. But that, she said, was based on the unusual nature of the Capitol attack itself.\n'I'm not aware,' she said, 'of that circumstance ever happening prior to January 6.'",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — The Supreme Court on Monday allowed Idaho officials to temporarily enforce a strict statewide ban on gender-affirming care for most minors, in one of the first such cases to reach the nation's highest court.\nIn an emergency request filed in February, Idaho asked the justices to block a lower court's order that halted implementation of the law. Signed by Republican Gov. Brad Little last year, the law makes it a felony to provide medical treatment – such as puberty-blocking drugs, hormone therapy and certain surgeries – to transgender minors.\nThe high court's decision, which came over the dissent of liberal justices, doesn't resolve the underlying legal challenges raised by the case but instead allows the state to enforce the law against most people while the lower courts resolve those questions.\nThough there was no formal opinion from the court, as is often the case on the court's emergency docket, several justices wrote to explain their positions.\nThe court's conservatives said the decision was intended as a signal to lower courts to limit how far they rule when they are temporarily blocking the state from enforcing a law. Justice Neil Gorsuch, in an opinion joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, noted that the lower court that reviewed the Idaho law didn't just block it for the parties involved but blocked its enforcement for everyone in the state.\nThat, they said, represented an overreach by the courts.\n'A return to a more piecemeal and deliberative judicial process may strike some as inefficient. It may promise less power for the judge and less drama and excitement for the parties and public,' Gorsuch wrote. 'But if any of that makes today's decision wrong, it makes it wrong in the best possible ways.'\nThe Supreme Court's decision on Monday continued to block enforcement against the parties who brought the suit, but no one else.\nThe move drew a sharp dissent from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who described the majority's decision as 'micromanaging the lower courts' exercise of their discretionary authority.'\nJackson, in an opinion joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, noted that a lower federal court 'determined that a never-before-in-effect Idaho law is likely unconstitutional' and that court temporarily blocked the law's enforcement while it considered the legal challenges involved.\n'This court is not compelled to rise and respond every time an applicant rushes to us with an alleged emergency, and it is especially important for us to refrain from doing so in novel, highly charged, and unsettled circumstances,' Jackson wrote.\nThe justices have for weeks been considering three merits appeals over similar laws in Tennessee and Kentucky. An Indiana ban on transition care for minors was allowed to take effect in late February by an appeals court in Chicago.\nIdaho, which is being represented in part by conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, argues that the lower court decisions to block the law were too broad because they swept in procedures banned under the act that the plaintiffs did not seek to continue.\nEvery day the law is blocked 'exposes vulnerable children to risky and dangerous medical procedures and infringes Idaho's sovereign power to enforce its democratically enacted law,' the state told the Supreme Court in its filing.\nAttorneys for the transgender teenagers and their parents who are challenging the state law had asked the court to turn down the request from Republican state Attorney General Raúl Labrador, saying that for both minor plaintiffs, 'gender-affirming medical care has dramatically alleviated their gender dysphoria and enabled them to become healthy, thriving teenagers.'\nLabrador said a statement that 'the state has a duty to protect and support all children,' adding: 'And that's why I'm proud to defend Idaho's law that ensures children are not subjected to these life-altering drugs and procedures.'\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Idaho, which represented the two families who sued over the law, described the court's decision as 'an awful result for transgender youth and their families.'\nThe ruling, the groups said in a statement, 'allows the state to shut down the care that thousands of families rely on while sowing further confusion and disruption.'\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\nThis story has been updated with additional details.",

CNN —\nCNN — In 1957, I moved to Berkeley, California: a bastion of American liberalism that squarely aligns with my progressive values, and a hub of American scholarship that nurtured my academic quest and professional growth. I came here for advanced studies in microbiology and genetics. Since then, I have lived, worked as a scientist and retired in this community.\nOver the 65 years that I have called this beautiful area home, I have occasionally encountered antisemitism, but these one-off incidents never succeeded in destroying my spirit. When I was four years old, Nazis burst into my bedroom and sent me and my family to Dachau, the first Nazi concentration camp. We were soon released and I was smuggled out of Germany by a Christian woman. After this harrowing experience, not much in the Bay Area could scare me.\nBut since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the hatred towards Jews that I have seen in Berkeley terrifies me more than anything I have experienced while living here. I am still reeling from being called a liar at a Berkeley City Council meeting, where I asked for a proclamation to mark Holocaust Remembrance Day and spoke about October 7. The Jews at that meeting were circled and called 'Zionist pigs' by menacing protesters.\nWe are approaching the holiday of Passover, which commemorates the freedom of the Israelites from Egyptian slavery and our formation as a free Jewish people in our own land. But this Passover is like no other in recent history, with scores of hostages still held in Gaza and Jews worldwide fearful for our future — including Jews in the US. We are facing the worst global antisemitism since the Holocaust and while it is not state-sanctioned as Nazism was, it is a threat going unchecked in California's East Bay.\nRelated article Opinion: To combat antisemitism, start by following the law\nRelated article Opinion: To combat antisemitism, start by following the law It is incredibly painful to see my neighbors vilify Jews, tear down posters of Jewish hostages in Gaza and not believe Jewish rape victims. In this hotbed, hatred and hostility have become normalized. Families have moved their children out of public schools. Jewish businesses have been vandalized and boycotted. And lies about Jews and Israel have gone unchecked and unchallenged in our public forums. Our local Jewish community is both horrified and petrified.\nThis onslaught of Jewish hatred cannot become the new normal. This epidemic must be treated as seriously as all other hatreds that our society is confronting, such as racism and homophobia. We need more education about Judaism and how the long, sordid history of antisemitism ties into other forms of hatred in our public schools.\nWe need colleges and universities to unequivocally denounce hate speech and actions directed at Jews. We need public officials to urge mutual respect, understanding and civil discourse during city council and town hall meetings.\nI have seen where unchecked antisemitism can lead, when people will do nothing — or worse, join the mainstream, such as our German neighbors during Nazism. This Passover, I resolve with whatever time I have left in this world to fight for the safety of the Jewish people, in Berkeley and around the globe.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook During Passover, we are commanded to tell the story of the exodus out of Egypt to our children. We believe in the lasting power of sharing this history with younger generations and reflecting on this hopeful new beginning. There is also lasting power in sharing my history as a Jewish refugee — and I invite my Berkeley neighbors to hear my story. Without understanding and acceptance, we are enslaved by our biases.\nThe hatred, violence and bigotry against the Jewish community cannot continue — for our shared future, we must confront it and root it out.",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu have thanked US lawmakers after they voted in favor of new aid packages for their countries worth billions of dollars.\n'Thank you, America!' Zelensky wrote on his Telegram on Saturday, shortly after the House of Representatives passed the long-delayed Ukraine Security Supplemental Appropriations Act by a vote of 311-112.\nThe bill was part of a wider $95 billion package providing foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific region. It provides nearly $61 billion to help Ukraine and others in the region fight Russia, while the House also passed funding worth $26.4 billion for Israel and $8.1 billion to counter China's actions in the Indo-Pacific.\nZelensky said the decision would keep 'history on the right track.'\n'Democracy and freedom will always have global significance and will never fail as long as America helps to protect it. The vital US aid bill passed today by the House will keep the war from expanding, save thousands and thousands of lives, and help both of our nations to become stronger. Just peace and security can only be attained through strength,' Zelensky added.\nMeanwhile, the House passed the Israel Security Supplemental with a vote of 366-58.\n'Thank you friends, thank you America!' said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a post on social media, adding that the bill demonstrates 'strong bipartisan support for Israel and defends Western civilization.'\nHowever, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, the spokesperson for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, condemned the aid package for Israel, describing it as a 'dangerous escalation' and act of aggression that would lead to more Palestinian casualties in Israel's war on Hamas.\nThe measures still need approval from the Senate, which could begin voting on them as soon as Tuesday.\nUS President Joe Biden said the House passage of the foreign aid bills sent a 'clear message' about America's leadership to the globe, and urged the Senate to 'quickly send this package to my desk so that I can sign it into law.'\nThe passing of the measures for Ukraine following months of resistance by some Republicans is seen by some as a potential turning point in the country's fight against Russia's invasion.\nUkraine's foreign minister told CNN the risk of a larger war in Europe had fallen following the vote.\n'This is a historic day, when not only Ukraine got a boost of hope, but also the United States and all of the free world,' Dmytro Kuleba said.\nEnsuring Russian President Vladimir Putin is defeated in Ukraine would protect the security and prosperity of Americans, he added.\n'Enabling Ukraine to push back Russian aggression is equal to preventing a larger war in Europe and averting the risk of all wannabe aggressors plunging our world into chaos,' Kuleba said.\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova appeared less enthused, insisting to CNN in a statement Saturday that the aid package would only increase tensions.\n'The allocation of US military aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan will exacerbate global crises: military aid to the Kyiv regime is direct sponsorship of terrorist activity, to Taiwan is interference in China's internal affairs, and to Israel is a direct path toward escalating unprecedented aggravation in the region,' the statement read.\nThree Ukrainian servicemen told CNN the vote provided a much-needed shot in the arm — and all three fighters were clear on the weapons they now need from the United States.\n'We thought that our partners had forgotten about us,' an intelligence officer with the call sign Bankir, currently serving in the Zaporizhzhia region, said in a phone conversation. 'This news gives us a sense of support and understanding that we have not been forgotten.'\nAn artillery reconnaissance commander with the 110th mechanized brigade, who spent two years defending the industrial town of Avdiivka before it fell to Russia in February, had a similar message.\n'When we feel support from the outside, it motivates us. After all, the military knows it cannot win with sticks and bows and arrows,' the commander, using his call sign Teren, told CNN. 'For people who want to defeat the enemy, this news is a great morale booster.'\nvideo\nvideo Related video See moment Ukraine aid bill passes the House\nRelated video See moment Ukraine aid bill passes the House He went on: 'To win, we need ammunition … we really need artillery shells because we have an artillery hunger. We also need drones, both reconnaissance and attack drones.'\nAnother soldier, Dmytro Kurylovich, fighting in eastern Ukraine with the National Guard, identified air defense and artillery as top priorities.\n'First of all, we need air defense systems and artillery shells […] All big cities need air defense systems. Artillery is needed so that we can conduct a counter-offensive and fight back. If we have enough artillery, we will be able to liberate our territories faster and change the situation at the front,' he said in an audio message to CNN.\n'Morale changes depending on whether there is ammunition,' he added, throwing into sharp relief the impact on Ukraine's soldiers of being outgunned by Russian forces ten to one – a ratio recently reported by Ukraine's president in an interview.\nThe intelligence officer Bankir also described how frontline soldiers would feel more secure knowing the rest of the country was better protected from Russian missile strikes.\n'We need air defense systems. Here at the front, we need to be sure that our families in the back are protected and safe. Then we can fight,' he said.",

            "summary": "When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration: 'This fight is about freedom, and the freedom that is fundamental to the promise of America.'\nIn a new abortion-focused ad that the Biden campaign aired in Arizona last week, President Joe Biden somberly asks: 'If Donald Trump gets back in power, what freedom will you lose next?'\nFor Biden, Harris and other Democrats to lean so heavily on the word 'freedom' in this campaign is a historic reversal of roles. At least since the New Deal 90 years ago, Republicans have been the party most likely to frame their agenda as advancing 'freedom' and 'liberty' while Democrats have more often emphasized ideas such as 'equality' and 'justice.'\nRepublicans haven't abandoned their rhetorical efforts to claim the terrain of freedom. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for instance, used the word almost as a mantra the past few years to denounce the restrictions many states imposed to fight the spread of Covid-19 and to attack what he calls the left's effort to impose 'woke ideology.' And Trump disparages Biden's agenda to promote the deployment of electric vehicles as an attempt to deny Americans' freedom to continue purchasing gas-powered cars and trucks.\nBut the GOP push at every level of government to roll back the 'rights revolution' of the past six decades – symbolized by the proliferation of red-state laws limiting access to abortion and potentially other reproductive health care such as IVF – has provided Democrats a historic opportunity to reverse the direction of this long-running debate, many analysts agree.\n'Historically, Republicans have rooted their philosophical world view in liberty: for them it's about freedom to own guns, to practice religion as they see fit' or reducing government taxes, spending and regulation, said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute, which studies the intersection of culture and politics. 'What's new is Democrats are using the term in ways to reimagine what freedom really means.'\nTransforming the debate over freedom may be especially crucial for Biden because polls consistently show Trump with a double-digit lead when voters are asked who they trust more to handle the economy. That means that to win the election Biden will need to convince a substantial number of voters who believe Trump is better for their bottom line to vote against him anyway. The interrelated issues revolving around rights, values and democracy likely offer the president his best chance to do so. 'If any issue' is going to flip voters who express more confidence in Trump on the economy, 'it is going to be social issues like abortion,' said Deckman.\nBiden signaled the central role freedom would play in his campaign messaging from the outset, in the video he released last year announcing his plan to seek reelection. As an ominous piano key trills behind images of the January 6, 2021, insurrection, abortion rights protesters and the White House, Biden opens the video with a stark declaration: 'Freedom. Personal freedom is fundamental to who we are as Americans. There's nothing more important. Nothing more sacred.' Later he says: 'The question we're facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer. I know what I want the answer to be, and I think you do too.'\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security.\nRoe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security. Harris, who has been the administration's point person in delivering the freedom message, has likewise cast an expansive net. When Harris delivered a Martin Luther King Day speech to the NAACP this year that summarized the administration's case for another term, she cited all the issues Biden did in the video and others, such as the restrictions several red states have imposed on the teaching of the nation's racial history and the right 'to live free from the horror of gun violence.'\nWay to Win, a liberal group that funds organizations and campaigns focusing on voters of color, has been pushing the party for several years to emphasize the freedom argument. Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, the group's vice president and chief strategy officer, says linking all these other issues to abortion is key to portraying Trump and his allies as a threat to freedom.\n'If [abortion] was the only thing, it would feel different than if you are able to tick off all these other things that they are doing and that they will do,' she said. 'We can even say it with other kinds of repro [rights]: We can say it with IVF, or now they are going to come for your contraception. Abortion is an entry point: because it is so visceral for people, it is a way to connect to a larger story about rights and freedoms.'\nLauren Hitt, a senior spokesperson for the Biden campaign, argued freedom will be a powerful message for the president because it resonates with a broad range of voters. 'It … speaks to the values of traditional Republican voters, [Nikki] Haley primary voters, and suburban voters – as well as to our base who believe deeply that the government shouldn't be making personal decisions for people,' she said. 'It's a uniquely powerful idea grounded in traditional democratic values that will be critical in winning the swing voters we need to win in November.'\nThe Trump campaign pushed back on Biden's ad asking which freedom Trump would take away next. 'Under Joe Biden, Americans are less free, less safe, and less prosperous,' Karoline Leavitt, the campaign's national spokesperson, said in a statement.\nDaniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that broad changes in societal attitudes have encouraged both parties to emphasize their commitments to personal freedom. 'Each side recognizes this is something people care about,' Cox said. 'It's effective language at a time when we are increasingly individualistic. We are not as inclined to be communitarian and oriented toward the concerns of others. So I think it's not a surprise that we're seeing both political parties try to employ this language to their advantage.'\nEven with all the increased Democratic emphasis on protecting rights, Cox said, the issue remains 'contested ground' that can favor either party depending on how it is framed. While Republicans have been 'on their heels' defending abortion restrictions such as last week's Arizona ruling, he said, the party has benefited in other races from positioning itself as defending 'parent's rights,' as Republican Glenn Youngkin did while winning the Virginia governorship in 2021. (It's notable that when abortion rights and parental rights collided in the 2023 Virginia state legislative elections, Democrats stressing the former won control of both chambers over Republicans emphasizing the latter.)\nPolling suggests the public remains split over which party it trusts to defend basic rights and freedoms. To begin with, Democrats and Republicans hold very different priorities over which rights are most important to protect, PRRI found in unpublished national polling shared exclusively with CNN. In that survey, conducted late last year, Republicans were most likely to say their freedom to own guns, to practice their religion and to speak their mind was growing more restricted; Democrats were most likely to say that they were losing the freedom to control their own body. 'The parties are talking past each other,' Deckman said. 'Freedom is a word that is quintessentially American, but it depends on what freedoms you are referring to in the first place.'\nThe public returned a similar split verdict last fall in an NBC poll that asked voters which party they trusted more to handle different issues. In the poll, Democrats held a commanding 18 percentage point advantage on dealing with abortion. But when asked which party they trusted more on 'protecting our constitutional rights,' voters preferred Republicans by a margin of 43% to 35%. Even White women, who strongly preferred Democrats on abortion, split evenly over which party they trusted on the broader question of preserving core constitutional rights.\nThat GOP advantage may reflect the traditional political dynamic that conservative voters have been more likely than liberals to believe their rights are under siege and to view government actions as a threat to their liberty. In 2022 polling by Penn State University's McCourtney Institute for Democracy, Republicans were twice as likely as Democrats to say that they had lost rights and freedoms over the past decade. Republicans were also considerably more likely, though not by as lopsided a margin, to predict that they would lose more rights than they gain over the next decade.\nThe real-world consequence of that imbalance was on display in the 2016 presidential campaign, when Democratic-leaning voters largely shrugged about Hillary Clinton's warnings that a Trump victory would allow him to move the Supreme Court to the right in a way that would threaten basic rights, like abortion.\nChris Wilson, a GOP pollster who worked for the super PAC supporting DeSantis in the 2024 campaign, said the Penn State polling suggests that Biden still will face difficulty mobilizing key elements of the Democratic coalition with a message about rights and freedoms. He noted that such groups as Generation Z, Blacks and Latinos were much less likely than college-educated Whites or Republicans to express fears in the poll that they would lose rights in the decade ahead.\n'To whatever extent the Democrats are trying to make a rights argument, it's not as worrying to the youth and to minorities as it is to Whites, people with college degrees, and Boomers,' Wilson said. 'Biden's ‘rights' argument might be a big hit with his peers, but might be the wrong note to strike if he wants to hold onto the parts of the Democratic coalition that are starting to look shaky.'\nBut the Penn State polling was conducted before the Dobbs decision ended the nationwide right to abortion. And many analysts believe that seismic shift has increased the relevance of questions revolving around rights and freedoms to key groups that Democrats rely on – with younger women especially focused on these threats. While Republicans traditionally responded more to these arguments, Deckman said, 'These times certainly have made freedom a more accessible, even an existential, issue for people on the left.'\nFernandez Ancona agrees to an extent with both Wilson and Deckman. The 2022 elections, she said, demonstrated how strongly many people react to the risk of losing rights they believed had been settled. 'When these things you take for granted are taken away in this very stark way, it's incredibly motivating,' she said. But she also believes that Democrats need to tie their case about defending personal freedom into a broader message that portrays the 2024 election less as a personal choice between Trump and Biden than as a fundamental crossroads over America's future priorities that will shape not only personal liberties but also economic opportunity.\n'We have to get people to shift their thinking about how this is a choice between two different futures,' she said. 'It can get people out of this one-to-one candidate-to- candidate [comparison] and asking, ‘what I like, what I don't like' about Trump or Biden.'\nFor libertarians, the escalating struggle between Biden and Republicans over the idea of freedom is a source of both bemusement and frustration. Libertarians take a purist position that advocates for minimal government intervention in both personal behavior and the economy; they usually find Republicans deficient on the first count, and Democrats on the second.\nDavid Boaz, a distinguished senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, sees those flaws in both Biden and Trump. The Biden administration, Boaz said, is 'very big on reproductive freedom, and very big on a lot of aspects of LGBTQ freedom, but beyond those things, where's the freedom in the Biden-Harris plan?' And while Trump talks about promoting economic freedom by cutting taxes and regulation, Boaz continued, Republicans have also undermined such freedom by promoting high tariffs and using government policy to punish companies they disfavor, as DeSantis did with Disney in Florida.\nBut while Boaz believes both Biden and Trump have imperfect records when it comes to promoting freedom, he thinks one issue breaks the tie between them: Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election. ﻿'I have friends who say Biden is the biggest spender ever and he's regulating and he's woke and how can anyone consider voting for him over Trump?' Boaz said.\n'And I'll say that one reason is that Biden has not tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power. That's a very fundamental issue. You can add up all these [other] issues and weigh them. But the big freedom issue that Biden has over Trump,' Boaaz added, 'is that Trump tried to steal an election.'",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration: 'This fight is about freedom, and the freedom that is fundamental to the promise of America.'\nIn a new abortion-focused ad that the Biden campaign aired in Arizona last week, President Joe Biden somberly asks: 'If Donald Trump gets back in power, what freedom will you lose next?'\nFor Biden, Harris and other Democrats to lean so heavily on the word 'freedom' in this campaign is a historic reversal of roles. At least since the New Deal 90 years ago, Republicans have been the party most likely to frame their agenda as advancing 'freedom' and 'liberty' while Democrats have more often emphasized ideas such as 'equality' and 'justice.'\nRepublicans haven't abandoned their rhetorical efforts to claim the terrain of freedom. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for instance, used the word almost as a mantra the past few years to denounce the restrictions many states imposed to fight the spread of Covid-19 and to attack what he calls the left's effort to impose 'woke ideology.' And Trump disparages Biden's agenda to promote the deployment of electric vehicles as an attempt to deny Americans' freedom to continue purchasing gas-powered cars and trucks.\nBut the GOP push at every level of government to roll back the 'rights revolution' of the past six decades – symbolized by the proliferation of red-state laws limiting access to abortion and potentially other reproductive health care such as IVF – has provided Democrats a historic opportunity to reverse the direction of this long-running debate, many analysts agree.\n'Historically, Republicans have rooted their philosophical world view in liberty: for them it's about freedom to own guns, to practice religion as they see fit' or reducing government taxes, spending and regulation, said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute, which studies the intersection of culture and politics. 'What's new is Democrats are using the term in ways to reimagine what freedom really means.'\nTransforming the debate over freedom may be especially crucial for Biden because polls consistently show Trump with a double-digit lead when voters are asked who they trust more to handle the economy. That means that to win the election Biden will need to convince a substantial number of voters who believe Trump is better for their bottom line to vote against him anyway. The interrelated issues revolving around rights, values and democracy likely offer the president his best chance to do so. 'If any issue' is going to flip voters who express more confidence in Trump on the economy, 'it is going to be social issues like abortion,' said Deckman.\nBiden signaled the central role freedom would play in his campaign messaging from the outset, in the video he released last year announcing his plan to seek reelection. As an ominous piano key trills behind images of the January 6, 2021, insurrection, abortion rights protesters and the White House, Biden opens the video with a stark declaration: 'Freedom. Personal freedom is fundamental to who we are as Americans. There's nothing more important. Nothing more sacred.' Later he says: 'The question we're facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer. I know what I want the answer to be, and I think you do too.'\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security.\nRoe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security. Harris, who has been the administration's point person in delivering the freedom message, has likewise cast an expansive net. When Harris delivered a Martin Luther King Day speech to the NAACP this year that summarized the administration's case for another term, she cited all the issues Biden did in the video and others, such as the restrictions several red states have imposed on the teaching of the nation's racial history and the right 'to live free from the horror of gun violence.'\nWay to Win, a liberal group that funds organizations and campaigns focusing on voters of color, has been pushing the party for several years to emphasize the freedom argument. Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, the group's vice president and chief strategy officer, says linking all these other issues to abortion is key to portraying Trump and his allies as a threat to freedom.\n'If [abortion] was the only thing, it would feel different than if you are able to tick off all these other things that they are doing and that they will do,' she said. 'We can even say it with other kinds of repro [rights]: We can say it with IVF, or now they are going to come for your contraception. Abortion is an entry point: because it is so visceral for people, it is a way to connect to a larger story about rights and freedoms.'\nLauren Hitt, a senior spokesperson for the Biden campaign, argued freedom will be a powerful message for the president because it resonates with a broad range of voters. 'It … speaks to the values of traditional Republican voters, [Nikki] Haley primary voters, and suburban voters – as well as to our base who believe deeply that the government shouldn't be making personal decisions for people,' she said. 'It's a uniquely powerful idea grounded in traditional democratic values that will be critical in winning the swing voters we need to win in November.'\nThe Trump campaign pushed back on Biden's ad asking which freedom Trump would take away next. 'Under Joe Biden, Americans are less free, less safe, and less prosperous,' Karoline Leavitt, the campaign's national spokesperson, said in a statement.\nDaniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that broad changes in societal attitudes have encouraged both parties to emphasize their commitments to personal freedom.

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — Kamala Harris hadn't even started building up to her ending when the crowd in Las Vegas — more fired up than any poll would suggest — started chanting, 'Four more years!' But she made sure everyone heard the line she's come up with: 'Trump abortion bans.'\nAnd not one pro-Palestinian protester interrupted her that day, or, for that matter, over her four-day campaign swing West.\nThe vice president is clearly feeling energized these days. She is more engaged. She is looser. Aides say she was the one who pushed to explicitly call out former President Donald Trump as responsible for every rollback in abortion rights, and she is clearly feeding on the old prosecutorial rush of tearing apart the opposition's argument.\nIn a conference room in the back of a campaign office in a Las Vegas strip mall, Harris said she is finding the last few months, on the attack and able to zero in on the contrast with Trump, 'very liberating.'\n'You can't forget that for the first probably year and a half, we were landlocked. It was basically me and Joe and a Zoom screen,' she told CNN, in an exclusive interview at the end of the multiday campaign swing, built in part around getting her to battlegrounds Arizona and Nevada, and around what staff has found to be helpful downtime back home in Los Angeles cooking Sunday dinner. 'Being out and being able to just have real conversations and not soundbites in an interview — it is liberating.'\nNo one in the vice president's orbit, including Harris herself, needs to be reminded how the disappointment and disenchantment from her first years on the job still hang over her, or how odd it is that some voters say in interviews with CNN and outside focus groups they are inclined toward Biden but are turned off by Harris.\nCNN's conversations with two dozen aides to the vice president, the reelection campaign and other top Democrats also show the paradox that even the most Biden-centric aides have been forced to grudgingly admit: There is another swath of voters turned off by the president — and their internal data shows Harris will be critical to getting them if Biden wants to win a second term.\nAfter years of being shunted to politically toxic and fruitless parts of the administration portfolio, such as overseeing migration negotiations with Central American leaders, or clearly junior varsity ones like chairing the National Space Council, these days are so full of plum assignments for Harris that her trip to Arizona was originally supposed to be to promote the latest round of student loan debt cancellation — only to get quickly changed when the state Supreme Court ruled that Arizona must adhere to its 1864 abortion ban.\n'She has been front and center on so many of the most politically potent issues right now,' said Julie Chavez Rodriguez, who was a top aide to Harris for years before becoming the Biden reelection campaign manager, calling these 'new opportunities to speak to the coalitions we know she already has a deep affinity to, but on issues that are top of mind for those voters.'\n'As a former prosecutor, she can prosecute the case on so much,' Rodriguez said.\nIt means getting to talk about gun control and reaching out to younger voters like the gym full of high schoolers in Vegas who cheered even more loudly for her than they did when Marvel actress Xochitl Gomez took the stage first. ('She's killing it!' an excited 15-year-old in a Barbie-pink denim jacket exclaimed after pushing up to take a photo with Harris as Aretha Franklin's 'Respect' played on the speakers.)\nWhile Biden talks about threats to democracy, Harris talks about 'freedom' under assault — a way of thinking that she said feels rooted in her life and in the lives of the voters she is after. It's the stories she used to tell about being taken to civil rights protests when she was in her stroller. It's showing up at the Cow Palace in San Francisco when she was district attorney to join the chants to close the 'gun show loophole' — as Biden did earlier this month in a new action to crack down on buyers at gun shows avoiding background checks.\n'I grew up the child of parents who fought for civil rights and freedoms,' she said, 'so this really does cut at the core for me around what's important about our country and what's at stake in the country.'\nMore often these days, she's invoking the 'prosecutor for president' framing that defined her own presidential campaign more than four years ago. She likes facts, she says. She likes using them to show she is right and has been right all along about what she says Trump is after.\n'The prosecutor approach is really about just deconstructing an issue,' she said. 'It's presenting and reminding folks about the empirical evidence that shows us exactly how we arrived at this point. … He can't hide from this stuff.'\nJust before coming on stage in Arizona, Harris and a few aides scrambled to add in a line to go right at what Trump had said minutes before — that the US Supreme Court's Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade is 'working the way it is supposed to.'\nDobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade is 'working the way it is supposed to.' 'Here's what a second Trump term looks like: More bans, more suffering and less freedom,' she told those gathered in Tucson, warning a national abortion ban and restrictions on abortion medications loom.\n'Shame! Shame! Shame!' the crowd started chanting.\nBy that evening, at a $1.5 million fundraiser in 'Family Guy' creator Seth MacFarlane's tree-filled living room in a Beverly Hills house with a 360-degree view of Los Angeles, and then in front of a luncheon for Black women in power the next day, she had started building that into a pursed lip, lowered voice Trump impression of her own, mocking the former president as saying, 'Well, you know, the states will do what they want to do.'\nDuring her own run for president, Harris was often derided as having no core and just chasing situational politics. By the end of the swing through Nevada, she was the one coming at Trump for being a weathervane on even the most fundamental issues of belief and politics.\n'It's not as though he has any real explanation. There's a lot of what he's doing that is just to suggest that he took a different tact,' she said of Trump's shifting arguments about whether and when to have abortion bans. 'There's a lot of benefit to being unburdened by ideology.'\nHarris' small staff has struggled since her inauguration to keep up with a scrutiny no previous vice president has faced, so even with the significantly stepped-up travel schedule these days, they have been grateful for help from new campaign hires in fielding press requests or just handling event logistics.\nFor the candidate herself, the shift has been more existential.\nBiden's personality fit the unstructured ambiguity of the modern vice presidency. He could be the presidential adviser, or the chummy cheerleader schmoozing hours after the conversations were scheduled to end.\nNot Harris. She likes a plan. She thrives with a goal. Left to her own, people who know her and were sometimes involved say she often let a small circle of friends and advisers into her head, getting into agonizing spirals of what else she should be doing, but also why she wasn't doing more, but also what would happen if she did try to do more.\nThree years of telling Harris she was supposed to establish herself led to more stress over what that could mean more than any actual progress.\n'It took me way longer than two years how to figure out how to be a good United States senator, and her job is a lot harder than mine,' said Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a longtime leader on the gun safety movement who has often talked about how engaged he has found Harris to be. 'There's no doubt she's better at the job today than she was in Year 1.'\nRunning for vice president has the definition that being vice president lacks. It's tactics, strategy, a target, a goal. Given a mission, aides have found Harris to be an extremely effective performance player, whether pressuring interest group leaders dragging their feet to support Biden or helping deliver the battlegrounds where she is shining more.\n'What business do we need to accomplish?' is a line Harris tends to use and that staff have learned to use themselves to prod her.\nWith Harris hyperaware of the filters she believes go over her every word and move, aides know better than to use the phrase 'attack dog' in a planning meeting with her. She won't risk being seen as an angry Black woman. She won't be the traditional running mate all-purpose battering ram.\nAt her first event in Las Vegas last week, Harris asked students to raise their hands if they were ever in an active shooter drill; dozens of hands went up. She told them about the blood stains on the floor and abandoned valentines still strewn around the preserved Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School she toured in Parkland, Florida, last month, and about a student from another school who confided that she didn't like going to fifth period because there was no closet in that room to hide in.\nHarris has a way of telling stories like these that spark audible reactions of shock and outrage from the crowd. She did it there, and again an hour later while talking about abortion, decrying how having no exception for rape is 'immoral,' resulting in a survivor of 'violence to their body — that they don't have the right to determine what happens to their body next.'\n'There's a certain level of authority that comes with having a uterus and being a woman,' said New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, praising how Harris has been leading the charge for the administration on reproductive rights.\n'They have the potential to tell a really interesting story and vision that connects with younger people, but there's a long way to go from here to there,' said John Della Volpe, a pollster who specializes in younger voters and is not affiliated with the reelection campaign. 'She can translate that in a more emotional and evocative way that resonates with young people.'\nFor Harris, it's at least the feeling, for the first time in a long time, of standing up and standing out on her own. These days, Trump campaign aides don't talk much about her, despite past Republicans' attempts to make her a liability for Biden. But she's eager to take on whoever Trump picks as his own running mate.\n'I am ready,' she threw down, 'for whoever has the, fill in the blank, to do it.'\nFor all the efforts, the campaign and Harris' own staff still aren't quite sure what people make of her. In the last few months, they invested in asking voters about her, including having the Democratic National Committee pay for focus groups in Milwaukee run by an operative who has long worked for her.\nThe bad news: Several people said Harris rubs them the wrong way, in all the ways that are familiar from criticism of her. A few specifically cited her laugh — a frequent target of Republican operatives who flood clips of it on social media, which defenders say plays into sexism.\nThe good news, as described to CNN by several people familiar with the findings: People said they would much rather hear from Harris than Biden on abortion, guns, student loans and Gaza.\nMultiple people asked said they didn't think Harris had been treated well. They questioned whether Biden actually likes her.\nHarris has internalized skepticism about campaign data — 'I give polls only so much credit,' she said in the interview — but around her, the responses were validation of years of grumbling that Biden should have been better setting up his heir apparent, and that perhaps they are now both in danger of paying the price.\nYet the rivalry still bubbles up. Some Biden aides greeted the findings with frustration, annoyed by the suggestion that the president will need to lean on her more. Questions about where Harris is more resonant immediately lead Biden aides to stress that they are complementary components of the campaign, and that the president, not her, is the one who can do things like go to Pittsburgh to propose new tariffs on Chinese steel.\nHarris has integrated so much into the work of the administration that Air Force Two sat on the tarmac for an hour recently, delaying a campaign-geared trip to North Carolina as she listened in on Biden's call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which she has done without public announcement throughout the Israel-Hamas war.\nBut in a March speech in Alabama, Harris called for 'an immediate ceasefire,' waited for applause, and only then added, 'for at least the next six weeks' to get the Israeli hostages out of Gaza. West Wing aides fumed both at the noticeable pause — even though the position was the same as Biden's — and at hearing that Harris' aides had alerted reporters ahead of time that they should watch the speech.\nLikewise, when CNN reported in February that Harris had been holding private meetings with top Democratic officials to discuss campaign strategy, top Biden aides spread word to several who attended that they had not realized these were happening.\n'There's so many ways in which they are able to complement one another and speak to our core audiences from different perspectives that reinforce who we are as a campaign and as an administration at this unique moment in time,' said Rodriguez, the Biden campaign manager.\nThe solution for Harris, aides believe, is exposure. Though many leading Democrats think she'd have a hard path to a future presidential nomination, aides believe they can at least boost her numbers by getting her out more.\nBut the day job still gets in the way. A long-anticipated appearance on Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show was postponed last week, according to people familiar, rather than risking a setback to being taken seriously by laughing it up on a comedy show in the midst of a crisis.\nWith under 200 days until the election, they are not sure when she will get back.\nShe's already scripted some bits, though.\nWhen MacFarlane asked her at the fundraiser who her favorite Trump is, she knew the question was coming. No purposeful pause this time.\n'Alec Baldwin,' she shot back.",

            "summary": "China has accused the United States of 'stoking military confrontation' with the recent deployment of a powerful missile launcher capable of firing weapons with a range of up to 1,600 kilometers to exercises in the Philippines.\nThe presence of the US Army's Mid-Range Capability (MRC) ground-based missile system increases the risks of 'misjudgment and miscalculation' in a region already on edge over Chinese-Philippine face-offs in the South China Sea, Beijing says.\nIt's the first-ever deployment of the MRC missile system, also known as the Typhon system, to the Indo-Pacific theater, and it comes amid a series of US-Philippine military exercises, including the largest-ever edition of the bilateral Balikatan exercises beginning Monday.\nThe US Army has not said how long the Typhon system will remain in the Philippines, but its involvement in the series of joint exercises between the two treaty allies, the first of which began on April 8, sends a signal the US can put offensive weaponry well within striking distance of Chinese installations in the South China Sea, the southern Chinese mainland and along the Taiwan Strait, analysts say.\nThe Typhon system is capable of firing the Standard Missile 6 (SM-6), a ballistic missile defense munition that can also target ships at sea at a range of 370 kilometers (230 miles), according to the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\nIt also can fire the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile, a maneuverable cruise missile with a range of 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles), according to the CSIS.\nDuring a regular news briefing last week, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian accused the US of seeking a 'unilateral military advantage,' and underscored Beijing's strong opposition to the deployment.\n'We urge the US to earnestly respect other countries' security concerns, stop stoking military confrontation, stop undermining peace and stability in the region, and take concrete actions to reduce strategic risks,' Lin said.\nThe US Army is calling the deployment, which began April 11 for the Salaknib exercise, a 'landmark' in its regional capability.\nThe apparent diplomatic fallout comes as attendees from 29 countries, including the commander of the US Pacific Fleet, attend a four-day Western Pacific Naval Symposium, which began in the eastern Chinese port city of Qingdao on Sunday.\nThe attendees will discuss 'maritime peace, maritime order based on maritime security cooperation and international laws, and global maritime governance,' according to Chinese state-run Xinhua news agency.\nThose are the same rules Washington and Manila accuse Beijing of ignoring with aggressive Chinese actions that have injured Filipino sailors and damaged vessels around disputed features in the South China Sea.\nThe 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines – the oldest such US pact in Asia-Pacific – stipulates both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party.\nIn brief comments to CNN on the sidelines of the gathering, US Adm. Stephen Koehler said: 'I think it's a great opportunity for all navies to get together and discuss all the issues.'\nAnalysts say the deployment of the Typhon missile battery is the first signal of US plans to address what has long been an advantage for Beijing in the region.\n'This in some way ‘equalizes' the prior situation where (Chinese) missiles have threatened US forces along the First Island Chain (which includes the northern Philippines, Japan and Taiwan), and even further eastward along the Second Island Chain centering on Guam,' said Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.\nA 2021 report for the US Army's professional journal Military Review puts the current missile advantage of the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) in stark terms.\n'The conventional arm of the PLARF is the largest ground-based missile force in the world, with over 2,200 conventionally armed ballistic and cruise missiles and with enough antiship missiles to attack every US surface combatant vessel in the South China Sea with enough firepower to overcome each ship's missile defense,' Army Maj. Christopher Milhal wrote.\nWhile the Typhon can't bring those kinds of numbers into play for US forces, its mobility represents a problem for Chinese mission planners — giving it important deterrent value, analysts say.\nIn announcing the Typhon deployment, the US military noted how the system was delivered to the Philippines via an 8,000-mile, 15-hour flight from Washington state by a US Air Force C-17 cargo jet.\nAnalysts don't expect the Typhon system to be permanently based in the Philippines, but Koh said the ability to move the batteries to a range of 'pre-surveyed launch sites' around the region on short notice increases their survivability and challenges relatively new and untested Chinese intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) and targeting capabilities.\nWhether the Typhon's likely temporary status mitigates the fallout remains unknown. but China has previously reacted furiously to missile deployments in what it sees as its backyard.\nWriting in the International Institute for Strategic Studies' Military Balance Blog, analyst Rupert Schulenberg noted that in 2016, when South Korea agreed to the deployment of a THAAD defensive missile system on the Korean Peninsula, 'Beijing responded with an unofficial economic boycott that cost South Korea's economy $7.5 billion in 2017 alone.'\nThe current deployment of the Typhon was something that would not have even been an option for the US military until 2019. Development of ground-launched missile systems of the type were banned under the 1987 Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty between the US and the Soviet Union.\nBut the US formally withdrew from the treaty in 2019, with then-President Donald Trump 'citing Russian noncompliance and concerns about China's intermediate-range missile arsenal.'\nMeanwhile, the US and the Philippines kicked-off the largest of their series of joint exercises Monday, with the three-week Balikatan drills — Tagalog for shoulder-to-shoulder — involving thousands of military personnel.\nA report from the official Philippine News Agency said Manila would use the exercises to showcase its military's most advanced systems, including a missile frigate, light fighter jets, close-combat support aircraft and Black Hawk helicopters.\nPhilippine officials previously indicated the naval portion of the exercise would for the first time extend beyond the 12-nautical-mile limit of Philippine waters — and into the country's exclusive economic zone, some 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers) from Philippine shores, though no exact route has been provided.\nIt will also include French naval participation in a group sail from Palawan Island, according to Philippine officials.\nPalawan, which sits between the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is about 200 kilometers from Second Thomas Shoal, a contested feature in the Spratly Islands that has been the site of a number of dangerous face-offs between Philippine and Chinese coast guard vessels, during which Philippine ships have been targeted with water cannons, injuring several Filipino sailors.\nCNN's Steven Jiang in Qingdao contributed to this report.\nCNN's Steven Jiang in Qingdao contributed to this report.",

Iran's attack on Israel this weekend only strengthens the case.\nWithdrawing the roughly 2,500 US troops that remain in Iraq to combat ISIS, which has been relegated to a low-level insurgency with a dwindling support base is a testy subject in Washington and Baghdad alike. In Iraq, Sudani is under pressure from his ruling Shia-led coalition to cut military ties with the US, which is still seen as an occupying power, or at the very least reorient the bilateral relationship from dependency to normality. Sudani has reportedly expressed his desire to keep US forces in the country for the foreseeable future to ensure ISIS doesn't resurge, a request his hardline coalition partners will be hard-pressed to support.\nAt the same time, a troop withdrawal is generally viewed warily in the US foreign policy establishment, particularly if it's based on a timetable rather than conditions on the ground. As the US ambassador in Iraq said last month, 'In the past we have left quickly only to come back, or only to need to continue, so this time I would argue we need to do this in an orderly fashion.'\nUnderstandably, the US is looking for an optimal scenario before pulling the plug on the US troop presence. But back in the real world, optimal scenarios are few and far between. If the Biden administration's approach is to wait for the perfect time to get out, then it will wait for eternity.\nIt's worth remembering why the United States sent troops to Iraq in the first place. In 2014, the Islamic State terrorist group was at its peak, ruling about 10 million people stretching tens of thousands of miles across parts of Iraq and Syria. The Iraqi security forces, rife with abuse, corruption and poor leadership, were falling apart. The Iraqi government at the time was led by Nouri al-Maliki, an increasingly autocratic figure who marginalized Iraq's Sunni minority. In June 2014 when ISIS took the city of Mosul, a predominately Sunni city, some of the its residents viewed the Iraqi army's route as a liberation. Others at the time saw ISIS as a better alternative to the Iraqi state.\nRelated article Opinion: US bombing strikes are sending the wrong message\nRelated article Opinion: US bombing strikes are sending the wrong message The US bombing campaign that began in August 2014 was designed to relieve the pressure on the Iraqi security forces and then eliminate the ISIS territorial caliphate. As President Barack Obama said at the time, 'You initially push them back, you systematically degrade their capabilities, you narrow their scope of action, you slowly shrink the space, the territory that they control, you take out their leadership, and over time, they are not able to conduct the same kinds of terrorist attacks that they once could.'\nThroughout the war, the US Air Force served as Iraq's hammer in the sky, striking ISIS compounds, killing its leaders and increasing the probability of successful Iraqi ground operations. ISIS' territorial caliphate shrank in 2015 and 2016 as the Iraqi army, Iraqi-backed militias and US special operations personnel successfully dislodged the terrorist group from multiple cities.\nBy the summer of 2017, ISIS lost control of Mosul. The Iraqi government declared victory against the group five months later. And in March 2019, ISIS was swept out of its last territorial stronghold in the Syrian town of Baghouz. The mission — eliminating ISIS' territorial caliphate — was achieved.\nThe United States, however, refused to take success for an answer. Instead of withdrawing, the Trump administration reportedly chose to stay in Iraq and Syria (where some 900 US troops are based) for reasons that were unrelated to the counter-ISIS mission, like undermining Iran's influence in Iraq, severing Iran's supply lines in Syria and using the US troop presence to prevent Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad from capturing Syria's oil-rich eastern region.\nRelated article Opinion: Why Iran hates America\nRelated article Opinion: Why Iran hates America Yet all of those objectives ranged from unlikely to delusional. In Iraq, the Iranians made significant inroads in Iraqi politics after the US overthrew the brutal Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein who nonetheless provided a bulwark against arch-rival Iran. In fact, Sudani relies on support from the Coordination Framework, a coalition of parties allied with Iranian-backed militias. Iran also has a secure, four decades' long alliance with Syria, where Assad's forces have regained most of the country courtesy of scorched-earth tactics, Russian air power and Iranian-backed ground forces. The notion the US could reduce Iranian influence there was always a heavy lift.\nThe Biden administration also deserves blame for broadening the net to a seemingly impossible ask: 'the enduring defeat of ISIS.' This proved to be a major error because it transformed the entire mission from one that could be measured — the territorial defeat of the ISIS caliphate — to one that couldn't.\nWhy does any of this matter? Because it shows how US policy is now governed mostly by fanciful goals.\nUS troops should be pulled out of Iraq and Syria now. As a State Department official remarked in March, 'ISIS has been defeated territorially and Iraqi forces are in a stronger position than ever to suppress the remaining threat.'\nISIS has alienated its previous Sunni support base, which has no intention of being subjugated by the jihadists a second time. ISIS has no friends on the ground and a lot of enemies; Turkey, Russia, Assad and Iraq all have a self-interest in ensuring ISIS doesn't regenerate. And just because Iran and Russia would like the US to leave the region doesn't mean Washington should stay. Doing so would amount to giving its adversaries a veto over foreign policy.\nSome may take issue with the notion that ISIS has been defeated. After all, the group is still planning and executing attacks as we saw most recently on March 21, when four gunmen claiming an affiliation with the Islamic State's branch in Afghanistan killed more than 140 people in a Moscow concert hall.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook But using the word 'defeated' in the terrorism context is a road to endless warfare. The world can't defeat terrorism any more than it can defeat bad weather. The best a country can do is monitor the threat, ensure it has the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance in place to detect an imminent plot and take measures to prevent it.\nThe US should withdraw for another reason: to eliminate, or at least reduce, the risk to US forces in the event of an Israeli counterstrike against Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has stated that Iran will pay a price for the more than 300 projectiles — drones and missiles included — Tehran is believed to have launched at Israeli territory. If Israel proceeds with a counterattack on Iranian soil, the prospects of Iranian retaliation against US bases in the region goes up. Far from removing US leverage, withdrawing would undermine Iran's.\nThe US doesn't need a perpetual ground presence to accomplish its objectives.",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — The Supreme Court will hear arguments Tuesday from a former Pennsylvania police officer who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in a case that could undermine federal charges against more than 350 rioters.\nThe court's decision could also have significant ramifications for former President Donald Trump, who was charged with the same criminal offense.\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith charged Trump with violating a federal law enacted in 2002 that prohibits people from obstructing an 'official proceeding.' Prosecutors filed that same charge against hundreds of rioters, such as the so-called 'QAnon Shaman,' who climbed the Senate chamber's dais in horned headdress, and the leader of the Oath Keepers, who had championed a 'bloody civil war' in the weeks before the riot.\nThe charge can add up to 20 years to a prison sentence.\nNow, the Supreme Court will consider whether the prosecutors' interpretation of the law can be used against the rioters and whether the convictions already secured will stick.\nTrump would almost certainly use a decision against the government to fuel criticism he has directed at prosecutors as he has tried to reframe the January 6 attack on the Capitol as a 'beautiful day.'\nfuel criticism he has directed at prosecutors as he has tried to reframe the January 6 attack on the Capitol as a 'beautiful day.' And that means the stakes are high not only for Trump and the January 6 defendants but also the Justice Department.\n'Any finding that the Justice Department has been charging improperly in any of these cases would be very politically damaging,' said Claire Finkelstein, a professor of law and philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School. 'This is a case in which we want our system as a whole to speak with a single voice and weigh in on the side of rule of law.'\nThe high court will hear arguments in Fischer v. US on the second day of Trump's trial in New York on separate state charges that he falsified business records to hide the reimbursement of hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. (Trump has pleaded not guilty in that case, and he has tried to brand all the criminal charges against him as motivated by politics.)\nFischer v. US on the second day of Trump's trial in New York on separate state charges that he falsified business records to hide the reimbursement of hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. (Trump has pleaded not guilty in that case, and he has tried to brand all the criminal charges against him as motivated by politics.) The charge at issue in the Supreme Court case stems from a law Congress enacted in response to a series of corporate accounting scandals, including the 2001 Enron debacle. That law makes it a felony to 'corruptly' alter, destroy or mutilate a record with the intent of making it unavailable for use in an 'official proceeding,' or to 'otherwise' obstruct, influence, or impede such a proceeding.\nProsecutors say the charge should apply to the January 6 cases because the plain meaning of the words 'obstruct' an 'official proceeding' should cover the attack that interrupted Congress' counting of ballots to certify President Joe Biden's win in the 2020 election.\nCritics counter that the law was intended to prevent evidence tampering before a trial or investigation.\nThough Trump is not a party in the case, the appeal has indirectly thrust him onto the Supreme Court's docket for the third time this election year. In March, the justices unanimously ruled that the former president would appear on the ballot in Colorado despite claims he violated the 14th Amendment's 'insurrectionist ban' because of his actions on January 6.\nNext week the court will hear arguments on Trump's explosive claim that he is entitled to immunity from the special counsel's federal election subversion case, including the obstruction charge.\nelection subversion case, including the obstruction charge. Joseph Fischer, a former Pennsylvania police officer who brought the case to the Supreme Court, told the justices that by the time he arrived at the Capitol on January 6, Congress had already recessed. His lawyers said Fischer spent less than four minutes inside the building and that he advanced fewer than 25 feet.\nProsecutors paint a different picture. They say Fischer warned his police chief by text that the day might get violent. He texted that protestors should drag Democrats 'into the street and have a mob trial.' Fischer captured a video on his own cell phone in which he can be heard yelling 'charge!' before he ran into the Capitol, prosecutors say.\nA grand jury returned a seven-count indictment against Fischer weeks after the attack that included charges of civil disorder; assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers as well as the obstruction charge. The case before the Supreme Court involves only that last charge.\nThe US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit combined Fischer's case with two others and ruled that the charge could be used against January 6 defendants – siding with 14 of 15 district court judges who ruled the same way. All three defendants appealed to the Supreme Court, but the justices granted only Fischer's case. The other two are pending and will likely be summarily resolved after Fischer.\nYet the political ramifications are potentially enormous.\nExactly how much impact the court's ruling may have on other January 6 cases is unclear. Most defendants who were convicted of the obstruction charge and sentenced to prison were also convicted of additional felony or misdemeanor charges, according to a CNN analysis. The average sentence in those cases was just over four years, the analysis shows – far less than the 20-year maximum the obstruction count carries.\n'A Fischer win would not be a revolutionary blow to the DOJ's Capitol riot cases, but would be a stinging reminder that improbably broad interpretations of criminal statutes will not be tolerated,' said Nicholas Smith, who represented the defendants before the DC Circuit.\nTrump would almost certainly use a win for Fischer to try to further undermine the Justice Department. Depending on how the court rules, he might also attempt to have that charge thrown out in his own case.\nThe special counsel appears eager to head that argument off.\nIn a filing last week at the Supreme Court in Trump's immunity case, Smith argued the obstruction charge should stick against Trump even if Fischer wins. In a footnote, Smith pointed out that Trump's charge is based on the fake slate of electors he attempted to have submitted to Congress.\n'The Trump charges probably survive almost no matter what the court does in Fischer,' said Randall Eliason, a former federal prosecutor and George Washington University law professor.\nProgressive groups have called on Justice Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from cases involving January 6 because his wife, conservative activist Ginni Thomas, acknowledged she attended Trump's rally at the White House before the attack. Text messages reviewed by a congressional committee also showed that Ginni Thomas repeatedly texted senior officials inside the White House after the election to offer her support.\nThomas has largely ignored those requests.\nFischer relies heavily on a 2015 precedent from a deeply fractured Supreme Court that centered on a commercial fisherman who was caught with undersized red grouper on his boat . The fisherman had ordered the offending fish to be tossed overboard before authorities could confirm he had violated federal fishing regulations.\nfisherman who was caught with undersized red grouper on his boat. The fisherman had ordered the offending fish to be tossed overboard before authorities could confirm he had violated federal fishing regulations. The fisherman was convicted of a related crime that prohibits people from altering or destroying 'any record, document, or tangible object' with the intent to obstruct an investigation. The government argued the fish fell within the definition of 'tangible object.'\nBut a 5-4 majority of the Supreme Court that included Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the leader of the court's liberal wing at the time, and Justice Samuel Alito, a stalwart conservative, disagreed. Viewed in context, a plurality of the court reasoned, a 'tangible object' included items 'used to record or preserve information,' like a document – not a fish.\nFischer told the Supreme Court that context and history of the law at issue in the January 6 prosecutions is just as clear. It was meant to apply, his attorneys argue, to efforts to tamper with evidence, not to charge people involved in a riot.\nBut that interpretation has drawn considerable pushback from the government and some outside experts. The way the law at issue in the January 6 charges is written is different from how it looks in the earlier case.\nThe section on 'obstruction' is more separated, which the Justice Department argues suggests Congress intended to lay down a broad prohibition on disrupting congressional proceedings.\nEliason thinks the earlier decision about the undersized fish will probably ultimately work to the government's benefit. Among those who joined the dissent in the fisherman case was the late Justice Antonin Scalia, a leader of the widely accepted notion of interpreting the law based on its words rather than its legislative history or other factors.\n'If they're being consistent, at least two out of the three Trump justices ought to vote against Fischer's positions,' Eliason said. 'The ambiguity is not there. It's a broad statute, but it's not unclear.'",

            "summary": "The New York judge overseeing Donald Trump's hush money trial will take center stage in the case Monday with jury selection kicking off in the historic criminal prosecution of the former president.\nNew York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan is a seasoned jurist who is no stranger to Trump's orbit. He has presided over the Trump Organization tax fraud trial, sentenced the former president's close confidant Allen Weisselberg to prison over his role in the scheme and overseen former Trump adviser Steve Bannon's criminal fraud case.\nBut it's the former president's trial on charges that he illegally falsified business records over the reimbursement of hush money payments made before the 2016 election that will leave a lasting mark on Merchan's long career atop the state-level trial court.\nAll eyes will be on the judge as he oversees the first trial Trump has in the four criminal cases brought against him by state and federal prosecutors last year. The presumptive Republican nominee has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\nMerchan has been described by observers as a 'tough' judge, yet one who is fair, no matter who is before him.\nHere's what you need to know.\nTrump's trial is likely to be a spectacle with wall-to-wall media coverage and a show of law enforcement to provide protection to the former president as he attends the proceedings, which are expected to last several weeks. In the lead-up to the start of the trial, Trump fanned the flames on social media with his views on the judge.\nBut in the courthouse, Merchan does not stand for disruptions or delays, attorneys who have appeared before him previously told CNN, and he's known to maintain control of his courtroom even when his cases draw considerable attention.\n'Judge Merchan was efficient, practical, and listened carefully to what I had to say,' Nicholas Gravante, the attorney who represented Weisselberg in his plea in the tax fraud case, said last year.\n'He was clear in signaling his judicial inclinations, which helped me tremendously in giving Mr. Weisselberg informed legal advice,' Gravante said. 'Judge Merchan was always well-prepared, accessible, and – most importantly in the Weisselberg matter – a man of his word. He treated me and my colleagues with the utmost respect, both in open court and behind closed doors.'\nThat sentiment was echoed by Karen Friedman Agnifilo, a private practice attorney who previously worked as a prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, supervising cases Merchan presided over.\n'[Merchan] doesn't let the prosecutors or the defendants create any issues in his courtroom. He doesn't let a media circus or any other kind of circus happen. I don't think Donald Trump attacking him and threatening him is going to bode very well for him in the courtroom,' Agnifilo, who is also a CNN legal analyst, said last year before Trump was arraigned in the hush money case.\nMerchan has attempted to get out ahead of any potential issues created by Trump during the trial by issuing a gag order against the former president in recent weeks. The order, which bars Trump from publicly commenting on witnesses and the staff of the court and district attorney, was later broadened by Merchan to cover the judge's own family after Trump went after his daughter on social media.\n'It is no longer just a mere possibility or a reasonable likelihood that there exists a threat to the integrity of the judicial proceedings. The threat is very real. Admonitions are not enough, nor is reliance on self-restraint,' Merchan wrote in his ruling expanding the gag order.\nTrump is appealing the gag order, a move that is part of his broader effort to delay the hush money trial.\nMerchan and other judges in the state have so far rejected Trump's various bids to delay the trial, though Merchan did postpone the trial's start date last month after a late production of discovery documents.\nTrump has a long history of attacking people involved in his criminal and civil cases, including the judges overseeing them.\nMerchan is no exception.\nLast month, the former president described him as a 'certified Trump hater' on his Truth Social platform and went on to single out the judge's daughter, Loren Merchan, over her Democratic ties in an attack that led the judge to expand the gag order.\nIn focusing on Loren Merchan, Trump has said that she is a senior executive at 'a Super Liberal Democrat firm' that has worked with top Democrats, including President Joe Biden. The former president pushed the discredited claims that Loren Merchan posted an incendiary image of the former president behind bars on her social media account – an account that the court said didn't even belong to her.\nTrump also claimed Judge Merchan has ruled against him in pretrial motions 'because his daughter makes money by working to ‘Get Trump.''\nLoren Merchan has not commented publicly on the case.\nThough it's true that Loren Merchan has served as president of Authentic Campaigns, a firm that does digital campaign work like online fundraising, mobile messaging and web design, the firm has scrubbed references to her on its site, and it's difficult to directly link Authentic to specific political ads. Still, the firm works for campaigns that have disparaged Trump, including for being charged with crimes.\nLast year, Merchan rejected a request by Trump for the judge to recuse himself from the case due to his daughter's work. He wrote in his order that the court 'has examined its conscience and is certain in its ability to be fair and impartial.'\nTrump is challenging the judge's decision to not step away from the case.\nMerchan showed some of his tough side when Weisselberg was sentenced in 2023, telling the former Trump associate that if he had not already promised him a five-month sentence, he would have handed him a 'much greater' sentence after having listened to evidence at trial.\nWhen he presided over Bannon's criminal fraud case, Merchan chastised the former Trump aide's new team of attorneys for delaying the case when they asked for more time to review new evidence.\nIn addition to the Trump cases, Merchan has also presided over other high-profile cases, including the 'soccer mom madam' trial, in which he set a $2 million bond for suburban mom Anna Gristina, who was charged with running a $2,000-an-hour escort service for the wealthy, Bloomberg News reported.\nMerchan also handed a 25-years-to-life sentence to a Senegalese man who raped and murdered his girlfriend.\nThen-Trump attorney Timothy Parlatore said during an interview on CNN last year that Merchan was 'not easy' on him when he tried a case before him, but echoed that the judge likely will be fair.\n'I've tried a case in front of him before. He could be tough. I don't think it's necessarily going to be something that's going to change his ability to evaluate the facts and the law in this case,' Parlatore said.\nMerchan, however, is also credited by his peers for having helped create the Manhattan Mental Health Court, which he often presides over and where he has earned a reputation for 'compassionate' rulings that give defendants second chances.\n'I watched a colleague of mine try a shooting case where someone got shot, so he's able to try those very serious violent crimes and then switch,' Brendan Tracy, a criminal defense attorney who previously served as an assistant district attorney in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, told CNN last year.\n'Maybe someone who was a serial shoplifter and then charged with grand larceny and is in mental health treatment court because they had mental health issues, he was able to handle the wide range of cases and do them all fairly,' Tracy added.\nStill, Earl Ward, a trial attorney and chair of public defender nonprofit The Bronx Defenders, said that having watched Merchan preside over cases in the Mental Health Court, the judge often sided with prosecutors.\n'He's fair and his rulings are consistent with the law, but if it's a close call, his reputation is that he lands on the prosecution's side,' Ward previously told CNN.\nMerchan launched his legal career in 1994 when he started off as an assistant district attorney in the trial division in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. Several years later, he moved on to the state attorney general's office, where he worked on cases in Long Island.\nIn 2006, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, then a Republican, appointed Merchan to Family Court in the Bronx, and Democratic Gov. David Paterson appointed him to the New York State Court of Claims in 2009, the same year he began serving as an acting New York Supreme Court judge.\nBorn in Bogotá, Colombia, Merchan emigrated to the United States at the age of 6 and grew up in the New York City neighborhood of Jackson Heights, Queens, according to a New York Times profile of the judge. He was the first in his family to go to college.\nMerchan initially studied business at Baruch College in New York before he dropped out of school to work, only to return several years later to finish school so that he could get his law degree, the Times reported.\nHe eventually received his law degree from Hofstra University.\nSydney Kashiwagi and CNN's Marshall Cohen, Kara Scannell, Lauren del Valle and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.",

CNN —\nCNN — Friday's midnight release of 'The Tortured Poets Department,' Taylor Swift's 11th album, means that yet another era has begun — and a record-breaking one at that. Swifties, who are now more than familiar with football jargon (at least when it comes to Kansas City Chiefs' tight end Travis Kelce, Taylor's beau) can finally put away the grill and the drinks, lock the car, and leave the parking lot for the stadium. The tailgate is over: it's game on for Taylor Nation.\nI am one of them, and the anticipation — along with the revelry — has been an extended family affair.\nHaving secured tickets to an epic night of the Eras tour last spring at Gillette Stadium, my daughter Hannah and I made a pilgrimage from New York to attend the show with my lifelong best friend Sarah and her daughter Maggie . We were two moms with decades of concerts — from Def Leppard to U2 to Lizzo — under our belts, and our teen daughters, with whom we have danced to the likes of Harry Styles, Olivia Rodrigo and SZA.\n. We were two moms with decades of concerts — from Def Leppard to U2 to Lizzo — under our belts, and our teen daughters, with whom we have danced to the likes of Harry Styles, Olivia Rodrigo and SZA. The thing is, after that night at Gillette, I thought we were on the other side of Swift mania for a while. I was wrong. When more dates were announced, Maggie somehow got a code and purchased four seats for us in … are you ready for it?\nVancouver. A mere 2,500 miles away.\nThe seats are terrible, Sarah told me. It would be ridiculous to do this, we reasoned. I was very close to getting Hannah to agree it was too much. But Maggie was not to be dissuaded — and Sarah and I realized this might be the last great thing we do before these girls of ours leave our houses and head to college, to jobs and to lives that will be even more of their own than they are now.\nWe are not alone in this. The broader Swiftie community serves as a connector for all kinds of relationships, from best friends to parents and kids, creating a landscape for communication, bonding and the rites of passage that can be so difficult, perhaps especially for teenage girls like our daughters.\nAn absurdly brief trip to Vancouver via — literally — planes, trains, and an automobile was set. All things Swiftie, then, were settled. Or so we thought, until February.\nThat's when Swift, at the Grammys no less (where she won a historic fourth Album of the Year award for 'Midnights'), announced 'The Tortured Poets Department' would be coming on April 19. In the days leading up to the big night, Swifties speculated that the artist would reveal the long-awaited re-release of 'Reputation , ' her sixth album, which many felt would be the next 'Taylor's Version,' a series of re-recordings that allowed her to regain rights to her material after Big Machine, her original record company, sold her masters.\n, ' her sixth album, which many felt would be the next 'Taylor's Version,' a series of re-recordings that allowed her to regain rights to her material after Big Machine, her original record company, sold her masters. Swifties dug into Taylor math, which often revolves around the number 13, the date of her December birthday. Indeed, 13 days before the Grammys, her friends, including Kelce, had changed their profile pictures on social media to black and white, the colors of 'Reputation.' She showed up on the Grammys' red carpet in a white dress with black accents. Her website went down, replaced by a black screen and seemingly meaningless words in white, including 'Error 321' and 'DPT:321' and 'hneriergrd,' which Swifties unscrambled as 'red herring.'\nThe speculation was overwhelming: A fax error? A countdown? A blind alley? No. It was the new album. With a smile and what looked like a peace sign, she left the stage, the album's cover immediately going up on her Instagram site.\nThe pregame anticipation on this one has been intense, starting with how and when she recorded this, her fourth album in four years, while prepping and executing the highest-grossing concert tour of all time. Her work ethic makes the rest of us mere mortals feel inadequate at best. She writes, like Lin-Manuel Miranda's Alexander Hamilton, as if she is running out of time.\nBut the bigger question was what — who — this record was about, and all paths led to the 2023 end of her six-year relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn.\nThe easiest clue, of course, is the title itself, a seemingly savage take on Alwyn's WhatsApp chat with his friends entitled 'The Tortured Man Club.' The release date, too, holds value. While fans locate Swift's split from Alwyn to be anywhere from February to early April, 2023, it was on April 19 that she went to dinner with friends Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, who subsequently unfollowed Alwyn on social media. The date also, of course, marks the anniversary of the split of the 13 American colonies (13, don't forget) from Great Britain in 1775 with the Battle of Lexington and Concord, starting a war against a perceived tyranny that would end in independence for the oppressed.\nAn album about liberation? Freedom? Separation? A break from … a British boyfriend? A date chosen because 256 days remain in the year, and if you add those numbers up you get 13?\nWhen the track list emerged, all eyes went to track five, which is where Swift has always located her heart, producing gut-wrenching tracks such as 'Dear John' on 'Speak Now,' 'My Tears Ricochet' on 'Folklore' and the epic 'All Too Well' on 'Red,' which allegedly details in excruciating detail her breakup with actor Jake Gyllenhaal.\nThis time around, we have 'So Long, London,' cowritten with The National's Aaron Dessner, whose last track five with Swift was on 'Evermore,' the devastating 'Tolerate It.'\nSo, what has my cohort of Swifties made of all this? My best friend's daughter, the teen I thought might be done with all this for a while (as we wait for Vancouver), might actually be the Swiftie of all Swifties, a Taylor archivist of sorts (with a brother who was born on … December 13). Where does all of this fit, I asked her — what's the long game?\nRelated article Why young people are throwing PowerPoint parties\nRelated article Why young people are throwing PowerPoint parties In true Gen Z fashion, she responded a few hours later with an extensive, masterful, complex slide deck presentation that would undoubtedly nab her an A in Harvard's Taylor course. She contextualized the theories — some rational, some out there, but all relevant because in Swiftie world, nothing is coincidence and everything is intentional — and concluded that this was, indeed, Swift's first 'break-up' record since 'Red' (see Gyllenhaal).\nSuddenly 'You're Losing Me,' a bonus track from 'Midnights,' which is about the things that keep you up at night, seemed like a precursor, a song about the beginning of an end, especially when longtime collaborator Jack Antonoff referred to recording the song back in 2021. More clues came when a pale gray and pink 'Pop-Up Library' exhibit sponsored by Spotify went up at The Grove in Los Angeles, seemingly a poetry library filled with Swift's manuscripts.\nIt's one thing to be a puzzle to your fans — it's entirely another to make a puzzle for your fans. Swift has created music's version of 'I Spy' novels for this generation, encoding notes in her lyrics, creating everything from complex numerologies to word searches. The relentless hunt for Easter eggs across social media suddenly took physical form in this exhibit: from the 72 (the number of months Swift was with Alwyn) card catalogue drawers, six (the number of years Swift was with Alwyn) of which are open and filled with lace and dead flowers to a bust of the goddess Diana, the original statue crumbled on its way to London in the 6th century because of neglect. 'Even statues crumble,' Swift's TTPD billboard says in New York's Times Square, 'if they're made to wait.'\nRelated article Why everyone is crying to Taylor's breakup songs\nRelated article Why everyone is crying to Taylor's breakup songs When it was finally midnight, game time, all members of my own Swiftie family were in our own homes listening to the same thing, track by track, unpacking words and music, texting thoughts and questions (Who is Dylan Thomas? My name is in a song! My name is too!). I went to track five first, which everyone else found to be heresy. But it confirmed an awful lot of what everyone suspected: Swift's voice at its most vulnerable with the words 'And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free.'\nWas it about Alwyn? Yes. Was it about other things, including (especially?) Matty Healy? Also, yes. Is 'The Alchemy' about Kelce? Oh my. Yeah. Maybe. Probably.\nAs we continued to listen — and yes, Friday's a school/work day but who needs sleep??!! — alongside all of the Swifties posting emotional selfies and TikToks with their hands slapped over their mouths in awe, shouty caps pronouncing their love for this track or that, we found (we thought) answers to many questions, and had new questions that needed answers.\nThis record is as messy as it is emotional. It felt like the initial speculation all those months ago were somewhat vindicated. Perhaps what we thought were peace signs — from Swift's gesture at the Grammys to a sculpture in The Grove exhibit — were actually twos.\nIn many ways, 'Reputation' and 'TTPD' felt like two sides of the same relationship, their inverted black and white color schemes creating a yin and a yang, and while the first contains her first love songs to Alwyn — from 'Delicate' to 'Gorgeous' — the latter creates needed closure, maturity even.\nand 'TTPD' felt like two sides of the same relationship, their inverted black and white color schemes creating a yin and a yang, and while the first contains her first love songs to Alwyn — from 'Delicate' to 'Gorgeous' — the latter creates needed closure, maturity even.

Two albums, not one. 31 tracks. And yes, 31 is 13 backwards and that, too, is no accident. Check out the erratic capitalization of track 24, 'Thank you Aimee' if you doubt that Swift is masterminding it all. For my merry band of Swifties, there are no accidents. Just puzzles to gleefully solve, together, for as long as we can.\n'Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it,' Swift wrote on X (formerly Twitter) just after midnight. 'And then all that's left behind is the tortured poetry.' For my group of four, what is left to ponder as we continue to digest this record, together, in the coming months is what might be our last concert road trip, our last stab at a mother-daughter journey. Maybe wherever they land, there is a seminar on Taylor Swift. Then maybe we can study for the final exam together.",

            "excerpt": "Summer Lee is getting used to this.",
            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — Summer Lee is getting used to this.\nThe freshman congresswoman from Western Pennsylvania ousted regional political royalty on her way to the state House in 2018, then overcame millions in outside spending, nearly all of it from pro-Israel groups, to win the Democratic nomination and her seat in Congress two years ago. This time out, in her first House reelection bid, Republican megadonor Jeffrey Yass is bankrolling a super PAC attacking Lee and boosting her primary challenger, Edgewood Councilmember Bhavini Patel.\nIn an interview, Lee told CNN she had been 'bracing for this moment' since her last run and trusted that her consistency, as a candidate and on the major issues, would see her through to another term.\n'I put out there who I am because I am a very honest politician,' Lee said. 'I'm not obfuscating, I'm not obscuring parts of me. I'm not hiding one hand when I campaign. I'm telling people precisely what my values are.'\nLee is, indeed, widely considered the prohibitive favorite in Tuesday's Democratic primary. In addition to left-wing groups and leaders, such as New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who will campaign with her this weekend, Lee has the support of both commonwealth senators, Bob Casey, who's also up for reelection this year, and John Fetterman. Her top local allies include Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey and Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato, a friend who, like Lee, won her first race in 2018 for the state legislature against a well-known incumbent. The first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania, Lee has also cultivated a working relationship with the White House – President Joe Biden made a point of shouting her out last week during a campaign stop in Pittsburgh.\nBut the race for the Democratic nomination in Pennsylvania's 12th District is as notable for the people and groups that are largely sitting it out as those more deeply involved.\nIn 2022, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and its affiliated super PAC, United Democracy Project, along with Democratic Majority for Israel, spent remarkable sums – for a primary in a safe blue district – attempting to block Lee's path to what was an open seat. This time around, despite AIPAC and DMFI both promising to invest heavily in defeating candidates they deem insufficiently pro-Israel, the groups have been absent from the district's airwaves.\nTheir decision to effectively skip the contest, which many progressives expected to be a priority for pro-Israel groups, has frustrated some moderates upset by Lee's position on Israel's war in Gaza. (She called early on for a ceasefire and supports conditioning US military aid to Israel.) But pro-Israel political groups, according to multiple sources familiar with their thinking, ultimately backed off over concerns about Patel's low profile and Lee's strong polling. Lee's support for most of Biden's domestic agenda and willingness to occasionally work across party lines also played a role, they said, along with a grudging acknowledgement that she has proven sensitive to some of their concerns.\n'She's been forced to make some compromises. Certainly not as many as we would like, but some compromises with the pro-Israel community,' one pro-Israel strategist told CNN, noting Lee canceled an appearance at a fundraiser for the Council on American-Islamic Relations amid criticism of other scheduled speakers.\nAsked about their decision to stay on the sidelines in Pennsylvania, AIPAC spokesperson Marshall Wittmann did not specifically address the campaign in the 12th, though he promised robust involvement in other races. A United Democracy Project spokesperson declined to comment.\n'We are already involved in several races, and we will be engaged in additional campaigns where we can have the greatest impact,' Wittmann said. 'By the end of this election year, the voice of the pro-Israel movement will definitely be heard.'\nThe issue has particular resonance, though, in the Pittsburgh area, home to both a large Jewish community and the country's deadliest antisemitic attack, when a gunman in 2018 killed 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue. Those anxieties spiked again after Hamas' brutal October 7 raid into Israel. Patel criticized Lee's immediate response to the attack, accusing her opponent of going AWOL.\n'You know what I would be doing after October 7? I would've come straight back home; I would've been present in my community,' Patel said. 'There were rallies and visuals that were organized here at home. She was nowhere to be found.'\nLee called that claim an 'intentional mischaracterization' of her work.\n'There's a difference between campaigning and being actually present. And the reality is that she's campaigning right now,' Lee said of Patel. 'The assertion that we weren't present or that we did not do our due diligence to earnestly represent them is a mischaracterization. And she knows that we've done that.'\nMark Mellman, the founder of Democratic Majority for Israel, which spent big against Lee alongside AIPAC two years ago, doubled down on his past criticism, but also acknowledged Lee's strength as a candidate.\n'Summer Lee's always been a very talented politician, but she has clearly demonstrated herself to be opposed to a strong US-Israel relationship,' Mellman told CNN. 'There's no question about that either.'\nDespite some of the usual suspects choosing not to spend, Patel's campaign, which kicked off days before Hamas' October 7 attack, has not struggled for cash. She raised more than $300,000 in the last quarter of 2023 – a decent figure for such a little-known candidate. Lee pulled in roughly $1 million over the same period and nearly $2.3 million for the cycle. Patel's overall reported haul is about $600,000, though she entered the race with a shorter runway.\nBoth candidates are also enjoying significant air cover from outside groups – though the sources of those funds are very different. A coalition of progressive groups – led by the Working Families Party, along with Emgage PAC and Justice Democrats – have put more than $600,000 into the race on Lee's behalf. Patel's outside support has largely come from one very rich and, in most Democratic circles, unpopular individual: Yass, the GOP billionaire with close ties to former and potentially future President Donald Trump.\nThe Pennsylvania-based co-founder of Susquehanna International Group, Yass has already spent millions this election cycle. But his support for a Democrat, Patel, has garnered the most attention – at least for now – in large part because he effectively uses Moderate PAC, which has invested more than $600,000 in opposing Lee, to press his interests.\n'This being a ‘D +8 district,' we saw the potential for a Republican to come steal the seat,' Moderate PAC President Ty Strong told CNN. 'So our calculus was trying to get a more moderate Democrat, that represents the district, in that seat before we lose the seat. And before she does any more things that go against the wishes and the outlook of the people she represents.'\nPatel has denounced Yass and Trump. In an interview with CNN, she insisted she has never sought Yass' support and, ultimately, believes it has benefited Lee.\n'I have zero control over outside spending in this race,' Patel said. 'And I think any sort of conversation that takes away from my opponent's voting record and her inability to actually represent the values of this region, I think, again, is just deflecting.'\nPatel's campaign enjoys a decent amount of local Democratic support, though none with the ability to make headlines – or provoke liberal anger – like Yass, whose involvement also soured some pro-Israel groups on the race.\n'To go in as a well-known, right-wing Republican billionaire with a personal PAC and try and affect this race, frankly, taints everybody who might be interested in helping Patel and defeating Summer Lee,' the pro-Israel strategist said.\nAsked why he thought the pro-Israel groups were not joining his cause, Strong, the Moderate PAC leader, said Patel's lack of name recognition and internal polling numbers 'scared a lot of people away,' particularly those who 'did not want to give (Lee) another feather in the cap.'\n'If someone had more name recognition or was a staffer in the White House or had a little bit more of a history in the Democratic Party, if there was a picture of Patel standing next to Joe Biden, I think she would've gotten a lot farther,' Strong said of the challenger, adding that the PAC was still able to 'move the needle' by criticizing Lee's record and offering an alternative.\nLee and her supporters view the story differently – and often argue that, even without spending big, the specter of AIPAC's involvement can change the fundamentals of a campaign.\n'Whether or not AIPAC or someone like them gets in your race, it's destabilizing,' Lee said. 'It makes candidates think differently about how they're going to run and who they're serving, whose values they're going to represent.'\nIn the final days of the race, Lee's campaign and its allies are trying to steer the focus to her performance on Capitol Hill, most notably the significant federal funds she's helped bring to the district.\n'Progressives are often accused of having these lofty values that they can't actualize. And I think Summer, along with the rest of ‘The Squad,' has proven in this first race that they can do exactly that,' said Justice Democrats spokesperson Usamah Andrabi. 'A billion dollars in (to the district) in one Congress is an insane amount of money, and it's actually being delivered to the people and communities who need it.'\nProgressive leaders and other Lee allies are also keen to argue that, come November, it is Lee supporters Biden needs to turn out in big numbers to defeat Trump in this crucial, potentially decisive, battleground state.\n'President Biden needs to win Summer Lee voters. He needs to win progressives,' Andrabi said. 'And Western Pennsylvania is a progressive stronghold now.'\nPatel, for her part, argues that Lee is poised to be a drag on Biden in the general election. She pointed to what she described as Lee's 'performative obstructionism' in the House, where Lee has occasionally bucked Democratic leadership, and the congresswoman's support for an 'uncommitted' primary write-in campaign led by progressives critical of the administration's handling of Israel's war in Gaza – hoping to send a message to Biden that their votes should not be taken for granted.\n'When you look at the bigger picture and the alternative is Donald Trump, that's incredibly dangerous because our basic freedoms depend on getting President Biden reelected,' Patel said of Lee's alliance with the 'uncommitted' movement. 'If you claim to care about reproductive justice, LGBTQ rights, labor rights, then that means that you have to unequivocally be behind Biden because there is no other alternative to that.'\nModerate PAC echoed those criticisms in a recent television ad, which claimed that Lee 'is opposing President Biden' and, in a reprise of the 2022 campaign, highlighted a years-old tweet criticizing then-candidate Biden.\nFor her part, Lee insists she is confident the attacks will fall flat.\n'We're hearing (in the ads) from a very vocal minority,' she said, 'and we are representing a very resolute majority.'",

Burgundy rubber tree boasts the best leaf color when it receives bright indirect light (near an east-, west- or south-facing window). It tolerates low light, but the deep-green leaf hue will fade.\nIt's easy to overwater rubber tree, so wait to water until the top 3 to 4 inches of soil are dry to the touch.

Choose this plant for its easy-care nature and you'll also enjoy its air purifying abilities.\nThe name may be a mouthful, but it's worth learning if you want to add some color to your houseplant collection. The common name is ‘Triostar' stromanthe, although this beauty is often sold as Tricolor stromanthe. It's a relative to the prayer plant (Calathea) , so-called because the colorful leaves fold up at night like hands folded for bedtime prayers. In this folded position, leaves show off pink to maroon undersides.\n(Calathea) , so-called because the colorful leaves fold up at night like hands folded for bedtime prayers. In this folded position, leaves show off pink to maroon undersides. During the day, the variegated leaves lay flat, displaying shades of green, white and pink. Variegation shifts with exposure to sunlight. Brighter light favors a colorful leaf, while low light yields less brilliantly hued foliage. Stromanthe is more of a shrub size, typically growing 18 to 30 inches tall indoors. But place it on a tall plant stand and it can create the vertical interest of an indoor tree.\nThe trickiest part of growing stromanthe relates to humidity. This exotic beauty prefers high humidity, which is difficult to achieve in winter's dry indoor air. Leaf edges turn brown when humidity is too low. Remedy this by running a humidifier.\nFew indoor trees are more beloved than a classic palm-like bamboo palm (Chamaedorea seifrizii) . This indoor tree checks all the boxes: It unfurls lavish leaves, purifies the air, is undemanding and doesn't require bright light. In fact, although it grows well near a bright window, it also thrives in the lower light of a north-facing exposure.\n(Chamaedorea seifrizii) . This indoor tree checks all the boxes: It unfurls lavish leaves, purifies the air, is undemanding and doesn't require bright light. In fact, although it grows well near a bright window, it also thrives in the lower light of a north-facing exposure. Bamboo palm is rugged and has few problems. It grows 3 to 8 feet indoors and as wide as the pot will let it. The plant sends up multiple stems, filling a pot to form a grove of greenery. This tropical beauty needs constant moisture, so water it regularly. To avoid overwatering, add orchid bark to a commercial potting mix to provide good drainage for roots.\nIf pruning is necessary to remove a too-tall or wayward stem, cut stems where they emerge from soil. This palm doesn't produce new shoots from the middle of a stem.\nFor head-turning good looks, grace your home with a braided-trunk money tree (Pachira aquatica) . This striking tree is a feng shui prize, bringing good fortune and positive energy into the place where it grows, or so the legend goes.\nbraided-trunk money tree (Pachira aquatica) . This striking tree is a feng shui prize, bringing good fortune and positive energy into the place where it grows, or so the legend goes. Place money tree in a spot with bright, indirect light (near an east-, west- or south-facing window). Avoid positioning the plant directly in front of a window, because too much sunlight can scorch leaves, creating brown patches. As the name suggests, money tree grows as a tree, reaching 3 to 6 feet tall indoors.\nMoney tree prefers soil on the moist side, but don't take that as an invitation to water liberally and frequently. Instead, let the soil dry for an inch or two before you water again. Blend extra perlite into your potting mix to keep soil draining well. Money tree is undemanding in terms of care and has few problems. If leaves turn yellow, the plant might need more light or may be overwatered. Brown and crispy leaves signal too-low humidity.\nThis striking plant is more of a shrub than an indoor tree, but its unusual leaf form and glossy leaves make it a solid choice for any houseplant collection. Xanadu ( Thaumatophyllum xanadu ‘Winterbourn') is the ultimate low-maintenance houseplant, getting by with minimal water. In fact, after watering, wait until soil is 50 percent dry before watering again. In the winter when growth slows, this plant needs even less water.\nThaumatophyllum xanadu ‘Winterbourn') is the ultimate low-maintenance houseplant, getting by with minimal water. In fact, after watering, wait until soil is 50 percent dry before watering again. In the winter when growth slows, this plant needs even less water. Keep your Xanadu plant compact and bushy by giving it medium, indirect light. Give it too much direct sun (right beside a window) and the leaves may scorch. Too little sun (in a dark corner) will cause leaf stems to stretch and become leggy. A happy Xanadu fills a 10- to 14-inch pot with a compact, bushy plant that grows 2 to 4 feet tall and wide. It's a good air-purifying plant.\nIf you're looking for a bulletproof houseplant that achieves tree size indoors, consider corn plant (Dracaena fragrans) . This stately tropical commonly grows four to six feet tall. Green leaves feature yellow streaks down the center and sprout from woody canes. You'll often find pots of corn plant for sale having several canes per pot, with each cane a different height. The effect is lovely and forms a ready-made forest.\n(Dracaena fragrans) .

You'll often find pots of corn plant for sale having several canes per pot, with each cane a different height. The effect is lovely and forms a ready-made forest. Corn plants are easy to love and equally easy to care for. They grow best in bright indirect light, but can thrive in low light. Direct sunlight can cause leaf burn. Avoid overwatering by allowing the top 2 to 3 inches of soil to dry out between waterings.

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — The United States will cross a historic threshold on Monday when for the first time a former president goes on criminal trial in a case laced with fateful significance because Donald Trump could be back in the Oval Office next year.\nWhen the presumptive GOP nominee walks into court for the start of jury selection, he and the country will enter a new state of reality as legal and political worlds collide in a trial almost guaranteed to deepen Americans' bitter ideological estrangement.\nThe trial, related to hush money payments to an adult film actress before the 2016 election, will mark yet another extraordinary twist in the story of Trump, whose incessant testing of the limits of presidential decorum and the law has caused nearly nine years of political tumult and may still have years left to run. It raises the possibility that, depending on the jury's verdict, the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election could be a convicted felon. And given the case's subject matter — details about a payment to a woman who alleged that she had a sexual relationship with Trump, which he denies — it could reflect poorly on Trump's character and ethics as voters weigh their decisions in November.\nHush money payments are not illegal. Trump is accused of falsifying business records to keep unflattering information that could have hurt his campaign from the voters in an alleged early example of election interference. The fact that this case stems from alleged personal conduct means that it could have a lesser political impact than Trump's three other looming trials, which are rooted in greater constitutional and legal concerns pertinent to the powers of the presidency.\nThe fact that this case stems from alleged personal conduct means that it could have a lesser political impact than Trump's three other looming trials, which are rooted in greater constitutional and legal concerns pertinent to the powers of the presidency. But the success of the ex-president's legal delaying tactics in the other cases — related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election and hoarding of classified documents — means the hush money trial may be the only one to take place before the election. And Trump — though he is entitled to the presumption of innocence and the airing of evidence like any other defendant — is showing signs of increasing agitation at the prospect of the trial and the indignity it represents for someone who used to be the most powerful man in the world.\nStill, if he had to choose only one of the quartet of cases to reach a conclusion before the election, it would be this one.\nRelated article Your questions about Trump's trial, answered\nRelated article Your questions about Trump's trial, answered The United States, unlike democracies that have been historically less stable, is not a nation accustomed to seeing its former heads of state on trial. While the circumstances of this case and Trump's broader legal troubles are unique, this new precedent does open the possibility that it will be less of a leap for future presidents to be pursued by legal investigations. Indeed, Trump has already warned that if he wins in November, he will dedicate his second presidency to 'retribution' and will use the powers of the presidency to go after his foes, including the Biden family.\nNone of this is remotely normal. But it is all part of the extreme political, legal and constitutional challenges that Trump constantly poses to US institutions and that he is signaling would intensify if he wins a second term. The incessant cacophony stirred by his volcanic personality is by design — it makes it hard for Americans to process each distinct Rubicon that is crossed.\nThe former president has made fervent attempts to delegitimize the case, the judge and the legal system itself — partly to hedge against any future guilty verdicts. He has blasted Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat who is leading the prosecution, as politically biased. And Judge Juan Merchan expanded a gag order after Trump named his daughter, who has done work for Democrats, on social media.\nWhile the trial will not be televised, it is bound to be a national spectacle over the period of six weeks to two months that it is expected to last. In his previous civil trials, including a massive fraud case that went against him, Trump has used court breaks to stage free rolling and often angry televised news conferences, seeking to attack the probity of the court and to air issues in the case. He has often been an obstreperous defendant, infringing the behavioral codes of the courtroom and infuriating judges. At one point during the civil fraud trial, Judge Arthur Engoron admonished Trump for turning the courtroom into the campaign trail, and asked his attorney, 'Can you control your client?'\nFor all of Trump's claims of unfair treatment by the legal system, many other defendants would likely have faced far harsher treatment for their attacks on trials, prosecutors and court officers.\nWhile the Manhattan trial is in session four days a week, the ex-president will be required to attend — at a time when President Joe Biden will be free to blitz swing states. This is one reason why Trump's 2024 campaign is running as much through the courtrooms as according to the traditional rhythms of a White House bid.\nThe moment Trump shows up in the courtroom on Monday will be one of unfathomable drama and a test for members of the pool of citizens who will be vetted for service on a jury like none other in American history. 'He's the most famous person in the world. And when you've come face-to-face with somebody that's got that kind of charisma, that kind of power, it tends to be intimidating, it tends to be shocking, it tends to be exciting,' Robert Hirschhorn, a jury and trial consultant, said on CNN on Friday.\nThe task of finding jurors who lack strong opinions and prejudices against a defendant and the legal system , who can serve for a prolonged period and will make judgements solely based on the law and the evidence, is complex in any case. Because the accused is Trump, legal experts are predicting that jury selection could take as long as a week or more, which must conclude before prosecutors lay out their opening arguments against the former president.\n, who can serve for a prolonged period and will make judgements solely based on the law and the evidence, is complex in any case. Because the accused is Trump, legal experts are predicting that jury selection could take as long as a week or more, which must conclude before prosecutors lay out their opening arguments against the former president. But as he contemplates the beginning of his trial, Trump appears to be gleaning an understanding that his fate is now out of his hands and will be soon in those of 12 anonymous citizens whom he will not be allowed to bully, persuade or politicize. 'Jury selection is largely luck. It depends who you get. It's very unfair that I'm having a trial there,' Trump said on Friday, alluding to New York City's liberal lean.\nTrump is already seeking to turn the trial into a circus to further his merged legal defense and chief campaign argument that he's being persecuted by 'deranged prosecutors' trying to bar his return to the Oval Office. He branded himself as a 'proud political dissident' at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February and has compared himself to South African anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela and dead Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. On Saturday night in the swing state of Pennsylvania, Trump promised, 'I will be fighting for the freedom of 325 million Americans,' as he embarked on an unprecedented shuttle between a criminal trial and the campaign trail. On Sunday, he used his Truth Social network to blast 'a blatant and unprecedented attack' against his campaign and claimed that Biden coordinated with Bragg. There is no evidence that this is true.\nTrump's arguments are convincing to many Republican voters who embraced his narrative of persecution and made him their nominee in quick time this year. But will he be able to convince undecided general election voters that he's a victim, or will his first trial thicken a cloud of criminality that could doom his White House hopes and improve Biden's chances of landing a second term? Some polls have shown that a minority of Republican voters might have pause about voting for the ex-president if he is found guilty after a trial. But the circumstances are so unusual that it is impossible to predict how the politics of a conviction or an acquittal could play out.\nPolitical uncertainty over the case is being exacerbated by the charged backdrop. There is no clear leader in national polling in the race between Biden and Trump, which is likely to be decided by thousands of votes in a handful of battleground states. The president's prospects are being challenged by high interest rates and elevated prices that are causing pain for millions of Americans. Biden spent the weekend presiding over a successful defense of Israel after Iran sent hundreds of missiles and drones toward the Jewish state as fears of a wider Middle East war spiked. The deteriorating situation could bolster Trump's claims the world is spinning out of control under his successor's watch. That means that this and any future Trump trials — while a never-before-seen interruption to a presidential election campaign — may be only one factor that decides the destiny of the White House in November.\nTrump is charged in Manhattan with falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in what prosecutors said was an attempt to interfere in the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty and has denied having an affair with Daniels.\n'Manhattan is home to the country's most significant business market. We cannot allow New York businesses to manipulate their records to cover up criminal conduct,' Bragg wrote as he unveiled the indictment — Trump's first — in April 2023. 'The trail of money and lies exposes a pattern that, the People allege, violates one of New York's basic and fundamental business laws.'\nTrump's supporters claim that he's a victim of selective and politicized justice because he is being prosecuted over what they contend is a novel legal theory in a case stemming from personal embarrassments and campaign finance infringements. But Bragg's framing of the case identifies a common theme with Trump's other indictments: Is a president accountable to the same laws as every other citizen, or he is above the law?\n'This payment was made to deprive voters of essential information, which in turn was covered up with the intent to affect an election. … That's the allegation – deceiving voters to grasp power,' said Norm Eisen, a CNN legal analyst and author of the new book 'Trying Trump: A Guide to His First Election Interference Criminal Trial. '\n' Eisen added: ' Now , Alvin Bragg might not prove it — but that is why this is an alleged election interference case.'\n' Now , Alvin Bragg might not prove it — but that is why this is an alleged election interference case.' Trump's attorneys have argued that this trial should be delayed until the Supreme Court rules on his sweeping claims of presidential immunity arising from the federal election interference case brought by special counsel Jack Smith. While the initial conduct at issue in this case took place before Trump was president, prosecutors argue that he signed off on the alleged cover-up to reimburse his lawyer Michael Cohen for phony legal services while president.\nAs part of a desperate flurry of filings designed to postpone accountability in the hush money case, the former president has also been claiming that he cannot get a fair trial in New York — the city where he made his name but that has overwhelmingly voted against him. Merchan has declined efforts by the president's attorneys to get the trial relocated to a jurisdiction where voters may be more favorable to Trump.\nThe former president is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. If convicted, he could face probation or a maximum sentence of 1 1/3 to 4 years on each count in state prison. Many legal experts believe that, as a first offender, Trump would not face jail time, or that if he did, any custodial sentences would run concurrently.\nTrump's attorneys have not tipped their hand over possible defenses. But it's almost certain they will attack the credibility and personal testimony of both Cohen and Daniels. Cohen will face criticism for being an unreliable witness after spending time in prison after being convicted of tax offenses, of lying to Congress and other offenses.",

The views expressed here are solely hers. Read more opinion on CNN. CNN —\nCNN — Friday's midnight release of 'The Tortured Poets Department,' Taylor Swift's 11th album, means that yet another era has begun — and a record-breaking one at that. Swifties, who are now more than familiar with football jargon (at least when it comes to Kansas City Chiefs' tight end Travis Kelce, Taylor's beau) can finally put away the grill and the drinks, lock the car, and leave the parking lot for the stadium. The tailgate is over: it's game on for Taylor Nation.\nI am one of them, and the anticipation — along with the revelry — has been an extended family affair.\nHaving secured tickets to an epic night of the Eras tour last spring at Gillette Stadium, my daughter Hannah and I made a pilgrimage from New York to attend the show with my lifelong best friend Sarah and her daughter Maggie . We were two moms with decades of concerts — from Def Leppard to U2 to Lizzo — under our belts, and our teen daughters, with whom we have danced to the likes of Harry Styles, Olivia Rodrigo and SZA.\n. We were two moms with decades of concerts — from Def Leppard to U2 to Lizzo — under our belts, and our teen daughters, with whom we have danced to the likes of Harry Styles, Olivia Rodrigo and SZA. The thing is, after that night at Gillette, I thought we were on the other side of Swift mania for a while. I was wrong. When more dates were announced, Maggie somehow got a code and purchased four seats for us in … are you ready for it?\nVancouver. A mere 2,500 miles away.\nThe seats are terrible, Sarah told me. It would be ridiculous to do this, we reasoned. I was very close to getting Hannah to agree it was too much. But Maggie was not to be dissuaded — and Sarah and I realized this might be the last great thing we do before these girls of ours leave our houses and head to college, to jobs and to lives that will be even more of their own than they are now.\nWe are not alone in this. The broader Swiftie community serves as a connector for all kinds of relationships, from best friends to parents and kids, creating a landscape for communication, bonding and the rites of passage that can be so difficult, perhaps especially for teenage girls like our daughters.\nAn absurdly brief trip to Vancouver via — literally — planes, trains, and an automobile was set. All things Swiftie, then, were settled. Or so we thought, until February.\nThat's when Swift, at the Grammys no less (where she won a historic fourth Album of the Year award for 'Midnights'), announced 'The Tortured Poets Department' would be coming on April 19. In the days leading up to the big night, Swifties speculated that the artist would reveal the long-awaited re-release of 'Reputation , ' her sixth album, which many felt would be the next 'Taylor's Version,' a series of re-recordings that allowed her to regain rights to her material after Big Machine, her original record company, sold her masters.\n, ' her sixth album, which many felt would be the next 'Taylor's Version,' a series of re-recordings that allowed her to regain rights to her material after Big Machine, her original record company, sold her masters. Swifties dug into Taylor math, which often revolves around the number 13, the date of her December birthday. Indeed, 13 days before the Grammys, her friends, including Kelce, had changed their profile pictures on social media to black and white, the colors of 'Reputation.' She showed up on the Grammys' red carpet in a white dress with black accents. Her website went down, replaced by a black screen and seemingly meaningless words in white, including 'Error 321' and 'DPT:321' and 'hneriergrd,' which Swifties unscrambled as 'red herring.'\nThe speculation was overwhelming: A fax error? A countdown? A blind alley? No. It was the new album. With a smile and what looked like a peace sign, she left the stage, the album's cover immediately going up on her Instagram site.\nThe pregame anticipation on this one has been intense, starting with how and when she recorded this, her fourth album in four years, while prepping and executing the highest-grossing concert tour of all time. Her work ethic makes the rest of us mere mortals feel inadequate at best. She writes, like Lin-Manuel Miranda's Alexander Hamilton, as if she is running out of time.\nBut the bigger question was what — who — this record was about, and all paths led to the 2023 end of her six-year relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn.\nThe easiest clue, of course, is the title itself, a seemingly savage take on Alwyn's WhatsApp chat with his friends entitled 'The Tortured Man Club.' The release date, too, holds value. While fans locate Swift's split from Alwyn to be anywhere from February to early April, 2023, it was on April 19 that she went to dinner with friends Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, who subsequently unfollowed Alwyn on social media. The date also, of course, marks the anniversary of the split of the 13 American colonies (13, don't forget) from Great Britain in 1775 with the Battle of Lexington and Concord, starting a war against a perceived tyranny that would end in independence for the oppressed.\nAn album about liberation? Freedom? Separation? A break from … a British boyfriend? A date chosen because 256 days remain in the year, and if you add those numbers up you get 13?\nWhen the track list emerged, all eyes went to track five, which is where Swift has always located her heart, producing gut-wrenching tracks such as 'Dear John' on 'Speak Now,' 'My Tears Ricochet' on 'Folklore' and the epic 'All Too Well' on 'Red,' which allegedly details in excruciating detail her breakup with actor Jake Gyllenhaal.\nThis time around, we have 'So Long, London,' cowritten with The National's Aaron Dessner, whose last track five with Swift was on 'Evermore,' the devastating 'Tolerate It.'\nSo, what has my cohort of Swifties made of all this? My best friend's daughter, the teen I thought might be done with all this for a while (as we wait for Vancouver), might actually be the Swiftie of all Swifties, a Taylor archivist of sorts (with a brother who was born on … December 13). Where does all of this fit, I asked her — what's the long game?\nRelated article Why young people are throwing PowerPoint parties\nRelated article Why young people are throwing PowerPoint parties In true Gen Z fashion, she responded a few hours later with an extensive, masterful, complex slide deck presentation that would undoubtedly nab her an A in Harvard's Taylor course. She contextualized the theories — some rational, some out there, but all relevant because in Swiftie world, nothing is coincidence and everything is intentional — and concluded that this was, indeed, Swift's first 'break-up' record since 'Red' (see Gyllenhaal).\nSuddenly 'You're Losing Me,' a bonus track from 'Midnights,' which is about the things that keep you up at night, seemed like a precursor, a song about the beginning of an end, especially when longtime collaborator Jack Antonoff referred to recording the song back in 2021. More clues came when a pale gray and pink 'Pop-Up Library' exhibit sponsored by Spotify went up at The Grove in Los Angeles, seemingly a poetry library filled with Swift's manuscripts.\nIt's one thing to be a puzzle to your fans — it's entirely another to make a puzzle for your fans. Swift has created music's version of 'I Spy' novels for this generation, encoding notes in her lyrics, creating everything from complex numerologies to word searches. The relentless hunt for Easter eggs across social media suddenly took physical form in this exhibit: from the 72 (the number of months Swift was with Alwyn) card catalogue drawers, six (the number of years Swift was with Alwyn) of which are open and filled with lace and dead flowers to a bust of the goddess Diana, the original statue crumbled on its way to London in the 6th century because of neglect. 'Even statues crumble,' Swift's TTPD billboard says in New York's Times Square, 'if they're made to wait.'\nRelated article Why everyone is crying to Taylor's breakup songs\nRelated article Why everyone is crying to Taylor's breakup songs When it was finally midnight, game time, all members of my own Swiftie family were in our own homes listening to the same thing, track by track, unpacking words and music, texting thoughts and questions (Who is Dylan Thomas? My name is in a song! My name is too!). I went to track five first, which everyone else found to be heresy. But it confirmed an awful lot of what everyone suspected: Swift's voice at its most vulnerable with the words 'And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free.'\nWas it about Alwyn? Yes. Was it about other things, including (especially?) Matty Healy? Also, yes. Is 'The Alchemy' about Kelce? Oh my. Yeah. Maybe. Probably.\nAs we continued to listen — and yes, Friday's a school/work day but who needs sleep??!! — alongside all of the Swifties posting emotional selfies and TikToks with their hands slapped over their mouths in awe, shouty caps pronouncing their love for this track or that, we found (we thought) answers to many questions, and had new questions that needed answers.\nThis record is as messy as it is emotional. It felt like the initial speculation all those months ago were somewhat vindicated. Perhaps what we thought were peace signs — from Swift's gesture at the Grammys to a sculpture in The Grove exhibit — were actually twos.\nIn many ways, 'Reputation' and 'TTPD' felt like two sides of the same relationship, their inverted black and white color schemes creating a yin and a yang, and while the first contains her first love songs to Alwyn — from 'Delicate' to 'Gorgeous' — the latter creates needed closure, maturity even.\nand 'TTPD' felt like two sides of the same relationship, their inverted black and white color schemes creating a yin and a yang, and while the first contains her first love songs to Alwyn — from 'Delicate' to 'Gorgeous' — the latter creates needed closure, maturity even.

Two albums, not one. 31 tracks. And yes, 31 is 13 backwards and that, too, is no accident. Check out the erratic capitalization of track 24, 'Thank you Aimee' if you doubt that Swift is masterminding it all. For my merry band of Swifties, there are no accidents. Just puzzles to gleefully solve, together, for as long as we can.\n'Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it,' Swift wrote on X (formerly Twitter) just after midnight. 'And then all that's left behind is the tortured poetry.' For my group of four, what is left to ponder as we continue to digest this record, together, in the coming months is what might be our last concert road trip, our last stab at a mother-daughter journey. Maybe wherever they land, there is a seminar on Taylor Swift. Then maybe we can study for the final exam together.",

The longest-enduring standardized college admissions test in the nation, the SAT has faced decades of controversy over bias and criticism for reducing aspiring college students to a test score. It has also been denounced as part of the high barrier to entry into the so-called American meritocracy.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, when dozens of the most prestigious universities in the nation suspended their standardized testing requirement, some were hopeful of a new era of more equitable college admissions.\nBut this year, many of these institutions have done an about-face on their test-optional policies. At the same time, at least 1,825 US colleges and universities, or more than 80% of four-year schools, will still not require testing for 2025 admissions, according to FairTest, the National Center for Fair & Open Testing.\nThe splintering of admissions policies post-pandemic has reinvigorated debate around the necessity of the SAT.\nCriticism has dogged the SAT for years. The exam, whose acronym originally stood for 'Scholastic Aptitude Test,' was developed in the 1920s by Princeton-based eugenicist Carl Brigham, who believed immigration was diluting American intelligence and adapted US Army mental tests to determine whether similar exams could measure innate student intelligence. (Brigham retracted some of his views several years later.)\nThe College Board, the educational non-profit that designs and administers the exam, told CNN the SAT has been 'completely overhauled' since the 1920s and now measures how well a student has learned specific content, not inherent aptitude.\nBut the test's legacy — one steeped in racism and classism — has raised questions about the need for high-stakes testing at all. The National Education Association has noted that the SAT, and its counterpart the ACT, can factor too heavily in the college admissions process.\n'It's important that we don't overly rely on them because they're not holistic. They are one snapshot on one day and it can determine whether or not you get into college,' NEA's Director of Policy Daaiyah Bilal-Threats told CNN.\nMost colleges have no plans to reinstitute their pre-pandemic testing requirements.\n'Test-optional policies continue to dominate at national universities, state flagships, and selective liberal arts colleges because they typically result in more applicants, academically stronger applicants and more diversity,' said FairTest Executive Director Harry Feder in a February statement, after some Ivy League schools announced they would reinstitute their testing requirements.\nA strong emphasis on high SAT scores has also spurred the rise of a lucrative test prep industry in the United States, which is estimated to grow by about 7% to almost $50 billion by 2027, according to a report in October 2023 from market researcher Technavio.\nDiscrepancies with standardized testing appear to be symptomatic of the inequality endemic to the education system. Some experts point out that doing away with the SAT as an admissions component, like many universities did at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, does little to remedy systemic inequity. In fact, it can bring the disparity into starker focus.\nWealthier students may have access to prestigious internships, schools with better-funded clubs and sports, as well as music and arts programs — all elements of the quintessential college application.\n'(Students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds) don't have any of these fancy extracurriculars. They haven't played in a fancy jazz band. They don't do fancy internships. They don't work as volunteers in Guatemala. And yet some of them will be very capable students,' said Daniel Koretz, a testing policy expert at Harvard's Graduate School of Education. He says the question is: How do schools find these students?\nAccording to Koretz, the SAT's longevity can be attributed to its efficacy in predicting how a student will perform in college.\nA study published in January by Harvard's Opportunity Insights center found that standardized tests are more effective predictors of performance than high school grades.\nCritically, the study also found that students from different socioeconomic backgrounds who have similar test scores have 'virtually identical' college GPAs.\nWeeks after the study was released, several schools that had been test-optional for nearly four years officially reversed their stances. Yale and Dartmouth announced in February they were reinstating a testing requirement and were quickly joined by private and public institutions, including Brown, Georgetown, Harvard, the University of Florida and the University of Texas at Austin.\n'SAT/ACTs can be especially helpful in identifying students from less-resourced backgrounds who would succeed at Dartmouth but might otherwise be missed in a test-optional environment,' Dartmouth wrote in a statement in February.\n'With an abundance of high school GPAs surrounding 4.0 … an SAT or ACT score is a proven differentiator that is in each student's and the University's best interest,' UT Austin said in March.\nEducation experts who spoke to CNN say the SAT is necessary because there is no 'standard' American education.\nIndividual schools may have different grading criteria. Some schools weigh grade point averages differently. An A+ in an AP class in one district is equivalent to a 4.0 GPA. In another, it could be 5.0, 4.5 or 4.2.\nEven within the same school and subject, some teachers might grade more or less leniently than others.\nCollege admissions officers simply don't have the ability to account for all of these minute discrepancies, experts told CNN, so standardized tests will likely stick around unless US education becomes standardized in other ways.\n'Anytime you have a system as big as ours and in the absence of that kind of standardization in the K-12 system, schools are going to find value in finding ways to compare students. It doesn't have to be the SAT necessarily, but something standardized like it,' said Ethan Hutt, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's School of Education.\nThis lack of standardization reaches back to the early days of US education. Throughout the 1800's, there was little tracking of student achievement, and grades and written tests weren't common.\n'In the 19th century, schools … would gather parents and townspeople, and the teacher would basically put on an exhibition with the class,' said Hutt. 'They would ask students questions and to recite things (they had learned).'\nOral examinations were the norm until 1845, when education reformer and then-Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education Horace Mann instituted a written test to gauge the level of student instruction across Boston-area public schools.\nA college education was exceedingly rare, as the system was designed to favor wealthy White men funneled from elite private schools in the Northeast to prestigious private universities also in the Northeast.\n'Often, it would consist of either colleges accrediting certain high schools and saying, ‘OK, any graduate of (Phillips Exeter Academy) is automatically given entrance to Harvard,' or they would send out professors to do exams at individual schools,' said Hutt.\nFirst administered in 1926, the SAT was an attempt to broaden the university candidate pool.\nThree legislative milestones indirectly expanded the influence of the SAT. First, the 1944 Servicemen's Readjustment Act, commonly known as the GI Bill, gave returning soldiers the funds to pursue higher education. Between 1944 and 1951, more than two million veterans enrolled in college.\nSecond, the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibited colleges and universities that received federal money from discriminating against applicants according to 'race, color, or national origin.' Eight years later, Congress would pass another landmark legislation — Title IX — a law that prohibited institutions from discriminating on the basis of sex. These laws, at least in theory, sought to even out the playing field for college admissions.\nBetween 1945 and 1995, the percent of Americans older than 25 who had earned a bachelor's degree had increased from about 5% to 23%, according to the Census Bureau. And as higher education grew more attainable, the SAT became the most important exam some Americans would ever take.\nThe College Board continually revamps and redesigns both its SAT scoring metrics and exam content. For decades, the test consisted of two multiple-choice sections: math and verbal reasoning. Each section was worth a total of 800 points, making a perfect score 1600.\nIn 2005, the College Board added an 800-point writing section to the exam alongside its math and verbal reasoning sections. The test, scored out of 2400 instead of 1600, was also 45 minutes longer. About nine years later, the SAT reverted to a 1600-point essay-optional model before entirely scrapping the essay section in 2021.\nOn March 9, the College Board administered its first fully digital SAT exam. At around two hours, the test, which was taken by over 200,000 students on a test-taking app, is much shorter than its predecessors. It's also adaptive, meaning the questions in the second half of the reading and math sections are adjusted based on the student's performance on the first half.\nPart of the push to redesign comes from competition with the Iowa-based ACT, which has been administered since 1959 but has since become the preferred exam in many parts of the country.\n'When the ACT started getting so much more traction and because it was shorter, the SAT really wanted to maintain its market share, and so it made a number of changes for that reason,' said Rachel Rubin, a higher education policy expert and co-founder of Massachusetts-based educational consulting company Spark Admissions.\nAlthough the SAT has seen a slight slump in the number of test takers, with 1.9 million students sitting for the exam in 2023 compared to 2.2 million pre-pandemic, the College Board's exam still reins supreme. Only about 1.4 million students took the ACT in 2023, compared to 1.7 million in 2019.\nWorking through a history of bias The SAT's analogy section, a fixture of the exam until 2005, had long been criticized for presupposing that test-takers come from certain cultural backgrounds. An infamous example from the 1980s exam included 'regatta,' which is a sporting event consisting of boat races that is almost exclusively common in wealthy Northeast communities.\n'For many years the SAT … was crafted by people who were almost entirely White, were overwhelmingly male, and were largely educated in colleges and universities from the Northeast,' said Jack Schneider, the head of UMass Amherst's Center for Education Policy. 'The assumptions that they made about the things that any well-educated person should know were in many ways biased against communities of color, low-income communities, and communities where languages other than English were the predominant language.'\nSchneider acknowledges that eliminating bias from the SAT is incredibly difficult because 'we live in a biased society.'\nthat eliminating bias from the SAT is incredibly difficult because 'we live in a biased society.' The College Board told CNN it has also done away with its esoteric vocabulary in the past decade.\n'Starting in 2014, we said let's measure all the most common things that are most useful in college and that students are more likely to encounter in their high school classrooms,' said College Board CEO David Coleman, noting this applies both to the math curriculum and the mastery of vocabulary.\nIn recent years, the College Board has implemented cost-saving initiatives for eligible test-takers to promote equity, such as waiving the $60 registration fee and offering college application fee waivers, which can save applicants as much as $90 per school . It has partnered with education non-profit Khan Academy since 2015 to provide free test prep materials.\n$90 per school . It has partnered with education non-profit Khan Academy since 2015 to provide free test prep materials. The SAT School Day program, which launched in 2014, allows students to take the test on a weekday rather than on a designated weekend at a potentially unfamiliar testing center. The College Board say a majority of students use the program, which 'has been shown to lead to higher college-going rates for low-income and rural students.'\nColeman says administering the test in a familiar environment can reduce the stress inherent to the SAT experience. He added that the shorter digital exam is also aimed at accommodating different types of test-takers.\n'(The older version of the SAT) can feel like it's designed for young people who are very quick, and it's a great error to confuse quick and smart,' Coleman said. 'The digital exam gives kids 160% more time per question … to make sure they can finish the exam without feeling out of breath.'",

All these areas are winter grazing areas of Chushul village. Now people find it very difficult to go there. These areas are now no-man's land,' said Stanzin, who has been raising awareness about these issues since 2020.\nBut those interviewed by CNN also point to what they say is the impact of Chinese encroachment and changes to the control of contested lands over time, including from the 2020 clash.\nChinese encroachment and changes to the control of contested lands over time, including from the 2020 clash.

They have been crossing the line and coming in,' he said. 'China is capturing the land, the Indian government is saying nothing is lost, the (Indian) Army is not letting us go there.'\nCNN was unable to independently confirm the status of the restricted land described in this report, nor claims of Chinese encroachment or loss of Indian territorial control after the 2020 clash.\nIn a statement, India's Ministry of Defense told CNN: 'No Indian territory has been lost during the standoff. Negotiations are currently underway for disengagement at the remaining friction points.'\nOn the buffer zones, the ministry said: 'all disengagements achieved till date have been based on the principle of Mutual and Equal Security. Currently, a mutually agreed moratorium exists on military activities from both sides in areas where disengagement has been affected, to maintain peace and tranquility.'\nThe 'number of Indian graziers and livestock in traditional grazing areas has seen a sharp rise' after the events of 2020, the ministry's statement added. 'There has thus been no adverse impact on the livelihood of locals in the area.'\nChina's Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\nExplained: Why do India and China spar at the border? (2022)\n02:40 - Source: CNN\n02:40 - Source: CNN Mounting concern over threats to the way of life in Ladakh – from lost grazing lands to climate change and industrialization – have driven thousands from across the region to its joint capital city of Leh in recent weeks to demand greater rights ahead of India's general election, which begins Friday.\nThere, some 3,500 meters (11,550 feet) above sea level, residents are calling for Indian statehood for Ladakh to ensure political representation, as well as inclusion in the national constitution's Sixth Schedule, which grants special rights to tribal areas. Organizers say at least 10,000 people turned out during a single day in Leh last month to support the start of an ongoing, weekslong hunger strike.\nLadakh lost special controls over its land in 2019, following a controversial move by the Indian central government that stripped the former state of Jammu and Kashmir of its statehood and broke off Ladakh, which had been a part of it, into a separate territory.\nThe change placed the region under the direct control of India's central government, which critics say has pared back national environmental protections and backed ecologically harmful infrastructure development pushes in other sensitive parts of the country in recent years.\nChina doesn't recognize what its Foreign Ministry has called the 'so-called union territory of Ladakh,' saying the 'western section of the China-India border has always belonged to China.' In addition to China, the territory of Ladakh also shares a disputed border with Pakistan, another neighbor with which New Delhi has fraught relations.\nNow many in Ladakh are concerned about the potential damage of future New Delhi-backed industrial projects, or that an influx of people moving in could shift the largely tribal demography.\n'Only local people will think about the next few generations, (others will) … make mistakes at best and sell off the place at worst,' said Sonam Wangchuk, an activist and educator widely known across India, who is leading the hunger strike to draw attention to environmental threats facing Ladakh.\nSpeaking to CNN during the 19th day of a 21-day fast last month, Wangchuk said in a steady but weakened voice that without protections and representation, 'we will have no control on how to secure these mountains.'\nHe pointed to plans for a solar plant and the potential for more environmentally damaging industry to follow.\nThe activism has faced pressure from local authorities.\nEarlier this month, Wangchuk and other civil society leaders called off a planned peaceful march toward the border they said was meant to reveal grazing lands lost to Chinese encroachment, after local authorities banned unauthorized gatherings and temporarily slowed internet speeds, citing an 'apprehension of breach of peace.'\nCNN has reached out to Leh's district magistrate and local police for comment.\nSome, like the Ladakh president of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), say protections on land, jobs and culture in Ladakh could be granted through other means, which local leaders have rejected. He also suggested the border dispute is a factor in why other demands won't be met.\n'We are with the border with China and Pakistan. How can a sensitive (place) like Ladakh just be turned into a state immediately?' the local party leader, Phunchok Stanzin, told CNN.\nThe nomadic traditions of shepherd communities living off the land and selling goats' wool to be spun into luxurious Pashmina had already been diminishing in Ladakh in recent decades.\nA tourism boom and the impacts of climate change – as receding glaciers and other impacts drive flash floods, drought and reduced snowfall – are among factors shifting how some families make their livings.\nNamgail Phonchok, 51, whose village lies south of the piercing blue waters of Pangong Lake that stretches from India into China, fears his children won't be able to continue their way of life – including due to access restrictions on grazing lands.\n'When they won't let us graze, then we will sell our animals. We do not know what other job to get, and our own work will also go, then what will we do?' he said, adding that 'if big industries come here then the environment will get ruined completely.'\nBetween longer-term changes and new restrictions on grazing lands, 'our nomadic way of life is going away,' Phonchok said.\nDadul, in Phobrang, has seen those changes too.\nHe says 60 of the 113 households in his village used to be nomadic; now only 10 are maintaining the tradition due to those factors and lost grazing lands.\n'Nomadic way of life is a very rare thing in India. In one home you have yaks, sheep, goats, horses and other livestock … yaks are meant for transportation and milk, cheese and butter, and the goats give Pashmina. This is the actual eco-friendly and sustainable way of life,' he said.\n'When the army steps back from the real border, this effect spills over to the village … and the movement of the nomadic tribes is restricted,' he added.\nNew Delhi has denied that its border tensions with China are impacting the lives of the shepherds there.\nAnd Prime Minister Narendra Modi – India's Hindu nationalist leader, who is widely expected to win a rare third term in the upcoming election – has tread cautiously around the border issue, claiming in the wake of the June 2020 border clash that 'no one has intruded' into Indian territory.\nModi's comments appeared to contradict his own foreign minister, who said the violence began after 'the Chinese side sought to erect a structure in Galwan valley on our side of the LAC.' Beijing at the time said, 'none of the responsibility lies with China,' blaming Indian troops for 'starting provocations' and crossing the de facto border.\nNew Delhi says two sites remain contested along the Ladakh border after disengagement at other contested zones following the 2020 clash. Observers believe Chinese forces are blocking Indian patrols in those contested areas where they previously had access.\nAt the points where there has been disengagement, the establishment of buffer zones means 'both sides have pulled back by mutual agreement and neither side patrols there,' as opposed to earlier, when troops could patrol up to their claim, according to Joshi in New Delhi.\nNew Delhi's official response – and the lack of transparency over buffer zones – has fueled domestic debate about India's position on the border.\nA report from a Ladakh police superintendent released in 2023 further stoked concerns – detailing how Indian forces lost their presence in 26 of 65 patrol points over an unspecified period. Reduced patrolling led to an ultimate loss of control over such areas, where China grabs land 'inch-by-inch,' the report said.\nThe report also accused China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) of having 'taken advantage' of the buffer areas established in the de-escalation talks by objecting to Indian forces' movement in the buffer zone and asking for further pushback.\nIt noted: 'Much restrictions on the movement of civilians and grazers near the forward areas on the Indian side, indicating their ‘play safe' strategy that they do not want to annoy the PLA by giving them the chance to raise objections on the areas being claimed as disputed.'\nA copy was posted online by Indian magazine The Caravan alongside a report from Singh, from the Centre for Policy Research.\nSingh, who is also a lecturer at Yale University, suggested the lack of clarity on the border situation may stem from Modi's concerns over Chinese military superiority – and tarnishing his government's image.\nIf Modi's strongly nationalist government were to acknowledge loss of territorial control, 'it would be very difficult for him to then not take some aggressive action to regain that lost territory,' he said.\n'Then the risk of escalation would be very high and, in that escalation, I think Mr. Modi's government fears that they could be humiliated – that they could lose to China.'\nBut some from Ladakh argue that the sensitivity of the region, both environmentally and strategically, is the very reason to allow the local people more control over the land – including access around the border.\n'The shepherd is going to the mountain and protecting it every day,' said Dadul, the shepherd from Phobrang.\n'If the real protectors are brought to the borders and allowed to stay there, then what is left will be protected.'",

In addition to China, the territory of Ladakh also shares a disputed border with Pakistan, another neighbor with which Delhi has fraught relations.\nNow many in Ladakh are concerned about the potential damage of future New Delhi-backed industrial projects, or that an influx of people moving in could shift the largely tribal demography.\n'Only local people will think about the next few generations, (others will) … make mistakes at best and sell off the place at worst,' said Sonam Wangchuk, an activist and educator widely known across India, who is leading the hunger strike to draw attention to environmental threats facing Ladakh.\nSpeaking to CNN during the 19th day of a 21-day fast last month, Wangchuk said in a steady but weakened voice that without protections and representation, 'we will have no control on how to secure these mountains.'\nHe pointed to plans for a solar plant and the potential for more environmentally damaging industry to follow.\nThe activism has faced pressure from local authorities.\nEarlier this month, Wangchuk and other civil society leaders called off a planned peaceful march toward the border they said was meant to reveal grazing lands lost to Chinese encroachment, after local authorities banned unauthorized gatherings and temporarily slowed internet speeds, citing an 'apprehension of breach of peace.'\nCNN has reached out to Leh's district magistrate and local police for comment.\nSome, like the Ladakh president of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), say protections on land, jobs and culture in Ladakh could be granted through other means, which local leaders have rejected. He also suggested the border dispute is a factor in why other demands won't be met.\n'We are with the border with China and Pakistan. How can a sensitive (place) like Ladakh just be turned into a state immediately?' the local party leader, Phunchok Stanzin, told CNN.\nThe nomadic traditions of shepherd communities living off the land and selling goats' wool to be spun into luxurious Pashmina had already been diminishing in Ladakh in recent decades.\nA tourism boom and the impacts of climate change – as receding glaciers and other impacts drive flash floods, drought and reduced snowfall – are among factors shifting how some families make their livings.\nNamgail Phonchok, 51, whose village lies south of the piercing blue waters of Pangong Lake that stretches from India into China, fears his children won't be able to continue their way of life – including due to access restrictions on grazing lands.\n'When they won't let us graze, then we will sell our animals. We do not know what other job to get, and our own work will also go, then what will we do?' he said, adding that 'if big industries come here then the environment will get ruined completely.'\nBetween longer-term changes and new restrictions on grazing lands, 'our nomadic way of life is going away,' Phonchok said.\nDadul, in Phobrang, has seen those changes too.\nHe says 60 of the 113 households in his village used to be nomadic; now only 10 are maintaining the tradition due to those factors and lost grazing lands.\n'Nomadic way of life is a very rare thing in India. In one home you have yaks, sheep, goats, horses and other livestock … yaks are meant for transportation and milk, cheese and butter, and the goats give Pashmina. This is the actual eco-friendly and sustainable way of life,' he said.\n'When the army steps back from the real border, this effect spills over to the village … and the movement of the nomadic tribes is restricted,' he added.\nNew Delhi has denied that its border tensions with China are impacting the lives of the shepherds there.\nAnd Prime Minister Narendra Modi – India's Hindu nationalist leader, who is widely expected to win a rare third term in the upcoming election – has tread cautiously around the border issue, claiming in the wake of the June 2020 border clash that 'no one has intruded' into Indian territory.\nModi's comments appeared to contradict his own foreign minister, who said the violence began after 'the Chinese side sought to erect a structure in Galwan valley on our side of the LAC.' Beijing at the time said, 'none of the responsibility lies with China,' blaming Indian troops for 'starting provocations' and crossing the de facto border.\nNew Delhi says two sites remain contested along the Ladakh border after disengagement at other contested zones following the 2020 clash. Observers believe Chinese forces are blocking Indian patrols in those contested areas where they previously had access.\nAt the points where there has been disengagement, the establishment of buffer zones means 'both sides have pulled back by mutual agreement and neither side patrols there,' as opposed to earlier, when troops could patrol up to their claim, according to Joshi in New Delhi.\nNew Delhi's official response – and the lack of transparency over buffer zones – has fueled domestic debate about India's position on the border.\nA report from a Ladakh police superintendent released in 2023 further stoked concerns – detailing how Indian forces lost their presence in 26 of 65 patrol points over an unspecified period. Reduced patrolling led to an ultimate loss of control over such areas, where China grabs land 'inch-by-inch,' the report said.\nThe report also accused China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) of having 'taken advantage' of the buffer areas established in the de-escalation talks by objecting to Indian forces' movement in the buffer zone and asking for further pushback.\nIt noted: 'Much restrictions on the movement of civilians and grazers near the forward areas on the Indian side, indicating their ‘play safe' strategy that they do not want to annoy the PLA by giving them the chance to raise objections on the areas being claimed as disputed.'\nA copy was posted online by Indian magazine The Caravan alongside a report from Singh, from the Centre for Policy Research.\nSingh, who is also a lecturer at Yale University, suggested the lack of clarity on the border situation may stem from Modi's concerns over Chinese military superiority – and tarnishing his government's image.\nIf Modi's strongly nationalist government were to acknowledge loss of territorial control, 'it would be very difficult for him to then not take some aggressive action to regain that lost territory,' he said.\n'Then the risk of escalation would be very high and, in that escalation, I think Mr. Modi's government fears that they could be humiliated – that they could lose to China.'\nBut some from Ladakh argue that the sensitivity of the region, both environmentally and strategically, is the very reason to allow the local people more control over the land – including access around the border.\n'The shepherd is going to the mountain and protecting it every day,' said Dadul, the shepherd from Phobrang.\n'If the real protectors are brought to the borders and allowed to stay there, then what is left will be protected.'",
