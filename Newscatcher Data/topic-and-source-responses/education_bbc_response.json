            "summary": "100 years since its first education broadcast, BBC Children's and Education is announcing a £6 million investment into its online education platform, BBC Bitesize. BBC Bitesize will become the most personalised, trusted and free to access learning platform for the next generation, as the BBC celebrates 100 years of its education content.\nTo celebrate 100 years of BBC Education, BBC Teach will broadcast a special Live Lesson on CBBC and BBC iPlayer on 22 April. This interactive commemorative lesson will be broadcast to children in schools nationwide. Pupils will be challenged to produce their own radio report for CBBC's beloved Hacker T Dog's radio show, developing valuable skills such as interviewing techniques, scriptwriting, and presentation.\nBBC Education has been at the forefront of educational innovation since its inception in 1924, inspiring generations of learners through ground-breaking programming. Deemed revolutionary at the time, Bitesize was launched in 1998. It has gone on to become the most popular online educational website for school children in the UK, with 47% of all students using the platform last year to help with their exams.\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, BBC Education also launched Bitesize Daily and produced over 200 hours of original programming with more than 2,000 lessons created for children not able to go to school.\nPatricia Hidalgo, BBC Director of Children's and Education: 'Our Reithian values to ‘inform, educate and entertain' are the driving force behind the content we provide young people and their families. To ‘educate' is at the heart of the BBC's purpose for the last 100 years and we are so proud of the innovation we have pioneered as we have helped the nation to learn.\nWe're continuing this rich heritage as we evolve BBC Bitesize for the next generation of young learners investing in technology to deliver personalised content supported by the educational rigour and trust we have earned over this centenary.'\nThe significant investment marks a new era of educational content delivery and is a cornerstone of BBC Children's and Education's mission to revolutionise its education service in the digital age, piloting a service up to 19 years old. It will also enhance content discovery, recommendation systems, and self-curation features, making content more personalised, relevant and easier to find. Making learning, completing homework and exam revision simpler and more effective.\nLM4\nLM4",

            "summary": "Media caption, Newsround spoke to students still being affected by Raac\nIn September, at the start of the new term, some schools couldn't fully reopen because of Raac - a type of lightweight concrete used in buildings.\nIn September, at the start of the new term, some schools couldn't fully reopen because of Raac - a type of lightweight concrete used in buildings. It was found to be crumbly and unsafe, so for a while some pupils couldn't head back into the classroom and had to do online learning.\nIt has now been more than six months since problems with Raac first started, but there are still many students who are being affected by the issue.\nNewsround visited a secondary school near Ipswich where students are missing out on science experiments, are often moved from classrooms and feel like they are behind with their education.\nReinforced autoclaved aerated concrete - or Raac for short - is a lightweight concrete that was used in roofs, floors and walls between the 1950s and 1990s.\nIt was a cheaper alternative to standard concrete, but it's not as strong and lasts for around 30 years.\nSome schools and other buildings - like police stations and hospitals - which were built during this time, have now been found to have Raac which is too old and may not be safe enough anymore.\nJust days before the start of the new school term back in September, a beam collapsed in a school which had Raac. As a precaution, the English government ordered all schools with the concrete to close areas that may be affected, unless there were safety measures in place.\nIn England more than 200 schools and colleges have Raac, in Scotland there are 39 schools, five in Wales and currently one in Northern Ireland.\nImage source, Getty Images We visited one secondary school near Ipswich where Raac was discovered in a building, which now means they've lost six science labs, an IT suite, all the maths rooms and some offices.\nOne solution to make up for the lost classrooms, is to use temporary portacabins - but these come with their own challenges.\nStudents told Newsround they found them cold, noisy and it was tricky finding your class at first because they all look the same.\nThese portacabins also don't have the facilities for science experiments or design technology projects.\n\"We can't do our science experiments because we don't have any running water or gas so we cant use Bunsen burners... it's been quite annoying not to be able to do those science lessons because they're quite fun,\" said one student.\nFor this group of Year 8s it's also been hard because it was only a few years ago when they missed school because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nWhen asked how they felt about their education over the past few years, one student said: \"I've found it difficult, I feel behind because we've missed two and a bit years of education.\"\nImage source, Getty Images The Department of Education in England said they have identified schools and colleges affected by Raac and announced how they will be funded to remove it for good.\n\"Work is already underway, and for schools receiving more extensive works through the School Rebuilding Programme, we will confirm when works are expected to start by the end of the summer term,\" a spokesperson for the Department of Education added.\nFunding has been provided by governments in Wales and Northern Ireland to work on the faulty buildings affected there.\nThe Scottish government told us: \"In Scotland, it is the statutory responsibility of local authorities to manage and maintain their school estate - they own school buildings, unlike in other parts of the UK and as such they have a duty to maintain their own buildings.\n\"The Scottish government is aware that Raac has currently been identified in 32 schools in operation - all of which have introduced mitigations to protect pupils and staff.\"\nHas your school been affected by Raac?

Do I, do I not? It was the challenge,\" McIntosh said.\n\"It's been quite some time since I'd done a full-on season with a head coaching role. Before that I was doing a lot of coach education, so that's where I was at in my career, bit of a challenge and I must say I'm enjoying it.\"\nMcIntosh held the head coach role with the Australian Diamonds from 1995 to 2003, leading them to two gold medals at the Kuala Lumpur 1998 Commonwealth Games and the Manchester 2002 Commonwealth Games, plus two World Championships in 1995 and 1999.\nMcIntosh led several unbeaten campaigns with the Diamonds, racking up a 94% win ratio.\nCaptain Jones is embracing working alongside such a decorated coach.\n\"I really enjoy it and obviously the athletes she's worked with during her career, it's a huge privilege that she asked me to undertake the role [of captain],\" Jones said.\n\"I still feel like I'm learning every day both as a player and as a captain under Jill, who also was the captain of the Diamonds as well.\n\"The key to it is open conversation, we talk almost every day, maybe too much for Jill's preference, but we update each other on how the group is, what Jill's plans are for the week. It's a collaborative approach and the girls respond really well to that.\"\nDragons, who have recruited nine new players this season, know Friday night's game against Storm could define their season.\n\"Playing storm is really important,\" said McIntosh. \"We're right there with them. We need the win if we're going to stay in contact with that top four. It's really close in that middle sector of the ladder.\"\nAccording to Jones, a key battle will be between Dragons' former Surrey defender Leah Middleton and current Surrey attacker Peace Proskovia.\n\"We're actually full of confidence ahead of this Friday, they're coming off a loss,\" Jones said.\n\"I think Leah Middleton was Storm's best player last season and we've poached her from them. So I think that will be a great battle in the circle for anyone coming down to watch.\n\"That could be where the match is won and lost and I'm looking forward to it because we've got the home advantage.\"",

Researchers found there are 4,000 school-based foodbanks in primary and secondary schools across England, which equates to one in every five.\nReport lead author Dr William Baker, from the University of Bristol, said: \"The fact schools are running foodbanks en masse is falling under the radar with no national support, guidance, or oversight.\"\nA Department of Work and Pensions spokesperson said this month \"benefits were boosted to support millions of people on the lowest incomes\".\nGeneral secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, Paul Whiteman, said that teachers are being forced to \"dip into their own pockets to help families with food and clothing\".\nThe report calls for greater awareness among policy makers and reform, including an overhaul of the social security system, to address the growing issue.\n, Dr William Baker said it is \"shocking\" that schools are being used en masse for foodbanks\nDr Baker said: 'Our research shows there are now, quite shockingly, more foodbanks inside schools than outside of schools in England.\n'Teachers and support staff see the devastating effects of poverty and the cost-of-living crisis daily, so they have felt compelled to act.\"\nThe survey data used in the study indicates foodbanks exist in more than a fifth (21%) of schools and this rises to a third (33%) in schools with the high numbers of students from deprived backgrounds.\nCharitable and third sector organisations, chiefly The Trussell Trust and The Independent Food Aid Network, remain key players operating 1,646 and 1,172 foodbanks respectively.\nBut the latest data indicates schools now outstrip this, running an estimated 4,250 foodbanks.\nPolicy makers are largely unaware of the nature and scale of the problem, in contrast to previous high-profile media campaigns for universal free school meals and holiday food vouchers during the Covid-19 pandemic, the report claims.\n, Paul Whiteman said in recent years the NAHT has \"increasingly heard from school leaders who are going above and beyond\"\nMr Whiteman said in recent years his union has \"increasingly heard from school leaders who are going above and beyond\".\n'The Government hasn't done nearly enough to support children's recovery from the pandemic, tackle the root causes of poverty, or properly invest in social care, which have all been under-funded over the last decade,\" Mr Whiteman said.\n'Until this changes, we will continue to see worrying levels of poverty.'\nA government spokesman said there are 1.1m fewer people living in absolute poverty compared to 2010, adding that its £108bn cost of living support package prevented 1.3m people falling into poverty in 2022/23.\nThey said: 'This month we boosted benefits and pensions to support millions of people on the lowest incomes and the Household Support Fund continues to provide vital support for those most in need.'\nThe report, Feeding hungry families: food banks in schools in England, has been published in the Bristol Working Papers In Education Series.",
