Trump is set to begin Monday. Take a closer look at central figures related to the case.","summary":"On Monday, Donald J. Trump is set to become the first former U.S. president to face a criminal trial. Manhattan prosecutors charged him last year with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, accusing Mr. Trump of covering up a sex scandal with the porn star Stormy Daniels around the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has pleaded not guilty.\nJustice Merchan presided over the 2022 criminal trial and conviction of the Trump Organization and some of its executives, fining the company the maximum penalty of $1.6 million. A 17-year veteran of the court, Justice Merchan has been subject to verbal attacks by Mr. Trump, who has also targeted the judge's family.\nJust before the 2016 election, Ms. Daniels received a $130,000 hush-money payment from Mr. Trump's attorney, Michael Cohen, in exchange for her silence about her story of a 2006 sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. The former president has denied the encounter, and has frequently attacked Ms. Daniels since the payment became public in 2018.\nMr. Cohen has said that the hush-money payment he made to Ms. Daniels was paid at Mr. Trump's direction. He has also said that Mr. Trump covered up the deal through a series of reimbursements to Mr. Cohen, in order to avoid a sex scandal during and after the 2016 election. Mr. Cohen later served time in prison after pleading guilty in 2018 to federal campaign finance charges related to the hush-money scheme. Mr. Trump has called Mr. Cohen a liar and tried to block his testimony in this case by accusing him of perjury.\nLeading up to the 2016 election, Mr. Pecker, who was the publisher at the time, agreed to work with Mr. Cohen to suppress negative stories about Mr. Trump, a practice known in the tabloid world as 'catch and kill.' Mr. Pecker, a longtime Trump friend, brokered the hush-money deals with Ms. Daniels and a former former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump.\nIn the effort to bury negative stories about Mr. Trump before the 2016 election, Mr. Howard, who was the editor at the time, connected Mr. Cohen with a lawyer for Ms. Daniels, setting the hush-money deal in motion.\nAs part of the scheme to suppress negative stories about Mr. Trump before the 2016 election, American Media Inc., the parent company to the National Enquirer, paid Ms. McDougal $150,000 for the rights to her story of an affair with Mr. Trump in order to bury it. Mr. Trump denies the affair.\nIn October 2016, Mr. Davidson negotiated the hush-money deal with Mr. Cohen to buy Ms. Daniels's silence about the sexual encounter she said she had with Mr. Trump.\nMs. Hicks, who worked on Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign and served in the White House until 2018, spoke with Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen in 2016 on the day they learned that Ms. Daniels wanted money for her story, and again with Mr. Cohen on the day after he wired the $130,000 payment to Ms. Daniels's lawyer.\nMr. McConney facilitated payments to Mr. Cohen \u2013 which served as reimbursement for the $130,000 paid to Ms. Daniels \u2013 that were falsely described as 'legal expenses' in Trump Organization payment records.\nMr. Garten previously told a federal judge that payments by the Trump Organization to Mr. Cohen in 2017 were to reimburse him for a settlement payment to Ms. Daniels, and to compensate him for private counsel services for Mr. Trump.\nOut of various Trump investigations he inherited when he took office in 2022, Mr. Bragg zeroed in on the hush-money deal and resurrected the case, leading last year to Mr. Trump's first criminal indictment. Now Mr. Bragg is set to be the first criminal prosecutor to put Mr. Trump on trial, which has made him a frequent target of the former president's attacks.\nA former high-ranking official at the New York attorney general's office, Mr. Colangelo previously led a civil inquiry into Mr. Trump and oversaw an investigation into the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which led to its dissolution.\nAfter helping to lead the effort to convict the Trump Organization in 2022, Mr. Steinglass was recently added to the prosecution team. He typically prosecutes significant violent crime and secured a conviction against two Proud Boy extremists for a violent brawl in 2019.\nMr. Conroy, who has been at the Manhattan district attorney's office since 1996 and previously led the major economic crimes unit, has worked on the investigations into Mr. Trump longer than any other member of the team.\nShe joined Mr. Bragg's major economic crimes unit in 2022 after clerking for a U.S. District Court judge in New Jersey and working in private practice on criminal and regulatory investigations.\nA former federal prosecutor, Mr. Blanche left a large law firm to defend Mr. Trump in this case. He is also representing Mr. Trump in the federal classified documents case and the federal election interference case.\nA lawyer for Mr. Trump since 2021, Ms. Necheles also represented the Trump Organization in the criminal tax fraud trial in Manhattan, which resulted in a conviction and $1.6 million fine. She previously represented defendants in major organized-crime and public-corruption cases.\nAs a law partner to Ms. Necheles, Mr. Stern also defended the Trump Organization in its criminal tax fraud trial and has previously represented clients charged with bribery, fraud and conspiracy.\nThe newest addition to Mr. Trump's trial team, Mr. Bove served as a federal prosecutor in New York before turning to private practice where he has represented defendants charged with white-collar crimes.","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Kate Christobek","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/nyregion/promo-trump-trial/promo-trump-trial-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@nytimes","_score":7.735229,"_id":"0fd861574e80a8553cccb2f88e0f0ba4"},{"title":"David Pecker Is the First Witness of Trump's Criminal Trial","author":"Michael Rothfeld","published_date":"2024-04-22 16:07:53","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/nyregion/david-pecker-trump-trial.html","clean_url":"nytimes.com","excerpt":"Mr. Pecker, the longtime publisher of The National Enquirer, is first on the stand at the former president's trial.","summary":"The first witness in Donald J. Trump's criminal is David Pecker, who was the publisher of The National Enquirer, and had traded favors with Mr. Trump since the 1990s.\nMr. Pecker, who was sometimes referred to as the 'tabloid king,' had long used his publications to curry favor with Mr. Trump and other celebrities, in exchange for tips or for business reasons. Staff members called Mr. Trump, like other favored stars who were off limits, an 'F.O.P.' \u2014 'Friend of Pecker.'\nMr. Trump and Mr. Pecker, along with Mr. Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen, hatched a plan in August 2015 to boost his upstart presidential campaign, prosecutors say. The former Trump allies are each expected to take a turn on the witness stand, giving testimony that could help make him the first president convicted of a felony.\nProsecutors for Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, will try to show that the hush money payment to a porn star at the center of the trial was part of a larger effort to suppress negative news about Mr. Trump to sway the election. That scheme, they will contend, includes two other deals, both involving Mr. Pecker.\nMr. Trump had announced his presidential campaign in June 2015. The plan the men laid out two months later was simple, according to court documents, interviews with people involved in the events or familiar with them, private communications and other records.\nMr. Pecker would use The Enquirer to publish positive stories about Mr. Trump's campaign and negative stories about his rivals. He would alert Mr. Trump, through Mr. Cohen, when The Enquirer learned of stories that might threaten Mr. Trump. The Enquirer could buy the rights to those stories in order to suppress them, a practice known in the tabloid world as 'catch and kill.'\nIn late 2015, Mr. Pecker's company paid $30,000 to suppress a claim by a former doorman at a Trump building who said he had heard Mr. Trump fathered a child out of wedlock \u2014 a rumor that was apparently untrue. Then in August 2016, The Enquirer's parent company paid $150,000 to a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, to keep her account of an affair with Mr. Trump quiet. Two months later, Mr. Pecker and The Enquirer's editor helped Mr. Cohen negotiate a $130,000 hush-money payment with Stormy Daniels, the former porn star who also said she had sex with Mr. Trump. He has denied both women's claims.\nMr. Cohen pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance crimes in 2018.\nThe Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., made a deal that year to avoid federal prosecution, acknowledging that it had illegally tried to influence the election.","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Michael Rothfeld","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/22/multimedia/22trump-trial-pecker-wqml/22trump-trial-pecker-wqml-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":7.643023,"_id":"3be0857bba82406e4fe2c22957efbf5e"},{"title":"Trump Demands a Cut of Donations From Campaigns That Use His Name","author":"Chris Cameron","published_date":"2024-04-17 22:25:51","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/us/politics/trump-fundraising-republicans.html","clean_url":"nytimes.com","excerpt":"The Trump campaign said that candidates using his brand should turn over at least 5 percent of donations and encouraged them to send more than the minimum.","summary":"The presidential campaign of former President Donald J. Trump said in a letter to Republican vendors that candidates may use his name, image and likeness in campaign materials only if they send at least 5 percent of donations that they receive to Mr. Trump's campaign.\nThe move in effect imposes a tax on using the Trump brand for campaign purposes. Mr. Trump has sought to close a significant financial gap between him and President Biden, his Democratic rival. The Biden campaign and its political committees reported $192 million in cash on hand at the end of March, more than double the $93 million of Trump and the Republican Party.\nDanielle Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, said in a statement that 'it is important to protect small-dollar donors from scammers that use the president's name and likeness.'\nIn a letter this week signed by Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, who identified themselves as co-campaign managers, the campaign also said it was tightening control of campaign materials that use Mr. Trump's name, prohibiting strident language that has become common in donor appeals such as 'President Trump needs you' or 'If you support President Trump, you'll contribute now.'\nThe letter said the messaging guidelines were part of an effort 'to treat our donors with the utmost respect.' After Mr. Trump appeared in court on Monday, the campaign sent a fund-raising pitch falsely claiming in all-capital letters that Mr. Trump had 'just stormed out of Biden's kangaroo court!' Mr. Trump had not actually stormed out of the Manhattan courthouse.\nThe letter added that the campaign would punish campaign vendors if candidates whom they worked with did not comply with the new rules.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

More than half of the first group of 96 were dismissed in short order after indicating that they did not believe they could be impartial.

Trump.","summary":"Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index Donald J. Trump's lawyers faced an uphill battle Monday with Justice Juan M. Merchan, a no-nonsense jurist. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab courtroom in New York City while Mr. Trump looked on. Mr. Trump was charged in Manhattan, a deeply Democratic county and his former home, with falsifying nearly three dozen business records in an attempt to cover up a payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, who has said she had a brief sexual encounter with him in 2006. Mr. Trump denies that encounter happened, and has declared his innocence, calling the charges politically motivated. He has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a Democrat, who also attended the first day of trial on Monday. Mr. Trump faces 34 felony counts and could face probation or up to four years of prison time. The trial, which is expected to last weeks, has a fascinating list of potential witnesses: Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer turned apostate, who made the payment; Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who says she, too, had an affair with Mr. Trump; and Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels herself may testify. Before any of that happens, a jury must be selected, a winnowing that began Monday. Here are five takeaways from Mr. Trump's first day on trial: Justice Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, has been consistent about batting back defense motions on issues including the tardy disclosure of documents by prosecutors and efforts to delay or even dismiss the case. That pattern continued on Monday, as Justice Merchan rejected a defense effort to force his recusal. The defense had cited several issues, including the fact that his daughter is a Democratic political consultant. He also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost. But Mr. Trump's lawyers convinced Justice Merchan that sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the so-called Access Hollywood tape, in which Mr. Trump was caught bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial, calling them 'complete rumors, complete gossip, completely hearsay.' Justice Merchan's decisions on Monday made it clear that the trial will resurface unsavory events in the former president's life. Those include the Access Hollywood tape and other stories that Mr. Trump sought to suppress including an alleged affair with Ms. McDougal. Justice Merchan said on Monday that both could be discussed. In a minor victory for the defense, the judge reaffirmed that the 'Access Hollywood' tape itself could not be played, but that Trump's exact words could be entered into the record. Still, most of Mr. Merchan's rulings indicated that salacious details of Mr. Trump's biography will be heard in court. Entering the courtroom, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here.' Once he was in front of Mr. Merchan, Mr. Trump looked a lot less enthusiastic. He slouched. He scowled. He scoffed. And he was quiet, not the norm for a man who built a political career with his gift for slashing attacks and vicious put-downs. In court, the former president spoke only briefly, when asked a few questions by Justice Merchan about procedural matters, and whether he understood the consequences \u2014 ejection or jail \u2014 if he interrupted proceedings. He did whisper with his lawyers. And when the prosecution played a recording of him claiming to have great respect for women, he mouthed the word 'true.' But all in all, it seems it could be an exhausting experience for Mr. Trump; at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep. It's easy to forget how long it takes to do a little in legal settings. On Monday, the morning session was dominated by maneuvering by prosecutors and the defense, even as prospective jurors waited. By lunch, they were still waiting. Jury selection could take days or weeks, and the trial itself may take two months. The Passover holiday could cause delays, Justice Merchan said, though he might make some of that up by holding hearings on court matters on Wednesdays, which was previously going to be an off day. By afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into Justice Merchan's courtroom. He warmly welcomed them, introduced the lawyers and Mr. Trump and read them a summary of the case. Justice Merchan asked if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president. Of the 96 prospective jurors in the room at that time, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused. The remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial. April 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET Trump spoke briefly to TV cameras after court adjourned for the day, repeating his longstanding claims that the trial is a 'political witch hunt' before heading to his motorcade and departing the courthouse. Video Reporter: [inaudible] the trial \u2014 [inaudible] So thank you very much. We had some amazing things happen today. As you know, my son is graduating from high school and it looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation of my son, who's worked very, very hard. He's a great student and he's very proud of the fact that he did so well. And was looking forward for years to have his graduation with his mother and father there. And it looks like the judges isn't going to allow me to escape this scam. It's a scam trial. If you read all of the legal pundits, all of the legal scholars today, there's not one that I see that said, this is a case that should be brought or tried. It's a scam. It's a political witch hunt.

'You don't think you should be here at all right now?' he asks. Blanche says that yes, they don't believe this trial should happen during campaign season. Merchan reminds him that his client is a criminal defendant and required to be in court \u2014 his request is denied.

DavidAs former President Donald J. Trump's first criminal trial began inside a Manhattan courthouse on Monday, the scene outside had elements of a feisty political skirmish and a surreal circus rolled into one. The streets below the courtroom drew a mix of gawkers, activists and publicity hounds, along with a large contingent of journalists. Laura Loomer, a right-wing activist known for her aggressive tactics and closeness with Mr. Trump, led a chant of 'Donald Trump Did Nothing Wrong!' alongside Andrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and Trump lawyer. 'We're going to be here every single day talking to all you fake-news media freaks,' Ms. Loomer said through a Harvey Milk-style bullhorn in a video she posted on social media. 'And letting you know that Donald Trump did nothing wrong until you start reporting the truth.' Ms. Loomer described the case as a 'witch hunt' \u2014 a frequent assertion of Mr. Trump's \u2014 and criticized a key witness for the prosecution, Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, and the wife of the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan. Mr. Trump promptly reposted the video on Truth Social \u2014 despite a gag order that bars him from attacking witnesses in the case or Justice Merchan's family. His post, made during the lunch break, came shortly before Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month on prosecutors' request that Mr. Trump be held in contempt of court over statements they say violate the order. Performance artists also vied for attention. One, known as Crackhead Barney, stood screaming outside the gates surrounding Collect Pond Park that she had been kicked out, and demanded police officers' badge numbers. Another played the flute atop a park bench, notes drifting through the wind and his instrument glinting in the sunlight. Some anti-Trump demonstrators held handmade signs emblazoned with 'Loser' and 'Convict Trump Already,' while others tried to confront Ms. Loomer. One, Sue Scarlett Montgomery, asked reporters why they were paying attention to Ms. Loomer, a former Republican candidate for Congress who previously visited a treacherous migrant crossing in Panama as part of her anti-Muslim activism. 'They're covering me because I broke the story about this corrupt judge here,' Ms. Loomer shot back, attacking Judge Merchan's daughter, a Democratic political consultant who has also been a target of Mr. Trump.

Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Everyone expected that picking a jury to try a polarizing figure like former President Donald J. Trump was going to be a challenge. But the experience of the first round of about 100 potential panelists gave a flavor of just how difficult the process could be: More than half told the judge that they could not hear the case against Mr. Trump fairly and were immediately excused. Justice Juan M. Merchan, who is presiding over the case, read aloud to the prospective jurors a list of people who might serve as witnesses or be mentioned during the trial, asking them whether they recognized the names. Many of those names were indeed very recognizable. Among those who could come up during the trial were Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump's former adviser, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and one of Mr. Trump's lawyers. Several of Mr. Trump's relatives were also on the list, including his wife, Melania, his older daughter, Ivanka, and his son-in-law Jared Kushner.  April 15, 2024, 3:28 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:28 p.m. ET The first prospective juror is a young woman of color with a business degree who reads The New York Times and watches CNN. She seemed unbothered by the need to be fair and impartial and answered questions rapidly and almost nonchalantly. April 15, 2024, 3:45 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:45 p.m. ET The second prospective juror is a white creative director with glasses who lives in Midtown. Also a Times reader (thank you prospective juror). He did not answer with any surprises. When we start to get different answers to the final series of questions \u2014 which are more political and some of which concern Trump \u2014 is when we'll get something a little more interesting. April 15, 2024, 3:46 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:46 p.m. ET The third prospective juror, asked about her hobbies, said she likes to 'go to the club.' She said it in a playful voice, prompting a big laugh from reporters in the overflow room. April 15, 2024, 3:27 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:27 p.m. ET One thing that is striking: Trump has used the previous court appearances in other cases to project an image of grandeur. That is hard to do in this dingy courtroom, which smells slightly off and where he is an island amid a sea of people. April 15, 2024, 3:25 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:25 p.m. ET Prospective jurors who have not indicated that they wish to be dismissed are now being seated to answer the 42 questions that lawyers have agreed upon. They are being seated by jury identification number. April 15, 2024, 3:26 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:26 p.m. ET Trump is reading along with the juror questionnaire as the first possible juror, a young woman, ticks through her answers. April 15, 2024, 3:11 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:11 p.m. ET Of the 96 possible jurors brought into the room, more than 50 raised their hands to say they couldn't be fair. They were immediately excused. April 15, 2024, 3:11 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:11 p.m. ET Trump turned and stared at possible jurors as they raised their hands indicating they couldn't be fair in the case. April 15, 2024, 3:12 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:12 p.m. ET It's remarkable that more than half of the potential jurors brought in for a first round of questioning immediately said they could not hear Trump's case fairly. We knew that it would be hard to pick a jury, but a fail rate of 50 percent or higher right out of the gate is surpassingly rare.  April 15, 2024, 3:05 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:05 p.m. ET Among the notable names that the judge just read out as potential witnesses or people who could come up were Stephen K. Bannon, Rudy Giuliani, Melania Trump and Jared Kushner. Not all will appear as witnesses or even potentially be mentioned. But it certainly gives jurors a sense of the cast of characters.  The jury selection process in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan could take two weeks or more. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Lawyers representing the State of New York and Donald J. Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate. The potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair. The process could take two weeks or more \u2014 and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court. 'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.' The stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County \u2014 Manhattan, as most people know it \u2014 which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020. Mr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated. Prosecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28. Unlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.' Some may not be completely forthcoming. 'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said. Mr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors. 'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'     Former President Donald J. Trump smirked and scoffed during pretrial proceedings on Monday in Manhattan. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Former President Donald J. Trump seemed alternately irritated and exhausted Monday morning, as his lawyers and prosecutors hashed out pretrial motions before jury selection in his criminal case. Even as a judge was hearing arguments on last-minute issues in a criminal case that centers on salacious allegations and threatens to upend his bid for the presidency, Mr. Trump appeared to nod off a few times, his mouth going slack and his head drooping onto his chest. The former president's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, passed him notes for several minutes before Mr. Trump appeared to jolt awake and notice them. At other times, Mr. Trump whispered and exchanged notes with Mr. Blanche. He sat motionless while his own words from the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape \u2014 on which bragged about grabbing women's genitals \u2014 were read from a transcript by a prosecutor. At times, Mr. Trump's emotions were characteristically on display. He smirked and scoffed, and appeared frustrated when the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, did not immediately agree that he could miss court to attend the graduation of his youngest son, Barron. But when Justice Merchan warned that Mr. Trump could be ejected or thrown in jail if he disrupts the proceedings, the former president indicated that he understood. The only time Mr. Trump showed a flash of humor was when he laughed at one of his own social media posts, which attacked his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be the prosecution's central witness.  Former President Donald J. Trump's comments on the 'Access Hollywood' tape will allowed to be introduced as evidence. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times The judge in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial on Monday again refused to allow the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape to be played for jurors, but said that the comments Mr. Trump made on the tape could be introduced as evidence. On the tape, revealed in The Washington Post about a month before Mr. Trump was elected president in 2016, he is heard bragging about grabbing women's genitals, saying he could do so with abandon because 'when you're a star, they let you do it.' 'You can do anything,' Mr. Trump said on the recording. The tape rocked Mr. Trump's campaign. And prosecutors in Manhattan say it led him to agree to pay off Stormy Daniels, a porn star, who was shopping a story of a 2006 sexual encounter with the candidate. Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, paid Ms. Daniels $130,000. The payment is at the heart of the 34 felony charges against Mr. Trump, who is accused of falsifying business records to cover it up. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, had previously ruled that prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office could question witnesses about the tape, but found that it would be prejudicial to allow the actual video to the played. He reaffirmed that ruling on Monday. 'You can bring out what was said in the tape,' Justice Merchan said, adding that he didn't want jurors 'to hear Mr. Trump's voice and his gestures' in the tape. In a victory for the defense, the judge also ruled that the prosecution could not introduce evidence about sexual assault allegations against Mr. Trump that surfaced in the aftermath of the tape becoming public, calling them 'complete hearsay.' However, Justice Merchan said that prosecutors could introduce emails that followed the tape's disclosure, showing frantic efforts by Trump advisers to contain the fallout. The correspondence, he said, 'bolsters the people's claim that this was a crucial event.' Todd Blanche, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, had called on Justice Merchan to reconsider admitting 'this extremely salacious evidence,' which he described as 'very prejudicial.' Mr. Trump, who is again the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has denied any wrongdoing and has cast the case against him as politically motivated. Justice Juan M. Merchan has already reprimanded Donald J. Trump's lawyers for arguments that he considered frivolous. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Inside a dreary Lower Manhattan courtroom on a recent Wednesday, Justice Juan M. Merchan convened a special session for people with mental health troubles who had landed in legal jeopardy. He calmly counseled them, praised any signs of progress and shook the hand of one man who, thanks to medication, had turned his life around. But a different type of criminal defendant is now testing the judge's equanimity: Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump's trial on charges that he covered up a sex scandal before and after the 2016 presidential election will bring a maelstrom that no other judge in New York's vast judiciary has ever experienced. Known as a no-nonsense, drama-averse jurist, Justice Merchan, 61, has already reprimanded Mr. Trump's lawyers for arguments that he considered frivolous and issued a gag order intended to protect prosecutors, witnesses and his own family from Mr. Trump's vitriol \u2014 and yet the former president has continued to post articles with pictures of the judge's daughter, a political consultant who has worked with Democratic candidates. Although Justice Merchan is a registered Democrat, records show he was previously a Republican, and people who know him described the judge as a moderate, law-and-order former prosecutor. Two people close to Justice Merchan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the judge had privately expressed pain over the attacks on his daughter, but the people said that those attacks won't compromise his ability to oversee the case. Other people who know the judge said that he will cast aside Mr. Trump's drama \u2014 and exert control over the trial. 'It is Judge Merchan's show,' said Jill Konviser, a retired judge who has known Justice Merchan for more than 15 years. She added: 'He will do everything he can to, one, control his courtroom and two, ensure a fair trial for the defendant.' In Justice Merchan's 17 years on the bench, 13 as presiding judge in the Mental Health Court he created, he has had his share of unusual cases. There was a murder trial involving a supposed curse on the defendant; the daredevils who jumped off the World Trade Center with parachutes; and a so-called soccer-mom madam accused of running a high-end brothel on the Upper East Side. In that case, an appeals court reduced the steep bail Justice Merchan had set, calling it 'unreasonable.' None of those defendants challenged the judge quite like Mr. Trump, who claims that the case is a witch hunt and declared that Justice Merchan's gag order had infringed on his First Amendment rights. The former president has tested the order's limits by posting articles that named and attacked Justice Merchan's daughter, Loren, and his wife, Lara. The articles, by the conservative activist Laura Loomer, included photos of Loren Merchan and copies of a 2007 mortgage statement for a house owned by Justice Merchan and his wife. Previously, Mr. Trump falsely accused Loren Merchan of posting an image of him behind bars on social media. The trial, which could last two months as a parade of former aides and allies takes the stand against him, will dominate Justice Merchan's calendar this spring. On off-days, he will continue to preside over Mental Health Court. The program is for defendants charged with felonies and diagnosed with a serious mental illness. People who are accepted enter a guilty plea and then begin a period of treatment and judicial supervision. Those who complete the program successfully can have their charges reduced or dismissed. During one recent session, Justice Merchan showed particular interest in the relationship between a defendant and his child, and praised him for his dedication. 'You want to do better by your daughter,' Justice Merchan said. 'I'm sure she's going to appreciate that.'  Donald J. Trump has repeatedly tried to have Juan M. Merchan removed as the judge in his case. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Juan M. Merchan, the judge overseeing Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan, has declined to step aside from the case, rejecting the former president's effort to delay the trial and attack his integrity. The judge announced the decision in the opening minutes of Mr. Trump's trial on Monday morning. After Justice Merchan rules on a variety of legal issues, the trial will begin in earnest with jury selection. 'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said Monday before rejecting the request. 'We want to follow the law,' he added. 'We want justice to be done.' Mr. Trump's lawyers had called on Justice Merchan to recuse himself in a recent court filing, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. The Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case that accuses Mr. Trump of falsifying records to conceal a sex scandal from voters, had argued that no conflict of interest existed. And judicial ethics experts cast doubt on Mr. Trump's request, noting that the judge was not responsible for his daughter's career. It was just the latest attempt by Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, to both delay the trial and oust Justice Merchan. Nor will it be the last: In a separate civil action filed last week, Mr. Trump asked an appeals court to pause the case while it considers whether to remove Justice Merchan. It is a long-shot bid that a single appeals court judge rejected and will be likely to fail before a full five-judge panel. When Mr. Trump tried last year to have Justice Merchan kicked off the case, Justice Merchan rejected it then as well, citing a state advisory committee on judicial ethics that determined that his impartiality could not reasonably be questioned based on his daughter's interests. The repeated attempts reflect the former president's long-running effort to delay all four of his criminal cases past Election Day. Stalling is one of Mr. Trump's favored legal tactics, and he uses it liberally in Manhattan, as well as in the three other cities where he faces criminal charges. If Mr. Trump reclaims the White House, the criminal cases against him would most likely grind to a halt. In the attempt in appeals court to compel the judge's recusal, Emil Bove, a lawyer for the former president, argued that certain facts had changed since Justice Merchan first declined to step aside last year, including that Mr. Trump was now the presumptive Republican nominee for president. But a lawyer for the court system, Lisa Evans, said that there was no reason that the judge should step aside. 'There is absolutely no evidence to show that Judge Merchan will stand to benefit from the outcome of this trial,' Ms. Evans said.

Adam Gray/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images The streets outside the Manhattan courtroom where former President Donald J. Trump was set to go on trial were buzzing with anticipation on Monday morning as a crush of reporters \u2014 and a trickle of protesters \u2014 gathered to bear witness. Right-wing activists were planning rallies in the park directly opposite the court, which was subject to a heavy police presence. Some journalists and line-sitters had arrived late Sunday night, staking out places in the line to secure limited spaces inside the court's overflow room, where most reporters were gathered. Cameras lined the sidewalks outside the courthouse, a glowering edifice at 100 Centre Street, just blocks from New York's City Hall. TV crews were going live in intervals since before dawn, even as the police manned metal barricades. As the sun rose, some anti-Trump demonstrators had arrived, including one toting a sign reading 'Loser,' a favorite insult of the former president. Nadine Seiler, 58, took a midnight bus from Waldorf, Md., to get to the courthouse by dawn. 'This is the first and possibly only trial he's going to be on,' she said, holding up a spray-painted sheet reading 'Convict Trump Already.' Mr. Trump also had fans outside the courthouse, including Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist who argued with an anti-Trump protester as a gaggle of journalists surrounded them. Andrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City and lawyer for Mr. Trump, also came by to show support, arguing that the trial was a political persecution. 'He's somebody who I consider to be a mentor, almost like an uncle to me,' said Mr. Giuliani. Noting Mr. Trump's status as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Mr. Giuliani claimed: 'They want to tie him up for months at a time.' Others were simply there to witness the moment. 'I think it's a really difficult moment in American history,' said Sue Scarlett Montgomery, a filmmaker. 'It's a sad day, but here we are.'  The first criminal trial of an American president officially began on Monday as prosecutors and defense lawyers convened in a Manhattan courtroom to start selecting the jury that will decide Donald J. Trump's fate. The initial pool of prospective jurors dwindled rapidly. More than half of the first group of 96 were dismissed in short order after indicating that they did not believe they could be impartial. Court adjourned for the day roughly two hours after jury selection began, with zero jurors chosen. Before beginning the arduous process of choosing a jury for the landmark trial \u2014 on allegations that Mr. Trump falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star \u2014 the judge overseeing the case once again declined to step aside, rejecting Mr. Trump's latest effort to oust him. But there was also a ruling that favored the former president: The judge, Juan M. Merchan, rejected a request by prosecutors to introduce accusations of sexual assault that women lodged against Mr. Trump years ago, calling them 'rumors' and 'complete gossip.' The Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case against Mr. Trump, also asked the judge to hold Mr. Trump in contempt and penalize him $3,000 for violating a gag order barring him from attacking witnesses in the case. On social media over the weekend, Mr. Trump assailed one of the prosecution's key witnesses: Michael D. Cohen, his former fixer. Mr. Cohen paid $130,000 to the porn star, Stormy Daniels, during the 2016 presidential campaign to keep quiet about a sexual encounter she said she had with Mr. Trump. After the lunch break \u2014 during which Mr. Trump posted a video of an ally yelling about the judge's wife \u2014 Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month to discuss potential violations of the gag order, which also bars Mr. Trump from attacking the judge's family. The jury selection process could take two weeks or more, and the trial may spill into June. Mr. Trump is expected to be in the courtroom for much of it. Mr. Trump seemed alternately irritated and exhausted during pretrial arguments on Monday, sometimes smirking and scoffing, but also appearing to nod off, his mouth slack and his head drooping to his chest. After the trial got underway in the afternoon, he chuckled when Justice Merchan told the first group of 96 prospective jurors that he would ensure a fair trial. Mr. Trump, who might take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied the sexual encounter with Ms. Daniels. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records to hide the reimbursements to Mr. Cohen. They argue the payment to Ms. Daniels was part of a pattern: Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election. Here's what else to know about Mr. Trump's trial: This is the Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump, and it was brought by the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a year ago. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. The case, one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America. Mr. Trump's team will be looking for red needles in a blue haystack.\nMr. Trump has twice sought Justice Merchan's recusal, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. Justice Merchan has declined to step aside, noting a ruling by a judicial ethics commission that found his daughter's work posed no conflict for him. 'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said in court on Monday, adding, 'we want to follow the law, we want justice to be done.' Mr. Trump has also attacked the judge's daughter on social media.\nHundreds of potential jurors have been summoned. Those who say they cannot be fair or otherwise serve are being excused, and the remaining prospective jurors will answer 42 questions compiled before the trial. Lawyers on both sides will be able to remove a limited number of them without explanation. The lawyers can also ask to remove a potential juror 'for cause' by providing specific reasons they believe that person cannot be fair. In addition to the payment to Ms. Daniels, Mr. Bragg's office is expected to highlight two other deals involving The National Enquirer, a tabloid that has longstanding ties to Mr. Trump. In one deal, the tabloid bought the silence of a man who had heard that Mr. Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock, a rumor that turned out to be false, and in the other, it paid Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, who wanted to sell her story of an affair with Mr. Trump.\nThe prosecution's witness list is expected to include David Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, as well as Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal could also testify. Prospective jurors will answer a uniform set of questions aimed at discerning bias for or against the former president. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Follow our live coverage of Trump's hush money trial . The hundreds of New Yorkers who report for jury duty Monday morning in Manhattan will embark on an experience not found in history books: They will be vetted as jurors for the trial of a former U.S. president. The task won't be easy. Lawyers for Donald J. Trump and prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney's office will narrow the pool to 12 jurors and several alternates. Both sides will try to discern biases that could alter the outcome of the trial, posing dozens of questions that have been discussed and debated for weeks. The jurors, for their part, will be expected to answer each question honestly in an intimidating environment, just steps away from the former president, who is expected to attend much of the trial. Here's what we know about the process: The jury pool is composed of Manhattanites. Beyond that, little about the group is known, even by prosecutors and defense lawyers. Both sides will use the next several days, or weeks, to find out all they can. Because New York State does not allow juries to operate in full anonymity, the parties, including the former president, will know the jurors' names. The lawyers will also have access to their addresses. (Mr. Trump will not.) The public may never know the jurors' names. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, granted the prosecutors' request to withhold them. After reading a summary of the allegations, Justice Merchan will ask the prospective jurors whether they believe they can be fair and impartial. They will also be asked if they have any scheduling conflicts that would prevent them from attending every day of the trial, which could last more than six weeks. Those who raise concerns will most likely be removed from the pool. The jurors who remain will all be asked the same set of questions. One by one, they will talk \u2014 briefly and vaguely \u2014 about what they do for a living, their education and their families. They will be asked where they get their news, what radio and podcasts they listen to and whether they've read books written by Mr. Trump or his former fixer Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be a central witness. Other questions will be more pointed. Jurors will be asked if they've ever volunteered or attended a campaign event for Mr. Trump or one of his opponents. They will also be asked to divulge feelings or opinions they have about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case. But the jurors will not be asked how they voted in past elections, whom they plan to vote for, whether they have made political contributions or their party registration. Mr. Trump's legal team and prosecutors for the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, can challenge the inclusion of prospective jurors by providing specific reasons they believe a juror cannot be fair and impartial. The judge has the final say. Both sides will also receive a certain number of chances to remove jurors without explanation. After all of the challenged jurors are removed from the jury pool, Justice Merchan will seat the jury with those who remain. If Mr. Trump's behavior at previous trials is any guide, he is likely to be very involved in jury selection. In a previous defamation case, Mr. Trump was fixated on the jurors from the moment they walked into the courtroom. He pivoted in his chair to study them as they answered biographical questions. He frequently talked to his attorneys. But Mr. Trump's comments about the jurors in this case should start and stop in the courtroom. In addition to being ordered not to reveal their names, Mr. Trump is also subject to a gag order issued by Justice Merchan preventing him from making public statements about them.  \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nDonald J. Trump's lawyers faced an uphill battle Monday with Justice Juan M. Merchan, a no-nonsense jurist. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab courtroom in New York City while Mr. Trump looked on.\nMr. Trump was charged in Manhattan, a deeply Democratic county and his former home, with falsifying nearly three dozen business records in an attempt to cover up a payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, who has said she had a brief sexual encounter with him in 2006.\nMr. Trump denies that encounter happened, and has declared his innocence, calling the charges politically motivated. He has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a Democrat, who also attended the first day of trial on Monday.\nMr. Trump faces 34 felony counts and could face probation or up to four years of prison time.\nThe trial, which is expected to last weeks, has a fascinating list of potential witnesses: Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer turned apostate, who made the payment; Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who says she, too, had an affair with Mr. Trump; and Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels herself may testify.\nBefore any of that happens, a jury must be selected, a winnowing that began Monday.\nHere are five takeaways from Mr. Trump's first day on trial:\nJustice Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, has been consistent about batting back defense motions on issues including the tardy disclosure of documents by prosecutors and efforts to delay or even dismiss the case.\nThat pattern continued on Monday, as Justice Merchan rejected a defense effort to force his recusal. The defense had cited several issues, including the fact that his daughter is a Democratic political consultant.\nHe also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost.\nBut Mr. Trump's lawyers convinced Justice Merchan that sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the so-called Access Hollywood tape, in which Mr. Trump was caught bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial, calling them 'complete rumors, complete gossip, completely hearsay.'\nJustice Merchan's decisions on Monday made it clear that the trial will resurface unsavory events in the former president's life.\nThose include the Access Hollywood tape and other stories that Mr. Trump sought to suppress including an alleged affair with Ms. McDougal. Justice Merchan said on Monday that both could be discussed.\nIn a minor victory for the defense, the judge reaffirmed that the 'Access Hollywood' tape itself could not be played, but that Trump's exact words could be entered into the record.\nStill, most of Mr. Merchan's rulings indicated that salacious details of Mr. Trump's biography will be heard in court.\nEntering the courtroom, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here.'\nOnce he was in front of Mr. Merchan, Mr. Trump looked a lot less enthusiastic. He slouched. He scowled. He scoffed. And he was quiet, not the norm for a man who built a political career with his gift for slashing attacks and vicious put-downs.\nIn court, the former president spoke only briefly, when asked a few questions by Justice Merchan about procedural matters, and whether he understood the consequences \u2014 ejection or jail \u2014 if he interrupted proceedings. He did whisper with his lawyers. And when the prosecution played a recording of him claiming to have great respect for women, he mouthed the word 'true.'\nBut all in all, it seems it could be an exhausting experience for Mr. Trump; at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep.\nIt's easy to forget how long it takes to do a little in legal settings. On Monday, the morning session was dominated by maneuvering by prosecutors and the defense, even as prospective jurors waited. By lunch, they were still waiting.\nJury selection could take days or weeks, and the trial itself may take two months. The Passover holiday could cause delays, Justice Merchan said, though he might make some of that up by holding hearings on court matters on Wednesdays, which was previously going to be an off day.\nBy afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into Justice Merchan's courtroom. He warmly welcomed them, introduced the lawyers and Mr. Trump and read them a summary of the case.\nJustice Merchan asked if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president. Of the 96 prospective jurors in the room at that time, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused.\nThe remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.\nApril 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET Trump spoke briefly to TV cameras after court adjourned for the day, repeating his longstanding claims that the trial is a 'political witch hunt' before heading to his motorcade and departing the courthouse.\nVideo Reporter: [inaudible] the trial \u2014 [inaudible] So thank you very much. We had some amazing things happen today. As you know, my son is graduating from high school and it looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation of my son, who's worked very, very hard. He's a great student and he's very proud of the fact that he did so well. And was looking forward for years to have his graduation with his mother and father there. And it looks like the judges isn't going to allow me to escape this scam. It's a scam trial. If you read all of the legal pundits, all of the legal scholars today, there's not one that I see that said, this is a case that should be brought or tried. It's a scam.

DavidAs former President Donald J. Trump's first criminal trial began inside a Manhattan courthouse on Monday, the scene outside had elements of a feisty political skirmish and a surreal circus rolled into one.\nThe streets below the courtroom drew a mix of gawkers, activists and publicity hounds, along with a large contingent of journalists.\nLaura Loomer, a right-wing activist known for her aggressive tactics and closeness with Mr. Trump, led a chant of 'Donald Trump Did Nothing Wrong!' alongside Andrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and Trump lawyer.\n'We're going to be here every single day talking to all you fake-news media freaks,' Ms. Loomer said through a Harvey Milk-style bullhorn in a video she posted on social media. 'And letting you know that Donald Trump did nothing wrong until you start reporting the truth.'\nMs. Loomer described the case as a 'witch hunt' \u2014 a frequent assertion of Mr. Trump's \u2014 and criticized a key witness for the prosecution, Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, and the wife of the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan.\nMr. Trump promptly reposted the video on Truth Social \u2014 despite a gag order that bars him from attacking witnesses in the case or Justice Merchan's family. His post, made during the lunch break, came shortly before Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month on prosecutors' request that Mr. Trump be held in contempt of court over statements they say violate the order.\nPerformance artists also vied for attention. One, known as Crackhead Barney, stood screaming outside the gates surrounding Collect Pond Park that she had been kicked out, and demanded police officers' badge numbers. Another played the flute atop a park bench, notes drifting through the wind and his instrument glinting in the sunlight.\nSome anti-Trump demonstrators held handmade signs emblazoned with 'Loser' and 'Convict Trump Already,' while others tried to confront Ms. Loomer. One, Sue Scarlett Montgomery, asked reporters why they were paying attention to Ms. Loomer, a former Republican candidate for Congress who previously visited a treacherous migrant crossing in Panama as part of her anti-Muslim activism.\n'They're covering me because I broke the story about this corrupt judge here,' Ms. Loomer shot back, attacking Judge Merchan's daughter, a Democratic political consultant who has also been a target of Mr. Trump.\nApril 15, 2024, 4:15 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 4:15 p.m. ET The latest potential juror to be questioned reads The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, but is also the first person to say they are a New York Post reader.

Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate.\nThe potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair.\nThe process could take two weeks or more \u2014 and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court.\n'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.'\nThe stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County \u2014 Manhattan, as most people know it \u2014 which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020.\nMr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions.\nMr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated.\nProsecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28.\nUnlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.'\nSome may not be completely forthcoming.\n'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said.\nMr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors.\n'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J.

Trump seemed alternately irritated and exhausted Monday morning, as his lawyers and prosecutors hashed out pretrial motions before jury selection in his criminal case.\nEven as a judge was hearing arguments on last-minute issues in a criminal case that centers on salacious allegations and threatens to upend his bid for the presidency, Mr. Trump appeared to nod off a few times, his mouth going slack and his head drooping onto his chest.\nThe former president's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, passed him notes for several minutes before Mr. Trump appeared to jolt awake and notice them.\nAt other times, Mr. Trump whispered and exchanged notes with Mr. Blanche. He sat motionless while his own words from the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape \u2014 on which bragged about grabbing women's genitals \u2014 were read from a transcript by a prosecutor.\nAt times, Mr. Trump's emotions were characteristically on display. He smirked and scoffed, and appeared frustrated when the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, did not immediately agree that he could miss court to attend the graduation of his youngest son, Barron.\nBut when Justice Merchan warned that Mr. Trump could be ejected or thrown in jail if he disrupts the proceedings, the former president indicated that he understood.\nThe only time Mr. Trump showed a flash of humor was when he laughed at one of his own social media posts, which attacked his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be the prosecution's central witness.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J. Trump's comments on the 'Access Hollywood' tape will allowed to be introduced as evidence. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times The judge in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial on Monday again refused to allow the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape to be played for jurors, but said that the comments Mr. Trump made on the tape could be introduced as evidence.\nOn the tape, revealed in The Washington Post about a month before Mr. Trump was elected president in 2016, he is heard bragging about grabbing women's genitals, saying he could do so with abandon because 'when you're a star, they let you do it.'\n'You can do anything,' Mr. Trump said on the recording.\nThe tape rocked Mr. Trump's campaign. And prosecutors in Manhattan say it led him to agree to pay off Stormy Daniels, a porn star, who was shopping a story of a 2006 sexual encounter with the candidate.\nMichael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, paid Ms. Daniels $130,000. The payment is at the heart of the 34 felony charges against Mr. Trump, who is accused of falsifying business records to cover it up.\nThe judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, had previously ruled that prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office could question witnesses about the tape, but found that it would be prejudicial to allow the actual video to the played. He reaffirmed that ruling on Monday.\n'You can bring out what was said in the tape,' Justice Merchan said, adding that he didn't want jurors 'to hear Mr. Trump's voice and his gestures' in the tape.\nIn a victory for the defense, the judge also ruled that the prosecution could not introduce evidence about sexual assault allegations against Mr. Trump that surfaced in the aftermath of the tape becoming public, calling them 'complete hearsay.'\nHowever, Justice Merchan said that prosecutors could introduce emails that followed the tape's disclosure, showing frantic efforts by Trump advisers to contain the fallout. The correspondence, he said, 'bolsters the people's claim that this was a crucial event.'\nTodd Blanche, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, had called on Justice Merchan to reconsider admitting 'this extremely salacious evidence,' which he described as 'very prejudicial.'\nMr. Trump, who is again the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has denied any wrongdoing and has cast the case against him as politically motivated.\nJustice Juan M. Merchan has already reprimanded Donald J. Trump's lawyers for arguments that he considered frivolous. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Inside a dreary Lower Manhattan courtroom on a recent Wednesday, Justice Juan M. Merchan convened a special session for people with mental health troubles who had landed in legal jeopardy. He calmly counseled them, praised any signs of progress and shook the hand of one man who, thanks to medication, had turned his life around.\nBut a different type of criminal defendant is now testing the judge's equanimity: Donald J. Trump.\nMr. Trump's trial on charges that he covered up a sex scandal before and after the 2016 presidential election will bring a maelstrom that no other judge in New York's vast judiciary has ever experienced.\nKnown as a no-nonsense, drama-averse jurist, Justice Merchan, 61, has already reprimanded Mr. Trump's lawyers for arguments that he considered frivolous and issued a gag order intended to protect prosecutors, witnesses and his own family from Mr. Trump's vitriol \u2014 and yet the former president has continued to post articles with pictures of the judge's daughter, a political consultant who has worked with Democratic candidates.\nAlthough Justice Merchan is a registered Democrat, records show he was previously a Republican, and people who know him described the judge as a moderate, law-and-order former prosecutor.\nTwo people close to Justice Merchan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the judge had privately expressed pain over the attacks on his daughter, but the people said that those attacks won't compromise his ability to oversee the case. Other people who know the judge said that he will cast aside Mr. Trump's drama \u2014 and exert control over the trial.\n'It is Judge Merchan's show,' said Jill Konviser, a retired judge who has known Justice Merchan for more than 15 years. She added: 'He will do everything he can to, one, control his courtroom and two, ensure a fair trial for the defendant.'\nIn Justice Merchan's 17 years on the bench, 13 as presiding judge in the Mental Health Court he created, he has had his share of unusual cases. There was a murder trial involving a supposed curse on the defendant; the daredevils who jumped off the World Trade Center with parachutes; and a so-called soccer-mom madam accused of running a high-end brothel on the Upper East Side. In that case, an appeals court reduced the steep bail Justice Merchan had set, calling it 'unreasonable.'\nNone of those defendants challenged the judge quite like Mr. Trump, who claims that the case is a witch hunt and declared that Justice Merchan's gag order had infringed on his First Amendment rights.\nThe former president has tested the order's limits by posting articles that named and attacked Justice Merchan's daughter, Loren, and his wife, Lara. The articles, by the conservative activist Laura Loomer, included photos of Loren Merchan and copies of a 2007 mortgage statement for a house owned by Justice Merchan and his wife. Previously, Mr. Trump falsely accused Loren Merchan of posting an image of him behind bars on social media.\nThe trial, which could last two months as a parade of former aides and allies takes the stand against him, will dominate Justice Merchan's calendar this spring.\nOn off-days, he will continue to preside over Mental Health Court. The program is for defendants charged with felonies and diagnosed with a serious mental illness. People who are accepted enter a guilty plea and then begin a period of treatment and judicial supervision. Those who complete the program successfully can have their charges reduced or dismissed.\nDuring one recent session, Justice Merchan showed particular interest in the relationship between a defendant and his child, and praised him for his dedication.\n'You want to do better by your daughter,' Justice Merchan said. 'I'm sure she's going to appreciate that.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Donald J. Trump has repeatedly tried to have Juan M. Merchan removed as the judge in his case. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Juan M. Merchan, the judge overseeing Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan, has declined to step aside from the case, rejecting the former president's effort to delay the trial and attack his integrity.\nThe judge announced the decision in the opening minutes of Mr. Trump's trial on Monday morning. After Justice Merchan rules on a variety of legal issues, the trial will begin in earnest with jury selection.\n'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said Monday before rejecting the request. 'We want to follow the law,' he added. 'We want justice to be done.'\nMr. Trump's lawyers had called on Justice Merchan to recuse himself in a recent court filing, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant.\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case that accuses Mr. Trump of falsifying records to conceal a sex scandal from voters, had argued that no conflict of interest existed. And judicial ethics experts cast doubt on Mr. Trump's request, noting that the judge was not responsible for his daughter's career.\nIt was just the latest attempt by Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, to both delay the trial and oust Justice Merchan. Nor will it be the last: In a separate civil action filed last week, Mr. Trump asked an appeals court to pause the case while it considers whether to remove Justice Merchan. It is a long-shot bid that a single appeals court judge rejected and will be likely to fail before a full five-judge panel.\nWhen Mr. Trump tried last year to have Justice Merchan kicked off the case, Justice Merchan rejected it then as well, citing a state advisory committee on judicial ethics that determined that his impartiality could not reasonably be questioned based on his daughter's interests.\nThe repeated attempts reflect the former president's long-running effort to delay all four of his criminal cases past Election Day. Stalling is one of Mr. Trump's favored legal tactics, and he uses it liberally in Manhattan, as well as in the three other cities where he faces criminal charges. If Mr. Trump reclaims the White House, the criminal cases against him would most likely grind to a halt.\nIn the attempt in appeals court to compel the judge's recusal, Emil Bove, a lawyer for the former president, argued that certain facts had changed since Justice Merchan first declined to step aside last year, including that Mr. Trump was now the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\nBut a lawyer for the court system, Lisa Evans, said that there was no reason that the judge should step aside.\n'There is absolutely no evidence to show that Judge Merchan will stand to benefit from the outcome of this trial,' Ms. Evans said.\nVideo transcript\nTrump Supporters Rally Outside New York Courthouse Pro-Trump protesters gathered near the Manhattan courthouse where the former president's criminal trial is taking place.

Trump was set to go on trial were buzzing with anticipation on Monday morning as a crush of reporters \u2014 and a trickle of protesters \u2014 gathered to bear witness.\nRight-wing activists were planning rallies in the park directly opposite the court, which was subject to a heavy police presence. Some journalists and line-sitters had arrived late Sunday night, staking out places in the line to secure limited spaces inside the court's overflow room, where most reporters were gathered.\nCameras lined the sidewalks outside the courthouse, a glowering edifice at 100 Centre Street, just blocks from New York's City Hall. TV crews were going live in intervals since before dawn, even as the police manned metal barricades. As the sun rose, some anti-Trump demonstrators had arrived, including one toting a sign reading 'Loser,' a favorite insult of the former president.\nNadine Seiler, 58, took a midnight bus from Waldorf, Md., to get to the courthouse by dawn. 'This is the first and possibly only trial he's going to be on,' she said, holding up a spray-painted sheet reading 'Convict Trump Already.'\nMr. Trump also had fans outside the courthouse, including Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist who argued with an anti-Trump protester as a gaggle of journalists surrounded them.\nAndrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City and lawyer for Mr. Trump, also came by to show support, arguing that the trial was a political persecution.\n'He's somebody who I consider to be a mentor, almost like an uncle to me,' said Mr. Giuliani.\nNoting Mr. Trump's status as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Mr. Giuliani claimed: 'They want to tie him up for months at a time.'\nOthers were simply there to witness the moment. 'I think it's a really difficult moment in American history,' said Sue Scarlett Montgomery, a filmmaker. 'It's a sad day, but here we are.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT The first criminal trial of an American president officially began on Monday as prosecutors and defense lawyers convened in a Manhattan courtroom to start selecting the jury that will decide Donald J. Trump's fate.\nThe initial pool of prospective jurors dwindled rapidly. More than half of the first group of 96 were dismissed in short order after indicating that they did not believe they could be impartial. Court adjourned for the day roughly two hours after jury selection began, with zero jurors chosen.\nBefore beginning the arduous process of choosing a jury for the landmark trial \u2014 on allegations that Mr. Trump falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star \u2014 the judge overseeing the case once again declined to step aside, rejecting Mr. Trump's latest effort to oust him.\nBut there was also a ruling that favored the former president: The judge, Juan M. Merchan, rejected a request by prosecutors to introduce accusations of sexual assault that women lodged against Mr. Trump years ago, calling them 'rumors' and 'complete gossip.'\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case against Mr. Trump, also asked the judge to hold Mr. Trump in contempt and penalize him $3,000 for violating a gag order barring him from attacking witnesses in the case.\nOn social media over the weekend, Mr. Trump assailed one of the prosecution's key witnesses: Michael D. Cohen, his former fixer. Mr. Cohen paid $130,000 to the porn star, Stormy Daniels, during the 2016 presidential campaign to keep quiet about a sexual encounter she said she had with Mr. Trump.\nAfter the lunch break \u2014 during which Mr. Trump posted a video of an ally yelling about the judge's wife \u2014 Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month to discuss potential violations of the gag order, which also bars Mr. Trump from attacking the judge's family.\nThe jury selection process could take two weeks or more, and the trial may spill into June. Mr. Trump is expected to be in the courtroom for much of it.\nMr. Trump seemed alternately irritated and exhausted during pretrial arguments on Monday, sometimes smirking and scoffing, but also appearing to nod off, his mouth slack and his head drooping to his chest. After the trial got underway in the afternoon, he chuckled when Justice Merchan told the first group of 96 prospective jurors that he would ensure a fair trial.\nMr. Trump, who might take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied the sexual encounter with Ms. Daniels. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records to hide the reimbursements to Mr. Cohen. They argue the payment to Ms. Daniels was part of a pattern: Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election.\nHere's what else to know about Mr. Trump's trial:\nThis is the Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump, and it was brought by the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a year ago. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. The case, one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America. Mr. Trump's team will be looking for red needles in a blue haystack.\nMr. Trump has twice sought Justice Merchan's recusal, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. Justice Merchan has declined to step aside, noting a ruling by a judicial ethics commission that found his daughter's work posed no conflict for him. 'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said in court on Monday, adding, 'we want to follow the law, we want justice to be done.' Mr. Trump has also attacked the judge's daughter on social media.\nHundreds of potential jurors have been summoned. Those who say they cannot be fair or otherwise serve are being excused, and the remaining prospective jurors will answer 42 questions compiled before the trial. Lawyers on both sides will be able to remove a limited number of them without explanation. The lawyers can also ask to remove a potential juror 'for cause' by providing specific reasons they believe that person cannot be fair.\nIn addition to the payment to Ms. Daniels, Mr. Bragg's office is expected to highlight two other deals involving The National Enquirer, a tabloid that has longstanding ties to Mr. Trump. In one deal, the tabloid bought the silence of a man who had heard that Mr. Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock, a rumor that turned out to be false, and in the other, it paid Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, who wanted to sell her story of an affair with Mr. Trump.\nThe prosecution's witness list is expected to include David Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, as well as Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal could also testify.\nProspective jurors will answer a uniform set of questions aimed at discerning bias for or against the former president. Credit...

Lawyers for Donald J. Trump and prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney's office will narrow the pool to 12 jurors and several alternates. Both sides will try to discern biases that could alter the outcome of the trial, posing dozens of questions that have been discussed and debated for weeks.\nThe jurors, for their part, will be expected to answer each question honestly in an intimidating environment, just steps away from the former president, who is expected to attend much of the trial.\nHere's what we know about the process:\nThe jury pool is composed of Manhattanites. Beyond that, little about the group is known, even by prosecutors and defense lawyers. Both sides will use the next several days, or weeks, to find out all they can.\nBecause New York State does not allow juries to operate in full anonymity, the parties, including the former president, will know the jurors' names. The lawyers will also have access to their addresses. (Mr. Trump will not.)\nThe public may never know the jurors' names. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, granted the prosecutors' request to withhold them.\nAfter reading a summary of the allegations, Justice Merchan will ask the prospective jurors whether they believe they can be fair and impartial. They will also be asked if they have any scheduling conflicts that would prevent them from attending every day of the trial, which could last more than six weeks. Those who raise concerns will most likely be removed from the pool.\nThe jurors who remain will all be asked the same set of questions. One by one, they will talk \u2014 briefly and vaguely \u2014 about what they do for a living, their education and their families. They will be asked where they get their news, what radio and podcasts they listen to and whether they've read books written by Mr. Trump or his former fixer Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be a central witness.\nOther questions will be more pointed. Jurors will be asked if they've ever volunteered or attended a campaign event for Mr. Trump or one of his opponents. They will also be asked to divulge feelings or opinions they have about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case.\nBut the jurors will not be asked how they voted in past elections, whom they plan to vote for, whether they have made political contributions or their party registration.\nMr. Trump's legal team and prosecutors for the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, can challenge the inclusion of prospective jurors by providing specific reasons they believe a juror cannot be fair and impartial. The judge has the final say.\nBoth sides will also receive a certain number of chances to remove jurors without explanation. After all of the challenged jurors are removed from the jury pool, Justice Merchan will seat the jury with those who remain.\nIf Mr. Trump's behavior at previous trials is any guide, he is likely to be very involved in jury selection. In a previous defamation case, Mr. Trump was fixated on the jurors from the moment they walked into the courtroom. He pivoted in his chair to study them as they answered biographical questions. He frequently talked to his attorneys.\nBut Mr. Trump's comments about the jurors in this case should start and stop in the courtroom. In addition to being ordered not to reveal their names, Mr. Trump is also subject to a gag order issued by Justice Merchan preventing him from making public statements about them.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ben Protess,Jonah E.

Trump engaged in a conspiracy to cover up a sex scandal in order to get elected president in 2016. The first witness called was the tabloid publisher David Pecker, whom prosecutors described as one member of a three-man plot to conceal damaging stories \u2014 including a porn star's account of a sexual tryst \u2014 as Mr. Trump mounted his bid for the presidency. Mr. Pecker was on the stand for only a few minutes in the afternoon before court adjourned for the day. He described how his publication, The National Enquirer, paid for stories, a practice he called 'checkbook journalism.' He is expected to return to the stand on Tuesday. Matthew Colangelo, one of the prosecutors for the Manhattan district attorney's office, told the jury in his opening statement that the case was about 'a criminal conspiracy and a coverup,' describing how Mr. Trump, his longtime counsel Michael D. Cohen, and Mr. Pecker engaged in a strategy to 'catch and kill' negative stories. The lead lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, insisted in his opening statement that the former president had done nothing wrong. 'President Trump is innocent,' he told the jury. 'President Trump did not commit any crimes.' The case centers on a $130,000 hush-money payment that Mr. Cohen made to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, to buy her silence as the 2016 campaign was winding down. Prosecutors say he was reimbursed by Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump falsified business records to conceal his conduct. Mr. Colangelo said the payment to Ms. Daniels came on the heels of another scandal \u2014 the 'Access Hollywood' tape, on which Mr. Trump bragged about groping women. Ms. Daniels's account, he said, 'could have been devastating to his campaign.' He added, 'With pressure mounting and Election Day fast approaching, Donald Trump agreed to the payoff and directed Cohen to proceed.' Mr. Cohen, who was an executive vice president at the Trump Organization and counsel to Mr. Trump, and Mr. Pecker are expected to be central witnesses. Mr. Blanche attacked Mr. Cohen's credibility, saying that his livelihood hinges on attacking the former president, and insisted that prosecutors were attempting to present perfectly legal activities, such as entering into nondisclosure agreements, in a negative light. 'I have a spoiler alert: There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,' Mr. Blanche said. 'It's called democracy.' He continued: 'They put something sinister on this idea as if it were a crime. You'll learn it's not.' Here's what else to know about the trial: The Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump was unveiled a year ago by the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and if convicted could face up to four years in prison. Those are felonies because prosecutors say Mr. Trump sought to conceal another crime. On Monday, they strongly emphasized a violation of state election law \u2014 conspiracy to promote election \u2014 that is not one of the actual charges, but they say is baked into the overall crime.\nThe case is the former president's first criminal trial, although he has been indicted three other times in three other cities. With those other cases tied up in appeals and other delays, the Manhattan case may be the only one he faces before the 2024 presidential election. The trial is expected to last six weeks.\nBefore opening statements, the judge overseeing the case delivered a crucial ruling that determined what prosecutors can question Mr. Trump about should he decide to take the stand in his own defense. The ruling, a significant victory for prosecutors that might prompt Mr. Trump to decide not to testify, allows them to question him about several recent losses he suffered in unrelated civil trials, including a fraud case this year in which the former president was found liable for conspiring to manipulate his net worth and was penalized $454 million.\nThe jury was drawn from a pool of residents of Manhattan, where Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular; during jury selection, dozens of prospective jurors were excused because they said they could not be impartial. But the jurors who were selected each pledged to decide the case based only on the facts. Read more about them.\nThe case will receive vast media attention, but the proceedings won't be shown on television. Matthew Colangelo, a prosecutor, said there would be 'only one conclusion: Donald Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.' Credit... Dave Sanders for The New York Times The Manhattan district attorney's office and lawyers for Donald J. Trump presented opening statements to jurors on Monday, with prosecutors accusing the former president of entering a criminal conspiracy while the defense sought to discredit two key witnesses. A prosecutor, Matthew Colangelo, began by telling jurors that Mr. Trump had conspired with his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, and the publisher of The National Enquirer, David Pecker, to conceal damaging stories during his 2016 campaign. 'This case is about a criminal conspiracy and a cover-up,' Mr. Colangelo said, telling a story about a hush-money payment to a porn star and insisting that the former president was ultimately responsible. In the end, Mr. Colangelo said, there would be 'only one conclusion: Donald Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.' Immediately after Mr. Colangelo's presentation, Mr. Trump's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, directly disagreed, insisting that the jury acquit the former president. Mr. Trump, he said, had engaged in actions that were legal and normal. 'President Trump did not commit any crimes,' Mr. Blanche told the jury, using the former president's preferred form of address. The lawyer told jurors that Mr. Trump had earned the right to be referred to as 'president' and reminded them that he was the presumptive Republican nominee. Mr. Blanche argued that there was nothing illegal about nondisclosure agreements, which he said companies, the wealthy and the famous all use frequently. And, he said, prosecutors were wrong to suggest something criminal about Mr. Trump's efforts to win the White House. 'I have a spoiler alert: There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,' Mr. Blanche said. 'It's called democracy.' Mr. Blanche asserted that Mr. Cohen, a key prosecution witness, was paid for legal services, and he attempted to undermine Mr. Cohen's credibility. Mr. Blanche called Mr. Cohen a 'criminal' who 'can't be trusted' and suggested that he was testifying only because he didn't get a job in the Trump administration. He also took aim at Stormy Daniels, the former porn star who claimed she had sex with Mr. Trump, characterizing her as an opportunist who had used a brief encounter with Mr. Trump related to his reality show, 'The Apprentice,' to make huge sums of money. He added that Ms. Daniels was 'biased' against the former president and made a living off her story about the sexual encounter. Mr. Blanche also sought to minimize the charges, saying the records at the heart of the case were just '34 pieces of paper' that the former president had nothing to do with. Mr. Trump is accused of falsifying business records \u2014 which is a felony if prosecutors can show the records were altered with an intent to commit or conceal a second crime. A year ago, when the former president was formally charged with 34 felonies, the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, told reporters that he did not have to specify what the second crime was, and listed three options. During opening statements, Mr. Colangelo made it clear he believed that the strongest case relied on one of those options: convincing jurors that Mr. Trump concealed the violation of a state law that forbids 'conspiracy to promote or prevent an election.'

The New York state court system has just agreed to publish a transcript of each day's proceeding by the end of the following day on its website. You can find the daily transcripts here. April 22, 2024, 1:07 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:07 p.m. ET Trump's motorcade left the courthouse just after 1:05 p.m., wrapping up the trial's first day of testimony. The view was blocked by an N.Y.P.D. dump truck, to many reporters' great frustration. Inside Collect Pond Park, across from the courthouse, a lone pro-Trump protester's 'Trump for President '24' banner flaps meekly in the light breeze. April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse The charges against Trump, which accuse him of falsifying records, are felonies because prosecutors say he sought to conceal another crime. Prosecutors had said before the trial that they had a menu of three crimes to choose from. The one they emphasized most strongly today is a violation of state election law: 'conspiracy to promote election.' It's not one of the actual charges, but they say it was baked into the overall crime. April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse And its worth emphasizing that when the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, was first asked about this, at a news conference directly after Trump was formally charged, he said that prosecutors did not have to specify which crime they were alleging Trump concealed. But today, Colangelo took the opposite tack: hitting the word 'conspiracy' again and again. April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET With the trial now underway, here's the People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump by the numbers: The case was born as 'Investigation No. 2018-00403803 \u2013 Investigation Into the Business Affairs of John Doe.' That's how the Manhattan district attorney's office identified the six-year inquiry that led to today's proceedings, with the number and name appearing on subpoenas and the correspondence case. Arrest No. M23613757 was given to Mr. Trump when he surrendered last year on April 4. And when the former president was arraigned later that day, his indictment was given a Docket Number, IND-71543-23, which the court system uses to track the case.  Collect Pond Park across from the courthouse has attracted onlookers and interested parties since Donald J. Trump's trial began last week. Credit... Nate Schweber for The New York Times Andrew Giuliani, the son of Donald J. Trump's former lawyer and a regular strutting presence on the periphery of the courthouse where the former president is on trial, posed for photos inside Collect Pond Park. Grinning and wearing a campaign jacket, Mr. Giuliani, who has made a career as a right-wing media figure, hugged supporters of Mr. Trump on Monday. From one, he borrowed a flag with Mr. Trump's face that promotes him for president in 2024. 'Two-thousand twenty-four years in prison!' taunted Ricky Caballero, 56, from Brooklyn. 'He owes your dad money. Why you out here supporting him?' Mr. Caballero wore a tank top with a Puerto Rican flag. He said that was his heritage, and that he remembers watching Mr. Trump lob paper towels at survivors of Hurricane Maria in 2017. Mr. Caballero said he was still furious. Mr. Giuliani circulated like a celebrity among Mr. Trump's supporters and ignored Mr. Caballero. It was one of a number of loud exchanges between supporters and detractors of Mr. Trump that were noticeably monitored by the police. There were no police in the park on Friday, when a man amid a mental health crisis burned himself to death in an anti-government protest. On Monday, there were six community affairs officers and six regular uniformed officers watching closely for trouble. At one point, the sound of the national anthem wafted through the park, courtesy of the flute-playing activist Marc Crawford Leavitt. 'I'm just playing and no one can argue with my playing patriotic songs,' he said, a sign decrying Trump as a liar hanging around his neck. Anusha Bayya contributed reporting.

Prosecutors had declined to tell them earlier, given that Trump has made something of a habit of attacking witnesses.  April 22, 2024, 12:35 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:35 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse I'm again struck at just how quickly we went today. We started late, and by the end of a very short day had finished both opening statements and started in on our first witness. This trial was expected to last six weeks. It may end even more quickly.

Right now he's describing the types of people tabloids typically use as sources: hotel workers, limo drivers, lawyers. April 22, 2024, 12:26 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:26 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse Trump's lawyers have sought to cast the tabloid that Pecker presided over as a media company like any other. But Pecker's comment that they practiced 'checkbook journalism,' and his description of their editorial practices, may undermine that argument, as we continue to hear about how the publication operated. April 22, 2024, 12:27 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:27 p.m. ET Checkbook journalism is one of the things that sets supermarket tabloids apart from more traditional news outlets.

They will be taken into a lot of different environments \u2014 these editorial meetings, the Trump campaign and the Trump White House, and small meetings of New York operators in which, prosecutors will argue, the history of the country was shaped.

April 22, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET Maggie Haberman Reporting from the courthouse 'We used checkbook journalism, and we paid for stories,' Pecker says of his time at The National Enquirer. Steinglass, the prosecutor, asks him whether he had \"final say\" over editorial decisions. Anything over $10,000 for a story, Pecker says, had to be approved by him. April 22, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET Jesse McKinley Reporting from the courthouse Pecker says in his experience, the only thing that's important 'is the cover' of a magazine. David Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, was described as a master of the 'catch-and-kill' technique by people who have worked for him. Credit... Mary Altaffer/Associated Press 'Catch-and-kill' is a term coined by old-time tabloid editors for buying the exclusive rights to stories, or 'catching' them, for the specific purpose of ensuring the information never becomes public. That's the 'killing' part. Why would anyone want to spend money on a story that it never intends to publish? In the world of tabloid journalism, where ethical lines are blurry, deciding what to publish and why is often a calculus that covers favors doled out and chits called in. David Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, who also oversaw other tabloids such as Star and lifestyle publications such as Men's Fitness, was a master of the technique, according to people who have worked for him. In 2003, Mr. Pecker's company, American Media Inc., bought several muscle magazines founded by a mentor of Arnold Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilding legend and movie star. When Mr. Schwarzenegger, who was often featured in those magazines, jumped into the recall election to replace California's governor, Mr. Pecker ordered his staff to buy up negative stories about him in order to protect his investment, former employees said. Staff members called it 'the David Pecker Project.' American Media paid $20,000 to a former mistress of Mr. Schwarzenegger so that she would not speak about their affair \u2014 though news of it had previously been published. The company paid another $1,000 to her friend and $2,000 to a man who had a video of Mr. Schwarzenegger dancing lewdly in Rio de Janeiro 20 years earlier. Mr. Schwarzenegger was elected governor. Mr. Pecker's publications made deals with other celebrities as well, though not always for money. He traded away dirt about the golfer Tiger Woods in exchange for an exclusive interview in Men's Fitness in 2007, according to people with knowledge of that episode. And, according to the prosecutors in the Manhattan trial of Donald J. Trump, Mr. Pecker employed 'catch-and-kill' tactics in the 2016 presidential election, paying a doorman and a Playboy model to suppress negative stories about Mr. Trump and boost the candidacy of his longtime associate.  April 22, 2024, 12:11 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:11 p.m. ET Kate Christobek Reporting from the courthouse Justice Merchan has shown so far that he is eager to keep this trial on schedule. Court will be adjourned for the day in less than a half an hour, but yet the judge has chosen to start the first witness. He seems serious about keeping his word to the jurors that the trial will last six weeks. April 22, 2024, 12:08 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:08 p.m. ET Alan Feuer Providing analysis of Trump cases What will be interesting about Pecker's testimony, if it goes as opening statements suggested it would, is that he won't really be describing Trump's involvement in any actual criminal activity. Rather, he will serve as a tour guide to the seamy way in which Trump used The National Enquirer to his political advantage \u2014 a storytelling point on the way to alleged criminal activity. April 22, 2024, 12:10 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:10 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse And yet, prosecutors have framed Pecker's involvement here as part of a 'conspiracy.' This could be a risk for them \u2014 conspiracy is not one of the charged crimes. And this jury has at least two lawyers. David Pecker's publication, The National Enquirer, was a repository for as many secrets as it published. Credit... Marion Curtis/Associated Press The first witness in Donald J. Trump's criminal is David Pecker, who was the publisher of The National Enquirer, and had traded favors with Mr. Trump since the 1990s. Mr. Pecker, who was sometimes referred to as the 'tabloid king,' had long used his publications to curry favor with Mr. Trump and other celebrities, in exchange for tips or for business reasons. Staff members called Mr. Trump, like other favored stars who were off limits, an 'F.O.P.' \u2014 'Friend of Pecker.' Mr. Trump and Mr. Pecker, along with Mr. Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen, hatched a plan in August 2015 to boost his upstart presidential campaign, prosecutors say. The former Trump allies are each expected to take a turn on the witness stand, giving testimony that could help make him the first president convicted of a felony. Prosecutors for Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, will try to show that the hush money payment to a porn star at the center of the trial was part of a larger effort to suppress negative news about Mr. Trump to sway the election. That scheme, they will contend, includes two other deals, both involving Mr. Pecker. Mr. Trump had announced his presidential campaign in June 2015. The plan the men laid out two months later was simple, according to court documents, interviews with people involved in the events or familiar with them, private communications and other records. Mr. Pecker would use The Enquirer to publish positive stories about Mr. Trump's campaign and negative stories about his rivals. He would alert Mr. Trump, through Mr. Cohen, when The Enquirer learned of stories that might threaten Mr. Trump. The Enquirer could buy the rights to those stories in order to suppress them, a practice known in the tabloid world as 'catch and kill.' In late 2015, Mr. Pecker's company paid $30,000 to suppress a claim by a former doorman at a Trump building who said he had heard Mr. Trump fathered a child out of wedlock \u2014 a rumor that was apparently untrue. Then in August 2016, The Enquirer's parent company paid $150,000 to a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, to keep her account of an affair with Mr. Trump quiet. Two months later, Mr. Pecker and The Enquirer's editor helped Mr. Cohen negotiate a $130,000 hush-money payment with Stormy Daniels, the former porn star who also said she had sex with Mr. Trump. He has denied both women's claims. Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance crimes in 2018. The Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., made a deal that year to avoid federal prosecution, acknowledging that it had illegally tried to influence the election.

The National Enquirer's master of 'Catch and Kill,' he was part of the conspiracy that Colangelo described in his opening statement, working with Trump and Cohen to bury negative stories about Trump and publish negative ones about his rivals. He's expected to tell the jury about his conversations with Trump and Cohen about killing the bad stories, including the one about Stormy Daniels. And he'll provide much of the broad arc of the case \u2013 and the motive \u2014 corroborating elements of Cohen's expected testimony along the way. Credit...

Pool photo by Jabin Botsford Donald J. Trump has assembled a team of defense lawyers with extensive experience representing people charged with white-collar crimes to defend him against the charges filed by the Manhattan district attorney's office. Some have worked for Mr. Trump for years. Others are more recent additions, but are involved in the former president's broader legal defense, also representing him in other criminal cases. Here's a look at Mr. Trump's defense team: Mr. Blanche started representing Mr. Trump last year, leaving a prestigious position as a partner at Wall Street's oldest law firm to take him on as a client. He is also representing Mr. Trump in his federal classified documents case in Florida and his federal election interference case in Washington. Mr. Blanche has also represented Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, as well as Boris Epshteyn, an adviser to Mr. Trump. Before turning to private practice, Mr. Blanche was a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, where he supervised violent-crime cases. Ms. Necheles has been a lawyer for Mr. Trump since 2021 and represented the Trump Organization during its criminal tax fraud trial in Manhattan. The business was convicted of 17 felonies and ordered by Justice Juan M. Merchan to pay the maximum penalty of $1.6 million. Ms. Necheles previously represented defendants in major organized-crime and public-corruption cases, including Venero Mangano, the Genovese crime family underboss who was known as Benny Eggs. Mr. Bove, the newest addition to Mr. Trump's legal team, is a legal partner to Mr. Blanche. He is a former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York who turned to private practice and now represents defendants charged with white-collar crimes. Mr. Stern is a law partner to Ms. Necheles and also defended the Trump Organization in its criminal tax-fraud trial. He has previous experience representing clients charged with bribery, fraud and conspiracy.  Justice Juan M. Merchan handed prosecutors a legal cudgel that could dissuade Donald J. Trump from testifying. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times The judge in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial ruled on Monday morning that prosecutors could ask the former president about a range of previous cases that he has lost, as well as past violations of gag orders, in the event that he decides to testify in his defense. Among other cases, the ruling by the judge, Juan M. Merchan, would allow prosecutors to question Mr. Trump about the civil fraud case brought by the New York attorney general, Letitia James, in which the former president was found to have inflated his net worth to obtain favorable loans. That case resulted in a $454 million judgment against Mr. Trump. Justice Merchan will also allow the Manhattan district attorney's office \u2014 which brought the case against Mr. Trump \u2014 to question him about civil cases brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll. Those cases found that Mr. Trump was liable for sexually abusing and defaming Ms. Carroll in the first instance and for defamation in the second. (Justice Merchan did not mention the sexual abuse finding, only the defamation, in his ruling regarding the Carroll cases on Monday.) Justice Merchan will also let prosecutors ask about Mr. Trump's attack on a law clerk in a civil fraud case, in violation of a gag order, as well as a 2018 decision that led to the dissolution of the Donald J. Trump Foundation to resolve a case brought by the New York attorney general at the time, Barbara Underwood, over financial irregularities. The former president suggested in early April that he would testify in the criminal trial, saying that prosecutors 'have no case.' That said, Mr. Trump has promised to testify in previous cases only to back out, and Justice Merchan's decision could change his thinking on such a maneuver. Justice Merchan said that, in the event that Mr. Trump did testify, he would give jurors 'careful and specific' instructions about the scope of prosecutors' queries, adding that he had 'greatly curtailed' what specifics could be the target of questions. However, Justice Merchan warned Mr. Trump that his ruling was 'a shield and not a sword' and that the former president's testimony could open 'the door to questioning that has otherwise been excluded.' Mr. Trump is being tried on charges that he falsified business records to cover up a hush-money payment to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election. He has denied the charges. Susan Hoffinger and Joshua Steinglass are among the experienced team that the Manhattan district attorney has put together to prosecute Donald J. Trump. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, has assembled an accomplished team to take on perhaps the most high-profile case in his office's history: the first criminal trial against former President Donald J. Trump. The group includes veteran prosecutors and former white-collar criminal defense lawyers who have extensive experience going up against Mr. Trump. Here's a look at the prosecution team: Mr. Steinglass, who has served as an assistant district attorney since 1998, is a recent addition to this case; in 2022 he helped lead the team that secured a conviction against the Trump Organization for conspiracy, criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records. He typically prosecutes significant violent crimes, such as a violent brawl on the Upper East Side that led to the conviction of two Proud Boy extremists in 2019. After starting her career at the Manhattan district attorney's office, Ms. Hoffinger founded her own firm and spent 20 years as a defense lawyer focusing on white-collar criminal defense. She rejoined the district attorney's office in 2022 and worked with Mr. Steinglass to obtain the conviction of the Trump Organization in its criminal tax fraud trial. A prosecutor for 28 years, Mr. Conroy previously led the Manhattan district attorney's office's major economic crimes unit, where he was involved in the prosecution of the bankrupt law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf and supervised investigations into multinational financial institutions for falsification of business records. Mr. Conroy is the longest serving member of this trial team. Mr. Colangelo joined the district attorney's office in 2022 after serving for two years as a senior official at the U.S. Department of Justice. He previously worked for the New York attorney general's office, where he oversaw the investigation into the Trump Foundation, which led to its dissolution. He was also, for a time, one of the lead lawyers on the civil fraud inquiry into Mr. Trump. Before joining Mr. Bragg's major economic crimes unit in 2022, Ms. Mangold clerked for a U.S. District Court judge in New Jersey and worked in private practice for over 10 years. As a partner at the law firm Kobre & Kim, Ms. Mangold focused on criminal and regulatory investigations related to financial misconduct. Ms. Ellis joined the Manhattan district attorney's office in 2018 after working as an associate at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. Before becoming a lawyer, Ms. Ellis worked as a legal analyst at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank.  Broadcast feeds from the trial are limited to those from outside the courtroom. Credit... Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times The Manhattan criminal trial of Donald J. Trump will be closely followed around the world. But you will not be able to watch the proceedings on TV. There will be no video feed aired live from the courtroom. Nor will there be an audio feed, as some federal courts allow. New York courts generally do not permit video to be broadcast from courtrooms, although a feed is being transmitted into an overflow room for the reporters covering the trial. And cameras will be stationed in the hallway outside the courtroom to capture Mr. Trump's remarks as he enters and leaves. Shortly after court adjourned on Monday, the state's chief administrative judge, Joseph A. Zayas, issued a statement saying that transcripts of each day of the trial would be published online by the end of the following day on the court system's website. Judge Zayas was responding to a request for public transcripts filed last week by a New York lawyer, Jim Walden, on behalf of a civic group and a news website. 'With current law restricting the broadcasting of trial proceedings and courtroom space for public spectators very limited, the release of the daily transcripts on the court system's website is the best way to provide the public a direct view of the proceedings in this historic trial,' Judge Zayas wrote in his statement. Court will be in session, for the most part, every weekday except Wednesdays, from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., until the trial ends. The weeklong jury selection process was a pressure cooker for many of the nearly 300 Manhattan residents who were summoned to be interviewed. Credit... Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times Follow our live coverage of Trump's hush money trial in Manhattan. The two Manhattan residents were led into the courtroom to fulfill a foundational civic duty: to be interviewed as prospective jurors. But in the room when they arrived was a defendant, Donald J. Trump, unlike any in American history. Both would-be jurors, a man and a woman, were eventually excused. But the experience thrust them into the spotlight in a way they never had imagined. One was challenged by Mr. Trump's lawyers over his past social media posts relating to the former president. The other has a medical practice that she could not shut for six weeks while serving on the jury. While they were not chosen as jurors, their experiences illustrate the intensity of the attention focused on Mr. Trump's trial \u2014 and on the first jury to ever weigh the fate of a former United States president in a criminal proceeding. Both contacted The New York Times only after they were excused from serving. Though the court's rules protecting prospective jurors' identities end when they are dismissed from serving, The Times is withholding their names and most identifying characteristics about them. Like the other prospective jurors who were considered, both included detailed personal information on the juror questionnaires they filled out, including where they work. They were made to answer those questions by speaking into a microphone in open court; soon, both were blindsided as details of their lives ricocheted around the internet. They said they were frustrated that so much attention was devoted to prospective jurors and ascertaining information about them. While they later learned that the judge in the case, Justice Juan M. Merchan, had ordered the redaction of some of the information jurors were ordered to reveal publicly, they felt that he had acted too late. As with many things connected to the trial, the rhythms and even some of the parameters are being written in real time. Their experiences mirrored some that other prospective jurors who were dismissed have described. One, a man who gave his name as Mark to NBC News, said he had 'satirized Mr. Trump often in my artwork,' and because of that, he had expected not to be chosen. A woman who gave her name as Kara, who said the nature of her job made serving extremely difficult, told NBC News that she realized the gravity of serving on any criminal jury, but particularly this one. Seeing Mr. Trump in person, she said, was 'very jarring.' He was, she realized, just 'another guy.' One of the prospective jurors who spoke with The Times, the man, did not immediately realize what case he was involved in when he was led into the courtroom on the 15th floor of the Manhattan criminal courthouse. The woman had a sense a week earlier, having read a news story about the trial beginning the week she was supposed to respond to a juror summons. The man, sitting a few rows behind the prosecutors' table when the two were part of the first panel of 96 prospective jurors brought into the courtroom Monday afternoon, felt a sense of calm about five minutes into being there. Trump was simply a defendant, he thought. It was a business-records trial. Prosecutors were on one side, the defense lawyers on the other. The woman was struck by the fact that Mr. Trump stood and waved to prospective jurors, she said, as he and his lawyers were introduced to the group. It felt more to her like the behavior of a campaigning candidate than of a criminal defendant. (Mr. Trump, of course, is both.) Both were put off by efforts by Mr. Trump's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, to assess prospective jurors' views of Mr. Trump. The man said Mr. Blanche seemed 'folksy' in a way he found disingenuous, while the woman was sharper, describing a 'witch hunt' to root out people sympathetic to Democrats on the panel \u2014 a phrase Mr. Trump uses often to criticize the various prosecutors investigating his conduct. The man in particular was frustrated that he was asked about past social media posts in which he had been critical of Mr. Trump, which Mr. Blanche's team raised and which Justice Merchan ultimately agreed meant the man should be excused. The man believed he could have been fair and resented the implication that he could not have been. Both he and the woman, who said they believed in the system of jury service, noted that they had begun the day taking sworn oaths vowing to render a fair and impartial judgment on the evidence. The man believed his own views \u2014 especially views from years ago \u2014 had no bearing on his ability to judge the evidence. If anything, he said, he would have been hyper-conscious in doing so. Both had realized the magnitude of what serving on that jury would mean. But they were also conscious of the threats and blowback that could come with weighing evidence against Mr. Trump \u2014 particularly with their personal details traceable in public. And both had concerns about being chosen because of that; the man in particular said his spouse had been worried. Both would have valued being part of the historic trial. But both also had a sense of relief that they were not picked.  Former President Donald J. Trump is accused of 34 felonies, but a conviction is no sure thing. Credit... Pool photo by Curtis Means In the official record, the case is known as the People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump, and, for now, the people have the stronger hand: They have insider witnesses, a favorable jury pool and a lurid set of facts about a presidential candidate, a payoff and a porn star. On Monday, the prosecutors will formally introduce the case to 12 all-important jurors, embarking on the first prosecution of an American president. The trial, which could brand Mr. Trump a felon as he mounts another White House run, will reverberate throughout the nation and test the durability of the justice system that Mr. Trump is attacking in a way that no other defendant would be allowed to do. Though the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, has assembled a mountain of evidence, a conviction is hardly assured. Over the next six weeks, Mr. Trump's lawyers will seize on three apparent weak points: a key witness's credibility, a president's culpability and the case's legal complexity. Prosecutors will seek to maneuver around those vulnerabilities, dazzling the jury with a tale that mixes politics and sex, as they confront a shrewd defendant with a decades-long track record of skirting legal consequences. They will also seek to bolster the credibility of that key witness, Michael D. Cohen, a former fixer to Mr. Trump who previously pleaded guilty to federal crimes for paying the porn star, Stormy Daniels. Daniel J. Horwitz, a veteran defense lawyer who previously worked in the Manhattan district attorney's office prosecuting white-collar cases, said prosecutors can be expected to corroborate Mr. Cohen's story wherever possible. 'The prosecution has layers upon layers of evidence to back up what Michael Cohen says,' Mr. Horwitz said. Despite its tawdry particulars, District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg has cast the case as one of election interference. Credit... Pool photo by Mary Altaffer Both sides will lay out their cases in opening statements on Monday, offering dueling interpretations of the evidence some six years after the payoff to Ms. Daniels entered the public consciousness and briefly imperiled Mr. Trump's presidency. But in previewing the case for prospective jurors last week, Manhattan prosecutors emphasized neither the payoff that secured Ms. Daniels's silence, nor the sex scandal that was buried in the process. One prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, instead distilled the trial's stakes to a fundamental question: 'This case is about the rule of law and whether or not Donald Trump broke it.' Mr. Steinglass's boss, Mr. Bragg, has offered a loftier interpretation, casting Mr. Trump's actions as election interference. Although Mr. Trump's lawyers might claim he was merely trying to hide embarrassing stories from his family, Mr. Bragg says Mr. Trump orchestrated a scheme to conceal simmering sex scandals from voters as they headed to the polls in 2016. All told, his allies struck three hush-money deals, paying off people who had stories to tell \u2014 stories that could have derailed Mr. Trump's candidacy. Mr. Bragg's prosecutors will seek to turn that 2016 campaign strategy against him: The tactics that helped propel Mr. Trump to victory will be admitted as evidence and reconsidered far beyond the courtroom. Aides and friends who lied on Mr. Trump's behalf will take the witness stand to testify against him. They include: David Pecker, the tabloid publisher who bought and buried damaging stories about Mr. Trump; Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman who tried to spin reporters; and Mr. Cohen, the fixer who paid Ms. Daniels. Mr. Pecker, who ran the company that owned The National Enquirer, is set to go first, and is expected to recount for the jury several conversations with Mr. Trump about the hush money, according to a person familiar with the plan. Stormy Daniels was paid $130,000 to bury her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Credit... Jeenah Moon for The New York Times Mr. Trump faces 34 felony counts, and up to four years behind bars, but more than just his freedom is at stake. If convicted, he might lose the right to vote, including to cast a ballot for himself. If he were to win back the White House, he would be the first convicted criminal to serve as commander in chief. And the question of how he might serve a prison sentence, should it come to that if he does not receive probation, could throw the country into turmoil. America has grown accustomed to seeing Mr. Trump smash through its customs and is now witnessing a phenomenon that is a first in the 248 years of its history. Presidents have been impeached, driven from office and rejected at the polls. Mr. Trump is about to be the first to have his fate decided not just by voters, but by 12 citizens in a jury box. And they all hail from Manhattan, the borough that made Mr. Trump famous, and where he is now deeply unpopular. A favorable jury pool, legal experts say, has given Mr. Bragg a leg up at the trial. Yet the jury, which was made final on Friday and includes six alternates, is no rubber stamp: It includes at least two people who have expressed some affection for the former president, and it takes only one skeptical member to force a mistrial, an outcome that Mr. Trump would celebrate as a win. The stakes are high for Mr. Bragg as well. He is betting his career and his legacy on a prosecution he inherited, rejected and then transformed. When he took office in 2022, he declined to bring a financial fraud case against Mr. Trump that his predecessor had prepared, prompting an uproar when two prosecutors resigned in protest. But Mr. Bragg continued to investigate and soon revisited the hush-money deal \u2014 an episode that had become known internally as 'the zombie case,' because it kept coming back to life. Little more than a year after taking office, Mr. Bragg indicted the former president. Three other indictments followed in three other cities, but with those cases mired in delay, Mr. Bragg's trial may now be the only one that Mr. Trump will face before Election Day. The Manhattan case comprises the three hush-money deals: with Ms. Daniels, with a former Playboy model and with a onetime doorman who told a tale of Mr. Trump fathering a child out of wedlock. Mr. Pecker and his tabloid bought the silence of the doorman, whose story turned out to be false. They also bought the rights to the story told by the model, Karen McDougal, and then never wrote it, a practice known as 'catch and kill.' David Pecker, the chief executive of American Media, had a cooperative relationship with Mr. Trump for years. Credit... Marion Curtis/Associated Press Then there was Ms. Daniels, who was interested in selling her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Mr. Pecker drew the line there: Her price was too high. Instead, he and a top editor alerted Mr. Cohen, who soon paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 not to tell her story about a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump a decade earlier. Mr. Cohen has said he acted at Mr. Trump's direction, but the former president is not charged over the payment itself. Instead, he stands accused of covering up the transaction by disguising reimbursements to Mr. Cohen. In internal records, Mr. Trump's company marked those payments as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet no such expenses existed, prosecutors say, and the retainer agreement was fictional. Mr. Trump is accused of engineering \u2014 or, at least, approving \u2014 the coverup. His company, prosecutors argue, produced 34 false records that underpin the counts against him: 11 checks, 11 monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted and 12 entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust. Mr. Trump signed several of the checks in the White House, as prosecutors will surely point out at the trial. But directly linking Mr. Trump to the plot to falsify those records is another matter altogether. His lawyers will be likely to argue that he was oblivious, and that Mr. Cohen handled the specifics. Mr. Cohen hashed out the reimbursement plan with Mr. Trump's chief financial officer, Allen H. Weisselberg, who is serving jail time for perjury and will not testify, records show. The lack of a firsthand witness to confirm Mr. Cohen's account is a potential flaw in the case, but it may not be fatal. Prosecutors plan to introduce a document containing Mr. Weisselberg's handwritten notes about the reimbursements \u2014 a key piece of evidence demonstrating that Mr. Cohen did not act alone. And under the law, the prosecutors need not prove that Mr. Trump personally falsified the records. Already during the trial's first week, Mr. Steinglass laid the groundwork with a simple analogy: He asked prospective jurors whether they could accept that, if a husband hired a hit man to murder his wife, the husband was just as guilty as the man who pulled the trigger. 'Can you all follow the same kind of logic in this case?' Mr. Steinglass asked the prospective jurors. Many said they could. Mr. Cohen is expected to offer the closest thing this case has to a smoking gun: He is likely to say that, in early 2017, he and Mr. Trump discussed the repayment scheme in the Oval Office. If Mr. Trump testifies in his own defense, that could pit Mr. Cohen's word against Mr. Trump's \u2014 a he-said, he-said story, with two questionable narrators. Whether or not Mr. Trump takes the stand, the trial could become a referendum on Mr. Cohen's credibility, with the verdict possibly hinging on a convincing performance. In 2018, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to a variety of federal crimes, admitting to participating in the hush-money deals with Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal and lying to Congress about plans for a Trump business deal in Russia. Mr. Trump's lawyers will seek to emphasize Mr. Cohen's checkered past at every turn. And, on cross-examination, Mr. Trump's lawyers are likely to portray Mr. Cohen as a serial liar with a grudge against his former boss. Michael D. Cohen, a former fixer to Mr. Trump and a conduit for the hush money, will be a crucial witness. Credit... Dave Sanders for The New York Times Susan Necheles, one of Mr. Trump's lawyers, began that campaign during jury selection. She referenced Mr. Cohen's 2022 book 'Revenge,' questioning the credibility of 'someone who says that they want revenge against President Trump.' Yet the prosecution is expected to note that Mr. Cohen told many of his lies for Mr. Trump. And prosecutors will offer evidence corroborating the broad strokes of Mr. Cohen's story, which could persuade jurors when they are weighing his testimony about the crucial Oval Office meeting. Mr. Trump's White House executive assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, who has been identified as a potential witness, could confirm that Mr. Cohen did indeed meet with Mr. Trump, even if she cannot confirm what they discussed. Mr. Pecker can support at least some of Mr. Cohen's testimony about Mr. Trump's involvement in the hush-money deals. And a recording Mr. Cohen made of a call he had with Mr. Trump will capture the former president discussing the deal with Ms. McDougal. 'The prosecution's argument is that you can trust Michael Cohen beyond a reasonable doubt as to their isolated conversation,' said Mr. Horwitz, the former prosecutor. He called the approach 'Prosecuting 101.' William K. Rashbaum, Maggie Haberman, Jonathan Swan and Michael Rothfeld contributed reporting.  \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nProsecutors in the first criminal trial of an American president began laying out their case for a jury of 12 New Yorkers on Monday, saying Donald J. Trump engaged in a conspiracy to cover up a sex scandal in order to get elected president in 2016.\nThe first witness called was the tabloid publisher David Pecker, whom prosecutors described as one member of a three-man plot to conceal damaging stories \u2014 including a porn star's account of a sexual tryst \u2014 as Mr. Trump mounted his bid for the presidency.\nMr. Pecker was on the stand for only a few minutes in the afternoon before court adjourned for the day. He described how his publication, The National Enquirer, paid for stories, a practice he called 'checkbook journalism.' He is expected to return to the stand on Tuesday.\nMatthew Colangelo, one of the prosecutors for the Manhattan district attorney's office, told the jury in his opening statement that the case was about 'a criminal conspiracy and a coverup,' describing how Mr. Trump, his longtime counsel Michael D. Cohen, and Mr. Pecker engaged in a strategy to 'catch and kill' negative stories.\nThe lead lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, insisted in his opening statement that the former president had done nothing wrong. 'President Trump is innocent,' he told the jury. 'President Trump did not commit any crimes.'\nThe case centers on a $130,000 hush-money payment that Mr. Cohen made to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, to buy her silence as the 2016 campaign was winding down. Prosecutors say he was reimbursed by Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump falsified business records to conceal his conduct.\nMr. Colangelo said the payment to Ms. Daniels came on the heels of another scandal \u2014 the 'Access Hollywood' tape, on which Mr. Trump bragged about groping women. Ms. Daniels's account, he said, 'could have been devastating to his campaign.'\nHe added, 'With pressure mounting and Election Day fast approaching, Donald Trump agreed to the payoff and directed Cohen to proceed.'\nMr. Cohen, who was an executive vice president at the Trump Organization and counsel to Mr. Trump, and Mr. Pecker are expected to be central witnesses.\nMr. Blanche attacked Mr. Cohen's credibility, saying that his livelihood hinges on attacking the former president, and insisted that prosecutors were attempting to present perfectly legal activities, such as entering into nondisclosure agreements, in a negative light.\n'I have a spoiler alert: There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,' Mr. Blanche said. 'It's called democracy.'\nHe continued: 'They put something sinister on this idea as if it were a crime. You'll learn it's not.'\nHere's what else to know about the trial:\nThe Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump was unveiled a year ago by the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and if convicted could face up to four years in prison. Those are felonies because prosecutors say Mr. Trump sought to conceal another crime. On Monday, they strongly emphasized a violation of state election law \u2014 conspiracy to promote election \u2014 that is not one of the actual charges, but they say is baked into the overall crime.\nThe case is the former president's first criminal trial, although he has been indicted three other times in three other cities. With those other cases tied up in appeals and other delays, the Manhattan case may be the only one he faces before the 2024 presidential election. The trial is expected to last six weeks.\nBefore opening statements, the judge overseeing the case delivered a crucial ruling that determined what prosecutors can question Mr. Trump about should he decide to take the stand in his own defense. The ruling, a significant victory for prosecutors that might prompt Mr. Trump to decide not to testify, allows them to question him about several recent losses he suffered in unrelated civil trials, including a fraud case this year in which the former president was found liable for conspiring to manipulate his net worth and was penalized $454 million.\nThe jury was drawn from a pool of residents of Manhattan, where Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular; during jury selection, dozens of prospective jurors were excused because they said they could not be impartial. But the jurors who were selected each pledged to decide the case based only on the facts. Read more about them.\nThe case will receive vast media attention, but the proceedings won't be shown on television.\nMatthew Colangelo, a prosecutor, said there would be 'only one conclusion: Donald Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.' Credit... Dave Sanders for The New York Times The Manhattan district attorney's office and lawyers for Donald J. Trump presented opening statements to jurors on Monday, with prosecutors accusing the former president of entering a criminal conspiracy while the defense sought to discredit two key witnesses.\nA prosecutor, Matthew Colangelo, began by telling jurors that Mr. Trump had conspired with his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, and the publisher of The National Enquirer, David Pecker, to conceal damaging stories during his 2016 campaign.\n'This case is about a criminal conspiracy and a cover-up,' Mr. Colangelo said, telling a story about a hush-money payment to a porn star and insisting that the former president was ultimately responsible.\nIn the end, Mr. Colangelo said, there would be 'only one conclusion: Donald Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.'\nImmediately after Mr. Colangelo's presentation, Mr. Trump's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, directly disagreed, insisting that the jury acquit the former president. Mr. Trump, he said, had engaged in actions that were legal and normal.\n'President Trump did not commit any crimes,' Mr. Blanche told the jury, using the former president's preferred form of address. The lawyer told jurors that Mr. Trump had earned the right to be referred to as 'president' and reminded them that he was the presumptive Republican nominee.\nMr. Blanche argued that there was nothing illegal about nondisclosure agreements, which he said companies, the wealthy and the famous all use frequently. And, he said, prosecutors were wrong to suggest something criminal about Mr. Trump's efforts to win the White House.\n'I have a spoiler alert: There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,' Mr. Blanche said. 'It's called democracy.'\nMr. Blanche asserted that Mr. Cohen, a key prosecution witness, was paid for legal services, and he attempted to undermine Mr. Cohen's credibility. Mr. Blanche called Mr. Cohen a 'criminal' who 'can't be trusted' and suggested that he was testifying only because he didn't get a job in the Trump administration.\nHe also took aim at Stormy Daniels, the former porn star who claimed she had sex with Mr. Trump, characterizing her as an opportunist who had used a brief encounter with Mr. Trump related to his reality show, 'The Apprentice,' to make huge sums of money.\nHe added that Ms. Daniels was 'biased' against the former president and made a living off her story about the sexual encounter.\nMr. Blanche also sought to minimize the charges, saying the records at the heart of the case were just '34 pieces of paper' that the former president had nothing to do with.\nMr. Trump is accused of falsifying business records \u2014 which is a felony if prosecutors can show the records were altered with an intent to commit or conceal a second crime.\nA year ago, when the former president was formally charged with 34 felonies, the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, told reporters that he did not have to specify what the second crime was, and listed three options. During opening statements, Mr. Colangelo made it clear he believed that the strongest case relied on one of those options: convincing jurors that Mr. Trump concealed the violation of a state law that forbids 'conspiracy to promote or prevent an election.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 1:37 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:37 p.m. ET Alan Feuer\nAlan Feuer Providing analysis of Trump cases There's some good news for people who want to follow the Trump trial in detail, but can't make it to the courthouse.

Prosecutors had said before the trial that they had a menu of three crimes to choose from. The one they emphasized most strongly today is a violation of state election law: 'conspiracy to promote election.' It's not one of the actual charges, but they say it was baked into the overall crime.\nApril 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich\nJonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse And its worth emphasizing that when the district attorney, Alvin L.

That's how the Manhattan district attorney's office identified the six-year inquiry that led to today's proceedings, with the number and name appearing on subpoenas and the correspondence case. Arrest No. M23613757 was given to Mr. Trump when he surrendered last year on April 4. And when the former president was arraigned later that day, his indictment was given a Docket Number, IND-71543-23, which the court system uses to track the case.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Collect Pond Park across from the courthouse has attracted onlookers and interested parties since Donald J.

Credit... Mary Altaffer/Associated Press 'Catch-and-kill' is a term coined by old-time tabloid editors for buying the exclusive rights to stories, or 'catching' them, for the specific purpose of ensuring the information never becomes public. That's the 'killing' part.\nWhy would anyone want to spend money on a story that it never intends to publish? In the world of tabloid journalism, where ethical lines are blurry, deciding what to publish and why is often a calculus that covers favors doled out and chits called in.\nDavid Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, who also oversaw other tabloids such as Star and lifestyle publications such as Men's Fitness, was a master of the technique, according to people who have worked for him.\nIn 2003, Mr. Pecker's company, American Media Inc., bought several muscle magazines founded by a mentor of Arnold Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilding legend and movie star. When Mr. Schwarzenegger, who was often featured in those magazines, jumped into the recall election to replace California's governor, Mr. Pecker ordered his staff to buy up negative stories about him in order to protect his investment, former employees said.\nStaff members called it 'the David Pecker Project.' American Media paid $20,000 to a former mistress of Mr. Schwarzenegger so that she would not speak about their affair \u2014 though news of it had previously been published. The company paid another $1,000 to her friend and $2,000 to a man who had a video of Mr. Schwarzenegger dancing lewdly in Rio de Janeiro 20 years earlier. Mr. Schwarzenegger was elected governor.\nMr. Pecker's publications made deals with other celebrities as well, though not always for money. He traded away dirt about the golfer Tiger Woods in exchange for an exclusive interview in Men's Fitness in 2007, according to people with knowledge of that episode.\nAnd, according to the prosecutors in the Manhattan trial of Donald J. Trump, Mr. Pecker employed 'catch-and-kill' tactics in the 2016 presidential election, paying a doorman and a Playboy model to suppress negative stories about Mr. Trump and boost the candidacy of his longtime associate.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 12:11 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:11 p.m. ET Kate Christobek\nKate Christobek Reporting from the courthouse Justice Merchan has shown so far that he is eager to keep this trial on schedule.

This could be a risk for them \u2014 conspiracy is not one of the charged crimes. And this jury has at least two lawyers.\nDavid Pecker's publication, The National Enquirer, was a repository for as many secrets as it published. Credit... Marion Curtis/Associated Press The first witness in Donald J. Trump's criminal is David Pecker, who was the publisher of The National Enquirer, and had traded favors with Mr. Trump since the 1990s.\nMr. Pecker, who was sometimes referred to as the 'tabloid king,' had long used his publications to curry favor with Mr. Trump and other celebrities, in exchange for tips or for business reasons. Staff members called Mr. Trump, like other favored stars who were off limits, an 'F.O.P.' \u2014 'Friend of Pecker.'\nMr. Trump and Mr. Pecker, along with Mr. Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen, hatched a plan in August 2015 to boost his upstart presidential campaign, prosecutors say. The former Trump allies are each expected to take a turn on the witness stand, giving testimony that could help make him the first president convicted of a felony.\nProsecutors for Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, will try to show that the hush money payment to a porn star at the center of the trial was part of a larger effort to suppress negative news about Mr. Trump to sway the election. That scheme, they will contend, includes two other deals, both involving Mr. Pecker.\nMr. Trump had announced his presidential campaign in June 2015. The plan the men laid out two months later was simple, according to court documents, interviews with people involved in the events or familiar with them, private communications and other records.\nMr. Pecker would use The Enquirer to publish positive stories about Mr. Trump's campaign and negative stories about his rivals. He would alert Mr. Trump, through Mr. Cohen, when The Enquirer learned of stories that might threaten Mr. Trump. The Enquirer could buy the rights to those stories in order to suppress them, a practice known in the tabloid world as 'catch and kill.'\nIn late 2015, Mr. Pecker's company paid $30,000 to suppress a claim by a former doorman at a Trump building who said he had heard Mr. Trump fathered a child out of wedlock \u2014 a rumor that was apparently untrue. Then in August 2016, The Enquirer's parent company paid $150,000 to a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, to keep her account of an affair with Mr. Trump quiet. Two months later, Mr. Pecker and The Enquirer's editor helped Mr. Cohen negotiate a $130,000 hush-money payment with Stormy Daniels, the former porn star who also said she had sex with Mr. Trump. He has denied both women's claims.\nMr. Cohen pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance crimes in 2018.\nThe Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., made a deal that year to avoid federal prosecution, acknowledging that it had illegally tried to influence the election.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 12:07 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:07 p.m. ET Maggie Haberman\nMaggie Haberman Reporting from the courthouse Merchan stops testimony, says he realizes jurors weren't given writing materials to take notes.

Some have worked for Mr. Trump for years. Others are more recent additions, but are involved in the former president's broader legal defense, also representing him in other criminal cases.\nHere's a look at Mr. Trump's defense team:\nMr. Blanche started representing Mr. Trump last year, leaving a prestigious position as a partner at Wall Street's oldest law firm to take him on as a client. He is also representing Mr. Trump in his federal classified documents case in Florida and his federal election interference case in Washington.\nMr. Blanche has also represented Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, as well as Boris Epshteyn, an adviser to Mr. Trump. Before turning to private practice, Mr. Blanche was a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, where he supervised violent-crime cases.\nMs. Necheles has been a lawyer for Mr. Trump since 2021 and represented the Trump Organization during its criminal tax fraud trial in Manhattan. The business was convicted of 17 felonies and ordered by Justice Juan M. Merchan to pay the maximum penalty of $1.6 million.\nMs. Necheles previously represented defendants in major organized-crime and public-corruption cases, including Venero Mangano, the Genovese crime family underboss who was known as Benny Eggs.\nMr. Bove, the newest addition to Mr. Trump's legal team, is a legal partner to Mr. Blanche. He is a former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York who turned to private practice and now represents defendants charged with white-collar crimes.\nMr. Stern is a law partner to Ms. Necheles and also defended the Trump Organization in its criminal tax-fraud trial. He has previous experience representing clients charged with bribery, fraud and conspiracy.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Justice Juan M. Merchan handed prosecutors a legal cudgel that could dissuade Donald J. Trump from testifying. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times The judge in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial ruled on Monday morning that prosecutors could ask the former president about a range of previous cases that he has lost, as well as past violations of gag orders, in the event that he decides to testify in his defense.\nAmong other cases, the ruling by the judge, Juan M. Merchan, would allow prosecutors to question Mr. Trump about the civil fraud case brought by the New York attorney general, Letitia James, in which the former president was found to have inflated his net worth to obtain favorable loans. That case resulted in a $454 million judgment against Mr. Trump.\nJustice Merchan will also allow the Manhattan district attorney's office \u2014 which brought the case against Mr. Trump \u2014 to question him about civil cases brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll. Those cases found that Mr. Trump was liable for sexually abusing and defaming Ms. Carroll in the first instance and for defamation in the second. (Justice Merchan did not mention the sexual abuse finding, only the defamation, in his ruling regarding the Carroll cases on Monday.)\nJustice Merchan will also let prosecutors ask about Mr. Trump's attack on a law clerk in a civil fraud case, in violation of a gag order, as well as a 2018 decision that led to the dissolution of the Donald J. Trump Foundation to resolve a case brought by the New York attorney general at the time, Barbara Underwood, over financial irregularities.\nThe former president suggested in early April that he would testify in the criminal trial, saying that prosecutors 'have no case.' That said, Mr. Trump has promised to testify in previous cases only to back out, and Justice Merchan's decision could change his thinking on such a maneuver.\nJustice Merchan said that, in the event that Mr. Trump did testify, he would give jurors 'careful and specific' instructions about the scope of prosecutors' queries, adding that he had 'greatly curtailed' what specifics could be the target of questions.\nHowever, Justice Merchan warned Mr. Trump that his ruling was 'a shield and not a sword' and that the former president's testimony could open 'the door to questioning that has otherwise been excluded.'\nMr. Trump is being tried on charges that he falsified business records to cover up a hush-money payment to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election.

Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, has assembled an accomplished team to take on perhaps the most high-profile case in his office's history: the first criminal trial against former President Donald J. Trump. The group includes veteran prosecutors and former white-collar criminal defense lawyers who have extensive experience going up against Mr. Trump.\nHere's a look at the prosecution team:\nMr. Steinglass, who has served as an assistant district attorney since 1998, is a recent addition to this case; in 2022 he helped lead the team that secured a conviction against the Trump Organization for conspiracy, criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records. He typically prosecutes significant violent crimes, such as a violent brawl on the Upper East Side that led to the conviction of two Proud Boy extremists in 2019.\nAfter starting her career at the Manhattan district attorney's office, Ms. Hoffinger founded her own firm and spent 20 years as a defense lawyer focusing on white-collar criminal defense. She rejoined the district attorney's office in 2022 and worked with Mr. Steinglass to obtain the conviction of the Trump Organization in its criminal tax fraud trial.\nA prosecutor for 28 years, Mr. Conroy previously led the Manhattan district attorney's office's major economic crimes unit, where he was involved in the prosecution of the bankrupt law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf and supervised investigations into multinational financial institutions for falsification of business records. Mr. Conroy is the longest serving member of this trial team.\nMr. Colangelo joined the district attorney's office in 2022 after serving for two years as a senior official at the U.S. Department of Justice. He previously worked for the New York attorney general's office, where he oversaw the investigation into the Trump Foundation, which led to its dissolution. He was also, for a time, one of the lead lawyers on the civil fraud inquiry into Mr. Trump.\nBefore joining Mr. Bragg's major economic crimes unit in 2022, Ms. Mangold clerked for a U.S. District Court judge in New Jersey and worked in private practice for over 10 years. As a partner at the law firm Kobre & Kim, Ms. Mangold focused on criminal and regulatory investigations related to financial misconduct.\nMs. Ellis joined the Manhattan district attorney's office in 2018 after working as an associate at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. Before becoming a lawyer, Ms. Ellis worked as a legal analyst at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Broadcast feeds from the trial are limited to those from outside the courtroom.

But you will not be able to watch the proceedings on TV.\nThere will be no video feed aired live from the courtroom. Nor will there be an audio feed, as some federal courts allow.\nNew York courts generally do not permit video to be broadcast from courtrooms, although a feed is being transmitted into an overflow room for the reporters covering the trial. And cameras will be stationed in the hallway outside the courtroom to capture Mr. Trump's remarks as he enters and leaves.\nShortly after court adjourned on Monday, the state's chief administrative judge, Joseph A. Zayas, issued a statement saying that transcripts of each day of the trial would be published online by the end of the following day on the court system's website.\nJudge Zayas was responding to a request for public transcripts filed last week by a New York lawyer, Jim Walden, on behalf of a civic group and a news website.\n'With current law restricting the broadcasting of trial proceedings and courtroom space for public spectators very limited, the release of the daily transcripts on the court system's website is the best way to provide the public a direct view of the proceedings in this historic trial,' Judge Zayas wrote in his statement.\nCourt will be in session, for the most part, every weekday except Wednesdays, from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., until the trial ends.\nThe weeklong jury selection process was a pressure cooker for many of the nearly 300 Manhattan residents who were summoned to be interviewed.

The two Manhattan residents were led into the courtroom to fulfill a foundational civic duty: to be interviewed as prospective jurors.\nBut in the room when they arrived was a defendant, Donald J. Trump, unlike any in American history.\nBoth would-be jurors, a man and a woman, were eventually excused. But the experience thrust them into the spotlight in a way they never had imagined.\nOne was challenged by Mr. Trump's lawyers over his past social media posts relating to the former president. The other has a medical practice that she could not shut for six weeks while serving on the jury.\nWhile they were not chosen as jurors, their experiences illustrate the intensity of the attention focused on Mr. Trump's trial \u2014 and on the first jury to ever weigh the fate of a former United States president in a criminal proceeding.\nBoth contacted The New York Times only after they were excused from serving. Though the court's rules protecting prospective jurors' identities end when they are dismissed from serving, The Times is withholding their names and most identifying characteristics about them.\nLike the other prospective jurors who were considered, both included detailed personal information on the juror questionnaires they filled out, including where they work.\nThey were made to answer those questions by speaking into a microphone in open court; soon, both were blindsided as details of their lives ricocheted around the internet. They said they were frustrated that so much attention was devoted to prospective jurors and ascertaining information about them.\nWhile they later learned that the judge in the case, Justice Juan M. Merchan, had ordered the redaction of some of the information jurors were ordered to reveal publicly, they felt that he had acted too late. As with many things connected to the trial, the rhythms and even some of the parameters are being written in real time.\nTheir experiences mirrored some that other prospective jurors who were dismissed have described. One, a man who gave his name as Mark to NBC News, said he had 'satirized Mr. Trump often in my artwork,' and because of that, he had expected not to be chosen.\nA woman who gave her name as Kara, who said the nature of her job made serving extremely difficult, told NBC News that she realized the gravity of serving on any criminal jury, but particularly this one.\nSeeing Mr. Trump in person, she said, was 'very jarring.' He was, she realized, just 'another guy.'\nOne of the prospective jurors who spoke with The Times, the man, did not immediately realize what case he was involved in when he was led into the courtroom on the 15th floor of the Manhattan criminal courthouse. The woman had a sense a week earlier, having read a news story about the trial beginning the week she was supposed to respond to a juror summons.\nThe man, sitting a few rows behind the prosecutors' table when the two were part of the first panel of 96 prospective jurors brought into the courtroom Monday afternoon, felt a sense of calm about five minutes into being there. Trump was simply a defendant, he thought. It was a business-records trial. Prosecutors were on one side, the defense lawyers on the other.\nThe woman was struck by the fact that Mr. Trump stood and waved to prospective jurors, she said, as he and his lawyers were introduced to the group. It felt more to her like the behavior of a campaigning candidate than of a criminal defendant. (Mr. Trump, of course, is both.)\nBoth were put off by efforts by Mr. Trump's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, to assess prospective jurors' views of Mr. Trump. The man said Mr. Blanche seemed 'folksy' in a way he found disingenuous, while the woman was sharper, describing a 'witch hunt' to root out people sympathetic to Democrats on the panel \u2014 a phrase Mr. Trump uses often to criticize the various prosecutors investigating his conduct.\nThe man in particular was frustrated that he was asked about past social media posts in which he had been critical of Mr. Trump, which Mr. Blanche's team raised and which Justice Merchan ultimately agreed meant the man should be excused.\nThe man believed he could have been fair and resented the implication that he could not have been. Both he and the woman, who said they believed in the system of jury service, noted that they had begun the day taking sworn oaths vowing to render a fair and impartial judgment on the evidence. The man believed his own views \u2014 especially views from years ago \u2014 had no bearing on his ability to judge the evidence. If anything, he said, he would have been hyper-conscious in doing so.\nBoth had realized the magnitude of what serving on that jury would mean.\nBut they were also conscious of the threats and blowback that could come with weighing evidence against Mr. Trump \u2014 particularly with their personal details traceable in public. And both had concerns about being chosen because of that; the man in particular said his spouse had been worried.\nBoth would have valued being part of the historic trial. But both also had a sense of relief that they were not picked.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J. Trump is accused of 34 felonies, but a conviction is no sure thing. Credit... Pool photo by Curtis Means In the official record, the case is known as the People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump, and, for now, the people have the stronger hand: They have insider witnesses, a favorable jury pool and a lurid set of facts about a presidential candidate, a payoff and a porn star.\nOn Monday, the prosecutors will formally introduce the case to 12 all-important jurors, embarking on the first prosecution of an American president. The trial, which could brand Mr. Trump a felon as he mounts another White House run, will reverberate throughout the nation and test the durability of the justice system that Mr. Trump is attacking in a way that no other defendant would be allowed to do.\nThough the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, has assembled a mountain of evidence, a conviction is hardly assured. Over the next six weeks, Mr. Trump's lawyers will seize on three apparent weak points: a key witness's credibility, a president's culpability and the case's legal complexity.\nProsecutors will seek to maneuver around those vulnerabilities, dazzling the jury with a tale that mixes politics and sex, as they confront a shrewd defendant with a decades-long track record of skirting legal consequences. They will also seek to bolster the credibility of that key witness, Michael D. Cohen, a former fixer to Mr. Trump who previously pleaded guilty to federal crimes for paying the porn star, Stormy Daniels.\nDaniel J. Horwitz, a veteran defense lawyer who previously worked in the Manhattan district attorney's office prosecuting white-collar cases, said prosecutors can be expected to corroborate Mr. Cohen's story wherever possible.\n'The prosecution has layers upon layers of evidence to back up what Michael Cohen says,' Mr. Horwitz said.\nDespite its tawdry particulars, District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg has cast the case as one of election interference. Credit... Pool photo by Mary Altaffer Both sides will lay out their cases in opening statements on Monday, offering dueling interpretations of the evidence some six years after the payoff to Ms. Daniels entered the public consciousness and briefly imperiled Mr. Trump's presidency.\nBut in previewing the case for prospective jurors last week, Manhattan prosecutors emphasized neither the payoff that secured Ms. Daniels's silence, nor the sex scandal that was buried in the process. One prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, instead distilled the trial's stakes to a fundamental question: 'This case is about the rule of law and whether or not Donald Trump broke it.'\nMr. Steinglass's boss, Mr. Bragg, has offered a loftier interpretation, casting Mr. Trump's actions as election interference. Although Mr. Trump's lawyers might claim he was merely trying to hide embarrassing stories from his family, Mr. Bragg says Mr. Trump orchestrated a scheme to conceal simmering sex scandals from voters as they headed to the polls in 2016. All told, his allies struck three hush-money deals, paying off people who had stories to tell \u2014 stories that could have derailed Mr. Trump's candidacy.\nthree hush-money deals, paying off people who had stories to tell \u2014 stories that could have derailed Mr. Trump's candidacy. Mr. Bragg's prosecutors will seek to turn that 2016 campaign strategy against him: The tactics that helped propel Mr. Trump to victory will be admitted as evidence and reconsidered far beyond the courtroom. Aides and friends who lied on Mr. Trump's behalf will take the witness stand to testify against him.\nThey include: David Pecker, the tabloid publisher who bought and buried damaging stories about Mr. Trump; Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman who tried to spin reporters; and Mr. Cohen, the fixer who paid Ms. Daniels. Mr. Pecker, who ran the company that owned The National Enquirer, is set to go first, and is expected to recount for the jury several conversations with Mr. Trump about the hush money, according to a person familiar with the plan.\nStormy Daniels was paid $130,000 to bury her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Credit... Jeenah Moon for The New York Times Mr. Trump faces 34 felony counts, and up to four years behind bars, but more than just his freedom is at stake. If convicted, he might lose the right to vote, including to cast a ballot for himself. If he were to win back the White House, he would be the first convicted criminal to serve as commander in chief. And the question of how he might serve a prison sentence, should it come to that if he does not receive probation, could throw the country into turmoil.\nAmerica has grown accustomed to seeing Mr. Trump smash through its customs and is now witnessing a phenomenon that is a first in the 248 years of its history. Presidents have been impeached, driven from office and rejected at the polls. Mr. Trump is about to be the first to have his fate decided not just by voters, but by 12 citizens in a jury box.\nAnd they all hail from Manhattan, the borough that made Mr. Trump famous, and where he is now deeply unpopular. A favorable jury pool, legal experts say, has given Mr. Bragg a leg up at the trial.\nYet the jury, which was made final on Friday and includes six alternates, is no rubber stamp: It includes at least two people who have expressed some affection for the former president, and it takes only one skeptical member to force a mistrial, an outcome that Mr. Trump would celebrate as a win.\nThe stakes are high for Mr. Bragg as well. He is betting his career and his legacy on a prosecution he inherited, rejected and then transformed.\nWhen he took office in 2022, he declined to bring a financial fraud case against Mr. Trump that his predecessor had prepared, prompting an uproar when two prosecutors resigned in protest.\nBut Mr. Bragg continued to investigate and soon revisited the hush-money deal \u2014 an episode that had become known internally as 'the zombie case,' because it kept coming back to life. Little more than a year after taking office, Mr. Bragg indicted the former president.\nThree other indictments followed in three other cities, but with those cases mired in delay, Mr. Bragg's trial may now be the only one that Mr. Trump will face before Election Day.\nThe Manhattan case comprises the three hush-money deals: with Ms. Daniels, with a former Playboy model and with a onetime doorman who told a tale of Mr. Trump fathering a child out of wedlock.\nMr. Pecker and his tabloid bought the silence of the doorman, whose story turned out to be false. They also bought the rights to the story told by the model, Karen McDougal, and then never wrote it, a practice known as 'catch and kill.'\nDavid Pecker, the chief executive of American Media, had a cooperative relationship with Mr. Trump for years. Credit... Marion Curtis/Associated Press Then there was Ms. Daniels, who was interested in selling her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Mr. Pecker drew the line there: Her price was too high.\nInstead, he and a top editor alerted Mr. Cohen, who soon paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 not to tell her story about a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump a decade earlier.\nMr. Cohen has said he acted at Mr. Trump's direction, but the former president is not charged over the payment itself. Instead, he stands accused of covering up the transaction by disguising reimbursements to Mr. Cohen.\nIn internal records, Mr. Trump's company marked those payments as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet no such expenses existed, prosecutors say, and the retainer agreement was fictional.\nMr. Trump is accused of engineering \u2014 or, at least, approving \u2014 the coverup. His company, prosecutors argue, produced 34 false records that underpin the counts against him: 11 checks, 11 monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted and 12 entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust.\nMr. Trump signed several of the checks in the White House, as prosecutors will surely point out at the trial.\nBut directly linking Mr. Trump to the plot to falsify those records is another matter altogether.\nHis lawyers will be likely to argue that he was oblivious, and that Mr. Cohen handled the specifics. Mr. Cohen hashed out the reimbursement plan with Mr. Trump's chief financial officer, Allen H. Weisselberg, who is serving jail time for perjury and will not testify, records show.\nThe lack of a firsthand witness to confirm Mr. Cohen's account is a potential flaw in the case, but it may not be fatal. Prosecutors plan to introduce a document containing Mr. Weisselberg's handwritten notes about the reimbursements \u2014 a key piece of evidence demonstrating that Mr. Cohen did not act alone.\nAnd under the law, the prosecutors need not prove that Mr. Trump personally falsified the records. Already during the trial's first week, Mr. Steinglass laid the groundwork with a simple analogy: He asked prospective jurors whether they could accept that, if a husband hired a hit man to murder his wife, the husband was just as guilty as the man who pulled the trigger.\n'Can you all follow the same kind of logic in this case?' Mr. Steinglass asked the prospective jurors. Many said they could.\nMr. Cohen is expected to offer the closest thing this case has to a smoking gun: He is likely to say that, in early 2017, he and Mr. Trump discussed the repayment scheme in the Oval Office.\nIf Mr. Trump testifies in his own defense, that could pit Mr. Cohen's word against Mr. Trump's \u2014 a he-said, he-said story, with two questionable narrators.\nWhether or not Mr. Trump takes the stand, the trial could become a referendum on Mr. Cohen's credibility, with the verdict possibly hinging on a convincing performance.\nIn 2018, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to a variety of federal crimes, admitting to participating in the hush-money deals with Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal and lying to Congress about plans for a Trump business deal in Russia. Mr. Trump's lawyers will seek to emphasize Mr. Cohen's checkered past at every turn.\nAnd, on cross-examination, Mr. Trump's lawyers are likely to portray Mr. Cohen as a serial liar with a grudge against his former boss.\nMichael D. Cohen, a former fixer to Mr. Trump and a conduit for the hush money, will be a crucial witness. Credit... Dave Sanders for The New York Times Susan Necheles, one of Mr. Trump's lawyers, began that campaign during jury selection. She referenced Mr. Cohen's 2022 book 'Revenge,' questioning the credibility of 'someone who says that they want revenge against President Trump.'\nYet the prosecution is expected to note that Mr. Cohen told many of his lies for Mr. Trump. And prosecutors will offer evidence corroborating the broad strokes of Mr. Cohen's story, which could persuade jurors when they are weighing his testimony about the crucial Oval Office meeting.\nMr. Trump's White House executive assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, who has been identified as a potential witness, could confirm that Mr. Cohen did indeed meet with Mr. Trump, even if she cannot confirm what they discussed. Mr. Pecker can support at least some of Mr. Cohen's testimony about Mr. Trump's involvement in the hush-money deals. And a recording Mr. Cohen made of a call he had with Mr. Trump will capture the former president discussing the deal with Ms. McDougal.\n'The prosecution's argument is that you can trust Michael Cohen beyond a reasonable doubt as to their isolated conversation,' said Mr. Horwitz, the former prosecutor. He called the approach 'Prosecuting 101.'\nWilliam K.

In February, they sued the company, claiming that Trump Media \u2014 which made its trading debut last month at an $8 billion valuation \u2014 was trying to deprive them of the full value of their shares. Now they also claim the company is trying to prevent them from selling those shares.\nIn a separate lawsuit that followed, Trump Media claimed that Mr. Moss and Mr. Litinsky should forfeit their shares because their poor decision-making had contributed to a yearslong delay in its merger with Digital World Acquisition Corporation. Trump Media agreed to merge with Digital World, a cash-rich shell company, in 2021 as a way to go public, but the deal closed only in March.\nThe pair's stake is worth more than $220 million based on the current $26 share price of Trump Media, compared with $2 billion for Mr. Trump. Overall, the stock has fallen about 62 percent from where it began trading on March 26.\nThe litigation provides a portrait of some of the chaos that has bedeviled Trump Media since its inception. The lawsuits are also a distraction for the fledgling company, which is struggling to show that it is a viable business rather than a money-losing entity whose value is derived solely from Mr. Trump's presence on its flagship platform. On Tuesday, the company announced plans to launch a streaming video service to draw in more users.\nMr. Moss, now an Atlanta financial planner and radio host, and Mr. Litinsky, a conservative media personality, met Mr. Trump during the second season of 'The Apprentice,' which ran for 15 episodes in 2004.

That said, Mr. Trump has promised to testify in previous cases only to back out, and Justice Merchan's decision could change his thinking on such a maneuver.\nJustice Merchan said that, in the event that Mr. Trump did testify, he would give jurors 'careful and specific' instructions about the scope of prosecutors' queries, adding that he had 'greatly curtailed' what specifics could be the target of questions.\nHowever, Justice Merchan warned Mr. Trump that his ruling was 'a shield and not a sword' and that the former president's testimony could open 'the door to questioning that has otherwise been excluded.'\nMr. Trump is being tried on charges that he falsified business records to cover up a hush-money payment to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election. He has denied the charges.","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jesse McKinley","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/22/multimedia/22trump-trial-sandoval-jwkg/22trump-trial-sandoval-jwkg-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":7.50575,"_id":"f2a02b16e3c7e683171e50fa44401a67"},{"title":"Business and a Second Trump Term","author":"David Leonhardt","published_date":"2024-04-17 10:35:02","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/briefing/trump-election-ceos-business.html","clean_url":"nytimes.com","excerpt":"Times reporters discuss the relationship between major C.E.O.s and Donald Trump.","summary":"If Donald Trump wins a second term, he has promised to govern as no modern president has, imposing steep tariffs, rounding up immigrants, freeing Jan. 6 rioters and possibly pulling out of NATO.

They don't believe Trump will do what he has promised, in contrast to many scholars who have studied politicians like Trump and believe that he will follow through.\nTo make sense of the situation, I asked for help from Jonathan and three Times reporters who have been covering Trump's second-term plans: Maggie Haberman, Charlie Savage and Jonathan Swan.

Trump's presidential campaign committee ended March with $45 million on hand, federal filings showed Saturday, as he tries to close the fund-raising gap with President Biden.\nBut Mr. Trump's campaign is spending much less than it was at the start of the year, which has helped it inch closer. In March, it spent just $3.7 million, the new filings show, compared with $11.4 million in January \u2014 and much less than the $29.2 million spent by Mr. Biden's campaign in March. In other words, Mr. Trump's campaign is guarding resources as it seeks to build a campaign war chest for the general election.\nThis cycle began with the announcement of former President Donald J.

Since late February, the president has cut a deficit of five percentage points to a single point, a virtual tie, according to a recent survey by The New York Times and Siena College.\nThe rivals each capitalized on splashy fund-raisers in the past month that brought in tens of millions of dollars for their respective campaigns. But Mr. Trump's haul from an April 6 event in Palm Beach, Fla., will be reflected on a future filing. His campaign reported that it and the Republican National Committee raked in more than $50.5 million from the dinner, which was held at the home of the billionaire John Paulson.\nBy the end of the 2020 cycle Biden had raised and spent more than $1 billion and Trump more than $700 million dollars.\nFigures are for the 2020 and 2024 Biden and Trump presidential campaign committees as of the last day of the month.

We should focus on our freedoms and continue to uphold our Constitution. So talking in hypotheticals is not something that I do.' President Trump's campaign committee ended March with $45 million on hand, up from $33.5 million at the end of February, an improvement as he seeks to close the formidable fund-raising gap with President Biden, whose campaign had $85.5 million.

'We did not do justice by our country by showing and fighting over that day. We should focus on our freedoms and continue to uphold our Constitution.

When the interviewer, Dana Bash, pressed her on whether Mr. Pence had been wrong to certify the election results, Ms. Noem again avoided a direct answer, instead criticizing Mr. Pence for denouncing Mr. Trump after Jan. 6. 'I wasn't in Mike Pence's shoes, and the information that he had at that time \u2014 I don't know how he based his decisions,' she said. 'I think he's a nice man. I think that he's failed Donald Trump since that day, because he certainly does not recognize that we need someone in the White House who needs him out on the trail advocating for him, instead of constantly criticizing and going back and ripping him apart.' On abortion, Ms. Noem, who supported a federal ban when she was a member of Congress, said she now believed restrictions should be left to individual states. That is the position Mr. Trump took this month, though his allies have developed plans that could functionally ban abortion nationwide without formally doing so. Mr. Trump has also expressed support for rape and incest exceptions, which South Dakota's near-total abortion ban does not include. When asked about that, Ms. Noem tried to distance herself from her own state's law, noting that it was a 'trigger ban' enacted years ago to take effect if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. 'The law in my state was passed decades before I ever became governor,' she said, adding: 'That may be a topic that will continue to be discussed in South Dakota. Our law today allows an exception to save the life of the mother, but the people in South Dakota will decide what their laws look like.' She did not give a clear answer when Ms. Bash asked what she believed South Dakota's laws should look like. 'I can have an opinion, and I can weigh forward and I can look at the science and what we've learned about babies in the womb and believe that we should protect life, but I think that our law today is what South Dakota wants,' she said. 'And they'll continue to have that debate, and I'll continue to follow through on my role, which is to make sure the will of the people is enforced.' Ms. Bash repeated her question, and Ms. Noem implied \u2014 but did not say outright \u2014 that she might oppose a rape and incest exception. 'We have a law that says that there is an exception for the life of the mother, and I just don't believe a tragedy should perpetuate another tragedy,' she said. Versions of that statement are common among people who believe abortion should be illegal even in cases of rape and incest. 'I believe in taking care of mothers that are in a crisis situation and that we should be locking alongside them, giving them all the information and the best information they can make before they have to be put in a situation where an abortion is the only option that they have,' she added. Ms. Noem also echoed Mr. Trump's claims that the criminal charges against him in New York \u2014 where his trial began last week \u2014 were political, and affirmed that she would support him even if he were convicted of felonies. 'When he was in the White House, every single day as governor, I got to be on offense, I got to solve problems,' she said. 'And since Joe Biden has been in the White House, I just have to defend the freedoms of my people in South Dakota. I'm every day trying to push back on what this federal government is trying to do by increasing costs for the everyday families that get up every day and go to work. So yes, Donald Trump should be back in that White House. I'm going to do all I can to help him win.' Credit... Chris Seward/Associated Press Former President Donald J. Trump's presidential campaign committee ended March with $45 million on hand, federal filings showed Saturday, as he tries to close the fund-raising gap with President Biden. But Mr. Trump's campaign is spending much less than it was at the start of the year, which has helped it inch closer. In March, it spent just $3.7 million, the new filings show, compared with $11.4 million in January \u2014 and much less than the $29.2 million spent by Mr. Biden's campaign in March. In other words, Mr. Trump's campaign is guarding resources as it seeks to build a campaign war chest for the general election. This cycle began with the announcement of former President Donald J. Trump's campaign in November 2022 and President Biden's in April 2023. Raised $43.8 $158.5 $15.3 $114.7 Spent $29.2 $74.3 $4 $70.1 Net cash $85.5 \u2014 $44.6 \u2014 Mr. Biden's campaign had $85.5 million on hand at the end of March, according to its monthly filing with the Federal Election Commission, a significant increase from the month before: He ended February with $71 million in his campaign account while Mr. Trump ended February with less than half that. As Mr. Trump and Republicans chase the Democrats' financial edge, Mr. Biden has also started to narrow the polling gap between himself and Mr. Trump. Since late February, the president has cut a deficit of five percentage points to a single point, a virtual tie, according to a recent survey by The New York Times and Siena College. The rivals each capitalized on splashy fund-raisers in the past month that brought in tens of millions of dollars for their respective campaigns. But Mr. Trump's haul from an April 6 event in Palm Beach, Fla., will be reflected on a future filing. His campaign reported that it and the Republican National Committee raked in more than $50.5 million from the dinner, which was held at the home of the billionaire John Paulson. The total nearly doubled the $26 million that Mr. Biden's campaign said it raised on March 28 at Radio City Music Hall in New York, a star-studded event headlined by the president and two former presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Those funds were included in Mr. Biden's March fund-raising numbers. Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump are primarily raising money though joint fund-raising agreements with their respective parties, arrangements that legally allow them to pull in hundreds of thousands of dollars from individual donors, some of which flows into their campaigns. Joint fund-raising committees for both candidates filed reports with the Federal Election Commission this week, providing the first details of 2024 of major donors to both candidates, and the total scale of their fund-raising haul. But the F.E.C. reports for presidential campaigns, which are filed monthly in election years, offer different insights about candidates' activities and how the committees backing them are spending money. By the end of the 2020 cycle Biden had raised and spent more than $1 billion and Trump more than $700 million dollars. For example, federal law guarantees political campaigns bottom-dollar rates for broadcast advertising, so campaign committees are often used to pay for television time. In the first three months of 2024, Mr. Biden's campaign has spent $45.2 million on media buys and production, filings show \u2014 more than half of its total of $74.1 million in spending. The Biden campaign has spent $6.9 million on payroll and related expenses, and an additional $6.9 million on 'text message outreach.' His campaign's spending shot up in March, after two relatively steady months. In contrast, Mr. Trump's campaign spending has slowed sharply since the beginning of the year, when he was still fending off Republican primary challengers. Since Jan. 1, Mr. Trump's campaign has spent $23 million \u2014 but just $3.7 million of that was in March. His campaign has paid $6 million for placed media this year, all of it before Super Tuesday. One of Mr. Trump's committees \u2014 a leadership PAC called Save America, which he has used to pay his legal bills \u2014 reported on Saturday that it had almost $4.1 million on hand at the end of March, roughly the same amount as it had at the end of February. The group spent $5 million in March, including $3.7 million in bills to the legal teams defending him. Mr. Trump's campaign itself also paid about $473,000 in legal expenses. A super PAC backing Mr. Trump, MAGA Inc., reported raising $14.4 million in March, including a $5 million contribution from the former Trump cabinet official Linda McMahon and $4.2 million from Robert T. Bigelow, an aerospace and real estate mogul. The group also transferred $5 million to Save America \u2014 part of a huge refund of money from the super PAC to the committee over the past year. With national polls consistently suggesting that the rematch between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden could hinge on a few states or a single one, that has magnified the candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running as an independent. It has also drawn attention to how the liberal scion is paying for his campaign and what he is spending money on, including for ballot access and security. His selection of Nicole Shanahan, a wealthy Silicon Valley lawyer and investor, as his running mate already appears to have become a boon for his campaign. Of the $5.4 million that Mr. Kennedy raised in March, $2 million came from Ms. Shanahan, who until last year was married to the Google co-founder Sergey Brin. A correction was made on : An earlier version of this story misstated the total amount MAGA Inc. raised in March. It was $14.4 million, not $9.4 million. The lower figure inaccurately took into account a $5 million transfer from the group to another Trump committee. How we handle corrections Credit... Travis Dove for The New York Times After former President Donald J. Trump sat in a courtroom in New York for much of the last week, Saturday night was supposed to herald a return to the campaign trail and the large rallies where he often gives long, freewheeling speeches. With thousands gathered on the tarmac at an airport in Wilmington, N.C., Mr. Trump's campaign was building anticipation. Two hours before he was set to speak, the campaign sent a fund-raising blast with a message from Mr. Trump: 'They can't keep me off stage! Did they think I would run and hide?' Ninety minutes later, the skies darkened to charcoal and lightning flashed. As thunderstorms swept toward the area and the National Weather Service issued watches and warnings concerning dangerous winds and hail, the rally was canceled over safety concerns. 'We'll make up for this very quickly at another time,' Mr. Trump said on a call he made into the rally that was broadcast over the speakers. 'We'll do it as quick as possible. I'm devastated that this could happen.' But the cancellation, which Mr. Trump indicated was out of his hands, highlights the challenges that he may face as he tries to balance his presidential campaign with a criminal trial that will keep him busy through May. For much of the last week, Mr. Trump's public comments had been limited to social media posts and remarks to reporters outside the courtroom. His only campaign stop was at a bodega in New York City, in a state he overwhelmingly lost in the last two elections and that is not expected to be in play in November. Saturday's rally was expected to serve as a preview of the upcoming weeks, with Mr. Trump traveling on weekends to campaign in battleground states that are more central to his efforts to return to the White House. He has repeatedly claimed that the trial is preventing him from campaigning in places like North Carolina, which he won in 2016 and 2020, but where Democrats are making a big push in November. Opening arguments are slated to start on Monday, and the trial is set to last six to eight weeks. As is often the case with Mr. Trump's rallies, the crowds began lining up hours ahead of his expected remarks. Among those gathered outside was a group wearing shirts with the logo of the Proud Boys, a prominent far-right extremist group. One person held a sign that read 'Free All of the J6 Prisoners,' a reference to those serving sentences in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. Mr. Trump, who faces four criminal indictments that include charges tied to his efforts to overturn his election loss, has recently embraced dozens of Jan. 6 defendants. He has called them 'hostages' and has said he would consider pardoning them. In a statement, Ammar Moussa, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, criticized the group's presence, pointing to remarks Mr. Trump made in a debate in 2020, in which he told the Proud Boys to 'stand back and stand by.' 'This is Donald Trump's America: where white nationalists and violent far-right extremists are empowered and working families are left behind,' Mr. Moussa wrote. Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, responded in a statement, 'We don't comment on stupid.' Mr. Trump's remarks were expected to face particular scrutiny given that he is under a gag order in his criminal trial that bans him from attacking witnesses, prosecutors, jurors and court staff, as well as their relatives and relatives of the judge. Prosecutors have said Mr. Trump has violated the gag order seven times, and there is a hearing about the issue on Tuesday. Mr. Trump did travel to North Carolina earlier in the day, attending a fund-raiser in Charlotte in the afternoon. When he called into the rally, he told the attendees that he was minutes away from 'flying in' to Wilmington but that the authorities 'would prefer that we not come in' over safety concerns. 'I'm so sorry,' Mr. Trump said. 'But we'll do it again, and we'll do it bigger and better. You have my promise.' As the crowd left to seek shelter in their cars, vendors outside were still selling an array of merchandise, some of which had been created specifically for the occasion. One T-shirt promoted what it called the Wilmington stop on Mr. Trump's 'Save America' tour. 'I was there!' The shirt read. 'Where were you???'

Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, told CBS that President Biden needed to ensure 'that young people feel included in the conversation, not just as a vote but as part of the governing coalition.' He added, 'I think part of the frustration by young people is that they oftentimes don't feel heard. They feel like their voices and their votes are taken advantage of come election time.'

Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab New York City courtroom as Mr. Trump looked on.\nBefore jury selection began, the judge, Juan M. Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, rejected another effort to force his recusal by the defense, which cited several issues, including his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant.\nHe also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost.\nBut Mr. Trump's lawyers did persuade Justice Merchan that mentioning sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump was recorded bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial.\nEntering the courtroom Monday, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here,' but he looked less enthusiastic in front of Justice Merchan. He quietly slouched and scowled \u2014 and at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep.\nBy afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into the courtroom. Some quickly left: When the judge asked the first group of 96 if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused.\nThe remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Kate Christobek","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/16/multimedia/16trump-trial-day-1-mhqg/16trump-trial-day-1-mhqg-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":7.431175,"_id":"39012738845d2a9c19f8166a77fc9cc7"},{"title":"A Weary Trump Appears to Doze Off in Courtroom Ahead of Criminal Trial","author":"Maggie Haberman","published_date":"2024-04-15 17:21:01","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/15/nyregion/trump-asleep-criminal-trial.html","clean_url":"nytimes.com","excerpt":"The former president flashed signs of irritation at times, but also seemed to fall asleep, before jolting back awake.","summary":"Former President Donald J.

Trump goes on trial on Monday in Manhattan, President Biden and his allies are not likely to say much.\nFor Democrats, a former president facing criminal charges over covering up a sex scandal surrounding the 2016 campaign speaks for itself. The media coverage will be constant, especially if Mr. Trump takes the stand, which he has floated as a possibility. And while Mr. Trump faces up to eight weeks in court, Mr. Biden will be on the campaign trail and employing a 'Rose Garden strategy' as he governs from the White House, a contrast that the president's aides hope voters will view favorably.\nThe approach could be bolstered by the fact that Mr. Trump will be appearing in a court case involving salacious details and questionable financial maneuverings while Mr. Biden is addressing a conflict in the Middle East.\nMr. Biden and his campaign have said nothing publicly about the criminal indictments against Mr. Trump, worried about improperly influencing the cases or stoking Mr. Trump's repeated allegations \u2014 made without evidence \u2014 that Mr. Biden has engineered the charges.\nMany of the deep-pocketed outside Democratic groups supporting the Biden campaign are charting a similar path. Part of their calculation, they say, is that ads promoting Mr. Biden's record or arguing that Mr. Trump is a threat to democracy are testing better with voters than highlighting Mr. Trump's legal troubles. Another consideration is that the Manhattan case, which is being brought by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, is not easily explained in a sound bite or a 30-second ad.\n'I just don't think in the end it's the strongest argument for voters,' said Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist running a pro-Biden super PAC called Unite the Country. 'Campaigns have limited resources and you spend those resources in a way that moves the most votes.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Cannon denied requests by Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira to have the charges against them dropped.","summary":"The federal judge overseeing former President Donald J. Trump's classified documents case on Thursday denied initial attempts by Mr. Trump's two co-defendants to have the charges against them dismissed.\nThe ruling by the judge, Aileen M. Cannon, was the first time she had rejected dismissal motions by the two men, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, both of whom work for Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence in Florida.\nProsecutors in the office of the special counsel, Jack Smith, say that Mr. Nauta, one of Mr. Trump's closest personal aides, and Mr. De Oliveira, the property manager of Mar-a-Lago, conspired with the former president to hide from the government boxes of classified materials that Mr. Trump had removed from the White House, and then took part in a related plot to destroy security camera footage of the boxes being moved. The men have also been charged with lying to investigators working on the case.\nAt a hearing last week in Federal District Court in Fort Pierce, Fla., lawyers for the two men tried to convince Judge Cannon that their clients had no idea that the boxes they had moved on Mr. Trump's behalf contained classified materials. The lawyers also said they needed more details about the evidence against the men than what was contained in the 53-page superseding indictment.\nMr. Nauta's lawyer, Stanley Woodward Jr., raised an additional claim: that the obstruction statute his client was charged with violating was unconstitutionally vague.\nOn Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard somewhat similar arguments about that law, which has been used not only against hundreds of pro-Trump rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, but also against Mr. Trump himself in both the classified documents case and the federal case in which he stands accused of plotting to overturn the 2020 election.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Debs campaigned from a prison cell more than a century ago has the United States experienced what might now happen: a prominent candidate with a felony conviction running for president. And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning.\nFor now, he faces no formal campaign restrictions, beyond having to be present in a courtroom, and he remains highly competitive in polls. But some of the cases are proceeding at a pace that could bring verdicts before the election \u2014 and the Constitution and American law have clear answers for only some of the questions that will arise if he is convicted.\nOthers would bring the country into truly uncharted territory, with huge decisions resting in the hands of federal judges.\nHere is what we know, and what we don't know.\nThis is the simplest question of the bunch. The answer is yes.\nThe Constitution sets very few eligibility requirements for presidents. They must be at least 35 years old, be 'natural born' citizens and have lived in the United States for at least 14 years.\nThere are no limitations based on character or criminal record. While some states prohibit felons from running for state and local office, these laws do not apply to federal offices.\nThe Republican and Democratic Parties have guaranteed spots on general-election ballots in every state, and the parties tell election officials whose name to put in their spot. States could, in theory, try to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on legally shaky ground.\n'We let states set the time, place and manner' of elections, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who specializes in election law, 'but I think the best reading of our Constitution is you don't let the state add new substantive requirements.'\nWhile that view is not universal among legal experts, it prevailed in court in 2019, after California passed a law requiring candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on primary ballots. A federal district judge blocked the law from taking effect, saying it was most likely unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court also unanimously blocked it as a violation of the state constitution, and the case never reached the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that states could not keep Mr. Trump off their ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies people who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' after taking an oath to support the Constitution.\nNumerous lawsuits had argued that Mr. Trump's actions before and on Jan. 6, 2021, met this bar. In December, the Colorado Supreme Court found him ineligible, and Maine's secretary of state did the same. But the Supreme Court \u2014 led by a conservative supermajority, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump himself \u2014 concluded that only Congress had the power to enforce Section 3 against candidates for federal office. (Four of the justices, including the three liberals, wanted to allow a wider range of options for disqualification.)\nCongress is not going to do that with Republicans in control of the House. And the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal cases, meaning convictions would not disqualify Mr. Trump either.\nCongress can designate either groups of people to whom Section 3 applies (such as people who fought for the Confederacy) or specific crimes that, upon conviction, would trigger disqualification, said Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University. But none of the crimes Mr. Trump is charged with carry that automatic penalty.\n'Whether or not Trump is tried, convicted, acquitted, that's a separate question from whether or not he's disqualified,' said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nOne of the charges in the federal case related to Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election \u2014 conspiracy to violate civil rights \u2014 once carried a disqualification penalty, Mr. Kreis said, but Congress removed it decades ago.\nNow that Mr. Trump has secured a majority of delegates to the Republican convention, the party has no mechanism to nominate somebody else. Under the party's official convention rules, if a delegate tries to support someone other than the person the primary results bound them to, 'such support shall not be recognized.'\nNor have top Republicans shown any interest in another nominee.\nIf he were forced to withdraw from the race after the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him.\nafter the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him. Probably not.\nMr. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, and he would be disenfranchised there if convicted of a felony.\nMost felons in Florida regain voting rights after completing their full sentence, including parole or probation, and paying all fines and fees. But it is highly unlikely that Mr. Trump, if convicted, would have time to complete his sentence before Election Day.\nHe could also petition for clemency, which would require the approval of the governor \u2014 Ron DeSantis, who ran against Mr. Trump in the Republican primary \u2014 and two Florida cabinet members. Chris Taylor, the director of external affairs for the Florida Commission on Offender Review, confirmed that a Florida resident convicted of a felony could apply to have their voting rights restored through that process even if their conviction happened outside Florida.\nSince Mr. Trump also has a residence in New York, he could switch his voter registration there to take advantage of its more permissive approach: Felons in New York can vote while on parole or probation. But, as in Florida and almost every other state, they are still disenfranchised while in prison.\nSo if Mr. Trump is imprisoned, he could be in the extraordinary position of being deemed fit to be voted for, but unfit to vote.\nNo one knows.\n'We're so far removed from anything that's ever happened,' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley. 'It's just guessing.'\nLegally, Mr. Trump would remain eligible to be president even if he were imprisoned. The Constitution says nothing to the contrary. 'I don't think that the framers ever thought we were going to be in this situation,' Professor Levinson said.\nIn practice, the election of an incarcerated president would create a legal crisis that would almost certainly need to be resolved by the courts.\nIn theory, Mr. Trump could be stripped of his authority under the 25th Amendment, which provides a process to transfer authority to the vice president if the president is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' But that would require the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare Mr. Trump unable to fulfill his duties, a remote prospect given that these would be loyalists appointed by Mr. Trump himself.\nMore likely, Mr. Trump could sue to be released on the basis that his imprisonment was preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional obligations as president. Such a case would probably focus on the separation of powers, with Mr. Trump's lawyers arguing that keeping a duly elected president in prison would be an infringement by the judicial branch on the operations of the executive branch.\nOn the federal charges only, he could also try to pardon himself \u2014 or to commute his sentence, leaving his conviction in place but ending his imprisonment. Either action would be an extraordinary assertion of presidential power, and the Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of whether a 'self pardon' was constitutional.\nOr President Biden, on his way out the door, could pardon Mr. Trump on the basis that 'the people have spoken and I need to pardon him so he can govern,' Professor Chemerinsky said.\nBut that wouldn't apply to the New York or Georgia cases, because the president does not have pardon power for state charges.\nAgain, no one knows, particularly when it comes to the New York and Georgia cases.\nIn the two federal cases, a likely outcome would be that a Trump-appointed attorney general would withdraw the charges.\nThe Justice Department does not indict sitting presidents, a policy outlined in a 1973 memo, during the Nixon era. It has never had reason to develop a policy on what to do with an incoming president who has already been indicted. But the rationale for not indicting sitting presidents \u2014 that it would interfere with their ability to perform their duties \u2014 applies just as well in this hypothetical scenario.\n'The reasons why we wouldn't want to indict a sitting president are the reasons we wouldn't want to prosecute a sitting president,' said Professor Chemerinsky, who has disagreed with the department's reasoning. 'My guess is, if the Trump prosecution were still ongoing in some way and Trump were elected, the Justice Department \u2014 which would be the Trump Justice Department \u2014 would say, \u2018We're following the 1973 memo.''\nLike so much else here, this would be legally untested, and it is impossible to say what the Supreme Court would do if the question reached it.\nIn its Clinton v. Jones ruling in 1997, the court allowed a lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed. But that case was civil, not criminal, and it was filed by a private citizen, not by the government itself.\nCharlie Savage contributed reporting.","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ben Protess,Jonah E.

Also attending were members of pro-Trump groups like the Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative group skeptical about helping Ukraine.\nLeading the participants from Ukraine was Oleksandr Merezhko, the chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament's foreign affairs committee and an ally of President Volodymyr Zelensky. Reaching out to the Trump camp, he said, was simply a recognition of Ukraine's perilous vulnerability to the shifting sands of American politics.\n'When we are fighting for our survival, we can't afford to antagonize either Biden or Trump,' Mr. Merezhko said. 'If we place the wrong bet, we risk losing our country.'\nMr. Trump has not detailed his plans for Ukraine if he is re-elected, but many of his supporters are strongly opposed to helping the country in its battle against Russia.\nOleksandr Merezhko, left, the chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament's foreign affairs committee, and Zygimantas Pavilionis, a conservative member of Lithuania's Parliament, in Washington in February.

Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan, the first for an American president, and alternates are expected to be chosen on Friday should any of the first dozen have to drop out of the trial unexpectedly.\nOpening statements, where prosecutors and defense lawyers will introduce their dueling cases to the newly empaneled jury, are expected to begin as early as Monday.\nSeven new jurors were added in short order Thursday afternoon, hours after two others who had already been picked were abruptly excused. One alternate juror was also picked before court adjourned for the day, and the selection of alternates was set to resume on Friday morning.\nThe case stems from a hush-money payment made during the 2016 presidential campaign to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, who at the time was threatening to go public with her story of s sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. The $130,000 payment came from Mr. Trump's former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who has said he acted at Mr. Trump's direction. The Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, charged Mr. Trump with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, accusing him of having disguised reimbursements of Mr. Cohen to keep the sex scandal under wraps.\nMr. Trump has pleaded not guilty and has consistently denied having had sex with Ms. Daniels. If the jury convicts him, he faces up to four years behind bars.\nHere's what else to know about Day 4 of the trial:\nWith a full panel of regular jurors and one alternate already seated, court will commence at 9:30 a.m. Friday. Five more alternates are expected to be chosen. They will vote on Mr. Trump's guilt or innocence only if a regular member must leave the panel for some reason.\nIf there is time in the afternoon, there will be what is known as a Sandoval hearing, which will determine the questions that prosecutors can ask Mr. Trump if he chooses to testify.\nJustice Juan Merchan has ordered news outlets not to report prospective jurors' answers to two queries on a lengthy questionnaire: 'Who is your current employer?' and 'Who was your prior employer?'

Trump. Shortly before noon, lawyers began directly questioning the first group of prospective jurors to make it through initial queries. Questions involved their opinions on campaign finance law and on the trial's potential witnesses, including a porn star and a tabloid publisher. Earlier, some prospective jurors who had previously indicated that they would be able to be impartial had changed their minds after taking a night to think about it. 'I don't think I can be as impartial and unbiased as I hoped I could be,' one admitted. He was excused. It could take two weeks or more to pick the 12 jurors who will decide the case, which centers on allegations that the former president falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star, Stormy Daniels. The pool of possible jurors being scrutinized on Tuesday came from an initial group of 96, dozens of whom were dismissed immediately on Monday after indicating that they felt they could not fairly reach a decision. The dismissals underscored the difficulty of picking a jury in a city where the defendant is widely reviled. Mr. Trump, who may take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied all wrongdoing. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records that hid reimbursements to his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who had paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 to buy her silence. Prosecutors say that Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election. Here's what to know about the case: The case was brought a year ago by Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. It is one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, but may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nA day after Mr. Trump appeared to nod off during pretrial motions, he was back at the defense table. He appeared somewhat bored as the jury selection process continued, with prospective jurors responding to a series of mostly yes or no questions.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America.\nMr. Trump has repeatedly complained that the case is a politically motivated witch hunt and has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and his family, as well as key witnesses, including Mr. Cohen. Justice Merchan has imposed a gag order on Mr. Trump that bars him from attacking witnesses, jurors, prosecutors or the judge's family. Even before the trial began on Monday, prosecutors asked Justice Merchan to hold the former president in contempt of court over social media posts about Mr. Cohen; the judge said he would hold a hearing later this month.

Asked about the fairness of Trump being on trial in Manhattan, where he's an unpopular figure, Adams replied, 'That is beyond my pay grade.' But, he added, 'This city is a fair city.'

Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, accused Donald J. Trump of falsifying business records connected to a hush money payment to a porn star. Mr. Trump pleaded not guilty to all 34 felony counts. Credit Credit... Andrew Seng for The New York Times All 34 felony counts at the center of the Manhattan criminal case against former President Donald J. Trump stem from a $130,000 hush-money payment handed over to a porn star in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign. The specific charges are far less titillating: falsifying business records in the first degree. But a conviction could still result in jail time. The payment was made by Mr. Trump's fixer, Michael D. Cohen, to Stormy Daniels in order to buy her silence about a sexual liaison she said she had with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump directed him to make the payment. Paying hush money is not illegal. But while serving as the commander in chief, prosecutors say, Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen in a manner that constituted fraud: In internal records, Mr. Trump's company classified the reimbursement as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet there were no such expenses, according to prosecutors, who say the agreement was also fictional. Those records underpin the 34 counts of falsifying business records: 11 involve the checks, 11 center on monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted to the company and 12 involve entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust. Mr. Trump has denied all wrongdoing. In announcing the charges a year ago, Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, said that his office must keep a close eye on how companies conduct business in New York. 'This is the business capital of the world,' Mr. Bragg said. 'We regularly do cases involving false business statements. The bedrock \u2014 in fact, the basis for business integrity and a well-functioning business marketplace \u2014 is true and accurate record-keeping.' The charges against Mr. Trump are all Class E felonies, the lowest category in New York. Each count carries a maximum prison sentence of four years. Nothing in the law requires the judge, Juan E. Merchan, to imprison Mr. Trump if the jury convicts him. The judge could instead sentence him to probation. But Justice Merchan has made it clear that he takes white-collar crime seriously and could put Mr. Trump behind bars. It's possible, however, if Mr. Trump is convicted of more than one count, Justice Merchan would impose a concurrent sentence, under which Mr. Trump would serve all time simultaneously. Key Players in the Trump Criminal Trial \u203a  April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET Olivia Bensimon Reporting from outside the courthouse Journalists still vastly outnumber the Trump supporters who have gathered near the courthouse today. One man's Stars and Stripes flag flaps in the breeze, two other people are sitting on benches. Neighborhood workers on their lunch breaks bask in the spring sun. Jury selection is often a lengthy process, but in the first criminal trial of a former American president, currently taking place in a Manhattan criminal courthouse, it's going more slowly than normal. In part, that is because of the nature of the case: Jurors, once seated, will be asked to decide whether Donald J. Trump committed a crime. Prosecutors have charged him with 34 felonies, accusing him of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal that could have hurt his first presidential run. But the process has been particularly drawn-out because, once would-be jurors say they can be fair and impartial, they are being asked a series of 42 questions. After that, they face additional scrutiny from lawyers for the prosecution and the defense. Here are the 42 questions: 1. Without telling us your address, in what neighborhood do you live? For example, Upper East Side, Lower East Side, Inwood, etc. How long have you lived there? Are you a native New Yorker? If not, where did you live previously? 2. What do you do for a living?

Is there any reason, whether it be a bias or something else, that would prevent you from being fair and impartial if you are selected as a juror for this case? New York State makes no provision for anonymous juries, even in a case as sensitive as this one. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Last month, Justice Juan M. Merchan ordered that prospective jurors' names would be shielded from the public, underscoring the need for privacy for those who may decide Donald J. Trump's criminal fate \u2014 and tempt the anger of his followers. Yet on the first two days of jury selection, several prospective jurors revealed potentially identifying information, reflecting the difficulty of having an anonymous jury in a case with an intense media spotlight. On the first day, a woman said she worked for a city agency of approximately 500 people and revealed its name. Later, a man who identified himself as a bookseller revealed the name of the small store where he works. This continued on Tuesday when others revealed the names of employers. While some worked for companies that were large, where the potential jurors could likely remain unidentifiable, others were less cautious. One woman revealed the name of the three-person company she owns with her husband. Justice Merchan did not interject as the prospective jurors divulged the information, nor did he caution them against doing so. Juries are not completely anonymous in New York State. Mr. Trump, his lawyers and the prosecutors have access to the names of the prospective jurors. But after a request by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, Justice Merchan decided to withhold the names from the public. Mr. Trump did not oppose the request. The accidental self-identifications are a notable departure from how federal Judge Lewis A. Kaplan conducted jury selection in Mr. Trump's defamation trial in January, brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll. In the federal system, jurors are allowed to remain anonymous, even to parties in the case. Before potential jurors answered basic questions about their backgrounds, Judge Kaplan instructed them not to reveal personal information. 'Don't give us anything that could enable anybody to pin you down geographically,' he said. He also cautioned them not to reveal their names to each other, and when the trial concluded, he left them with these ominous words: 'My advice to you is that you never disclose that you were on this jury,' Judge Kaplan said. 'And I won't say anything more about it.'

There are currently 18 remaining from yesterday's initial group who have been interviewed by lawyers, and six more who have yet to be interviewed. The judge, Juan Merchan, said that he's hoping to bring in a new group of prospective jurors \u2014 likely around 100 of them \u2014 in the afternoon. Soon, we may have some actual jurors.

We can see prosecutors huddling and going over their notes, presumably evaluating the jurors and their responses. It's no exaggeration to say that this is one of the highest-stakes moments of the trial: evaluating who may help or sink the case based on little more than appearance, disposition and responses to a few questions. April 16, 2024, 12:42 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 12:42 p.m. ET Kate Christobek Reporting from the courthouse Trump has largely remained emotionless as his lawyer, Todd Blanche, has asked the prospective jurors what they think about the former president. But at one point, he smiled tightly when a potential juror said, 'I was a big fan of The Apprentice when I was in middle school.'

But the man refused to talk about it multiple times, saying it had \"absolutely no bearing on the case.' After some back and forth, he finally said he was a Democrat, but he did not budge further.

Justice Merchan knows the importance of getting this little piece of the process right: an appeals court two years ago overturned a conviction in a case he presided over when a defendant did not appear at an important sidebar, and the defendant hadn't waived the right to do so.

We are running 5 to 7 minutes per person. The very premise of the trial is that prosecutors believe Donald J. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times Donald J. Trump first ran for president nearly a decade ago. Now, as he runs again in a political climate that he helped create, his Manhattan criminal trial is partly a referendum on his tactics during that first campaign. The trial's very premise is that prosecutors believe Mr. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign \u2014 sex scandals involving a porn star and a Playboy model, for example \u2014 he concealed them, the prosecutors say. But in a development that will bolster their case, prosecutors on Monday secured permission from the judge to admit evidence connected to Mr. Trump's overall political strategy in 2016. Much of it bears the former president's imprint: aggressive tweets, false denials, coordination with a tabloid publisher and more. The judge's ruling showed how the weapons that worked so well for Mr. Trump then are being turned against him in the courtroom now. The techniques prosecutors highlighted Monday were not invented by Mr. Trump for use in his campaign; they are behaviors he exhibited throughout his life as a businessman and a reality-television star. But in modern American political history, such raw tactics had rarely been seen at such a high level. One example is Mr. Trump's relationship with The National Enquirer tabloid and its publisher, David Pecker, who is expected to appear as a witness. The Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case, obtained permission from the judge on Monday to introduce evidence related to a 2015 meeting among Mr. Trump, Mr. Pecker and Mr. Trump's former fixer, Michael D. Cohen. A prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, said on Monday that the three men had 'conspired to influence the 2016 election.' That meeting laid the groundwork for hush-money deals with a porn star, Stormy Daniels, and a Playboy model, Karen McDougal. But another result of that meeting, Mr. Steinglass said, were explosive headlines about Mr. Trump's opponents in the Republican primary, including those claiming that Ben Carson had committed 'medical malpractice' and that Senator Ted Cruz had a 'family connection to J.F.K.'s assassin.' A lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, protested the admission of evidence related to that meeting, saying that newspaper publishers met with candidates 'all the time,' and that there was nothing improper about it, let alone illegal. That admission worked against him. The judge, Juan M. Merchan, said that he was glad that Mr. Blanche believed that there was nothing wrong with the meeting \u2014 because it meant that he should not mind that the evidence would be introduced. 'There is no reason not to allow it in,' Justice Merchan said. Mr. Steinglass won again when he persuaded Justice Merchan to admit evidence of the Trump campaign in crisis after the publication in 2016 of the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump boasted about grabbing women by their genitals. 'The video sent the campaign into a tailspin,' Mr. Steinglass said. He offered up an email sent by a Washington Post reporter to Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump's campaign spokeswoman. Mr. Steinglass said that Ms. Hicks had forwarded the exchange to Stephen K. Bannon, Kellyanne Conway and other members of the campaign team, 'suggesting that their response should be to deny, deny, deny.' Eventually, he said, Mr. Bannon sent it to Mr. Cohen. Mr. Blanche again protested, but was again rebuffed. The judge said he would allow jurors to see the email, saying that the ensuing thread was relevant. The exchanges that prosecutors and defense lawyers debated on Monday underscored Mr. Trump's penchant for delegating dirty work to others, giving himself some distance in the process. The hush-money deals worked that way: Mr. Cohen paid off Ms. Daniels, while The National Enquirer bought Ms. McDougal's silence. (Mr. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to his reimbursement of Mr. Cohen.) That habit is still on display this year, and can be helpful given that Justice Merchan has barred Mr. Trump from attacking witnesses, prosecutors and the judge's own family. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump posted on social media a video of Laura Loomer, a political ally, in the park outside the courthouse. Ms. Loomer, speaking into a bullhorn, insinuated that the judge's family was politically compromised. Had Mr. Trump said that himself, he would have risked violating the judge's gag order.

Asked whether she knew anyone in the legal field, one prospective juror gave a candid answer. 'I dated a lawyer for a while,' she said, before pausing and adding: 'It ended fine.'

Very Manhattan.  April 16, 2024, 10:37 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 10:37 a.m. ET Jonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse Prospective jurors were asked at the beginning of jury selection yesterday whether they could be fair and impartial, and dozens were excused when they said they could not. But a few of those who have made it to this stage have realized while answering questions that they may have a tougher time than they thought. One prospective juror just admitted: 'I don't think I can be as impartial and unbiased as I hoped I could be.' He was excused.

Occasionally he fidgets, appears to write notes, whispers to his lawyer and at one point examined his tie. He largely stares ahead, not looking in the direction of the prospective jurors. But his glare fixates on the jury box when prospective jurors bring up conflicts, including a woman who said she realized overnight that she could not be impartial and unbiased. April 16, 2024, 10:03 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 10:03 a.m. ET Jonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse Prosecutors have now filed court documents claiming that Trump violated the gag order barring him from attacking witnesses. They are asking that he be fined $1,000 for each violation, so $3,000 in all. It will be some time before the motion is decided. On Tuesday, the spectacle of the first trial of a president was fading into New York's usual urban bustle. Credit... Yuki Iwamura/Associated Press The scene outside Manhattan's Criminal Court on Tuesday morning was placid \u2014 by New York standards \u2014 after the tense crush on the first day of Donald J. Trump's trial. On Monday, cable news stations had staked out every concrete surface bordering Centre Street. On Tuesday, there were swaths of open ground in the space reserved for media organizations. As the sun rose and workers in Collect Pond Park removed overflowing trash cans around 5:30 a.m., only five people were in the line for those holding official passes for entry. In the line for the general public were some familiar faces among court-watchers, including Ron Sinibaldi, whose hobbies include following high-profile cases. He's previously attended proceedings involving Senator Robert Menendez, who is accused of taking bribes, and New Jersey officials involved in closing the George Washington Bridge as political retribution. Everyday street scenes played out nearby. Around 7 a.m., a lone man fed pigeons in the park, which was sparsely populated by the time Mr. Trump's motorcade arrived nearly two hours later. An exception: one older man holding up a red Trump 2024 flag and shouting at television reporters: 'Fight! Fight! Fight for Donald Trump!' Shortly after, a line of young children toddled through, flanked by teacher's aides and clutching a rope, their neon orange vests a pop of color. Anusha Bayya contributed reporting.  April 16, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET Kate Christobek Reporting from the courthouse Jury selection is off to a slow start this morning. One of the prospective jurors who was next to answer questions was experiencing flu-like symptoms and was sent home. Two other jurors, who answered questions yesterday, are running late. Justice Merchan has decided to proceed without them for now but will keep them in the larger jury pool. April 16, 2024, 9:59 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:59 a.m. ET Kate Christobek Reporting from the courthouse The remaining prospective jurors are now in the courtroom. Justice Merchan kindly reminded them to be on time going forward.  In court Monday, former President Donald J. Trump scowled and scoffed, and apparently slept. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab New York City courtroom as Mr. Trump looked on. Before jury selection began, the judge, Juan M. Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, rejected another effort to force his recusal by the defense, which cited several issues, including his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. He also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost. But Mr. Trump's lawyers did persuade Justice Merchan that mentioning sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump was recorded bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial. Entering the courtroom Monday, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here,' but he looked less enthusiastic in front of Justice Merchan. He quietly slouched and scowled \u2014 and at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep. By afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into the courtroom. Some quickly left: When the judge asked the first group of 96 if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused. The remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.   The jury selection process in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan could take two weeks or more. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Lawyers representing the State of New York and Donald J. Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate. The potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair. The process could take two weeks or more \u2014 and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court. 'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.' The stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County \u2014 Manhattan, as most people know it \u2014 which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020. Mr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated. Prosecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28. Unlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.' Some may not be completely forthcoming. 'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said. Mr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors. 'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'  Former President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Not since Eugene V. Debs campaigned from a prison cell more than a century ago has the United States experienced what might now happen: a prominent candidate with a felony conviction running for president. And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning. Former President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases: two federal, one in New York and another in Georgia. The first of those to go to trial is the sex scandal cover-up in New York, where jury selection began on Monday. For now, he faces no formal campaign restrictions, beyond having to be present in a courtroom, and he remains highly competitive in polls. But some of the cases are proceeding at a pace that could bring verdicts before the election \u2014 and the Constitution and American law have clear answers for only some of the questions that will arise if he is convicted. Others would bring the country into truly uncharted territory, with huge decisions resting in the hands of federal judges. Here is what we know, and what we don't know. This is the simplest question of the bunch. The answer is yes. The Constitution sets very few eligibility requirements for presidents. They must be at least 35 years old, be 'natural born' citizens and have lived in the United States for at least 14 years. There are no limitations based on character or criminal record. While some states prohibit felons from running for state and local office, these laws do not apply to federal offices. The Republican and Democratic Parties have guaranteed spots on general-election ballots in every state, and the parties tell election officials whose name to put in their spot. States could, in theory, try to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on legally shaky ground. 'We let states set the time, place and manner' of elections, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who specializes in election law, 'but I think the best reading of our Constitution is you don't let the state add new substantive requirements.' While that view is not universal among legal experts, it prevailed in court in 2019, after California passed a law requiring candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on primary ballots. A federal district judge blocked the law from taking effect, saying it was most likely unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court also unanimously blocked it as a violation of the state constitution, and the case never reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that states could not keep Mr. Trump off their ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies people who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' after taking an oath to support the Constitution. Numerous lawsuits had argued that Mr. Trump's actions before and on Jan. 6, 2021, met this bar. In December, the Colorado Supreme Court found him ineligible, and Maine's secretary of state did the same. But the Supreme Court \u2014 led by a conservative supermajority, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump himself \u2014 concluded that only Congress had the power to enforce Section 3 against candidates for federal office. (Four of the justices, including the three liberals, wanted to allow a wider range of options for disqualification.) Congress is not going to do that with Republicans in control of the House. And the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal cases, meaning convictions would not disqualify Mr. Trump either. Congress can designate either groups of people to whom Section 3 applies (such as people who fought for the Confederacy) or specific crimes that, upon conviction, would trigger disqualification, said Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University. But none of the crimes Mr. Trump is charged with carry that automatic penalty. 'Whether or not Trump is tried, convicted, acquitted, that's a separate question from whether or not he's disqualified,' said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. One of the charges in the federal case related to Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election \u2014 conspiracy to violate civil rights \u2014 once carried a disqualification penalty, Mr. Kreis said, but Congress removed it decades ago. Now that Mr. Trump has secured a majority of delegates to the Republican convention, the party has no mechanism to nominate somebody else. Under the party's official convention rules, if a delegate tries to support someone other than the person the primary results bound them to, 'such support shall not be recognized.' Nor have top Republicans shown any interest in another nominee. If he were forced to withdraw from the race after the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him. Probably not. Mr. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, and he would be disenfranchised there if convicted of a felony. Most felons in Florida regain voting rights after completing their full sentence, including parole or probation, and paying all fines and fees. But it is highly unlikely that Mr. Trump, if convicted, would have time to complete his sentence before Election Day. He could also petition for clemency, which would require the approval of the governor \u2014 Ron DeSantis, who ran against Mr. Trump in the Republican primary \u2014 and two Florida cabinet members. Chris Taylor, the director of external affairs for the Florida Commission on Offender Review, confirmed that a Florida resident convicted of a felony could apply to have their voting rights restored through that process even if their conviction happened outside Florida. Since Mr. Trump also has a residence in New York, he could switch his voter registration there to take advantage of its more permissive approach: Felons in New York can vote while on parole or probation. But, as in Florida and almost every other state, they are still disenfranchised while in prison. So if Mr. Trump is imprisoned, he could be in the extraordinary position of being deemed fit to be voted for, but unfit to vote. No one knows. 'We're so far removed from anything that's ever happened,' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley. 'It's just guessing.' Legally, Mr. Trump would remain eligible to be president even if he were imprisoned. The Constitution says nothing to the contrary. 'I don't think that the framers ever thought we were going to be in this situation,' Professor Levinson said. In practice, the election of an incarcerated president would create a legal crisis that would almost certainly need to be resolved by the courts. In theory, Mr. Trump could be stripped of his authority under the 25th Amendment, which provides a process to transfer authority to the vice president if the president is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' But that would require the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare Mr. Trump unable to fulfill his duties, a remote prospect given that these would be loyalists appointed by Mr. Trump himself. More likely, Mr. Trump could sue to be released on the basis that his imprisonment was preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional obligations as president. Such a case would probably focus on the separation of powers, with Mr. Trump's lawyers arguing that keeping a duly elected president in prison would be an infringement by the judicial branch on the operations of the executive branch. On the federal charges only, he could also try to pardon himself \u2014 or to commute his sentence, leaving his conviction in place but ending his imprisonment. Either action would be an extraordinary assertion of presidential power, and the Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of whether a 'self pardon' was constitutional. Or President Biden, on his way out the door, could pardon Mr. Trump on the basis that 'the people have spoken and I need to pardon him so he can govern,' Professor Chemerinsky said. But that wouldn't apply to the New York or Georgia cases, because the president does not have pardon power for state charges. Again, no one knows, particularly when it comes to the New York and Georgia cases. In the two federal cases, a likely outcome would be that a Trump-appointed attorney general would withdraw the charges. The Justice Department does not indict sitting presidents, a policy outlined in a 1973 memo, during the Nixon era. It has never had reason to develop a policy on what to do with an incoming president who has already been indicted. But the rationale for not indicting sitting presidents \u2014 that it would interfere with their ability to perform their duties \u2014 applies just as well in this hypothetical scenario. 'The reasons why we wouldn't want to indict a sitting president are the reasons we wouldn't want to prosecute a sitting president,' said Professor Chemerinsky, who has disagreed with the department's reasoning. 'My guess is, if the Trump prosecution were still ongoing in some way and Trump were elected, the Justice Department \u2014 which would be the Trump Justice Department \u2014 would say, \u2018We're following the 1973 memo.'' Like so much else here, this would be legally untested, and it is impossible to say what the Supreme Court would do if the question reached it. In its Clinton v. Jones ruling in 1997, the court allowed a lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed. But that case was civil, not criminal, and it was filed by a private citizen, not by the government itself. Charlie Savage contributed reporting.  \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe challenging process of choosing a jury in the first criminal trial of a former American president proceeded slowly on Tuesday, as prospective jurors were questioned individually about their ability to fairly consider the charges against Donald J. Trump.\nShortly before noon, lawyers began directly questioning the first group of prospective jurors to make it through initial queries. Questions involved their opinions on campaign finance law and on the trial's potential witnesses, including a porn star and a tabloid publisher.\nEarlier, some prospective jurors who had previously indicated that they would be able to be impartial had changed their minds after taking a night to think about it. 'I don't think I can be as impartial and unbiased as I hoped I could be,' one admitted. He was excused.\nIt could take two weeks or more to pick the 12 jurors who will decide the case, which centers on allegations that the former president falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star, Stormy Daniels.\nThe pool of possible jurors being scrutinized on Tuesday came from an initial group of 96, dozens of whom were dismissed immediately on Monday after indicating that they felt they could not fairly reach a decision. The dismissals underscored the difficulty of picking a jury in a city where the defendant is widely reviled.\nMr. Trump, who may take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied all wrongdoing. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records that hid reimbursements to his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who had paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 to buy her silence. Prosecutors say that Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election.\nHere's what to know about the case:\nThe case was brought a year ago by Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. It is one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, but may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nA day after Mr. Trump appeared to nod off during pretrial motions, he was back at the defense table. He appeared somewhat bored as the jury selection process continued, with prospective jurors responding to a series of mostly yes or no questions.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America.\nMr. Trump has repeatedly complained that the case is a politically motivated witch hunt and has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and his family, as well as key witnesses, including Mr. Cohen. Justice Merchan has imposed a gag order on Mr. Trump that bars him from attacking witnesses, jurors, prosecutors or the judge's family. Even before the trial began on Monday, prosecutors asked Justice Merchan to hold the former president in contempt of court over social media posts about Mr. Cohen; the judge said he would hold a hearing later this month.\nApril 16, 2024, 2:00 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 2:00 p.m. ET Anusha Bayya\nAnusha Bayya Reporting from outside the courthouse A midday addition to the crowd here, albeit briefly: Mayor Eric Adams has come by, flanked by his security detail, and was soon peppered with questions by reporters.

Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, accused Donald J. Trump of falsifying business records connected to a hush money payment to a porn star. Mr. Trump pleaded not guilty to all 34 felony counts. Credit Credit... Andrew Seng for The New York Times All 34 felony counts at the center of the Manhattan criminal case against former President Donald J. Trump stem from a $130,000 hush-money payment handed over to a porn star in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign.\nThe specific charges are far less titillating: falsifying business records in the first degree. But a conviction could still result in jail time.\nThe payment was made by Mr. Trump's fixer, Michael D. Cohen, to Stormy Daniels in order to buy her silence about a sexual liaison she said she had with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump directed him to make the payment.\nPaying hush money is not illegal. But while serving as the commander in chief, prosecutors say, Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen in a manner that constituted fraud: In internal records, Mr. Trump's company classified the reimbursement as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet there were no such expenses, according to prosecutors, who say the agreement was also fictional.\nThose records underpin the 34 counts of falsifying business records: 11 involve the checks, 11 center on monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted to the company and 12 involve entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust. Mr. Trump has denied all wrongdoing.\nIn announcing the charges a year ago, Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, said that his office must keep a close eye on how companies conduct business in New York.\n'This is the business capital of the world,' Mr. Bragg said. 'We regularly do cases involving false business statements. The bedrock \u2014 in fact, the basis for business integrity and a well-functioning business marketplace \u2014 is true and accurate record-keeping.'\nThe charges against Mr. Trump are all Class E felonies, the lowest category in New York. Each count carries a maximum prison sentence of four years.\nNothing in the law requires the judge, Juan E. Merchan, to imprison Mr. Trump if the jury convicts him. The judge could instead sentence him to probation.\nBut Justice Merchan has made it clear that he takes white-collar crime seriously and could put Mr. Trump behind bars. It's possible, however, if Mr. Trump is convicted of more than one count, Justice Merchan would impose a concurrent sentence, under which Mr. Trump would serve all time simultaneously.\nKey Players in the Trump Criminal Trial \u203a Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET Olivia Bensimon\nOlivia Bensimon Reporting from outside the courthouse Journalists still vastly outnumber the Trump supporters who have gathered near the courthouse today.

Neighborhood workers on their lunch breaks bask in the spring sun.\nJury selection is often a lengthy process, but in the first criminal trial of a former American president, currently taking place in a Manhattan criminal courthouse, it's going more slowly than normal.\nIn part, that is because of the nature of the case: Jurors, once seated, will be asked to decide whether Donald J. Trump committed a crime. Prosecutors have charged him with 34 felonies, accusing him of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal that could have hurt his first presidential run.\nBut the process has been particularly drawn-out because, once would-be jurors say they can be fair and impartial, they are being asked a series of 42 questions.

Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Last month, Justice Juan M. Merchan ordered that prospective jurors' names would be shielded from the public, underscoring the need for privacy for those who may decide Donald J. Trump's criminal fate \u2014 and tempt the anger of his followers.\nYet on the first two days of jury selection, several prospective jurors revealed potentially identifying information, reflecting the difficulty of having an anonymous jury in a case with an intense media spotlight.\nOn the first day, a woman said she worked for a city agency of approximately 500 people and revealed its name. Later, a man who identified himself as a bookseller revealed the name of the small store where he works.\nThis continued on Tuesday when others revealed the names of employers. While some worked for companies that were large, where the potential jurors could likely remain unidentifiable, others were less cautious. One woman revealed the name of the three-person company she owns with her husband.\nJustice Merchan did not interject as the prospective jurors divulged the information, nor did he caution them against doing so.\nJuries are not completely anonymous in New York State. Mr. Trump, his lawyers and the prosecutors have access to the names of the prospective jurors. But after a request by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, Justice Merchan decided to withhold the names from the public. Mr. Trump did not oppose the request.\nThe accidental self-identifications are a notable departure from how federal Judge Lewis A. Kaplan conducted jury selection in Mr. Trump's defamation trial in January, brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll.\nIn the federal system, jurors are allowed to remain anonymous, even to parties in the case. Before potential jurors answered basic questions about their backgrounds, Judge Kaplan instructed them not to reveal personal information.\n'Don't give us anything that could enable anybody to pin you down geographically,' he said.\nHe also cautioned them not to reveal their names to each other, and when the trial concluded, he left them with these ominous words: 'My advice to you is that you never disclose that you were on this jury,' Judge Kaplan said. 'And I won't say anything more about it.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 16, 2024, 1:11 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 1:11 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich\nJonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse The prospective jurors have just been excused for lunch.

We are running 5 to 7 minutes per person.\nThe very premise of the trial is that prosecutors believe Donald J. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times Donald J. Trump first ran for president nearly a decade ago.\nNow, as he runs again in a political climate that he helped create, his Manhattan criminal trial is partly a referendum on his tactics during that first campaign.\nThe trial's very premise is that prosecutors believe Mr. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign \u2014 sex scandals involving a porn star and a Playboy model, for example \u2014 he concealed them, the prosecutors say.\nBut in a development that will bolster their case, prosecutors on Monday secured permission from the judge to admit evidence connected to Mr. Trump's overall political strategy in 2016. Much of it bears the former president's imprint: aggressive tweets, false denials, coordination with a tabloid publisher and more.\nThe judge's ruling showed how the weapons that worked so well for Mr. Trump then are being turned against him in the courtroom now.\nThe techniques prosecutors highlighted Monday were not invented by Mr. Trump for use in his campaign; they are behaviors he exhibited throughout his life as a businessman and a reality-television star. But in modern American political history, such raw tactics had rarely been seen at such a high level.\nOne example is Mr. Trump's relationship with The National Enquirer tabloid and its publisher, David Pecker, who is expected to appear as a witness.\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case, obtained permission from the judge on Monday to introduce evidence related to a 2015 meeting among Mr. Trump, Mr. Pecker and Mr. Trump's former fixer, Michael D. Cohen. A prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, said on Monday that the three men had 'conspired to influence the 2016 election.'\nThat meeting laid the groundwork for hush-money deals with a porn star, Stormy Daniels, and a Playboy model, Karen McDougal. But another result of that meeting, Mr. Steinglass said, were explosive headlines about Mr. Trump's opponents in the Republican primary, including those claiming that Ben Carson had committed 'medical malpractice' and that Senator Ted Cruz had a 'family connection to J.F.K.'s assassin.'\nA lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, protested the admission of evidence related to that meeting, saying that newspaper publishers met with candidates 'all the time,' and that there was nothing improper about it, let alone illegal.\nThat admission worked against him. The judge, Juan M. Merchan, said that he was glad that Mr. Blanche believed that there was nothing wrong with the meeting \u2014 because it meant that he should not mind that the evidence would be introduced.\n'There is no reason not to allow it in,' Justice Merchan said.\nMr. Steinglass won again when he persuaded Justice Merchan to admit evidence of the Trump campaign in crisis after the publication in 2016 of the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump boasted about grabbing women by their genitals.\n'The video sent the campaign into a tailspin,' Mr. Steinglass said.\nHe offered up an email sent by a Washington Post reporter to Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump's campaign spokeswoman. Mr. Steinglass said that Ms. Hicks had forwarded the exchange to Stephen K. Bannon, Kellyanne Conway and other members of the campaign team, 'suggesting that their response should be to deny, deny, deny.' Eventually, he said, Mr. Bannon sent it to Mr. Cohen.\nMr. Blanche again protested, but was again rebuffed. The judge said he would allow jurors to see the email, saying that the ensuing thread was relevant.\nThe exchanges that prosecutors and defense lawyers debated on Monday underscored Mr. Trump's penchant for delegating dirty work to others, giving himself some distance in the process.\nThe hush-money deals worked that way: Mr. Cohen paid off Ms. Daniels, while The National Enquirer bought Ms. McDougal's silence. (Mr. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to his reimbursement of Mr. Cohen.)\nThat habit is still on display this year, and can be helpful given that Justice Merchan has barred Mr. Trump from attacking witnesses, prosecutors and the judge's own family.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Trump posted on social media a video of Laura Loomer, a political ally, in the park outside the courthouse. Ms. Loomer, speaking into a bullhorn, insinuated that the judge's family was politically compromised.\nHad Mr. Trump said that himself, he would have risked violating the judge's gag order.\nApril 16, 2024, 10:51 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 10:51 a.m. ET Kate Christobek\nKate Christobek Reporting from the courthouse Jury selection has been a slow and slogging exercise but there are occasional moments of levity.

Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab New York City courtroom as Mr. Trump looked on.\nBefore jury selection began, the judge, Juan M. Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, rejected another effort to force his recusal by the defense, which cited several issues, including his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant.\nHe also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost.\nBut Mr. Trump's lawyers did persuade Justice Merchan that mentioning sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump was recorded bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial.\nEntering the courtroom Monday, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here,' but he looked less enthusiastic in front of Justice Merchan. He quietly slouched and scowled \u2014 and at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep.\nBy afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into the courtroom. Some quickly left: When the judge asked the first group of 96 if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused.\nThe remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT The jury selection process in Donald J.

Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate.\nThe potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair.\nThe process could take two weeks or more \u2014 and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court.\n'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.'\nThe stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County \u2014 Manhattan, as most people know it \u2014 which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020.\nMr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions.\nMr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated.\nProsecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28.\nUnlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.'\nSome may not be completely forthcoming.\n'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said.\nMr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors.\n'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Not since Eugene V. Debs campaigned from a prison cell more than a century ago has the United States experienced what might now happen: a prominent candidate with a felony conviction running for president. And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning.\nFormer President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases: two federal, one in New York and another in Georgia. The first of those to go to trial is the sex scandal cover-up in New York, where jury selection began on Monday.\nFor now, he faces no formal campaign restrictions, beyond having to be present in a courtroom, and he remains highly competitive in polls. But some of the cases are proceeding at a pace that could bring verdicts before the election \u2014 and the Constitution and American law have clear answers for only some of the questions that will arise if he is convicted.\nOthers would bring the country into truly uncharted territory, with huge decisions resting in the hands of federal judges.\nHere is what we know, and what we don't know.\nThis is the simplest question of the bunch. The answer is yes.\nThe Constitution sets very few eligibility requirements for presidents. They must be at least 35 years old, be 'natural born' citizens and have lived in the United States for at least 14 years.\nThere are no limitations based on character or criminal record. While some states prohibit felons from running for state and local office, these laws do not apply to federal offices.\nThe Republican and Democratic Parties have guaranteed spots on general-election ballots in every state, and the parties tell election officials whose name to put in their spot. States could, in theory, try to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on legally shaky ground.\n'We let states set the time, place and manner' of elections, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who specializes in election law, 'but I think the best reading of our Constitution is you don't let the state add new substantive requirements.'\nWhile that view is not universal among legal experts, it prevailed in court in 2019, after California passed a law requiring candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on primary ballots. A federal district judge blocked the law from taking effect, saying it was most likely unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court also unanimously blocked it as a violation of the state constitution, and the case never reached the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that states could not keep Mr. Trump off their ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies people who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' after taking an oath to support the Constitution.\nNumerous lawsuits had argued that Mr. Trump's actions before and on Jan. 6, 2021, met this bar. In December, the Colorado Supreme Court found him ineligible, and Maine's secretary of state did the same. But the Supreme Court \u2014 led by a conservative supermajority, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump himself \u2014 concluded that only Congress had the power to enforce Section 3 against candidates for federal office. (Four of the justices, including the three liberals, wanted to allow a wider range of options for disqualification.)\nCongress is not going to do that with Republicans in control of the House. And the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal cases, meaning convictions would not disqualify Mr. Trump either.\nCongress can designate either groups of people to whom Section 3 applies (such as people who fought for the Confederacy) or specific crimes that, upon conviction, would trigger disqualification, said Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University. But none of the crimes Mr. Trump is charged with carry that automatic penalty.\n'Whether or not Trump is tried, convicted, acquitted, that's a separate question from whether or not he's disqualified,' said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nOne of the charges in the federal case related to Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election \u2014 conspiracy to violate civil rights \u2014 once carried a disqualification penalty, Mr. Kreis said, but Congress removed it decades ago.\nNow that Mr. Trump has secured a majority of delegates to the Republican convention, the party has no mechanism to nominate somebody else. Under the party's official convention rules, if a delegate tries to support someone other than the person the primary results bound them to, 'such support shall not be recognized.'\nNor have top Republicans shown any interest in another nominee.\nIf he were forced to withdraw from the race after the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him.\nafter the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him. Probably not.\nMr. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, and he would be disenfranchised there if convicted of a felony.\nMost felons in Florida regain voting rights after completing their full sentence, including parole or probation, and paying all fines and fees. But it is highly unlikely that Mr. Trump, if convicted, would have time to complete his sentence before Election Day.\nHe could also petition for clemency, which would require the approval of the governor \u2014 Ron DeSantis, who ran against Mr. Trump in the Republican primary \u2014 and two Florida cabinet members. Chris Taylor, the director of external affairs for the Florida Commission on Offender Review, confirmed that a Florida resident convicted of a felony could apply to have their voting rights restored through that process even if their conviction happened outside Florida.\nSince Mr. Trump also has a residence in New York, he could switch his voter registration there to take advantage of its more permissive approach: Felons in New York can vote while on parole or probation. But, as in Florida and almost every other state, they are still disenfranchised while in prison.\nSo if Mr. Trump is imprisoned, he could be in the extraordinary position of being deemed fit to be voted for, but unfit to vote.\nNo one knows.\n'We're so far removed from anything that's ever happened,' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley. 'It's just guessing.'\nLegally, Mr. Trump would remain eligible to be president even if he were imprisoned. The Constitution says nothing to the contrary. 'I don't think that the framers ever thought we were going to be in this situation,' Professor Levinson said.\nIn practice, the election of an incarcerated president would create a legal crisis that would almost certainly need to be resolved by the courts.\nIn theory, Mr. Trump could be stripped of his authority under the 25th Amendment, which provides a process to transfer authority to the vice president if the president is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' But that would require the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare Mr. Trump unable to fulfill his duties, a remote prospect given that these would be loyalists appointed by Mr. Trump himself.\nMore likely, Mr. Trump could sue to be released on the basis that his imprisonment was preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional obligations as president. Such a case would probably focus on the separation of powers, with Mr. Trump's lawyers arguing that keeping a duly elected president in prison would be an infringement by the judicial branch on the operations of the executive branch.\nOn the federal charges only, he could also try to pardon himself \u2014 or to commute his sentence, leaving his conviction in place but ending his imprisonment. Either action would be an extraordinary assertion of presidential power, and the Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of whether a 'self pardon' was constitutional.\nOr President Biden, on his way out the door, could pardon Mr. Trump on the basis that 'the people have spoken and I need to pardon him so he can govern,' Professor Chemerinsky said.\nBut that wouldn't apply to the New York or Georgia cases, because the president does not have pardon power for state charges.\nAgain, no one knows, particularly when it comes to the New York and Georgia cases.\nIn the two federal cases, a likely outcome would be that a Trump-appointed attorney general would withdraw the charges.\nThe Justice Department does not indict sitting presidents, a policy outlined in a 1973 memo, during the Nixon era. It has never had reason to develop a policy on what to do with an incoming president who has already been indicted. But the rationale for not indicting sitting presidents \u2014 that it would interfere with their ability to perform their duties \u2014 applies just as well in this hypothetical scenario.\n'The reasons why we wouldn't want to indict a sitting president are the reasons we wouldn't want to prosecute a sitting president,' said Professor Chemerinsky, who has disagreed with the department's reasoning.

Trump's attempt to delay a group of civil lawsuits that are seeking to hold him accountable for inspiring the violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\nMr. Trump had sought to have the suits put on hold until after the completion of his federal criminal trial connected to many of the same events. But in a nine-page ruling, the judge, Amit P. Mehta, decided that the civil lawsuits could move forward without running the risk that Mr. Trump might damage his chances in the criminal case by revealing his defense strategy prematurely or making statements that prosecutors might use against him.\nLast month, when lawyers for Mr. Trump first asked Judge Mehta to postpone the civil cases, it was the latest example of the former president seeking to pit his multiple legal matters against one another in an effort to delay them.\nIn the past few days, Mr. Trump has also sought to push back an important filing deadline he is facing in his classified documents case in Florida by arguing that the lawyers who have to write the court papers in question need more time because they are busy representing him at yet another criminal trial \u2014 the one in Manhattan where he stands accused of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal on the eve of the 2016 election.\nWhile Judge Mehta's decision to let the civil suits move forward struck a blow against Mr. Trump's delay tactics, he and his lawyers have been remarkably successful overall at throwing sand into the gears of all four of the criminal cases he is facing. The Manhattan trial, which is now in jury selection, may turn out to be the only one of the four to go in front of a jury before this fall's election.\nThe Jan. 6 civil suits are an often forgotten aspect of the barrage of legal proceedings confronting Mr. Trump. In the months after the Capitol attack, a half-dozen of them were filed by members of Congress and police officers who were at the building that day, accusing Mr. Trump of inciting the mob that stormed the building.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump commuted the sentence of a man who had spent almost 30 years of a life sentence in federal prison for what prosecutors said was his role in the murder of an undercover police officer in upstate New York.\nThe commutation went largely unnoticed as the country grappled with the aftermath of a pro-Trump mob's attack on the Capitol, which included assaults on Capitol Police officers. Since then, Mr. Trump has referred to the rioters as 'patriots' and 'hostages,' and has criticized an officer who shot and killed a woman trying to breach a doorway near the House chamber.\nAnd yet Mr. Trump, who is the first former president to face criminal indictment, has sought to portray himself as a champion of law enforcement, surrounding himself at events with a tableau of police officers and law-enforcement officials as he campaigns to return to the White House.\nMr. Trump has been endorsed by three police unions. He recently stood next to the Nassau County Police commissioner at a microphone outside a funeral home where he paid a condolence call at the wake for a slain New York Police officer, Jonathan Diller. Days later, Mr. Trump promised at a rally that he would pass a law for a mandatory death penalty for people who kill police officers.\n'You'll see the whole situation come to a halt,' Mr. Trump said of police deaths.\nMr. Trump often poses for photos with local police officers who are helping to guard his motorcades at various stops, including last week when he took pictures with officers at a campaign stop in Upper Manhattan on the second day of his criminal trial. His aides regularly post photos and videos of the encounters on social media, a montage intended to underscore a law-and-order image of the presumptive Republican nominee \u2014 who was also arraigned four times last year.\nwhen he took pictures with officers at a campaign stop in Upper Manhattan on the second day of his criminal trial.

Trump leaned heavily on major Republican donors in March as his campaign and the Republican Party sought to close the financial gap separating him from President Biden, new federal filings showed on Monday.\nFor much of the race, Mr. Trump has relied on small donors \u2014 in particular, those giving less than $200 online \u2014 to sustain his campaign. Most big donors steered clear.\nBut in recent weeks, as Mr. Trump finished trouncing his primary opponents and Mr. Biden and the Democrats gathered fund-raising steam, these donors have opened their checkbooks to the former president.\nIn the last two weeks of March alone, one committee backing Mr. Trump raised nearly $18 million, nearly all from six-figure contributions. Mr. Trump and the Republican Party finished the month with $93 million on hand between all their committees, his campaign has said, having raised more than $65 million in March.\nStill, Republicans are lagging behind. In the first three months of the year, Mr. Biden and the Democratic Party together raised more than $187 million, his campaign has said, including $90 million in March, ending the month with $192 million on hand.\nMr. Trump's campaign has not provided a full account of its first-quarter fund-raising. The two committees that filed on Monday reported raising nearly $90 million combined since January, but that does not include money raised directly by the campaign or the Republican National Committee.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump posted in his civil fraud case. A deal on Monday will keep the terms of the bond largely unchanged.","summary":"The New York attorney general's office and representatives for Donald J. Trump agreed in court on Monday to slightly modify the terms of a $175 million bond posted by the former president in his civil fraud case after the state questioned the qualifications of the company that provided it and sought to have it rejected.\nThe deal will keep the bond largely unchanged, with the $175 million in cash that Mr. Trump deposited as collateral remaining in a money-market account, while adding new terms stipulating that the $175 million must remain as cash, and not be transferred into mutual funds, for example. The two sides also agreed to give the California firm that provided the bond, Knight Specialty Insurance Company, exclusive control over the money-market account.\nThe dispute over the bond was overshadowed on Monday by the start of Mr. Trump's criminal trial in another Lower Manhattan courthouse a few blocks away. And in the end, the argument was resolved without much drama, the latest development in a civil fraud case against Mr. Trump and his family business that resulted in a $454 million judgment imposed on the former president.\nThe attorney general, Letitia James, accused Mr. Trump in the civil case of fraudulently inflating his net worth. After a monthslong trial last year, the judge in the case, Arthur F. Engoron, agreed and imposed the massive penalty. But subsequently, an appeals court lowered the judgment to $175 million while it considered Mr. Trump's appeal of the ruling.\nKnight provided the bond \u2014 which is a legal document, not an actual transfer of money \u2014 this month, essentially promising New York's court system that it will cover $175 million of the judgment against Mr. Trump if he loses his appeal and fails to pay. In return, Mr. Trump paid a fee to Knight, and pledged a significant amount of cash as collateral.\nThe attorney general's office raised questions about the bond, noting that Knight, which is owned by a subprime loan billionaire, had never provided such a court bond in its history, and asked Justice Engoron to reject it and require Mr. Trump to secure a new one. But in a hearing on Monday, prosecutors from the office struck a different tone and offered tweaks to the existing bond terms that they said would satisfy their concerns.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Since a surge in its first days of trading as Trump Media, which lifted the value of the company to about $8 billion at one point last month, the company's shares have dropped by more than 50 percent.\nTrump Media was expected to register the potential sale of new shares after the completion of its merger last month with Digital World Acquisition Corp., a cash-rich shell company known as a SPAC. Companies that merge with SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, typically file a registration statement a few weeks after the deal is completed for the sale of additional securities held by early investors.\nIn the filing, Trump Media \u2014 the parent company of Truth Social \u2014 registered more than 146 million shares of stock that could be sold, along with 21 million shares that were converted after the exercise of warrants, which enable an investor to buy shares at a preset price. When a SPAC goes public, it issues warrants to investors that can later be converted into shares.\nEven though the company said the investors weren't planning to sell those shares immediately, investors reacted to the notion that if a flood of new shares were to hit the market, they could depress the company's stock price.\nAlso included in the filing were an additional 36 million shares given to Mr. Trump as part of an 'earnout' bonus based on the company's stock price. With those additional shares, Mr. Trump has about 115 million shares of Trump Media, or 65 percent of the company's stock.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump on Tuesday visited a bodega in Harlem where he made a pointed attack on the district attorney prosecuting him and portrayed himself as tough on crime, a central theme of his 2024 run.\nHis visit to the store \u2014 the site of a case that prompted political controversy for Manhattan's district attorney when an employee was charged after fatally stabbing a man after a confrontation \u2014 made for a striking juxtaposition.\nAfter spending much of the day in a Manhattan courtroom as a criminal defendant, Mr. Trump immediately traveled uptown both to criticize the district attorney, Alvin Bragg, for being too lenient on crime and to play up his 'law and order' message.\nMr. Trump has for months tried to draw a distinction between his frequently expressed tough-on-crime stance and the felony charges he faces in four separate cases. Outside the bodega, he again tried to dismiss his charges as political persecution, arguing that Mr. Bragg was too focused on Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign sex scandal cover-up trial and was ignoring crime in the city.\n'It's Alvin Bragg's fault,' Mr. Trump said. 'Alvin Bragg does nothing.'\nThough Mr. Trump is prevented by a gag order from attacking witnesses, prosecutors and jurors in his New York case, the order does not cover Mr. Bragg or the judge overseeing his trial.\nBefore he arrived at the bodega, his campaign attacked Mr. Bragg over his handling of the 2022 incident, in which Jose Alba, a clerk, was charged with second-degree murder after stabbing a man, Austin Simon, in an altercation.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump was evidently not happy with what he saw out the window of his chauffeured S.U.V. as he rode through Lower Manhattan on Monday morning for the beginning of opening arguments in his first criminal trial.\nThe scene that confronted him as he approached the dingy courthouse at 100 Centre Street was underwhelming. Across the street, at Collect Pond Park, the designated site for protesters during the trial, only a handful of Trump supporters had gathered, and the number would not grow much throughout the morning.\nMr. Trump has portrayed his legal jeopardy as a threat to America itself, and he has suggested that the country would not put up with it. But the streets around the courthouse on Monday were chaos-free \u2014 well-patrolled and relatively quiet. As his motorcade made its way to the courthouse, the few Trump supporters gathered in the park were outnumbered by Trump detractors, who waved signs about his alleged liaison with a porn star.\nMr. Trump had tried to gin up something noisier. Shortly after 7 a.m., he posted on his social media website that 'America Loving Protesters should be allowed to protest at the front steps of Courthouses' and he followed this lament with a call for his supporters to 'GO OUT AND PEACEFULLY PROTEST. RALLY BEHIND MAGA. SAVE OUR COUNTRY!'\nThe narrow criminal courthouse steps in Lower Manhattan are not routinely open for protest \u2014 and particularly not when a former president of the United States is inside, guarded by a phalanx of Secret Service agents who have worked with local officials on security measures.\nAsked to comment on Mr. Trump's frustrations about the lack of protest activity, a spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, tried to connect it to the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, and President Biden and insisted people were being prevented from being in Lower Manhattan because of the barricades.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Two hours before he was set to speak, the campaign sent a fund-raising blast with a message from Mr. Trump: 'They can't keep me off stage! Did they think I would run and hide?'\nNinety minutes later, the skies darkened to charcoal and lightning flashed. As thunderstorms swept toward the area and the National Weather Service issued watches and warnings concerning dangerous winds and hail, the rally was canceled over safety concerns.\n'We'll make up for this very quickly at another time,' Mr. Trump said on a call he made into the rally that was broadcast over the speakers. 'We'll do it as quick as possible. I'm devastated that this could happen.'\nBut the cancellation, which Mr. Trump indicated was out of his hands, highlights the challenges that he may face as he tries to balance his presidential campaign with a criminal trial that will keep him busy through May.\nFor much of the last week, Mr. Trump's public comments had been limited to social media posts and remarks to reporters outside the courtroom.

'Don't give them a noble reason to indict you, because they will.'\nLess than two years later, that admonition proved prescient. Federal prosecutors charged Mr. Trump last June with violating the Espionage Act, accusing him of illegally holding onto more than 30 highly classified documents and obstructing the government's repeated efforts to retrieve them.\nA summary of the associate's interview with federal agents was among nearly 400 pages of investigative records that were unsealed on Monday by the judge overseeing Mr. Trump's classified documents case. The associate's identity was redacted from the summary.\nThe records had initially been attached as sealed exhibits to a motion Mr. Trump's lawyers had filed in January asking for additional discovery evidence from the government.

Trump was never mentioned during the Supreme Court's hearing on Tuesday about a federal obstruction statute used against hundreds of his supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, the former president loomed large over the proceeding.\nThat is because Mr. Trump has been charged under the law in question in an indictment he is facing in Washington that accuses him of plotting to overturn the 2020 election. And the court's eventual decision on the obstruction law could affect how his case moves forward.\nIt remains unclear at this point how the court will rule, but at the hearing the justices signaled that federal prosecutors may have interpreted the law too broadly and used it unfairly against many of the rioters who were on the ground on Jan. 6. But even if the court tosses out the use of the law against the Trump supporters who broke into the Capitol, it does not mean that the course of Mr. Trump's own case will be greatly altered.\nLawyers representing hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants have been questioning the use of the obstruction statute since long before Mr. Trump was charged with it in August. The lawyers have claimed, among other things, that one of the law's central provisions, requiring the government to offer some proof that documents were destroyed or tampered with, has nothing to do with breaking into the Capitol.\nIf the Supreme Court ends up agreeing with them, Mr. Trump's own lawyers will surely seek to have the two obstruction counts he is facing stricken from his indictment.\nOne of those counts accuses him of conspiring with six others who are unnamed \u2014 widely thought to be a group of lawyers close to him \u2014 to disrupt the certification of the election that took place inside the Capitol during a joint session of Congress on Jan. 6. The second count accuses him of actually obstructing that proceeding.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump.\nThe ad features JoJo Burgess, who is a steelworker and the mayor of Washington, Pa., a small town southwest of Pittsburgh. Mr. Biden is scheduled to speak on Wednesday at the headquarters of the United Steelworkers union in Pittsburgh, where he is expected to call on his trade representative to increase some tariffs on steel and aluminum products from China.\n'Donald Trump has shown through his history that workers mean nothing to him,' Mr. Burgess says in the ad, a minute-long spot. 'Right now, we have the most pro-American worker president in office that we've ever had in our history.'\nThe Biden campaign said it was spending in the 'mid-six figures' to push the message across television and digital platforms in Pennsylvania, separate from a $30 million ad campaign across the major battleground states. It hopes the ad will complement news media coverage of Mr. Biden's three-day Pennsylvania visit, which is set to conclude on Thursday in Philadelphia. Winning the state, where he narrowly defeated Mr. Trump in 2020, is crucial to his re-election strategy.\nThe new ad amplifies the argument that Mr. Biden is pursuing against Mr. Trump on the economy, accusing the former president of siding with billionaires over workers. In a speech laying out his tax policy on Tuesday in Scranton, his hometown, Mr. Biden laid into Mr. Trump.\n'He learned the best way to get rich is to inherit it,' Mr. Biden said of his rival.\nMr. Burgess, a Democrat, was a guest of Mr. Biden's at the president's State of the Union address in 2022. He became the first Black mayor of Washington, Pa., last year. The Biden campaign said the ad featuring Mr. Burgess would run during news programs, as well as on regional sports networks.\nThe campaign also released a shorter ad with Mr. Burgess for digital platforms. In that ad, Mr. Burgess defends Mr. Biden against attacks from Mr. Trump and other Republicans on his age and mental fitness.\n'When you meet him, this guy is as sharp as a knife,' Mr. Burgess says of the president.

Trump, and, for now, the people have the stronger hand: They have insider witnesses, a favorable jury pool and a lurid set of facts about a presidential candidate, a payoff and a porn star.\nOn Monday, the prosecutors will formally introduce the case to 12 all-important jurors, embarking on the first prosecution of an American president. The trial, which could brand Mr. Trump a felon as he mounts another White House run, will reverberate throughout the nation and test the durability of the justice system that Mr. Trump attacks as no other defendant could.\nThough the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, has assembled a mountain of evidence, a conviction is hardly assured. Over the next six weeks, Mr. Trump's lawyers will seize on three apparent weak points: a key witness's credibility, a president's culpability and the case's legal complexity.\nProsecutors will seek to maneuver around those vulnerabilities, dazzling the jury with a tale that mixes politics and sex, as they confront a shrewd defendant with a decades-long track record of skirting legal consequences. They will also seek to bolster the credibility of that key witness, Michael D. Cohen, a former fixer to Mr. Trump who previously pleaded guilty to federal crimes for paying the porn star, Stormy Daniels.\nDespite its tawdry particulars, District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg has cast the case as one of election interference. Credit... Pool photo by Mary Altaffer Daniel J.

Trump went to trial Monday, with hundreds of citizens summoned to potentially join a jury that will decide the fate of the first American president to face prosecution.\nBut the ritual of choosing the jury got off to a slow start as more than half of the first group of 96 potential jurors raised their hands to say they could not be fair to Mr. Trump, demonstrating the challenges of picking an impartial panel in a city where the defendant is widely loathed. The judge immediately excused them.\nOne prospective juror, a woman in her 30s, was heard outside the courtroom saying, 'I just couldn't do it.'\nThe prospective jurors, who represented a cross-section of Manhattanites of various ages and demographics, filed past Mr. Trump and into the rows of a dingy courtroom. Some strained their necks for a glance at the former president. He stood and turned after the judge introduced him as the defendant, flashing them a tight-lipped smile.\nThe judge, Juan M. Merchan, welcomed the prospective jurors to his courtroom, and began to describe the case, which was brought by the Manhattan district attorney's office and accused Mr. Trump of falsifying records to cover up a sex scandal. He is facing 34 felony counts, and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison.\nThe trial was born from a long-running investigation that began when Mr. Trump was still president. He was a target of Manhattan prosecutors in fits and starts over five years, spanning the terms of two district attorneys and multiple grand juries.

Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal during his 2016 campaign. If convicted, he could face up to four years in prison.\nAfter the judge overseeing the case rejected Trump's latest effort to oust him, the prosecution and the defense began collaborating on the arduous process of choosing a jury. Immediately, they ran into problems.\nMore than half of the first pool of 96 prospective jurors was dismissed after they indicated they did not believe they could be impartial, and court adjourned for the day with zero jurors chosen. My colleague Alan Feuer noted that such a high initial failure rate is 'surpassingly rare,' underscoring the challenges of seating an impartial jury for a defendant whom much of the country has already made its mind up about. Here's an explanation of the jurors both sides want.\nThe trial \u2014 perhaps the only one against Trump that will unfold before Election Day \u2014 is projected to take about six weeks, the judge told the prospective jurors. But it could stretch out longer if jury selection turns out to be especially time consuming. The process will be crucial for both sides, but could be especially challenging for the defense, who will effectively be searching for red needles in Manhattan's giant blue haystack.\n'The defense will be looking for working class voters, people that work in city jobs, perhaps firefighters, police, sanitation workers,' my colleague Jesse McKinley, who is writing our Trump on Trial newsletter, said.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Merchan warned against identifying people who might judge a former president who attacks the justice system regularly.","summary":"Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan took a startling turn on Thursday when two jurors were abruptly excused, demonstrating the challenge of picking citizens to determine the fate of a former president who has promoted attacks on the integrity of the jury and the justice system alike.\nOne juror told the judge overseeing the case \u2014 the first criminal trial of a former American president \u2014 that she had developed concerns about her identity being revealed. That fear, she added, might compromise her fairness and 'decision-making in the courtroom,' prompting the judge to excuse her.\nThe precise reason the judge dismissed the other juror was not immediately clear, but prosecutors had raised concerns about the credibility of answers he gave to questions about himself. Asked outside the courthouse whether he believed he should have been dismissed, the man, who declined to give his name, replied: 'Nope.'\nThe dismissals, the latest twist in a trial sure to be full of them, underscored the unprecedented trial of Mr. Trump, who is on charges that he falsified records to cover up a sex scandal. Jurors are risking their safety and their privacy to sit in judgment of a former commander in chief who is now their fellow citizen, a heavy responsibility that could unnerve even the most seen-it-all New Yorkers.\nInside a chilly courtroom on Thursday, as lawyers on both sides scrutinized a new round of prospective jurors, Mr. Trump stared intently at the jury box and appeared to press his lawyers to voice objections. But when Mr. Trump poked one of the lawyers, Todd Blanche, Mr. Blanche shook his head at his client.\nAlready this week, the judge has scolded Mr. Trump's comments about jurors, admonishing him to not intimidate anyone in the courtroom.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump.\nIn Scranton, his hometown, Mr. Biden is expected to talk about the tax code in the frame of economic fairness, arguing that Mr. Trump's tax cuts benefited billionaires while his own agenda has helped working- and middle-class families.\nThe president 'will outline how Trump's tax plan is a handout to the rich and leaves the middle class holding the bag,' Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign's communications director, said during a call with reporters. 'The address will drive home a simple question: Do you think the tax code should work for rich people and for corporations or for the middle class?'\nAll of that is standard election-year fare. But the backdrop to Mr. Biden's campaign swing could not be more unusual. In an unprecedented trial, Mr. Trump is spending most of this week, and much of the coming month or two, in a Manhattan courtroom facing criminal charges. Democrats hope that the contrast of Mr. Biden campaigning and carrying out the duties of a president while Mr. Trump's lawyers plead his innocence will highlight the choice voters face in November.\nAnd Mr. Biden must also contend with the fallout from Iran's weekend attack on Israel, which raised new fears of a wider regional war in the Middle East.\nOn Tuesday, the day after Tax Day, Mr. Biden is likely to promote his plans for changes to the tax code, including expanding the child tax credit, instituting a tax credit for first-time home buyers and making permanent tax credits for those who buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Mr. Trump denies having been involved with Ms. Daniels, and has declared his innocence, calling the charges against him a 'witch hunt' conjured by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a Democrat.\nHere are five takeaways from Mr. Trump's second day on trial:\nThe trial is expected to last about six weeks, according to Juan M. Merchan, who is overseeing it, and court officials had warned that the selection of 12 jurors and several alternates might take two weeks.\nBut Justice Merchan, an experienced jurist known for his no-nonsense style, has kept things moving fast.

Trump and his 'America First' movement.\nBut more Republicans voted against the aid than for it, showing just how much Mr. Trump's broad isolationism \u2014 and his movement's antipathy to Ukraine \u2014 has divided the G.O.P. in an election year.\nMr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the third time, had actually soft-pedaled his opposition to Ukraine aid in recent days as the dam began to break on the House Republican blockade. He stood by Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, who assembled the complicated aid packages for Ukraine, Israel and America's Asian allies, and against threatened efforts to bring down Mr. Johnson's speakership and plunge the House back into chaos. And he stayed quiet on Saturday, declining to pressure Republicans to vote no.\nBut few issues have been more central to the former president's creed than his foreign policy isolationism, his call for Europe to raise military spending in its own backyard, and his foreign policy shift toward Vladimir V. Putin's Russia.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson after the House passed the foreign aid bills for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Credit...

Trump are vanishingly rare these days, but I think I can propose one: Trump isn't exactly known for his powers of attention. During his four years as president, it was nearly impossible for him to focus on any policy question for very long \u2014 something that even his most committed supporters would be hard-pressed to deny.\nBut amid all the mind-wandering, flip-flopping and havoc-wreaking, there happened to be one node of unwavering consistency: a fixation on borders and immigration that was remarkably tenacious. Build walls, ban Muslims, separate families \u2014 Trump has suggested he would do all that again and more if he wins in November. His language is also becoming ever more violent. He now vilifies migrants as 'animals' who are 'poisoning the blood of our country.'\nThis escalation dovetails with Trump's demonstrated predilections. He has always been drawn to the soft spots in the democratic system, to those areas that would allow him to wield the kind of absolute power he insists he is entitled to, and immigration policy is perhaps the softest target of all.\nUnlike American citizens, who are protected by constitutional rights (and have legal recourse if those rights are violated), immigrants are exceptionally vulnerable to government power. Even the right to due process is inconsistently applied to them, and sometimes denied altogether. Migrants have been locked up without explanation. They have been locked up for being 'likely to become a public charge.' They have been locked up and never accused of committing any crime at all.\nAs Ana Raquel Minian explains in a new book, 'In the Shadow of Liberty: The History of Immigration Detention in the United States,' the American government has a long record of detaining migrants in places that are, legally speaking, black sites. 'Every day in the heart of the self-described \u2018greatest democracy on earth,'' Minian writes, 'people are incarcerated without charges for indefinite periods of time, under horrific conditions and without basic constitutional protections.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Several more alternate jurors still need to be chosen, but the judge overseeing the case indicated that opening statements could begin on Monday.\nThe dozen New Yorkers who were sworn in today by Justice Juan Merchan will, at the end of a six-week trial, be asked to render a verdict that could help shape the remainder of the 2024 campaign. Trump is facing 34 felony charges and up to four years in prison, in what might be his only criminal trial before Election Day.\nThose stakes caused some drama today. Two jurors were excused from the case: Prosecutors had raised questions about the credibility of answers given by one; the other said she had developed concerns about her identity becoming public, which she feared would compromise her fairness.\nThe dismissals appeared to rankle the judge, Juan Merchan, who wants to keep the proceedings on schedule. He instructed reporters to no longer divulge prospective jurors' employers, a decision that some media law experts questioned. He also said he would consider next week whether Trump had repeatedly violated his gag order, as prosecutors said.\nMissiles on display during the annual celebration in Tehran, yesterday. Credit...

The defense says it's all a nothing-burger: an overblown attempt to pursue felony charges for actions that, if anything, are minor record-keeping errors.\nAs the prosecution described it, the case that faces a man who made his Hollywood name with the artificial drama of 'The Apprentice' needs no contrivance. In a 45-minute opening statement, the prosecutor Matthew Colangelo wove a complex tale of Donald Trump \u2014 reeling from the unsavory revelations of the 'Access Hollywood' tape \u2014 desperately wanting to bat back another simmering scandal in the weeks before the 2016 presidential election.\nThat accusation was of a sexual encounter in 2006 with Stormy Daniels, a porn star. Colangelo said Trump, his campaign rattled by the 'Access Hollywood' tape, on which the former president bragged about grabbing women's genitals, agreed to pay Daniels $130,000 'to silence her and to make sure the public did not learn of the sexual encounter.'\nColangelo added that 'this was not spin or communication strategy,' but part of a larger effort to dupe the American voters.\n'This was a planned, coordinated, long-running conspiracy to influence the 2016 election to get Donald Trump elected through illegal expenditures,' he said, adding: 'It was election fraud.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Republicans in the State Legislature are considering plans to undermine it.","summary":"Facing mounting pressure to strike down a near-total abortion ban revived last week by Arizona's Supreme Court, Republican state legislators are considering efforts to undermine a planned ballot measure this fall that would enshrine abortion rights in the Arizona Constitution, according to a presentation obtained by The New York Times.\nThe 1864 law that is set to take effect in the coming weeks bans nearly all abortions and mandates prison sentences of two to five years for providing abortion care. The proposed ballot measure on abortion rights, known as the Arizona Abortion Access Act, would enshrine the right to an abortion before viability, or about 24 weeks. Supporters of the measure say they have already gathered enough signatures to put the question on the ballot ahead of a July 3 filing deadline.\nRepublicans in the Legislature are under tremendous pressure to overturn, or at least amend, the 1864 ban. Former President Donald J. Trump, the national standard-bearer of the Republican Party, directly intervened on Friday, calling on Republican legislators, in a frantically worded post online, to 'act immediately' to change the law. A top Trump ally in Arizona who is running for the Senate, Kari Lake, has also called for the overturning of the 1864 law, which she had once praised.\nAbortion rights have been a winning message for Democrats since the Supreme Court, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump, overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. And even though it is an objectively unpopular aspect of his White House legacy, Mr. Trump has repeatedly bragged that he is personally responsible for overturning Roe.\nRepublicans in Arizona, however, have already resisted efforts to repeal the 160-year-old law and are bracing for the potential for another floor battle on the ban that is looming for the Legislature, which is set to convene on Wednesday. The plans that circulated among Republican legislators suggest the caucus is considering other measures that would turn attention away from the 1864 law.\nThe presentation to Republican state legislators, written by Linley Wilson, the general counsel for the Republican majority in the Arizona State Legislature, proposed several ways in which the Republican-controlled Legislature could undermine the ballot measure, known as A.A.A., by placing competing constitutional amendments on the ballot that would limit the right to abortion even if the proposed ballot measure succeeded.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump in the case accusing him of plotting to subvert the 2020 election and could disrupt the prosecutions of hundreds of rioters involved in the Capitol attack.\nThe question the justices will consider is whether a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, enacted in the wake of the collapse of the energy giant Enron, covers the conduct of a former police officer, Joseph W. Fischer, who participated in the Capitol assault, on Jan. 6, 2021.\nThe law figures in two of the federal charges against Mr. Trump in his election subversion case, and more than 350 people who stormed the Capitol have been prosecuted under it. If the Supreme Court sides with Mr. Fischer and says the statute does not cover what he is accused of having done, Mr. Trump is almost certain to contend that it does not apply to his conduct, either.\nThe law, signed in 2002, was prompted by accounting fraud and the destruction of documents, but the provision is written in broad terms. Still, in an earlier case involving a different provision of the law, the Supreme Court said it should be tethered to its original purpose.\nAt least part of what the law meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code: It was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself. The law sought to close that gap.\nIt did that in a two-part provision. The first part makes it a crime to corruptly alter, destroy or conceal evidence to frustrate official proceedings. The second part, at issue in Mr. Fischer's case, makes it a crime 'otherwise' to corruptly obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

President Biden and the Democrats, with whom Mr. Lammy has cultivated a deep network of contacts, are fighting to hold off a resurgent Donald J. Trump.\nHaving been chosen by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, partly because of his trans-Atlantic credentials, Mr. Lammy, 51, is scrambling to build ties with Republicans and, more challengingly, with those around Mr. Trump. It's a very different American establishment from the Democratic one he knows so well.\nWould Mr. Lammy pay a visit to Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's Palm Beach estate, as David Cameron, Britain's current foreign secretary, did two weeks ago to lobby the former president on military aid to Ukraine?\n'Of course,' he said in an interview this week in Portcullis House, the parliamentary office building across the street from Big Ben.

Many media outlets \u2014 including The New York Times \u2014 have used 'hush-money trial' as a shorthand for the proceedings. It's a nod to the fact that Trump is accused of directing a payoff, and then falsifying business records, to cover up a potential sex scandal involving a porn star.\nAlvin Bragg, the district attorney in Manhattan, has argued that the case is about something much bigger: that the payment, made to Stormy Daniels, was part of an effort to hide information from voters ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n'It's an election interference case,' he said in an interview on NY1 in January.\nTrump, who has always understood the power of catchy shorthand, is trying to label the case the 'Biden trial,' falsely claiming that the charges have been orchestrated by the president to influence the 2024 election.\nDisagreement over the most basic facts is a fixture of American politics, particularly when Trump is involved. He has described the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, as a beautiful day. He wrongly says the 2020 election was stolen. So it is not surprising that he has tried to reframe his trial as interference in the 2024 election \u2014 even as he tries to wield it to his benefit by using it to grab attention in New York and solicit funds across the country.\nCrucially, the judge, Juan Merchan, seems to echo Bragg's framing of the case \u2014 and it is his interpretation that could matter most.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump's criminal fate \u2014 and tempt the anger of his followers.\nYet on the first two days of jury selection, several prospective jurors revealed potentially identifying information, reflecting the difficulty of having an anonymous jury in a case with an intense media spotlight.\nOn the first day, a woman said she worked for a city agency of approximately 500 people and revealed its name. Later, a man who identified himself as a bookseller revealed the name of the small store where he works.\nThis continued on Tuesday when others revealed the names of employers. While some worked for companies that were large, where the potential jurors could likely remain unidentifiable, others were less cautious.

Mr. Trump, his lawyers and the prosecutors have access to the names of the prospective jurors. But after a request by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, Justice Merchan decided to withhold the names from the public. Mr. Trump did not oppose the request.\nThe accidental self-identifications are a notable departure from how federal Judge Lewis A. Kaplan conducted jury selection in Mr. Trump's defamation trial in January, brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll.\nIn the federal system, jurors are allowed to remain anonymous, even to parties in the case. Before potential jurors answered basic questions about their backgrounds, Judge Kaplan instructed them not to reveal personal information.\n'Don't give us anything that could enable anybody to pin you down geographically,' he said.\nHe also cautioned them not to reveal their names to each other, and when the trial concluded, he left them with these ominous words: 'My advice to you is that you never disclose that you were on this jury,' Judge Kaplan said.

Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan were excused on Thursday, demonstrating the challenges of picking a jury to decide the fate of someone as polarizing as Mr. Trump.\nA woman selected for the jury told the judge overseeing the case \u2014 the first criminal trial of a former president \u2014 that she had developed concerns about her identity being revealed. That, she said, might compromise her fairness and 'decision-making in the courtroom.'\nThe other juror, a man from the Lower East Side, was excused after prosecutors raised concerns about his credibility. Although the precise reason for his dismissal was not yet clear, the prosecutors said they had obtained information that called into question the truth of the juror's answers to questions about himself. The man was also late to court on Thursday.\nThe dismissals, the latest unexpected episode in a trial that is sure to be full of them, rankled the judge, who said he thought the woman would have 'been a very good juror.'\nAlthough the judge, Juan M. Merchan, has kept prospective jurors' names private, they have disclosed their employers and other identifying information in court. Now, however, Justice Merchan has instructed reporters to no longer divulge where a prospective juror works.\nIt was unclear how much of a hindrance the two ousters would be for the case, which centers on accusations that Mr. Trump falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal. Justice Merchan had previously signaled that the jury could be set this week and that opening arguments might begin Monday, which is still feasible.\nThe dismissals brought the number of seated jurors down to five. Lawyers on both sides of the case will now seek to replace them \u2014 and find several more through the rest of the week. The final panel will include 12 jurors and as many as six alternates who will step in if a main juror gets sick or is excused for other reasons.\nThe woman excused from the jury said she had been concerned about public reports about her. She is an oncology nurse and her employer had been widely reported. Her friends, colleagues and family told her she had been identified as a potential juror, an alarming development that she said prompted her to reconsider whether she could serve.\nThe male juror, when approached by a reporter outside the courthouse, declined to give his name and said he didn't want to answer questions. He nodded, however, when asked if he thought he could be unbiased and shook his head when asked if he felt at all intimidated in the courtroom.\nAsked if he thought he should have been dismissed, he gave a one word answer as he walked hurriedly with his umbrella pulled low: 'Nope.'\nNate Schweber contributed reporting.","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ben Protess,Jonah E.

He was previously a director at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and spent 24 years as a reporter and editor for The Washington Post.\nVoice of America, which was founded in 1942, aims to offer unbiased news to audiences around the world. Mr. Abramowitz said he is drawn to the outlet's global reach and its mission to counter propaganda and disinformation coming from authoritarian countries like China, Russia and Iran.\n'These countries are waging ferocious information warfare aimed at undermining democracies, aimed at undermining the United States, and we need to fight back,' Mr. Abramowitz said in an interview. 'I think that the V.O.A. is one very important tool for the United States government in this information war.'\nHe added that 'attacks on journalism and the attacks on journalists have really been a harbinger of democratic decline around the world, so the opportunity to push back on that is deeply meaningful and attractive to me.'\nMr. Abramowitz is expected to start the role this summer. He succeeds John Lippman, the acting director since October 2023. Voice of America has not had a permanent director since 2021.\n'Michael is an esteemed journalist and a champion for human rights, and much of his work at Freedom House has informed our own efforts to counter disinformation and authoritarianism around the world,' Amanda Bennett, the chief executive of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, said in a statement.\nVoice of America says it reaches more than 326 million people each week with news in 48 languages via digital, TV and radio outlets. It has a firewall designed to protect its editorial independence from U.S. governmental interference.\nThe organization came under attack from former President Donald J. Trump during his term. In 2020, Mr. Trump appointed Michael Pack, an ally of his aide Stephen K. Bannon, to run the U.S. Agency for Global Media. Mr. Pack was accused of trying to turn Voice of America into a mouthpiece for the Trump administration, and a federal judge ruled that Mr. Pack had violated the First Amendment rights of the outlet's journalists. A federal investigation later found that Mr. Pack had grossly mismanaged the U.S. Agency for Global Media, repeatedly abusing his power by sidelining executives he felt did not sufficiently support Mr. Trump.\nMr. Abramowitz said he was confident that there was support for Voice of America's mission 'across partisan lines.'\n'The idea that we need to push back against authoritarian propaganda, these are values that are shared by people across the political spectrum,' he said.","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"business","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Katie Robertson","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/19/multimedia/19voa-bwfp/19voa-bwfp-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":6.6731086,"_id":"a4129522aed548405150f38827c58fc3"},{"title":"Nevada G.O.P.

Trump, is unloading a $3.3 million advertising campaign with a MAGA message, according to his campaign, hoping to cut into Mr. Brown's dominant lead over the crowded field.\nA television ad from Mr. Gunter that began airing on Wednesday called Mr. Brown 'the newest creature to emerge from the swamp,' tying him to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, and deriding his primary opponent as 'Scam Brown.'\nMr. Brown, a veteran who was wounded severely in Afghanistan in 2008, consolidated party support after entering the primary last July, earned the endorsement of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and has appeared at fund-raisers around the country with prominent Republicans. He has lapped his competitors in fund-raising, pulling in $2.4 million in the most recent quarter, according to fund-raising reports.\nMr. Brown has sought to employ the Trump campaign handbook, skipping debates and focusing his attention on Senator Jacky Rosen, the Democratic incumbent, rather than on his Republican rivals.\nThat changed on Thursday, when Mr. Brown appeared to address Mr. Gunter for the first time, at a private fund-raising event in Sparks, Nev., after Mr. Gunter accused him in ads and appearances of being disingenuous and not sufficiently pro-Trump.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump in the case accusing him of plotting to subvert the 2020 election and could disrupt the prosecutions of hundreds of rioters involved in the Capitol attack. The question the justices will consider is whether a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, enacted in the wake of the collapse of the energy giant Enron, covers the conduct of a former police officer, Joseph W. Fischer, who participated in the Capitol assault, on Jan. 6, 2021. The law figures in two of the federal charges against Mr. Trump in his election subversion case and more than 350 people who stormed the Capitol have been prosecuted under it. If the Supreme Court sides with Mr. Fischer and says the statute does not cover what he is accused of having done, Mr. Trump is almost certain to contend that it does not apply to his conduct, either. The law, signed in 2002, was prompted by accounting fraud and the destruction of documents, but the provision is written in broad terms. At least part of what the law meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code: It was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself. The law sought to close that gap. It did that in a two-part provision. The first part makes it a crime to corruptly alter, destroy or conceal evidence to frustrate official proceedings. The second part, at issue in Mr. Fischer's case, makes it a crime 'otherwise' to corruptly obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding. Here's what else to know: The heart of the case is at the pivot from the first part of the provision to the second. The ordinary meaning of 'otherwise,' prosecutors say, is 'in a different manner.' That means, they say, that the obstruction of official proceedings need not involve the destruction of evidence. The second part, they say, is broad catchall applying to all sorts of conduct. Mr. Fischer's lawyers counter that the first part of the provision must inform and limit the second one \u2014 to obstruction linked to the destruction of evidence. They would read 'otherwise,' in other words, as 'similarly.' The case is one of several affecting or involving Mr. Trump on the court's docket. In a separate case to be argued next week, the justices will consider Mr. Trump's claim that he is totally immune from prosecution.\nMr. Fischer is accused of entering the Capitol around 3:24 p.m. on Jan. 6, 2021, with the counting of electoral ballots having been suspended after the initial assault. Before his trip to Washington, prosecutors said he told a superior in a text message, that 'it might get violent.' In another, he wrote that 'they should storm the capital and drag all the democrates into the street and have a mob trial.' Prosecutors say that videos showed Mr. Fischer yelling 'Charge!' before pushing through the crowd, using a vulgar term to berate police officers and crashing into a line of them.\nMr. Fischer's lawyers dispute some of this. But the question for the justices is legal, not factual: Does the 2002 law cover what Mr. Fischer is accused of? That may turn in part on the meaning of another term in the law \u2014 its requirement that the defendant acted 'corruptly.' The meaning of that word is disputed. Two of the four criminal counts former President Donald J. Trump is facing in that case are based on the obstruction law. Credit... Michelle Gustafson for The New York Times While the Supreme Court's hearing is intended to determine the scope and validity of an obstruction law used against hundreds of rioters who broke into the Capitol on Jan. 6, any decision could also have an impact on a separate criminal case: one in which former President Donald J. Trump has been accused of plotting to overturn the 2020 election. Two of the four criminal counts Mr. Trump is facing in that case are based on the obstruction law. In an indictment filed in Washington last summer, he was charged with conspiring to obstruct the certification of the election on Jan. 6 during a joint session of Congress at the Capitol as well as with actually obstructing it. If the justices determine that prosecutors improperly used the obstruction law against members of the pro-Trump mob who disrupted the session, Mr. Trump's lawyers will surely seek to have the charges against him dismissed as well. In fact, they already tried that in October. They argued unsuccessfully to the trial judge in the case that Mr. Trump's indictment unfairly used the statute, which was initially 'directed at the destruction of records in accounting fraud,' by applying it 'to disputing the outcome of a presidential election.' 'This stretches the statutory language beyond any plausible mooring to its text,' the lawyers wrote. Jack Smith, the special counsel handling Mr. Trump's case, has told the Supreme Court that the two obstruction counts against the former president would be still valid even if the justices narrowed the law to cover only crimes that involved tampering with documents or records. Mr. Trump triggered that provision of the law, Mr. Smith has said, by plotting to create fake slates of electors that claimed he won in several keys swing states that he actually lost to President Biden. Mr. Smith has accused Mr. Trump of trying to use those fake slates to throw the certification proceeding into chaos and by urging his vice president, Mike Pence, to capitalize on the confusion by single-handedly declaring him the winner of the race. Even if the obstruction count were ultimately removed from Trump's indictment, it would probably not be a fatal blow. The indictment contains two other conspiracy counts that overlap almost entirely with the accusations in the obstruction counts. One of the conspiracy charges accuses Mr. Trump of committing fraud by using deceit to subvert the normal course of the election. The other charges him with plotting to deprive millions of Americans of the right to have votes properly counted.  April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET A little backstory on why prosecutors opted to charge so many defendants with obstruction: Michael Sherwin, the U.S. attorney in Washington who initially led the Jan. 6 prosecution, promised 'shock and awe' in charging as many people as possible. But using overtly political crimes like insurrection or seditious conspiracy turned out not to be legally feasible. The government settled on using the obstruction count to describe how the election's certification proceeding was disrupted by defendants who went beyond mere trespass or assault. April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET Prosecutors tried to set general rules for who was charged with the obstruction count. It was often used if a defendant actually entered the Senate chamber or made their way into congressional offices. It was also used if there was evidence that a defendant's behavior had some sort of role in chasing lawmakers away from their sworn duties to certify the election on Jan. 6. April 16, 2024, 9:54 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:54 a.m. ET Of course, one of the biggest attractions of this obstruction count to prosecutors is that it carries a hefty 20-year maximum sentence. No defendant has been sentenced to that maximum yet, but the stiff penalty likely has some sort of deterrent effect on others. April 16, 2024, 9:48 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:48 a.m. ET The argument is likely to be focused on the text and purpose of the obstruction law at issue in the case. Expect close examination, for instance, of the meaning of the word 'otherwise.' More than 1,380 people had been charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol as of early this month, according to the Justice Department. Credit... Hailey Sadler for The New York Times The investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack is already the largest criminal inquiry in Justice Department history, federal prosecutors have said. And even after more than three years, it has shown little sign of slowing down. Every week, a few more rioters are arrested and charges against them are unsealed in Federal District Court in Washington. Prosecutors have suggested that a total of 2,000 or 2,500 people could ultimately face indictment for their roles in the attack. More than 1,380 people had been charged in connection with the attack as of early this month, according to the Justice Department. Among the most common charges brought against them are two misdemeanors: illegal parading inside the Capitol and entering and remaining in a restricted federal area, a type of trespassing. About 350 rioters have been accused of violating the obstruction statute that the Supreme Court is considering at its hearing, and nearly 500 people have been charged with assaulting police officers. Many rioters have been charged with multiple crimes, the most serious of which so far has been seditious conspiracy. Almost 800 defendants have already pleaded guilty; about 250 of them have done so to felony charges. Prosecutors have won the vast majority of the cases that have gone to trial: More than 150 defendants have been convicted at trial and only two have been fully acquitted. More than 850 people have been sentenced so far, and about 520 have received at least some time in prison. The stiffest penalties have been handed down to the former leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, far-right extremist groups that played central roles in the Capitol attack. Enrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys leader, was sentenced to 22 years in prison, and Stewart Rhodes, who once led the Oath Keepers, was given an 18-year term.  April 16, 2024, 9:36 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:36 a.m. ET All along the defense lawyers have claimed that federal prosecutors stretched the statute in an unprecedented way to fit the central crime that took place at the Capitol on Jan. 6: the disruption of the certification of the election. Then again, nothing like the storming of the Capitol had ever happened before. So perhaps it's no surprise that prosecutors use the obstruction law in a novel manner. April 16, 2024, 9:31 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:31 a.m. ET It's worth remembering as today's hearing is poised to get underway that lawyers defending Jan. 6 rioters have been questioning the government's use of this particular obstruction law from the very outset of criminal cases being filed by the Justice Department. It's taken three years, but now the issue has finally reached the Supreme Court. April 16, 2024, 9:26 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:26 a.m. ET The argument will not start promptly at 10:00 a.m. The court has said it will issue one or more decisions first. They will be announced from the bench but will not be broadcast. A mob walked to the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times The man whose case led to the Supreme Court hearing on a controversial federal obstruction law is a former police officer from rural Pennsylvania indicted on charges of storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and crashing into a line of his fellow officers defending the building. Joseph W. Fischer was working for the police department in North Cornwall Township, Pa., when prosecutors say he pushed his way into the Capitol while holding up his cellphone to take videos of the surge. Once inside, he and another rioter 'galloped forward,' prosecutors say, making contact with a line of officers who were fighting off the crowd. Mr. Fischer fell to the ground and, as some nearby officers helped him to his feet, he tried to engage with them, prosecutors say. 'I'm a cop too,' he said, 'sometimes the country is worth more than your job.' According to court papers, Mr. Fischer was concerned about his own job before making the trip to Washington. Investigators unearthed text messages he wrote to the chief of his department, saying that things could get 'violent' on Jan. 6 and that the crowd should 'storm the capital and drag all the democrates.' He also warned the chief that he might need him to post his bail, the papers said. Township officials suspended Mr. Fischer without pay on the day of his arrest in February 2021 and later fired him. But he has pushed back against the government's description of behavior on Jan. 6. His lawyers say that he and a companion were prepared to leave Washington that day after listening President Trump's speech near the White House and turned around to head toward the Capitol only after hearing about the mounting protest there. The lawyers also claim that Mr. Fischer arrived at the Capitol grounds well after Congress had recessed the proceeding to certify the results of the 2020 election because of the attack. 'As Mr. Fischer walked toward the east side of the building, no barricades or fences impeded him,' the lawyers wrote in their brief to the Supreme Court. Mr. Fischer has disputed the assertion by prosecutors that he charged the police line inside the Capitol, telling the court instead that he was pushed into the officers by 'the weight of the crowd.' He also characterized his interactions with the officers differently than prosecutors did, claiming that he merely talked with one of the officers and patted him on the shoulder.  The Supreme Court has said that the purpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was 'to safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets following the collapse of Enron.' Credit...The provision at issue in the case is part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a 2002 law enacted after the collapse of Enron, a giant energy company, after the exposure of widespread accounting fraud and the destruction of documents by its outside auditor, Arthur Andersen. The Supreme Court has said that the purpose of the law was 'to safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets following the collapse of Enron.' At least part of what the law meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code: it was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was meant to close that gap. Lawyers for Joseph W. Fischer, charged under the law with obstructing an official proceeding by joining the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, said his case had an Alice-in-Wonderland quality. 'The Through the Looking Glass moment here,' they wrote in a Supreme Court brief, 'would be for those who wrote the Sarbanes-Oxley Act upon learning that they had created a new and breathtaking obstruction offense by endeavoring to close the narrow Enron-Arthur Anderson loophole.' Indeed, in a different case on the scope of the statute, one of the sponsors of the law, Michael Oxley, filed a supporting brief saying prosecutors had interpreted it too broadly. The law meant to address 'specific loopholes' that Arthur Andersen 'had exploited when they shredded business documents and destroyed hard drives in anticipation of federal law-enforcement action,' wrote Mr. Oxley, a former Ohio representative who died in 2016. In that case, concerning a separate provision of the law, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the law's origins informed its meaning and spared the defendant. 'The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, all agree, was prompted by the exposure of Enron's massive accounting fraud and revelations that the company's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen, had systematically destroyed potentially incriminating documents,' she wrote for four of the justices in the majority. She added that the government had acknowledged that the provision 'was intended to prohibit, in particular, corporate document-shredding to hide evidence of financial wrongdoing.'

Erin Schaff/The New York Times The Supreme Court's decision to consider the soundness of an obstruction law that has been widely used against those who took part in the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, is already having an effect on some of the rioters. A small group of people convicted under the law have been released from custody \u2014 or will soon go free \u2014 even though the justices hearing arguments on Tuesday are not expected to decide the case for months. Over the past several weeks, federal judges in Washington have agreed to release about 10 defendants who were serving prison terms because of the obstruction law, saying the defendants could wait at home as the court determined whether the law should have been used at all to keep them locked up. Among those already free is Matthew Bledsoe, the owner of a moving company from Tennessee who scaled a wall outside the Capitol and then paraded through the building with a Trump flag, ultimately planting it in the arm of a statue of President Gerald R. Ford. Soon to be released are defendants like Kevin Seefried, a drywall installer from Delaware who carried a Confederate flag through the Capitol, and Alexander Sheppard, an Ohio man who overran police lines to become one of the first people to break into the building. The interrupted sentences \u2014 which could be reinstated depending on how the Supreme Court rules \u2014 are just one of the complications to have emerged from the court's review of the obstruction statute, known in the penal code as 18 U.S.C. 1512. The charge has been used so far against more than 350 rioters, including Jacob Chansley, the so-called QAnon Shaman, and members of the far-right extremist groups the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. When the justices announced in December that they planned to scrutinize the law, many legal experts expressed concern that a ruling narrowing its scope or striking down its use in Jan. 6-related cases could deliver a devastating blow to the Justice Department's efforts to hold hundreds of rioters accountable. Federal prosecutors have often used the obstruction count in lieu of more politically fraught charges like seditious conspiracy to punish the central event of Jan. 6: the disruption of a proceeding at the Capitol to certify the election. But in the past few months, judges and prosecutors working on Capitol riot cases have quietly adjusted to the potential threat from a Supreme Court ruling, and the risk that there could be catastrophic consequences to the cases overall no longer seems as grave. For one thing, there are currently no defendants facing only the obstruction charge, according to the Justice Department. Every rioter indicted on that count has also been charged with other crimes, meaning that even if the obstruction law is removed as a tool of the Jan. 6 prosecutions, there would not be any cases that would disappear entirely. Indeed, if the court rules that the obstruction count does not apply to the Capitol attack, the main effect of the decision would be on the sentences defendants face. The obstruction law carries a hefty maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and while few, if any, rioters have gotten that much, the statute has routinely resulted in terms of several years. But some judges have already signaled they would increase the sentences stemming from other charges if the obstruction count was not available to them. In February, for example, Judge Royce C. Lamberth denied an early release to an Iowa man named Leo Kelly, who was sentenced to 30 months in prison on the obstruction count and six other misdemeanors. Judge Lamberth's reason for not setting Mr. Kelly free? Even if the Supreme Court ruled he was not permitted to sentence Mr. Kelly for obstruction, Judge Lamberth said he could increase the defendant's total time in prison by imposing consecutive, not concurrent, terms on the misdemeanor charges.  \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments on Tuesday in a case that could eliminate some of the federal charges against former President Donald J.

It was also used if there was evidence that a defendant's behavior had some sort of role in chasing lawmakers away from their sworn duties to certify the election on Jan. 6.\nApril 16, 2024, 9:54 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:54 a.m. ET Of course, one of the biggest attractions of this obstruction count to prosecutors is that it carries a hefty 20-year maximum sentence.

And even after more than three years, it has shown little sign of slowing down.\nEvery week, a few more rioters are arrested and charges against them are unsealed in Federal District Court in Washington. Prosecutors have suggested that a total of 2,000 or 2,500 people could ultimately face indictment for their roles in the attack.\nMore than 1,380 people had been charged in connection with the attack as of early this month, according to the Justice Department. Among the most common charges brought against them are two misdemeanors: illegal parading inside the Capitol and entering and remaining in a restricted federal area, a type of trespassing.\nAbout 350 rioters have been accused of violating the obstruction statute that the Supreme Court is considering at its hearing, and nearly 500 people have been charged with assaulting police officers. Many rioters have been charged with multiple crimes, the most serious of which so far has been seditious conspiracy.\nAlmost 800 defendants have already pleaded guilty; about 250 of them have done so to felony charges. Prosecutors have won the vast majority of the cases that have gone to trial: More than 150 defendants have been convicted at trial and only two have been fully acquitted.\nMore than 850 people have been sentenced so far, and about 520 have received at least some time in prison. The stiffest penalties have been handed down to the former leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, far-right extremist groups that played central roles in the Capitol attack.\nEnrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys leader, was sentenced to 22 years in prison, and Stewart Rhodes, who once led the Oath Keepers, was given an 18-year term.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 16, 2024, 9:36 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:36 a.m. ET All along the defense lawyers have claimed that federal prosecutors stretched the statute in an unprecedented way to fit the central crime that took place at the Capitol on Jan. 6: the disruption of the certification of the election. Then again, nothing like the storming of the Capitol had ever happened before. So perhaps it's no surprise that prosecutors use the obstruction law in a novel manner.\nApril 16, 2024, 9:31 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:31 a.m. ET It's worth remembering as today's hearing is poised to get underway that lawyers defending Jan. 6 rioters have been questioning the government's use of this particular obstruction law from the very outset of criminal cases being filed by the Justice Department.

Jason Andrew for The New York Times The man whose case led to the Supreme Court hearing on a controversial federal obstruction law is a former police officer from rural Pennsylvania indicted on charges of storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and crashing into a line of his fellow officers defending the building.\nJoseph W. Fischer was working for the police department in North Cornwall Township, Pa., when prosecutors say he pushed his way into the Capitol while holding up his cellphone to take videos of the surge. Once inside, he and another rioter 'galloped forward,' prosecutors say, making contact with a line of officers who were fighting off the crowd.\nMr. Fischer fell to the ground and, as some nearby officers helped him to his feet, he tried to engage with them, prosecutors say.\n'I'm a cop too,' he said, 'sometimes the country is worth more than your job.'\nAccording to court papers, Mr. Fischer was concerned about his own job before making the trip to Washington. Investigators unearthed text messages he wrote to the chief of his department, saying that things could get 'violent' on Jan. 6 and that the crowd should 'storm the capital and drag all the democrates.'\nHe also warned the chief that he might need him to post his bail, the papers said.\nTownship officials suspended Mr. Fischer without pay on the day of his arrest in February 2021 and later fired him. But he has pushed back against the government's description of behavior on Jan. 6.\nHis lawyers say that he and a companion were prepared to leave Washington that day after listening President Trump's speech near the White House and turned around to head toward the Capitol only after hearing about the mounting protest there. The lawyers also claim that Mr. Fischer arrived at the Capitol grounds well after Congress had recessed the proceeding to certify the results of the 2020 election because of the attack.\n'As Mr. Fischer walked toward the east side of the building, no barricades or fences impeded him,' the lawyers wrote in their brief to the Supreme Court.\nMr. Fischer has disputed the assertion by prosecutors that he charged the police line inside the Capitol, telling the court instead that he was pushed into the officers by 'the weight of the crowd.'\nHe also characterized his interactions with the officers differently than prosecutors did, claiming that he merely talked with one of the officers and patted him on the shoulder.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT The Supreme Court has said that the purpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was 'to safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets following the collapse of Enron.' Credit...The provision at issue in the case is part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a 2002 law enacted after the collapse of Enron, a giant energy company, after the exposure of widespread accounting fraud and the destruction of documents by its outside auditor, Arthur Andersen.\nThe Supreme Court has said that the purpose of the law was 'to safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets following the collapse of Enron.'\nAt least part of what the law meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code: it was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was meant to close that gap.\nLawyers for Joseph W. Fischer, charged under the law with obstructing an official proceeding by joining the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, said his case had an Alice-in-Wonderland quality.\n'The Through the Looking Glass moment here,' they wrote in a Supreme Court brief, 'would be for those who wrote the Sarbanes-Oxley Act upon learning that they had created a new and breathtaking obstruction offense by endeavoring to close the narrow Enron-Arthur Anderson loophole.'\nIndeed, in a different case on the scope of the statute, one of the sponsors of the law, Michael Oxley, filed a supporting brief saying prosecutors had interpreted it too broadly. The law meant to address 'specific loopholes' that Arthur Andersen 'had exploited when they shredded business documents and destroyed hard drives in anticipation of federal law-enforcement action,' wrote Mr. Oxley, a former Ohio representative who died in 2016.\nIn that case, concerning a separate provision of the law, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the law's origins informed its meaning and spared the defendant.\n'The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, all agree, was prompted by the exposure of Enron's massive accounting fraud and revelations that the company's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen, had systematically destroyed potentially incriminating documents,' she wrote for four of the justices in the majority. She added that the government had acknowledged that the provision 'was intended to prohibit, in particular, corporate document-shredding to hide evidence of financial wrongdoing.'\nA correction was made on : An earlier version of this article misstated the year of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.

Erin Schaff/The New York Times The Supreme Court's decision to consider the soundness of an obstruction law that has been widely used against those who took part in the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, is already having an effect on some of the rioters.\nA small group of people convicted under the law have been released from custody \u2014 or will soon go free \u2014 even though the justices hearing arguments on Tuesday are not expected to decide the case for months.\nOver the past several weeks, federal judges in Washington have agreed to release about 10 defendants who were serving prison terms because of the obstruction law, saying the defendants could wait at home as the court determined whether the law should have been used at all to keep them locked up.\nAmong those already free is Matthew Bledsoe, the owner of a moving company from Tennessee who scaled a wall outside the Capitol and then paraded through the building with a Trump flag, ultimately planting it in the arm of a statue of President Gerald R. Ford.\nSoon to be released are defendants like Kevin Seefried, a drywall installer from Delaware who carried a Confederate flag through the Capitol, and Alexander Sheppard, an Ohio man who overran police lines to become one of the first people to break into the building.\nThe interrupted sentences \u2014 which could be reinstated depending on how the Supreme Court rules \u2014 are just one of the complications to have emerged from the court's review of the obstruction statute, known in the penal code as 18 U.S.C. 1512. The charge has been used so far against more than 350 rioters, including Jacob Chansley, the so-called QAnon Shaman, and members of the far-right extremist groups the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers.\nWhen the justices announced in December that they planned to scrutinize the law, many legal experts expressed concern that a ruling narrowing its scope or striking down its use in Jan. 6-related cases could deliver a devastating blow to the Justice Department's efforts to hold hundreds of rioters accountable.\nFederal prosecutors have often used the obstruction count in lieu of more politically fraught charges like seditious conspiracy to punish the central event of Jan. 6: the disruption of a proceeding at the Capitol to certify the election.\nBut in the past few months, judges and prosecutors working on Capitol riot cases have quietly adjusted to the potential threat from a Supreme Court ruling, and the risk that there could be catastrophic consequences to the cases overall no longer seems as grave.\nFor one thing, there are currently no defendants facing only the obstruction charge, according to the Justice Department. Every rioter indicted on that count has also been charged with other crimes, meaning that even if the obstruction law is removed as a tool of the Jan. 6 prosecutions, there would not be any cases that would disappear entirely.\nIndeed, if the court rules that the obstruction count does not apply to the Capitol attack, the main effect of the decision would be on the sentences defendants face. The obstruction law carries a hefty maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and while few, if any, rioters have gotten that much, the statute has routinely resulted in terms of several years.\nBut some judges have already signaled they would increase the sentences stemming from other charges if the obstruction count was not available to them.\nIn February, for example, Judge Royce C. Lamberth denied an early release to an Iowa man named Leo Kelly, who was sentenced to 30 months in prison on the obstruction count and six other misdemeanors.\nJudge Lamberth's reason for not setting Mr. Kelly free?\nEven if the Supreme Court ruled he was not permitted to sentence Mr. Kelly for obstruction, Judge Lamberth said he could increase the defendant's total time in prison by imposing consecutive, not concurrent, terms on the misdemeanor charges.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Alan Feuer","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/16/multimedia/16scotus-obstruction-fischer-btwg/16scotus-obstruction-fischer-btwg-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":6.4631643,"_id":"8d8bb2e14e4c5c163e8695d238871935"},{"title":"Israel Weighs Response to Iran, and U.S. Speaker Tries to Pass Ukraine Aid","author":"Tracy Mumford","published_date":"2024-04-17 10:00:08","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/podcasts/israel-weighs-response-to-iran-and-us-speaker-tries-to-pass-ukraine-aid.html","clean_url":"nytimes.com","excerpt":"Plus, the French Olympic team reveals its outfits.","summary":"On Today's Episode:\nOn Today's Episode: Israel Weighs Response to Iran Attack, With Each Choice a Risk , by Ronen Bergman, Isabel Kershner, Julian E.

Trump in the case accusing him of plotting to subvert the 2020 election and could disrupt the prosecutions of hundreds of rioters involved in the Capitol attack. The question for the justices is whether a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, enacted in the wake of the collapse of the energy giant Enron, covers the conduct of a former police officer, Joseph W. Fischer, who participated in the Capitol assault, on Jan. 6, 2021. The law figures in two of the federal charges against Mr. Trump in his election subversion case and more than 350 people who stormed the Capitol have been prosecuted under it. If the Supreme Court sides with Mr. Fischer and says the statute does not cover what he is accused of having done, Mr. Trump is almost certain to contend that it does not apply to his conduct, either. The law, signed in 2002, was prompted by accounting fraud and the destruction of documents, but the provision is written in broad terms. At least part of what the law meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code: It was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself. The law sought to close that gap. It did that in a two-part provision. The first part makes it a crime to corruptly alter, destroy or conceal evidence to frustrate official proceedings. The second part, at issue in Mr. Fischer's case, makes it a crime 'otherwise' to corruptly obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding. Here's what else to know: The dense semantics being argued circle an important question: whether this statute \u2014 devised to curb things like destroying documents \u2014 requires specific proof that records were actually tampered with. It also raises another critical question: whether document tampering has anything to do with pro-Trump rioters breaking into the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The heart of the case is at the pivot from the first part of the provision to the second. The ordinary meaning of 'otherwise,' prosecutors say, is 'in a different manner.' That means, they say, that the obstruction of official proceedings need not involve the destruction of evidence. The second part, they say, is broad catchall applying to all sorts of conduct. Mr. Fischer's lawyers counter that the first part of the provision must inform and limit the second one \u2014 to obstruction linked to the destruction of evidence. They would read 'otherwise,' in other words, as 'similarly.' The case is one of several affecting or involving Mr. Trump on the court's docket. In a separate case to be argued next week, the justices will consider Mr. Trump's claim that he is totally immune from prosecution.\nMr. Fischer is accused of entering the Capitol around 3:24 p.m. on Jan. 6, 2021, with the counting of electoral ballots having been suspended after the initial assault. Before his trip to Washington, prosecutors said he told a superior in a text message, that 'it might get violent.' In another, he wrote that 'they should storm the capital and drag all the democrates into the street and have a mob trial.' Prosecutors say that videos showed Mr. Fischer yelling 'Charge!' before pushing through the crowd, using a vulgar term to berate police officers and crashing into a line of them.\nMr. Fischer's lawyers dispute some of this. But the question for the justices is legal, not factual: Does the 2002 law cover what Mr. Fischer is accused of? That may turn in part on the meaning of another term in the law \u2014 its requirement that the defendant acted 'corruptly.' The meaning of that word is disputed. Alan Feuer contributed reporting.

The Supreme Court in Washington. Credit... Kent Nishimura for The New York Times The provision at issue in the case, from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has two parts. The question for the justices is how they interact. And that depends on the word that links them: 'otherwise.' The first part of the provision focuses on evidence, saying that anyone who corruptly 'alters, destroys, mutilates or conceals a record, document or other object' to affect an official proceeding is guilty of a felony. So far, so good. It is uncontroversial to reinforce that destroying documents to impede an investigation has been a core purpose of the law, which was prompted by the shredding of documents in an accounting scandal. The second part of the provision makes it a crime 'otherwise' to corruptly obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding. Prosecutors say the defendant in the case, Joseph W. Fischer, did that by joining the mob that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The heart of the case is how the first part of the provision pivots to the second part. The ordinary meaning of 'otherwise,' prosecutors say, is 'in a different manner.' That means, they say, that the obstruction of official proceedings need not involve the destruction of evidence. The second part, they say, is a broad catchall for any kind of corrupt interference with an official proceeding. Lawyers for Mr. Fischer, the defendant in Tuesday's case, counter that the first part must inform and limit the second one \u2014 meaning that the obstruction of official proceedings must be linked to the destruction of evidence. They would read 'otherwise' as 'similarly.' The alternative, they say, would be to create a crime of breathtaking scope that would allow prosecutors to charge political protesters and others with felonies carrying 20-year prison sentences. In 2008, in Begay v. United States, the court considered a law with a broadly similar structure, the Armed Career Criminal Act, which requires mandatory sentences for people convicted of possessing firearms if they have earlier been found guilty of three violent felonies. In one clause, it listed specific crimes that qualified as violent felonies \u2014 including burglary, arson and extortion. Then, as in the new case, there followed an 'otherwise' clause, this one adding any crime that 'otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.' The Supreme Court ruled that the examples informed and limited the sweep of the 'otherwise' clause. If Congress had 'meant the statute to be all-encompassing, it is hard to see why it would have needed to include the examples at all,' Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote for the majority. A drunken driving offense, the court ruled, did not qualify as one of the covered crimes even though the plain words of the clause would seem to encompass it. Mr. Fisher's lawyers say that the 'otherwise' clause in the obstruction statute must also be anchored in the preceding clause. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit disagreed, with Judge Florence Y. Pan writing that the two uses of 'otherwise' were different. The gun law, she wrote, 'includes a list of examples followed by \u2018otherwise' in a single, unbroken sentence.' By contrast, she wrote, the 'otherwise' in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 'sits within a separately numbered subparagraph, after a semicolon and line break, all of which put distance between it and the lists of verbs and objects' in the previous part. In dissent, Judge Gregory G. Katsas wrote that 'the relationship created by the word otherwise does not depend on punctuation or line breaks.' Rather, he wrote, 'it flows from the connotation of similarity,' among other factors. That meant, he concluded, that the second part of the provision applies 'only to acts that affect the integrity or availability of evidence.'

Kenny Holston/The New York Times At its core, the case is about the meaning of a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. It was enacted following the collapse of Enron, a giant energy company, after the exposure of widespread accounting fraud and the destruction of documents by the company's outside auditor. There is an uneasy fit between the immediate purpose of the law and its recent use in more than 300 prosecutions arising from the violent riot that forced a halt to the constitutionally required congressional count of presidential electors' ballots. At least part of what it meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code at the time: It was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself. The law meant to close that gap. It did, in a two-part provision, Section 1512(c) of the federal criminal code: (c) Whoever corruptly \u2014 (1) alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object , or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding or (2) otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding , or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. The first part focuses on evidence, making it a felony to tamper with it to affect an official proceeding. The second part makes it a crime 'otherwise' to corruptly obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding. The heart of this case is the pivot from the first part to the second part. The ordinary meaning of 'otherwise,' prosecutors say, is 'in a different manner.' That means, they say, that the obstruction of official proceedings need not involve the destruction of evidence \u2014 in their view, making the second part a broad catchall for any kind of corrupt interference with an official proceeding. The lawyers for Joseph W. Fischer, who was accused of breaching the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and of assaulting police officers, counter that the first part must inform and limit the second one \u2014 meaning that the obstruction of official proceedings must be linked to the destruction of evidence. They would read 'otherwise' as 'similarly.' The alternative, they say, would be to create a felony of breathtaking scope that would allow prosecutors to charge political protesters with felonies carrying 20-year prison sentences.

Michelle Gustafson for The New York Times While the Supreme Court's hearing is intended to determine the scope and validity of an obstruction law used against hundreds of rioters who broke into the Capitol on Jan. 6, any decision could also have an impact on a separate criminal case: one in which former President Donald J. Trump has been accused of plotting to overturn the 2020 election. Two of the four criminal counts Mr. Trump is facing in that case are based on the obstruction law. In an indictment filed in Washington last summer, he was charged with conspiring to obstruct the certification of the election on Jan. 6 during a joint session of Congress at the Capitol as well as with actually obstructing it. If the justices determine that prosecutors improperly used the obstruction law against members of the pro-Trump mob who disrupted the session, Mr. Trump's lawyers will surely seek to have the charges against him dismissed as well. In fact, they already tried that in October. They argued unsuccessfully to the trial judge in the case that Mr. Trump's indictment unfairly used the statute, which was initially 'directed at the destruction of records in accounting fraud,' by applying it 'to disputing the outcome of a presidential election.' 'This stretches the statutory language beyond any plausible mooring to its text,' the lawyers wrote. Jack Smith, the special counsel handling Mr. Trump's case, has told the Supreme Court that the two obstruction counts against the former president would be still valid even if the justices narrowed the law to cover only crimes that involved tampering with documents or records. Mr. Trump triggered that provision of the law, Mr. Smith has said, by plotting to create fake slates of electors that claimed he won in several keys swing states that he actually lost to President Biden. Mr. Smith has accused Mr. Trump of trying to use those fake slates to throw the certification proceeding into chaos and by urging his vice president, Mike Pence, to capitalize on the confusion by single-handedly declaring him the winner of the race. Even if the obstruction count were ultimately removed from Trump's indictment, it would probably not be a fatal blow. The indictment contains two other conspiracy counts that overlap almost entirely with the accusations in the obstruction counts. One of the conspiracy charges accuses Mr. Trump of committing fraud by using deceit to subvert the normal course of the election. The other charges him with plotting to deprive millions of Americans of the right to have votes properly counted.

But using overtly political crimes like insurrection or seditious conspiracy turned out not to be legally feasible. The government settled on using the obstruction count to describe how the election's certification proceeding was disrupted by defendants who went beyond mere trespass or assault. April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET Prosecutors tried to set general rules for who was charged with the obstruction count. It was often used if a defendant actually entered the Senate chamber or made their way into congressional offices. It was also used if there was evidence that a defendant's behavior had some sort of role in chasing lawmakers away from their sworn duties to certify the election on Jan. 6. April 16, 2024, 9:54 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:54 a.m. ET Of course, one of the biggest attractions of this obstruction count to prosecutors is that it carries a hefty 20-year maximum sentence.

April 16, 2024, 9:48 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:48 a.m. ET The argument is likely to be focused on the text and purpose of the obstruction law at issue in the case.

Hailey Sadler for The New York Times The investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack is already the largest criminal inquiry in Justice Department history, federal prosecutors have said. And even after more than three years, it has shown little sign of slowing down. Every week, a few more rioters are arrested and charges against them are unsealed in Federal District Court in Washington. Prosecutors have suggested that a total of 2,000 or 2,500 people could ultimately face indictment for their roles in the attack. More than 1,380 people had been charged in connection with the attack as of early this month, according to the Justice Department. Among the most common charges brought against them are two misdemeanors: illegal parading inside the Capitol and entering and remaining in a restricted federal area, a type of trespassing. About 350 rioters have been accused of violating the obstruction statute that the Supreme Court is considering at its hearing, and nearly 500 people have been charged with assaulting police officers. Many rioters have been charged with multiple crimes, the most serious of which so far has been seditious conspiracy. Almost 800 defendants have already pleaded guilty; about 250 of them have done so to felony charges. Prosecutors have won the vast majority of the cases that have gone to trial: More than 150 defendants have been convicted at trial and only two have been fully acquitted. More than 850 people have been sentenced so far, and about 520 have received at least some time in prison. The stiffest penalties have been handed down to the former leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, far-right extremist groups that played central roles in the Capitol attack. Enrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys leader, was sentenced to 22 years in prison, and Stewart Rhodes, who once led the Oath Keepers, was given an 18-year term.  April 16, 2024, 9:36 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:36 a.m. ET All along the defense lawyers have claimed that federal prosecutors stretched the statute in an unprecedented way to fit the central crime that took place at the Capitol on Jan. 6: the disruption of the certification of the election. Then again, nothing like the storming of the Capitol had ever happened before. So perhaps it's no surprise that prosecutors use the obstruction law in a novel manner. April 16, 2024, 9:31 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:31 a.m. ET It's worth remembering as today's hearing is poised to get underway that lawyers defending Jan. 6 rioters have been questioning the government's use of this particular obstruction law from the very outset of criminal cases being filed by the Justice Department. It's taken three years, but now the issue has finally reached the Supreme Court. April 16, 2024, 9:26 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:26 a.m. ET The argument will not start promptly at 10:00 a.m. The court has said it will issue one or more decisions first. They will be announced from the bench but will not be broadcast. A mob walked to the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times The man whose case led to the Supreme Court hearing on a controversial federal obstruction law is a former police officer from rural Pennsylvania indicted on charges of storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and crashing into a line of his fellow officers defending the building. Joseph W. Fischer was working for the police department in North Cornwall Township, Pa., when prosecutors say he pushed his way into the Capitol while holding up his cellphone to take videos of the surge. Once inside, he and another rioter 'galloped forward,' prosecutors say, making contact with a line of officers who were fighting off the crowd. Mr. Fischer fell to the ground and, as some nearby officers helped him to his feet, he tried to engage with them, prosecutors say. 'I'm a cop too,' he said, 'sometimes the country is worth more than your job.' According to court papers, Mr. Fischer was concerned about his own job before making the trip to Washington. Investigators unearthed text messages he wrote to the chief of his department, saying that things could get 'violent' on Jan. 6 and that the crowd should 'storm the capital and drag all the democrates.' He also warned the chief that he might need him to post his bail, the papers said. Township officials suspended Mr. Fischer without pay on the day of his arrest in February 2021 and later fired him. But he has pushed back against the government's description of behavior on Jan. 6. His lawyers say that he and a companion were prepared to leave Washington that day after listening President Trump's speech near the White House and turned around to head toward the Capitol only after hearing about the mounting protest there. The lawyers also claim that Mr. Fischer arrived at the Capitol grounds well after Congress had recessed the proceeding to certify the results of the 2020 election because of the attack. 'As Mr. Fischer walked toward the east side of the building, no barricades or fences impeded him,' the lawyers wrote in their brief to the Supreme Court. Mr. Fischer has disputed the assertion by prosecutors that he charged the police line inside the Capitol, telling the court instead that he was pushed into the officers by 'the weight of the crowd.' He also characterized his interactions with the officers differently than prosecutors did, claiming that he merely talked with one of the officers and patted him on the shoulder.  The Supreme Court has said that the purpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was 'to safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets following the collapse of Enron.' Credit...The provision at issue in the case is part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a 2002 law enacted after the collapse of Enron, a giant energy company, after the exposure of widespread accounting fraud and the destruction of documents by its outside auditor, Arthur Andersen. The Supreme Court has said that the purpose of the law was 'to safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets following the collapse of Enron.' At least part of what the law meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code: it was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was meant to close that gap. Lawyers for Joseph W. Fischer, charged under the law with obstructing an official proceeding by joining the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, said his case had an Alice-in-Wonderland quality. 'The Through the Looking Glass moment here,' they wrote in a Supreme Court brief, 'would be for those who wrote the Sarbanes-Oxley Act upon learning that they had created a new and breathtaking obstruction offense by endeavoring to close the narrow Enron-Arthur Anderson loophole.' Indeed, in a different case on the scope of the statute, one of the sponsors of the law, Michael Oxley, filed a supporting brief saying prosecutors had interpreted it too broadly. The law meant to address 'specific loopholes' that Arthur Andersen 'had exploited when they shredded business documents and destroyed hard drives in anticipation of federal law-enforcement action,' wrote Mr. Oxley, a former Ohio representative who died in 2016. In that case, concerning a separate provision of the law, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the law's origins informed its meaning and spared the defendant. 'The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, all agree, was prompted by the exposure of Enron's massive accounting fraud and revelations that the company's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen, had systematically destroyed potentially incriminating documents,' she wrote for four of the justices in the majority. She added that the government had acknowledged that the provision 'was intended to prohibit, in particular, corporate document-shredding to hide evidence of financial wrongdoing.'

Erin Schaff/The New York Times The Supreme Court's decision to consider the soundness of an obstruction law that has been widely used against those who took part in the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, is already having an effect on some of the rioters. A small group of people convicted under the law have been released from custody \u2014 or will soon go free \u2014 even though the justices hearing arguments on Tuesday are not expected to decide the case for months. Over the past several weeks, federal judges in Washington have agreed to release about 10 defendants who were serving prison terms because of the obstruction law, saying the defendants could wait at home as the court determined whether the law should have been used at all to keep them locked up. Among those already free is Matthew Bledsoe, the owner of a moving company from Tennessee who scaled a wall outside the Capitol and then paraded through the building with a Trump flag, ultimately planting it in the arm of a statue of President Gerald R. Ford. Soon to be released are defendants like Kevin Seefried, a drywall installer from Delaware who carried a Confederate flag through the Capitol, and Alexander Sheppard, an Ohio man who overran police lines to become one of the first people to break into the building. The interrupted sentences \u2014 which could be reinstated depending on how the Supreme Court rules \u2014 are just one of the complications to have emerged from the court's review of the obstruction statute, known in the penal code as 18 U.S.C. 1512. The charge has been used so far against more than 350 rioters, including Jacob Chansley, the so-called QAnon Shaman, and members of the far-right extremist groups the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. When the justices announced in December that they planned to scrutinize the law, many legal experts expressed concern that a ruling narrowing its scope or striking down its use in Jan. 6-related cases could deliver a devastating blow to the Justice Department's efforts to hold hundreds of rioters accountable. Federal prosecutors have often used the obstruction count in lieu of more politically fraught charges like seditious conspiracy to punish the central event of Jan. 6: the disruption of a proceeding at the Capitol to certify the election. But in the past few months, judges and prosecutors working on Capitol riot cases have quietly adjusted to the potential threat from a Supreme Court ruling, and the risk that there could be catastrophic consequences to the cases overall no longer seems as grave. For one thing, there are currently no defendants facing only the obstruction charge, according to the Justice Department. Every rioter indicted on that count has also been charged with other crimes, meaning that even if the obstruction law is removed as a tool of the Jan. 6 prosecutions, there would not be any cases that would disappear entirely. Indeed, if the court rules that the obstruction count does not apply to the Capitol attack, the main effect of the decision would be on the sentences defendants face. The obstruction law carries a hefty maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and while few, if any, rioters have gotten that much, the statute has routinely resulted in terms of several years. But some judges have already signaled they would increase the sentences stemming from other charges if the obstruction count was not available to them. In February, for example, Judge Royce C. Lamberth denied an early release to an Iowa man named Leo Kelly, who was sentenced to 30 months in prison on the obstruction count and six other misdemeanors. Judge Lamberth's reason for not setting Mr. Kelly free? Even if the Supreme Court ruled he was not permitted to sentence Mr. Kelly for obstruction, Judge Lamberth said he could increase the defendant's total time in prison by imposing consecutive, not concurrent, terms on the misdemeanor charges.  \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe Supreme Court is hearing arguments on Tuesday in a case that could eliminate some of the federal charges against former President Donald J. Trump in the case accusing him of plotting to subvert the 2020 election and could disrupt the prosecutions of hundreds of rioters involved in the Capitol attack.\nThe question for the justices is whether a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, enacted in the wake of the collapse of the energy giant Enron, covers the conduct of a former police officer, Joseph W. Fischer, who participated in the Capitol assault, on Jan. 6, 2021.\nThe law figures in two of the federal charges against Mr. Trump in his election subversion case and more than 350 people who stormed the Capitol have been prosecuted under it. If the Supreme Court sides with Mr. Fischer and says the statute does not cover what he is accused of having done, Mr. Trump is almost certain to contend that it does not apply to his conduct, either.\nThe law, signed in 2002, was prompted by accounting fraud and the destruction of documents, but the provision is written in broad terms.\nAt least part of what the law meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code: It was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself. The law sought to close that gap.\nIt did that in a two-part provision. The first part makes it a crime to corruptly alter, destroy or conceal evidence to frustrate official proceedings. The second part, at issue in Mr. Fischer's case, makes it a crime 'otherwise' to corruptly obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding.\nHere's what else to know:\nThe dense semantics being argued circle an important question: whether this statute \u2014 devised to curb things like destroying documents \u2014 requires specific proof that records were actually tampered with. It also raises another critical question: whether document tampering has anything to do with pro-Trump rioters breaking into the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\nThe heart of the case is at the pivot from the first part of the provision to the second. The ordinary meaning of 'otherwise,' prosecutors say, is 'in a different manner.' That means, they say, that the obstruction of official proceedings need not involve the destruction of evidence. The second part, they say, is broad catchall applying to all sorts of conduct. Mr. Fischer's lawyers counter that the first part of the provision must inform and limit the second one \u2014 to obstruction linked to the destruction of evidence. They would read 'otherwise,' in other words, as 'similarly.'\nThe case is one of several affecting or involving Mr. Trump on the court's docket. In a separate case to be argued next week, the justices will consider Mr. Trump's claim that he is totally immune from prosecution.\nMr. Fischer is accused of entering the Capitol around 3:24 p.m. on Jan. 6, 2021, with the counting of electoral ballots having been suspended after the initial assault. Before his trip to Washington, prosecutors said he told a superior in a text message, that 'it might get violent.' In another, he wrote that 'they should storm the capital and drag all the democrates into the street and have a mob trial.' Prosecutors say that videos showed Mr. Fischer yelling 'Charge!' before pushing through the crowd, using a vulgar term to berate police officers and crashing into a line of them.\nMr. Fischer's lawyers dispute some of this. But the question for the justices is legal, not factual: Does the 2002 law cover what Mr. Fischer is accused of? That may turn in part on the meaning of another term in the law \u2014 its requirement that the defendant acted 'corruptly.' The meaning of that word is disputed.\nAlan Feuer contributed reporting.\nApril 16, 2024, 10:23 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 10:23 a.m. ET The dense semantics being argued here are circling an important question: whether this statute \u2014 designed to curb things like destroying documents \u2014 requires specific proof that records were actually tampered with.

Credit... Kent Nishimura for The New York Times The provision at issue in the case, from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has two parts. The question for the justices is how they interact. And that depends on the word that links them: 'otherwise.'\nThe first part of the provision focuses on evidence, saying that anyone who corruptly 'alters, destroys, mutilates or conceals a record, document or other object' to affect an official proceeding is guilty of a felony.\nSo far, so good. It is uncontroversial to reinforce that destroying documents to impede an investigation has been a core purpose of the law, which was prompted by the shredding of documents in an accounting scandal.\nThe second part of the provision makes it a crime 'otherwise' to corruptly obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding. Prosecutors say the defendant in the case, Joseph W. Fischer, did that by joining the mob that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\nThe heart of the case is how the first part of the provision pivots to the second part.\nThe ordinary meaning of 'otherwise,' prosecutors say, is 'in a different manner.' That means, they say, that the obstruction of official proceedings need not involve the destruction of evidence. The second part, they say, is a broad catchall for any kind of corrupt interference with an official proceeding.\nLawyers for Mr. Fischer, the defendant in Tuesday's case, counter that the first part must inform and limit the second one \u2014 meaning that the obstruction of official proceedings must be linked to the destruction of evidence. They would read 'otherwise' as 'similarly.'\nThe alternative, they say, would be to create a crime of breathtaking scope that would allow prosecutors to charge political protesters and others with felonies carrying 20-year prison sentences.\nIn 2008, in Begay v. United States, the court considered a law with a broadly similar structure, the Armed Career Criminal Act, which requires mandatory sentences for people convicted of possessing firearms if they have earlier been found guilty of three violent felonies. In one clause, it listed specific crimes that qualified as violent felonies \u2014 including burglary, arson and extortion.\nThen, as in the new case, there followed an 'otherwise' clause, this one adding any crime that 'otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.'\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the examples informed and limited the sweep of the 'otherwise' clause. If Congress had 'meant the statute to be all-encompassing, it is hard to see why it would have needed to include the examples at all,' Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote for the majority.\nA drunken driving offense, the court ruled, did not qualify as one of the covered crimes even though the plain words of the clause would seem to encompass it.\nMr. Fisher's lawyers say that the 'otherwise' clause in the obstruction statute must also be anchored in the preceding clause.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit disagreed, with Judge Florence Y. Pan writing that the two uses of 'otherwise' were different. The gun law, she wrote, 'includes a list of examples followed by \u2018otherwise' in a single, unbroken sentence.'\nBy contrast, she wrote, the 'otherwise' in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 'sits within a separately numbered subparagraph, after a semicolon and line break, all of which put distance between it and the lists of verbs and objects' in the previous part.\nIn dissent, Judge Gregory G. Katsas wrote that 'the relationship created by the word otherwise does not depend on punctuation or line breaks.'\notherwise does not depend on punctuation or line breaks.' Rather, he wrote, 'it flows from the connotation of similarity,' among other factors. That meant, he concluded, that the second part of the provision applies 'only to acts that affect the integrity or availability of evidence.'\nApril 16, 2024, 10:13 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 10:13 a.m. ET Justice Clarence Thomas asked the first question, in keeping with the court's practice since the pandemic.

Hailey Sadler for The New York Times The investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack is already the largest criminal inquiry in Justice Department history, federal prosecutors have said. And even after more than three years, it has shown little sign of slowing down.\nEvery week, a few more rioters are arrested and charges against them are unsealed in Federal District Court in Washington. Prosecutors have suggested that a total of 2,000 or 2,500 people could ultimately face indictment for their roles in the attack.\nMore than 1,380 people had been charged in connection with the attack as of early this month, according to the Justice Department. Among the most common charges brought against them are two misdemeanors: illegal parading inside the Capitol and entering and remaining in a restricted federal area, a type of trespassing.\nAbout 350 rioters have been accused of violating the obstruction statute that the Supreme Court is considering at its hearing, and nearly 500 people have been charged with assaulting police officers. Many rioters have been charged with multiple crimes, the most serious of which so far has been seditious conspiracy.\nAlmost 800 defendants have already pleaded guilty; about 250 of them have done so to felony charges. Prosecutors have won the vast majority of the cases that have gone to trial: More than 150 defendants have been convicted at trial and only two have been fully acquitted.\nMore than 850 people have been sentenced so far, and about 520 have received at least some time in prison. The stiffest penalties have been handed down to the former leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, far-right extremist groups that played central roles in the Capitol attack.\nEnrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys leader, was sentenced to 22 years in prison, and Stewart Rhodes, who once led the Oath Keepers, was given an 18-year term.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 16, 2024, 9:36 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:36 a.m. ET All along the defense lawyers have claimed that federal prosecutors stretched the statute in an unprecedented way to fit the central crime that took place at the Capitol on Jan. 6: the disruption of the certification of the election. Then again, nothing like the storming of the Capitol had ever happened before. So perhaps it's no surprise that prosecutors use the obstruction law in a novel manner.\nApril 16, 2024, 9:31 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:31 a.m. ET It's worth remembering as today's hearing is poised to get underway that lawyers defending Jan. 6 rioters have been questioning the government's use of this particular obstruction law from the very outset of criminal cases being filed by the Justice Department. It's taken three years, but now the issue has finally reached the Supreme Court.\nApril 16, 2024, 9:26 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:26 a.m. ET The argument will not start promptly at 10:00 a.m. The court has said it will issue one or more decisions first.

A mob walked to the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times The man whose case led to the Supreme Court hearing on a controversial federal obstruction law is a former police officer from rural Pennsylvania indicted on charges of storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and crashing into a line of his fellow officers defending the building.\nJoseph W. Fischer was working for the police department in North Cornwall Township, Pa., when prosecutors say he pushed his way into the Capitol while holding up his cellphone to take videos of the surge. Once inside, he and another rioter 'galloped forward,' prosecutors say, making contact with a line of officers who were fighting off the crowd.\nMr. Fischer fell to the ground and, as some nearby officers helped him to his feet, he tried to engage with them, prosecutors say.\n'I'm a cop too,' he said, 'sometimes the country is worth more than your job.'\nAccording to court papers, Mr. Fischer was concerned about his own job before making the trip to Washington. Investigators unearthed text messages he wrote to the chief of his department, saying that things could get 'violent' on Jan. 6 and that the crowd should 'storm the capital and drag all the democrates.'\nHe also warned the chief that he might need him to post his bail, the papers said.\nTownship officials suspended Mr. Fischer without pay on the day of his arrest in February 2021 and later fired him. But he has pushed back against the government's description of behavior on Jan. 6.\nHis lawyers say that he and a companion were prepared to leave Washington that day after listening President Trump's speech near the White House and turned around to head toward the Capitol only after hearing about the mounting protest there. The lawyers also claim that Mr. Fischer arrived at the Capitol grounds well after Congress had recessed the proceeding to certify the results of the 2020 election because of the attack.\n'As Mr. Fischer walked toward the east side of the building, no barricades or fences impeded him,' the lawyers wrote in their brief to the Supreme Court.\nMr. Fischer has disputed the assertion by prosecutors that he charged the police line inside the Capitol, telling the court instead that he was pushed into the officers by 'the weight of the crowd.'\nHe also characterized his interactions with the officers differently than prosecutors did, claiming that he merely talked with one of the officers and patted him on the shoulder.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT The Supreme Court has said that the purpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was 'to safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets following the collapse of Enron.' Credit...The provision at issue in the case is part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a 2002 law enacted after the collapse of Enron, a giant energy company, after the exposure of widespread accounting fraud and the destruction of documents by its outside auditor, Arthur Andersen.\nThe Supreme Court has said that the purpose of the law was 'to safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets following the collapse of Enron.'\nAt least part of what the law meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code: it was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was meant to close that gap.\nLawyers for Joseph W. Fischer, charged under the law with obstructing an official proceeding by joining the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, said his case had an Alice-in-Wonderland quality.\n'The Through the Looking Glass moment here,' they wrote in a Supreme Court brief, 'would be for those who wrote the Sarbanes-Oxley Act upon learning that they had created a new and breathtaking obstruction offense by endeavoring to close the narrow Enron-Arthur Anderson loophole.'\nIndeed, in a different case on the scope of the statute, one of the sponsors of the law, Michael Oxley, filed a supporting brief saying prosecutors had interpreted it too broadly. The law meant to address 'specific loopholes' that Arthur Andersen 'had exploited when they shredded business documents and destroyed hard drives in anticipation of federal law-enforcement action,' wrote Mr. Oxley, a former Ohio representative who died in 2016.\nIn that case, concerning a separate provision of the law, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the law's origins informed its meaning and spared the defendant.\n'The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, all agree, was prompted by the exposure of Enron's massive accounting fraud and revelations that the company's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen, had systematically destroyed potentially incriminating documents,' she wrote for four of the justices in the majority. She added that the government had acknowledged that the provision 'was intended to prohibit, in particular, corporate document-shredding to hide evidence of financial wrongdoing.'\nA correction was made on : An earlier version of this article misstated the year of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. It was 2021, not 2001.\nHow we handle corrections\nKevin Seefried is among a small group of people convicted under an obstruction law to be released from custody or soon to go free. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times The Supreme Court's decision to consider the soundness of an obstruction law that has been widely used against those who took part in the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, is already having an effect on some of the rioters.\nA small group of people convicted under the law have been released from custody \u2014 or will soon go free \u2014 even though the justices hearing arguments on Tuesday are not expected to decide the case for months.\nOver the past several weeks, federal judges in Washington have agreed to release about 10 defendants who were serving prison terms because of the obstruction law, saying the defendants could wait at home as the court determined whether the law should have been used at all to keep them locked up.\nAmong those already free is Matthew Bledsoe, the owner of a moving company from Tennessee who scaled a wall outside the Capitol and then paraded through the building with a Trump flag, ultimately planting it in the arm of a statue of President Gerald R. Ford.\nSoon to be released are defendants like Kevin Seefried, a drywall installer from Delaware who carried a Confederate flag through the Capitol, and Alexander Sheppard, an Ohio man who overran police lines to become one of the first people to break into the building.\nThe interrupted sentences \u2014 which could be reinstated depending on how the Supreme Court rules \u2014 are just one of the complications to have emerged from the court's review of the obstruction statute, known in the penal code as 18 U.S.C. 1512. The charge has been used so far against more than 350 rioters, including Jacob Chansley, the so-called QAnon Shaman, and members of the far-right extremist groups the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers.\nWhen the justices announced in December that they planned to scrutinize the law, many legal experts expressed concern that a ruling narrowing its scope or striking down its use in Jan. 6-related cases could deliver a devastating blow to the Justice Department's efforts to hold hundreds of rioters accountable.\nFederal prosecutors have often used the obstruction count in lieu of more politically fraught charges like seditious conspiracy to punish the central event of Jan. 6: the disruption of a proceeding at the Capitol to certify the election.\nBut in the past few months, judges and prosecutors working on Capitol riot cases have quietly adjusted to the potential threat from a Supreme Court ruling, and the risk that there could be catastrophic consequences to the cases overall no longer seems as grave.\nFor one thing, there are currently no defendants facing only the obstruction charge, according to the Justice Department. Every rioter indicted on that count has also been charged with other crimes, meaning that even if the obstruction law is removed as a tool of the Jan. 6 prosecutions, there would not be any cases that would disappear entirely.\nIndeed, if the court rules that the obstruction count does not apply to the Capitol attack, the main effect of the decision would be on the sentences defendants face. The obstruction law carries a hefty maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and while few, if any, rioters have gotten that much, the statute has routinely resulted in terms of several years.\nBut some judges have already signaled they would increase the sentences stemming from other charges if the obstruction count was not available to them.\nIn February, for example, Judge Royce C. Lamberth denied an early release to an Iowa man named Leo Kelly, who was sentenced to 30 months in prison on the obstruction count and six other misdemeanors.\nJudge Lamberth's reason for not setting Mr. Kelly free?\nEven if the Supreme Court ruled he was not permitted to sentence Mr. Kelly for obstruction, Judge Lamberth said he could increase the defendant's total time in prison by imposing consecutive, not concurrent, terms on the misdemeanor charges.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Adam Liptak","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/16/multimedia/16scotus-obstruction-obstruction-law-zvhq/16scotus-obstruction-obstruction-law-zvhq-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":6.365872,"_id":"5be306034a019d7118aa996c56139adc"},{"title":"Late Night Skewers Trump's Review of Jimmy Kimmel's Oscar Hosting","author":"Trish Bendix","published_date":"2024-04-18 06:58:38","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/arts/television/jimmy-kimmel-trump-oscars.html","clean_url":"nytimes.com","excerpt":"'Ranta Claus got up bright and early to post 165 venomous words about yours truly,' Kimmel said on Donald Trump's day off from his criminal trial on Wednesday.","summary":"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night's highlights that lets you sleep \u2014 and lets us get paid to watch comedy.

Although the judge has kept prospective jurors' names private, some have disclosed their employers and other identifying information in court.\nShe also said that she did not believe she could be impartial.\nThe judge, Juan M.

But he directed that those two answers be redacted from the transcript.\nJustice Merchan also said that he was concerned about news outlets publishing physical descriptions of prospective or seated jurors, asking reporters to 'simply apply common sense.'\n'It serves no purpose,' Justice Merchan said about publishing physical descriptions, adding that he was directing the press to 'refrain from writing about anything you observe with your eyes.'\nWith the loss of the female juror on Thursday morning, six seated jurors remain.\nIn early March, Justice Merchan issued an order prohibiting publicly disclosing the names of jurors, while allowing legal teams and the defendant to know their identities.\nBut before the trial, Mr. Trump's lawyers requested that potential jurors not be told that the jury would be anonymous unless he or she expressed concerns. Justice Merchan told the parties that he'd 'make every effort to not unnecessarily alert the jurors' to this secrecy, merely telling jurors that they would be identified in court by a number.\nOn Thursday, Justice Merchan seemed frustrated by news reports that included identifying characteristics of potential jurors that had been aired in open court.

'Eau Claire, Madison, Milwaukee \u2014 that type,' Mike Hoffman, the state party's election integrity director, said as he ticked off places being targeted.\n'We're keeping a close eye on you,' he recounted telling one city clerk, according to audio recordings of the party's training sessions obtained by The New York Times.\nThe Wisconsin training sessions are a small part of an expansive operation announced on Friday by former President Donald J. Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee, which plan to dispatch more than 100,000 volunteers and lawyers to monitor and potentially challenge the electoral process in each battleground state. They will focus on every aspect of voting, including mail ballots, voting machines and post-Election Day recounts and audits.\nThe sprawling effort is rooted in Mr. Trump's persistent false claims that Democrats cheated to win the 2020 election. His allies have helped turn that belief into Republican doctrine despite the overwhelming conclusion by Democratic and G.O.P. election officials, as well as federal and state judges, that no evidence of widespread fraud exists.\n'Democrat tricks from 2020 won't work this time,' Charlie Spies, the chief counsel of the R.N.C., pledged in a statement announcing the program. 'In 2024, we're going to beat the Democrats at their own game and the R.N.C. legal team will be working tirelessly to ensure that elections officials follow the rules in administering elections.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

This week, it was calling for tariffs on Chinese steel. Soon, President Biden is expected to protect federal land in the Alaskan wilderness.\nAs his re-election campaign heats up, Mr. Biden is leaning heavily on the powers of the presidency to try to shore up his support among key constituencies \u2014 young people, union workers and environmentalists \u2014 many of whom have expressed disappointment in his handling of the issues they care about.\nIt is a tactic often employed by previous sitting presidents, but one that is made more urgent for Mr. Biden by polls that show lagging support among several of the groups that helped him win the White House four years ago. Campaign aides say the rapid-fire string of announcements, which will continue, demonstrate that the president hears their concerns.\nIt is also part of the campaign's broader strategy of trying to boil down the choice for voters to a simple one of governing versus chaos. The announcements by Mr. Biden are meant to draw a contrast with former President Donald J. Trump, who has spent most of this week sitting at the defendant's table during the first of his four criminal trials.\n'You've got a president who's bringing people together to get things done, like relieve student loan debt, protect American manufacturing, lead on the world stage, while Donald Trump screams into an echo chamber of MAGA extremism on Truth Social,' said Michael Tyler, the communications director for Mr. Biden's re-election campaign.\nMr. Biden and his aides have been traveling to highlight his administration's accomplishments.

Trump's criminal trial will not start until next week, but media coverage of the proceedings has already been met with partisan furor.\nJury selection, which began on Monday, produced a full 12-person panel by Thursday and ended Friday with the selection of alternates. Over the course of the week, many conservatives claimed that the selection process had been rigged against Mr. Trump, while some progressives argued that the press was releasing too many details about possible jurors, putting them in potential danger.\nJournalists and commentators covering the trial, being held in Manhattan, face a tricky balancing act: inform the public about one of the most consequential cases in recent memory while not putting its participants in harm's way.\nThe judge, Juan M. Merchan, has ordered that the names of the potential and selected jurors remain confidential. The proceedings on Friday kicked off with a warning from a court official to reporters and members of the public attending the trial to follow courtroom rules around filming, photographs and technology.\nand members of the public attending the trial to follow courtroom rules around filming, photographs and technology. Several news outlets, including The New York Times, have published some information about the lives of the people in the jury pool, such as their profession and the neighborhood where they live.\nJesse Watters, a prime-time host on Fox News, went further than most. On Tuesday, he showed footage of one prospective juror who had been excused. The woman explained that she had told the judge that she could be unbiased, then explained that 'it's very difficult for anyone really in this country to come to this without prior opinions.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump, who had called on the Legislature to change the ban. He worried about political blowback to Republicans in the coming elections.\nBut Mr. Toma saw himself as upholding moral principles far more foundational than current politics, the past president or even the ban itself. Attempts to undercut it as 'a Civil-War-era law' were 'sort of ridiculous,' he said in an interview on Wednesday after the vote. He pointed to the Constitution and Bill of Rights \u2014 and the Bible.\n'Even all of our laws are actually based on, what, the Ten Commandments, and the Book of Genesis, which are thousands of years ago,' he said. 'The whole idea that we are equal in the sight of God, our maker, that we have unalienable rights, all that, that is all fundamentally a Christian worldview.'\nThis commitment to Arizona's 1864 ban \u2014 a near-total ban that the State Supreme Court recently reinstated \u2014 underscores the power of conservative Christian abortion opponents in shaping American abortion laws, even as they represent a minority view. Despite a popular backlash against the Supreme Court's decision overturning a constitutional right to abortion in 2022, anti-abortion forces have maintained a stronghold in many state legislatures, not only in deeply conservative states like Alabama, but also closely divided ones like Arizona.\nMembers of Students for Life of America went door to door try to persuade voters not to support a proposed ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights in the Arizona Constitution.
