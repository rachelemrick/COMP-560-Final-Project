            "summary": "In this file photo, Republican National Convention delegates talk prior to the start of the first day of the Republican National Convention at the Charlotte Convention Center on Aug. 24, 2020, in Charlotte, North Carolina. (David T.)\nThanks to a series of deadline issues, the responsibility for selecting about 20% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention that normally fell to a broad group of Republicans at the state convention will now be handled by a much smaller executive committee chaired by Idaho Republican Party Chairwoman Dorothy Moon.\nThe delegates will be sent to the July 15 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which is where the Republican Party is expected to officially nominate its candidate for president.\nThe Idaho Republican Party's 17-member executive committee, of which Moon is the chair, is scheduled to confirm the delegates during a meeting at 11 a.m. Saturday at Crane Creek Country Club in Boise, according to two Idaho Republican party officials and documents obtained by the Idaho Capital Sun.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\nIn past presidential election cycles, hundreds of Republicans who attended the state convention as state delegates got to vote on selecting the delegates to the national convention.\nPart of the issue is that because the Republican Party does not control the White House, its national convention will be held first this year. The issue arises with Rule 16 from the Rules of the Republican Party. That rule states, in part, that no primary election, caucus or convention for selecting delegates to the national convention shall occur 'less than 45 days before the national convention is scheduled to begin.'\nThe Republican National Convention is scheduled to begin July 15, which means the deadline to select delegates is May 31. The problem is the Idaho GOP Convention doesn't begin until June 13, well after the Republican Party's deadline to name delegates.\nIn a written statement to the Idaho Capital Sun, Moon and Brent Regan, the rules committee chairman, said the Idaho Republican Party made new rules to respond to the deadline issue and is following those new rules.\n'We have gone through a very deliberate process sanctioned by the RNC,' Moon wrote.\nRegan also wrote that Moon will vote only to break a tie on the executive committee and does not have the authority to pick any delegates by herself.\n'The chairman does not have the authority or mechanism to select ANY of the delegates,' Regan wrote, capitalizing the word 'any' to add emphasis. 'A review of party rules will show that whoever claims otherwise is either ignorant or malicious.'\nIdaho gets 32 delegates at the Republican National Convention this year, and being a delegate is a big deal in political circles. National conventions can feature a roaring, party-like atmosphere that is televised nationally, where delegates would typically cheer on a series of high profile speeches from the party's A-listers and rising stars and then hear directly from the party's nominees for president and vice president.\nCONTACT US\n'If you like politics, it's a great place to be and be participating,' said Cindy Siddoway, who represents Idaho on the Republican National Committee and has participated in multiple Republican national conventions.\n'It does cost to go, but it is a wonderful opportunity to participate in history,' Siddoway added.\nThe change in selecting delegates is happening as some longtime Republican officials say Moon and her supporters are purging officials from the Republican Party who do not fall in line and agree with them. For example, during the Idaho Republican Party's 2023 summer meeting in Challis, the party stripped executive committee voting rights from the Idaho Federation of Republican Women, the Idaho Young Republicans and the Idaho College Republicans. That's the same executive committee that is being asked to sign off on the new delegates to the Republican National Convention.\nAlthough the Idaho Republican Party's executive committee is going to consider confirming the list of delegates Saturday, two Republican officials – Region Six vice chair Trent Clark, who is a former chairman of the Idaho Republican Party, and Siddoway, told the Sun on Tuesday they have not yet seen the list of delegates.\n'The selection of delegates needs to follow the rules,' Clark said in an interview Tuesday. 'For 137 years we've been having our convention to name our delegates, even before we were a state.'\nSiddoway said she has always known delegates to be picked at the state convention, which she supported.\n'In my knowledge, it has never ever been done this way, but they are trying to meet all of the deadlines,' Siddoway told the Sun.\n'I wish we could have done it through a convention the way we normally do,' Siddoway added.\nSix other Idaho Republican officials expressed concern about the delegate selection issue in a March 26 letter that was sent to Idaho Republican Party Treasurer Steve Bender and obtained by the Sun.\nIn the letter, the six Idaho GOP officials said they have a duty to make an inquiry 'when a problem exists or a report on its face does not make sense,' citing the Idaho attorney general's office's guidance for nonprofit board membership. In their letter, the six officials said the early deadline issue was a topic of a discussion at a January 2023 Republican National Committee meeting held in Dana Point, California, which would have given Moon and Idaho Republican Party officials 18 months to come up with a plan to move up the state primary election and state convention.\n'Several states, and the District of Columbia, consulted with the (Republican National Committee) at the Dana Point meeting to resolve early deadline challenges,' the six GOP officials wrote, before switching to all capital letters in the next sentence. 'WHY DIDN'T IDAHO?'\nThe six Idaho Republicans who signed the letter were state committeewoman Marsha Bjornn from Madison County, state committeewoman Shellie Blanchard from Fremont County, Bannock County Chair Char Tovey, Jefferson County Chair Kaye Field, Caribou County youth committee chair Christin Clark and Clark County Chair Connie Barg.\nIn his written statement Regan, the GOP rules committee chair, said the Idaho Republican Party's state convention is as early as it practically can be. Part of the reason is because of how political parties are made up. The Republican Party's county central committees are responsible for sending delegates to the state convention. But the county central committees are made up of locally elected precinct committeemen, who are elected in the primary election every two years. The date of the primary election is May 21 this year, and there was not enough time to allow the new precinct committeeman to take office, organize at the county central committee level, select delegates to the state convention and have the state convention begin before the May 31 deadline to select delegates for the national convention.\n'We discussed the 45-day (May 31) deadline for submitting delegates with the RNC, but they were unable to accommodate a delay due to the need to conduct background checks and other security measures,' Regan wrote. 'If we miss the deadline we lose all but 12 of our delegates (under) RNC Rule 17a. Clearly, moving the primary and or moving the convention to an earlier date is not practical.'\nMost of Idaho's delegates were already picked by former President Donald Trump who Idaho Republican Party officials said won the March 2 Idaho Republican Presidential Caucus.\nBut the party does get to pick about 20% of the delegates. This year, that includes six delegates that are split between the state's two congressional districts. Normally, those are the delegates that would be selected by a broad group of Republicans at the state convention, if not for the 45-day deadline.\nFor example, the 2021 version of the Idaho Republican Party's rules states that the remaining 20% of delegates are selected by the nominating committee at the Idaho State Republican Convention, where they are voted on on the floor.\nIdaho state law also states that at the state party conventions, each political party may 'in the year of presidential elections … elect delegates to the national convention in the manner prescribed by national party rules …'\nBut faced with the deadline issue, the Idaho Republican Party's state central committee changed its rules for nominating delegates instead of pushing for an earlier primary election and an earlier state convention to meet the 45-day deadline.\nThe latest version of the Idaho Republican Party's rules, adopted in January, says that rather than selecting the remaining 20% of delegates at the convention, the nominations committee of the Idaho Republican Party will select the delegates, which 'shall be confirmed at a special meeting of the executive committee.' The new rule also states the Idaho Republican Party chairman, who is Moon, will serve as the delegation chairman responsible for sending the list of delegates, alternates and guests to Republican national party headquarters by the deadlines unless the delegation selects a different chairman based on a majority vote.\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\nThe post Due to early deadline, smaller Idaho GOP committee to play larger role selecting national delegates appeared first on Idaho Capital Sun.",

'If we miss the deadline we lose all but 12 of our delegates (under) RNC Rule 17a. Clearly, moving the primary and or moving the convention to an earlier date is not practical.'\nWhy is there an early deadline? Most of Idaho's delegates were already picked by former President Donald Trump who Idaho Republican Party officials said won the March 2 Idaho Republican Presidential Caucus.\nBut the party does get to pick about 20% of the delegates. This year, that includes six delegates that are split between the state's two congressional districts. Normally, those are the delegates that would be selected by a broad group of Republicans at the state convention, if not for the 45-day deadline.\nFor example, the 2021 version of the Idaho Republican Party's rules states that the remaining 20% of delegates are selected by the nominating committee at the Idaho State Republican Convention, where they are voted on on the floor.\nIdaho state law also states that at the state party conventions, each political party may 'in the year of presidential elections … elect delegates to the national convention in the manner prescribed by national party rules …'\nBut faced with the deadline issue, the Idaho Republican Party's state central committee changed its rules for nominating delegates instead of pushing for an earlier primary election and an earlier state convention to meet the 45-day deadline.\nThe latest version of the Idaho Republican Party's rules, adopted in January, says that rather than selecting the remaining 20% of delegates at the convention, the nominations committee of the Idaho Republican Party will select the delegates, which 'shall be confirmed at a special meeting of the executive committee.' The new rule also states the Idaho Republican Party chairman, who is Moon, will serve as the delegation chairman responsible for sending the list of delegates, alternates and guests to Republican national party headquarters by the deadlines unless the delegation selects a different chairman based on a majority vote.",

            "summary": "A new report from Pew Research Center shows the GOP has closed the gap with Democrats on the number of voters who are registered Republicans, while both parties have become more diverse.\n'Many of the factors long associated with voters' partisanship remain firmly in place,' the report reads. 'For decades, gender, race and ethnicity, and religious affiliation have been important dividing lines in politics. This continues to be the case today.'\nSome notable changes, however, have affected the makeup of both parties: Republicans have made noteworthy gains among rural voters, white evangelicals and voters without a college degree, The New York Times noted. 'At the same time, Democrats have held onto key constituencies, such as Black voters and younger voters, and have gained ground with college-educated voters.'\nHere are five key takeaways from the report on how the Democratic and Republican parties have changed over the last three decades:\nFour years ago, leading up to the 2020 election, the Democratic Party had the 'clear edge' over Republicans with 51% of voters identifying as Democrats vs. 46% identifying as Republican.\nNow, leading up to the 2024 election, that gap has closed. The survey found that registered voters are now evenly split along party lines: 49% identify as Democrats or lean toward the Democratic Party and 48% identify as Republicans or lean Republican.\n'In recent decades, neither party has had a sizable advantage, but the Democratic Party has lost the edge it maintained from 2017 to 2021,' according to the report.\nSince the 1990s, both the Republican and Democratic parties have become more diverse, the Pew report found.\nIn 1996, 85% of voters were White, 9% were Black, 4% were Hispanic and about 1% were Asian. Now, 67% are White, 11% are Black, 13% are Hispanic and 4% are Asian.\n'Both parties are more racially and ethnically diverse than three decades ago, but not to the same degree,' according to Pew. 'There has been more change in the composition of the Democratic coalition than the Republican coalition.'\nHowever, the Democratic Party's advantages among Black and Hispanic voters, in particular, have narrowed somewhat in recent years.\nHere are how the percentage of different ethnic and racial groups have changed in both parties since 1996:\nIn 1996, 93% of Republicans were white. Now, 79% are white — a 14% drop. The percent of white voters dropped 21% in the Democratic party (from 77% to 56%).\nThe percentage of Hispanics in both parties has tripled: from 3% to 9% for Republicans and from 5% to 16% for Democrats.\nAsian voters have increased from less than 1% of Democrats' coalition to 6%.\n'The share of Black voters within the Democratic coalition has remained fairly stable, and they currently make up 18% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters,' per Pew. Black voters make up 3% of Republicans.\nWhile 44% of Democrat voters are Hispanic, Black, Asian, another race or multiracial, only 20% of Republicans are non-white. 'However, the Democratic Party's advantages among Black and Hispanic voters, in particular, have narrowed somewhat in recent years,' Pew found.\nThe Pew survey found that registered voters who regularly attended religious services were more likely to identify as Republican.\n'In 2023, 62% of registered voters who attended religious services once a month or more aligned with Republicans, compared with 41% of those who attend services less often,' according to the report.\nThis has been the pattern for years, Pew says, among white, Hispanic and Asian voters. Black voters are the exception to this trend.\n'Only about one-in-ten Black voters who are regular attenders (13%) and a similar share (11%) of those who attend less often identify as Republicans or Republican leaners,' the report found.\nWhile the Democratic Party has an advantage among younger voters and the Republican Party has the edge among the older generations, the study found a significant age difference in the way generations approach political parties: Older voters overwhelmingly identify with a political party, while a substantial number of younger voters say they lean towards one party or the other\n'Younger voters are considerably more likely than older voters to opt out of identifying directly with a party,' according to Pew.\nAmong voters 80 and older, 77% identify with a party. For voters under 25, only 52% identify with a party. The other half say they are 'something else or independent, with 28% leaning Democratic and 20% leaning Republican.'\nThere is a gender gap in partisan affiliation. Men are more likely than women to associate with the Republican Party, and women tend to lean toward the Democratic party. The Pew report found that a majority of women voters continue to align with the Democratic Party, with 51% of women identifying as Democrats, and 44% as Republicans.\n'Nearly the reverse is true among men (52% align with the Republican Party, 46% with the Democratic Party)' according to the report. 'The gender gap is about as wide among married men and women.' However, this gap is even wider among unmarried men and women — 37% of never-married men identify as Republicans compared with 24% of never-married women.",

            "summary": "Where do our politics come from ? How we were raised, sure, and how we were educated, but there's also a sense that how you vote depends on who you are . As in: your race, your gender, and your sexuality. Secondary characteristics (your religion, your class, where you live, what you do for a living) are also predictive, but what they predict has changed with time: white suburban college-educated middle-class women used to be much more likely to vote Republican, for example, and now they're much more likely to vote for Democrats.\nWhere do our politics come from ? How we were raised, sure, and how we were educated, but there's also a sense that how you vote depends on who you are . As in: your race, your gender, and your sexuality. Secondary characteristics (your religion, your class, where you live, what you do for a living) are also predictive, but what they predict has changed with time: white suburban college-educated middle-class women used to be much more likely to vote Republican, for example, and now they're much more likely to vote for Democrats. Today, Republicans win by depending on their base: white men. White men invested in the existing social hierarchy, and the assurance that even if they're not currently on the top rung of the class ladder, their path there remains clear. (People who aren't white and aren't male who vote for Republicans are equally invested in that hierarchy — either because they benefit from their proximity to power [white women] or because they, as individuals, want the same place of privilege as white men. They don't want to destroy or flatten the hierarchy; they want to dominate it themselves).\nWhich helps us begin to understand the existence of Gay Republicans: a group, as you'll see below, that's almost entirely white, male, and cis-gendered, and deeply invested in shoring up that sort of power…..even if it requires supporting a party that's also invested in marginalizing, criminalizing, and even eradicating queerness. It's a mind-boggling contradiction — but it also has a long political history, one that Neil J. Young has meticulously documented and synthesized in his new book, Coming Out Republican: A History of the Gay Right . I think you'll find his answers to my questions about the heart of the book, and what we can learn from all this history, as compelling as I do.\nWhich helps us begin to understand the existence of Gay Republicans: a group, as you'll see below, that's almost entirely white, male, and cis-gendered, and deeply invested in shoring up that sort of power…..even if it requires supporting a party that's also invested in marginalizing, criminalizing, and even eradicating queerness.

What made you, personally, want to write this book in this moment? I've actually had this book topic in mind for over twenty years. But two events in 2019 prompted me to move it from the back burner and do it now. The first was, perhaps surprisingly, Pete Buttigieg's run for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Obviously, Buttigieg isn't a gay Republican. However, as a centrist Democrat — at least, that's how he positioned himself initially during that campaign — Buttigieg was getting hammered from the left, especially from the LGBTQ activist community. That really struck me for a couple of reasons, especially how much that the criticisms of him seemed more focused on his style and presentation than on his policies. But it also made me realize how much we need histories of LGBTQ peoples and communities that don't tell a progressive story and aren't about liberal politics.\nThe second event of 2019 that motivated this book was the outreach both the Trump re-election team and the Republican National Committee made to LGBTQ voters. The Trump team's efforts built on certain things he had done in the 2016 campaign that marked him as a different Republican presidential candidate, including waving a Pride flag at a Denver rally and being the GOP's first presidential nominee to ever say 'LGBT' in a nomination speech. The RNC's decision to create a position of senior advisor on LGBTQ outreach, on the other hand, had never been done before.\nNow, I view these efforts very cynically, as my writing about them in the book makes clear. At the same time, these were historically significant developments that made me want to dig into the history of gay Republicans and grapple with the part that the LGBTQ Right played in the rise of Trump and broader shifts within the Republican Party.\nAs much as I thought this was an important book to do, little did I know how urgent it would become over the course of my writing. Up until recently, even progressives, I think, have tended to assume LGBTQ rights — especially same-sex marriage — were fairly secure. And there's even been this generally accepted idea that, unlike abortion, LGBTQ rights are protected by solid public support, so conservative activists would be unlikely to go after them.\nBut I think people are beginning to recognize that abortion and LGBTQ rights aren't separate matters for the Right, but a set of interlocking issues that mobilize the base. And also, that public attitudes about LGBTQ matters can shift. As we all now well know, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' so-called 'Don't Say Gay' bill has had a chilling effect on the LGBTQ rights movement and has reignited an increasingly vocal and aggressive anti-LGBTQ activism on the right. There's good reason to anticipate conservatives pushing further ahead on an anti-LGBTQ agenda should there be a second Trump administration. Even if Trump doesn't win, these efforts will absolutely continue at the state level.\nLargely unknown is that LGBTQ conservatives have aided and abetted some of this, in ways that are both hard to understand and also, frankly, exasperating. And, as I explore through the book, their involvement in this recent rash of anti-LGBTQ activism both fits within and complicates their historic relationship to the Republican Party. Gay Republicanism as an organized, grassroots movement was born when gay Republicans in California came together to stop an anti-gay ballot proposition in 1978 put forward by a Republican state legislator, and one of their main focuses over the decades has been to try to stop social conservatives from gaining more power within the GOP.\nYet at the same time, gay Republicans regularly have supported religious liberty legislation and opposed hate crimes laws, to name just a couple of examples, that many feel serve to undermine LGBTQ freedom. And they have a long history of much more narrowly defining 'gay rights' than the broader LGBTQ community typically understood them. Their current delineation of 'gay rights' from 'LGBTQ rights' — or, even more so, saying they support trans rights but oppose the 'radical gender ideology' that the Left is forcing on the nation and its children — continues the unique way gay conservatives have positioned themselves and their politics within the American Right.\nThe thing that immediately strikes me when I think about Gay Republicans is shoring up societal power and privilege — which a conservative ethos allows a Gay Republican to do, so long as they're a certain type of Gay Republican. As in: largely white, male, cis-gendered, and homonormative. Can you talk a bit about who we're talking about when we're talking about Gay Republicans, both in terms of demographics and their particular brands of conservative politics?\nThe thing that immediately strikes me when I think about Gay Republicans is shoring up societal power and privilege — which a conservative ethos allows a Gay Republican to do, so long as they're a certain type of Gay Republican. As in: largely white, male, cis-gendered, and homonormative. Can you talk a bit about who we're talking about when we're talking about Gay Republicans, both in terms of demographics and their particular brands of conservative politics? This is almost entirely a story about white, gay men. An early reader of my manuscript asked: 'Where are the lesbians? Where are the people of color?' And let me tell you, I tried hard to diversify my central actors here to make sure I wasn't thoughtlessly putting forward a story about one white gay man after another. But at the end of the day, the historical evidence speaks for itself. Especially for the history I am telling here about the grassroots gay Republican clubs that ultimately formed the national Log Cabin Republicans organization and of the gay right-of-center activists, writers, and politicians who shaped the larger political landscape of gay Republicanism, there were only a handful of lesbians and persons of color involved.\nOf course, this overwhelming evidence caused me to sharpen my argument about how gay Republicans often used their whiteness, their maleness, and their homonormativity to stake their place within the GOP — and also how their whiteness and maleness shaped their politics and their political activism on a range of issues, including abortion, affirmative action, immigration, gun control, and welfare.\nThe abortion issue was especially fascinating to dig into because the handful of lesbian Republicans involved in the gay Republican clubs in the early years kept arguing that in order to attract more women, the Log Cabin chapters and national organization needed to take a pro-choice stance. They contended that supporting reproductive freedom was consistent with gay Republicans' belief in personal autonomy, privacy, and limited government. They were like, 'when we say the government should stay out of our wallets and out of our bedrooms, this is what that means !'\nThe abortion issue was especially fascinating to dig into because the handful of lesbian Republicans involved in the gay Republican clubs in the early years kept arguing that in order to attract more women, the Log Cabin chapters and national organization needed to take a pro-choice stance. They contended that supporting reproductive freedom was consistent with gay Republicans' belief in personal autonomy, privacy, and limited government. They were like, 'when we say the government should stay out of our wallets and out of our bedrooms, this is what that means !' And even though a slight majority of Log Cabin members consistently called themselves pro-choice, a larger percentage didn't want the organization to take a public position because they thought that abortion wasn't a 'gay issue' and that endorsing the right to choose would harm their making inroads with the party.\nThat really sums it up, right? Especially when you consider the many things gay Republicans did take stances on and devote their energies to, including lowering taxes, cutting business regulations, increasing military spending, toughening sentencing laws, and restricting immigration — their pronouncement that abortion could be ignored because it wasn't a matter of 'gay rights' has to be seen, I think, as reflective of a fairly patriarchal mindset within gay Republicanism and also the understanding these white, gay men had about how they could best fit within the larger Republican Party.\nThat really sums it up, right?

I do want to say, though, that a history of LGBTQ Republican voters might paint a different picture than what my book does with its focus on the organizations and public figures of gay Republicanism. About 15 percent of LGBTQ voters are registered Republicans, compared to 50 percent affiliated with the Democratic Party. That leaves 35 percent not belonging to either party. In national elections, LGBTQ Americans consistently give one-quarter to one-third of their votes to Republican candidates – and often as many as 50 percent vote Republican in local and state elections. A lot of LGBTQ people are regularly supporting the GOP's politicians and policies at the ballot box.\nI do want to say, though, that a history of LGBTQ Republican voters might paint a different picture than what my book does with its focus on the organizations and public figures of gay Republicanism.

A lot of LGBTQ people are regularly supporting the GOP's politicians and policies at the ballot box. But we don't have polling that helps us break down the category of 'LGBTQ voters' into the many subcategories we know make up this broad and diverse community. I think it is safe to say, though, that if we did, we'd have a picture of gay Republicanism — or, I should say, of LGBTQ Republicanism — that isn't as white, male, and gay as my book's subjects are. I do hope that in the near future we'll get much more precise polling of LGBTQ voters. (Think of the specificity pollsters apply to the multiple subcategories of 'religious voters,' for instance).\nBut until then, I also believe it is important to understand that it is gay white men who have disproportionately dominated the institutions, networks, and intellectual and political foundations of LGBTQ conservatism, and who have helped build the modern Republican Party that so many LGBTQ persons often back.\nThe chapters on early closeted and not-so-closeted Gay Republican leaders and advisors of the 1950s-1970s created such a useful foundation for understanding the conflicting ideologies of contemporary Gay Republicans — there's the uneasy attempts to reconcile religious mores and sexual desires, the libertarian demand for privacy and freedom from surveillance (unless you're a leftist!), the frustration with Leftist queer politics….what do those tensions tell us about the state of Gay Republicanism today amidst significant identity-based polarization?\nThe chapters on early closeted and not-so-closeted Gay Republican leaders and advisors of the 1950s-1970s created such a useful foundation for understanding the conflicting ideologies of contemporary Gay Republicans — there's the uneasy attempts to reconcile religious mores and sexual desires, the libertarian demand for privacy and freedom from surveillance (unless you're a leftist!), the frustration with Leftist queer politics….what do those tensions tell us about the state of Gay Republicanism today amidst significant identity-based polarization? By starting in the era of the 1950s Cold War closet, I was able to put a whole set of different actors making very different choices into play. You have these guys, mostly in Washington, D.C., who are hiding their sexuality because the government's 'Lavender Scare' hunt of homosexuals would have meant their lives would have been ruined personally and professionally had they been found out. Even as the Lavender Scare subsides and homosexuals have more ability to live their lives free of surveillance and harassment, they still tend to disguise their sexuality — some of them even marry women — in order to get ahead in conservative politics. Many of these also use socially conservative positions (including supporting anti-gay policies) as one of the ways they try not to be detected as homosexuals, a strategy we continue to see to this day.\nAt the same time, you have this other set of guys, mostly out in California, who are able to be more open about their sexuality and develop a more integrated public identity as homosexuals. They have a more consistent libertarian politics — at least when it comes to their own lives. They want a constrained government that doesn't have the power to come after their private lives or interfere with their businesses: low taxes, little regulation, and no surveillance and criminalization of homosexual activity.\nYet as the federal government and state and local authorities begin to end their coordinated harassment of homosexuals' lives in the 1970s, gay Republicans start to shift some of their views about the role of the government, especially police power. Now that law enforcement isn't going after them, they began to support things like robust police budgets, harsher sentencing laws, and 'tough-on-crime' politicians.\nIt's one of the ways I think we see a fairly consistent habit that gay Republicans have of not only abandoning their critiques of the misuse of government power when it is no longer directed at them but to actually advocating for that use of government power towards others, including Black and Brown persons, immigrants, Muslims, and women, as a way of showing their belonging within the larger conservative community.\nOne of the ongoing debates among gay Republicans has been a question that also serves as the title of one of my chapters: 'Are you a gay Republican or a Republican gay?' That question gets to the conflicting ideologies and identities of gay Republicans – and their interrelatedness. Those who called themselves 'gay Republicans' meant that they wanted to show the Republican Party that gays and lesbians belonged to it and, through making themselves visible, encourage the GOP to adopt more pro-gay positions — or, at least to curtail its anti-gay agenda.\nThose who described themselves as 'a Republican gay\" or, more frequently, as 'a Republican who just happens to be gay,' saw their mission as building a Republican Party where sexuality wasn't an issue, although they weren't very clear about how exactly that would be accomplished. They tended to have a far more limited view of 'gay rights,' one focused on ending government discrimination of homosexuals in employment and housing rather than on advocating for the extension of rights, including for some of them even saying they didn't believe the federal government should legalize same-sex marriage. But generally, these folks were especially uncomfortable with assertions of a sexual identity that they saw as 'liberal' and 'political' even as they named their own political affiliation as preeminent. And, of course, an assertion of political affiliation is a declaration of identity, especially as this particular one — Republican — is encoded with notions of whiteness, maleness, and even Christianness that the Right views as normative and non-identitarian.\nThose who described themselves as 'a Republican gay\" or, more frequently, as 'a Republican who just happens to be gay,' saw their mission as building a Republican Party where sexuality wasn't an issue, although they weren't very clear about how exactly that would be accomplished. They tended to have a far more limited view of 'gay rights,' one focused on ending government discrimination of homosexuals in employment and housing rather than on advocating for the extension of rights, including for some of them even saying they didn't believe the federal government should legalize same-sex marriage. But generally, these folks were especially uncomfortable with assertions of a sexual identity that they saw as 'liberal' and 'political' even as they named their own political affiliation as preeminent. And, of course, an assertion of political affiliation is a declaration of identity, especially as this particular one — Republican — is encoded with notions of whiteness, maleness, and even Christianness that the Right views as normative and non-identitarian. All of this helps us understand, I think, the multiple options available to LGBTQ conservatives in our era of identity-based polarization and how those choices facilitate their inclusion within the American Right. In addition to the long tradition of downplaying or even dismissing sexual identity in favor of other identities — American, conservative, Christian — one of the things that has happened more recently is a spirited assertion of being gay or lesbian rather than LGBTQ or queer.\n(It should be noted that the Log Cabin Republicans website does say that it is an organization for 'LGBT Republicans.' I asked why the 'Q' had been left off, but never received a response. You see this delineation happening a lot in rightwing media where gay and lesbian conservatives argue that 'LGBTQ' is a political identity of the Left. On social media, it is particularly rampant. If you want to go down a pretty grim rabbit hole, click on #gaynotqueer or #LGBwithouttheTQ on Twitter or TikTok.)\nIt's fascinating to watch conservative media embrace and promote this articulation of gay and lesbian identity. On one hand, it reinforces ideas about conservative individualism as contrasted to the Left's conformity and groupthink. I'm a gay individual, not an LGBTQ lemming . Even more, it positions 'gay' and 'lesbian' as 'not trans,' and helps bifurcate gay rights from LGBTQ rights which many view as only concerned with transgender rights and gender identity now.\nIt's fascinating to watch conservative media embrace and promote this articulation of gay and lesbian identity.

That's a smart strategy to reach a broader American public that continues to show discomfort with a lot of the trans rights movement, especially anything involving underage minors. And it's worth recognizing that there are a lot of gay and lesbian persons who aren't conservative or Republican who nevertheless have struggled with the prominence of trans issues or feel like the LGBTQ rights movement no longer represents them – that's a conversation that is happening in all sorts of LGBTQ spaces. Still, I think all of them would reject how gay Republicans have exploited this to advance their standing within the Republican Party.\nWhat archival find, interview, or conversation most challenged or textured your thinking during the process of writing the book (and doing press for it!)\nWhat archival find, interview, or conversation most challenged or textured your thinking during the process of writing the book (and doing press for it!) Oh goodness, it is hard to choose just one! Every good research project provides lots of unexpected moments, but perhaps the biggest pleasure of writing this book was how many surprises it gave me along the way. Maybe I'll just tease potential readers by saying there are a lot of things in this book that have never been previously reported, and I am especially grateful to the people who shared with me stories they had never told anyone else before, including Andrew Sullivan's fascinating account of how he came to write his landmark 1989 piece for The New Republic titled 'Here Comes the Groom: A (Conservative) Case for Gay Marriage,' an enormously consequential document in the history of the long path towards marriage equality.\nOh goodness, it is hard to choose just one!

But when it comes to an archival find that really challenged and textured my thinking, it has to be a series of documents I found in the collection of the Concerned Republicans for Individual Rights (CRIR) housed at the GLBT Historical Society in San Francisco. CRIR was founded in 1977 which makes it the nation's oldest LGBTQ Republican organization today, although not the first. (CRIR now goes by the name Log Cabin Republicans of San Francisco.) In the 1980s, as the HIV/AIDS crisis took hold in San Francisco, CRIR underwent an enormously fascinating transformation that made me grapple with and rethink some of the broader historical themes I was developing.\nBut when it comes to an archival find that really challenged and textured my thinking, it has to be a series of documents I found in the collection of the Concerned Republicans for Individual Rights (CRIR) housed at the GLBT Historical Society in San Francisco.

In the 1980s, as the HIV/AIDS crisis took hold in San Francisco, CRIR underwent an enormously fascinating transformation that made me grapple with and rethink some of the broader historical themes I was developing. For instance, I knew going into this project that the HIV/AIDS epidemic had profoundly shaped how gay Republicans and conservatives developed their intellectual and philosophical arguments regarding same-sex marriage, especially their contention that legalizing gay marriage was a smart public health measure that would help curtail homosexual 'promiscuity' and increase public safety. I just sort of assumed this was an obvious response from a gay demographic that tended to have more religious and socially conservative folks than the larger LGBTQ community did.\nBut when I dove into the research and started looking at the early years of the first gay Republican clubs, including CRIR, and especially the guys who founded and were active in them, I was pretty surprised by what I found. Those original guys were wild! The San Francisco club had a huge portion of its members that were very active in the city's S&M and leather scene, and the San Diego organization was started by a drag queen former sex worker. The Los Angeles group held many of its first meetings in the backroom of a leather bar. And there was definitely a sense that these meetings had as much social purposes as they did political ones, a good place for like-minded folks to flirt and organize.\nBut when I dove into the research and started looking at the early years of the first gay Republican clubs, including CRIR, and especially the guys who founded and were active in them, I was pretty surprised by what I found.

The Los Angeles group held many of its first meetings in the backroom of a leather bar. And there was definitely a sense that these meetings had as much social purposes as they did political ones, a good place for like-minded folks to flirt and organize. So, given these origins, I was a bit at a loss to explain how we got from there to the buttoned-up, almost puritanical gay Republicanism we see in the 1990s and 2000s. Was it just simply an overactive response to the devastating consequences of the disease?\nInstead, as these documents showed, it was a much more complicated process, one where gay Republicans' libertarian politics – and often libertine personal philosophy – struggled to respond to the health crisis and gradually shifted into a unique form of gay social conservatism. The documents that brought this alive concerned CRIR's role in opposing the shutdown of gay bathhouses and sex clubs by San Francisco public health officials. CRIR's opposition aligned them with much of the city's gay community, including most of the gay Democratic organizations. However, CRIR's arguments reflected their libertarian politics as they contended that gay men should be free to take their own personal risks when it came to their bodies and that the government shouldn't interfere in private enterprise. It also allowed them to make partisan criticisms of the Democratic politicians who were behind the bathhouse shutdowns, just more proof in their minds of how the Democratic Party didn't care about its gay and lesbian supporters.\nThey won this fight in San Francisco when a judge ordered the bathhouses to be reopened. Yet almost as soon as they secured this victory, they began to wrestle with what they were seeing. Both the escalating numbers of dead from HIV/AIDS and also how the Far Right was using fears of the epidemic to stir up vicious homophobia in the American public and advance an anti-gay political agenda. Gay Republicans adjusted, downplaying their libertarian arguments about sexual freedom and redefining 'personal responsibility' which they had once meant as the right for gay men to decide what they wanted to do with their bodies without government interference to now meaning the obligation every gay individual had to not contract and transmit the disease by abstaining from or limiting their sexual activity. And gay Republicans now began to accuse the gay Left of endangering the nation in its reckless defense of 'sexual freedom' and its disinterest in pursuing marriage rights. Soon, gay Republicans started promoting what I call a 'gay ‘family values' politics' that emphasized sexual monogamy, gender conformity, and the need for legal same-sex marriage.\nWatching all this take shape over just a couple of years in the 1980s was fascinating, but it also helped me appreciate how gay Republicans held onto and remade their political vision as they navigated these terrible events, a process that was far more complicated than the simple 'backlash thesis' I had originally thought. And tracing this history in the midst of COVID made all of it take on a deeper resonance for me. The LGBTQ Right has shown a myriad of views about lockdowns, masking requirements, and vaccines, but some of the loudest voices of COVID denialism have come from LGBTQ Trumpers who are prominent on social media. Seeing this current phenomenon through the history of gay Republicans and HIV/AIDS helped me appreciate how a particular politics regarding bodily freedom, scientific authority, and government mandates developed on the LGBTQ Right distinct from but also influential on the broader conservative movement, even as it did nothing to lessen my sense of the dangers that such views hold for all of us as they are mainstreamed.\nYou write that 'when gay Republicans say, as they often have, that it was ‘harder to come out as Republican than as gay,' they are heightening all Republicans' sense of victimhood.' The first time I read the book, I underlined that passage four times. Can you talk about how that idea becomes central to Gay Republican identity and also facilitates their inclusion within the party?\nYou write that 'when gay Republicans say, as they often have, that it was ‘harder to come out as Republican than as gay,' they are heightening all Republicans' sense of victimhood.' The first time I read the book, I underlined that passage four times. Can you talk about how that idea becomes central to Gay Republican identity and also facilitates their inclusion within the party? First of all, the fact that Anne Helen Petersen gave a quadruple underline to something I wrote will carry me for years to come. Bless you. But yes, this rhetoric was one of the most fascinating things for me to explore as it was such a jarring thing to encounter the first couple of times that I came across it. On one hand, such words fit neatly in the generally hyperbolic discourse of today's rightwing media, where they are repeated frequently. They seem of a piece with the outlandish and outrageous statements that Trump has normalized within American conservatism, especially its mediasphere.\nSo, I was especially surprised to discover there's a longer history here, with gay Republicans starting to say this as early as the 1980s. That perplexed me at first. How could any gay person imagine something – especially, declaring one's political affiliation – as more difficult than the experience of coming out at the height of the HIV/AIDS crisis and amid the virulent homophobia the epidemic reinvigorated? But what I soon realized was that this same rhetorical expression has been directed at different audiences in different times with varying intended effects.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, this comment circulated mostly within gay and lesbian media, places like the magazine The Advocate . It was a way for gay Republicans then to scold the gay rights movement which they felt was ostracizing them for their political views and betraying their supposed adherence to liberal values like tolerance and inclusion.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, this comment circulated mostly within gay and lesbian media, places like the magazine The Advocate .

In the 1990s and early 2000s, gay Republicans began voicing this line to the mainstream national media outlets that were giving them lots of attention, places like the Washington Post , New York Times , and even GQ magazine. These publications tended to fawn over the 'normalness' of the gay Republicans they wrote about, by which they meant their straight-acting, gender-conforming, conservative-dressing presentation. (Almost all of those profiled, it should be noted, were white men.) At the same time, all of these articles had an underlying befuddlement to them. Essentially, why would any gay person belong to the Republican Party? Now, that's not a bad question. In fact, it's one of my book's central interrogations. But gay Republicans in these years learned that saying it had been harder for them to come out as Republican than as gay was one of the ways they got that sympathetic and even admiring coverage in the first place. Their narrative presented them as both brave but also doubly-burdened. Not only did they have to come out as gay, they also had to come out as Republican! And it redirected the focus away from a homophobic political party they were valiantly trying to make better towards a hostile LGBTQ community that would ostracize and excommunicate some of its own members just because of how they voted.\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, gay Republicans began voicing this line to the mainstream national media outlets that were giving them lots of attention, places like the Washington Post , New York Times , and even GQ magazine.

Especially in the last decade, this rhetoric has happened most frequently and passionately within a conservative mediascape that has a surprisingly large number of prominent LGBTQ conservative figures. The language has a threefold purpose. First, it serves to declare the LGBTQ rights movement – or really, the gay rights movement – as completed, having accomplished what it set out to do. Don't Ask, Don't Tell no longer exists. Same-sex marriage is legal. And it is no longer difficult to come out of the closet. Therefore, gay rights have been secured, and anything more that is being called for is simply another sign that the 'woke,' leftist LGBTQ rights movement will never be satisfied.\nEspecially in the last decade, this rhetoric has happened most frequently and passionately within a conservative mediascape that has a surprisingly large number of prominent LGBTQ conservative figures.

Therefore, gay rights have been secured, and anything more that is being called for is simply another sign that the 'woke,' leftist LGBTQ rights movement will never be satisfied. Secondly, and more importantly, this language serves to support and enhance the Right's politics of grievance and its sense of victimhood by presenting Republicans – and, implicit in that, white, heterosexual Christians – as the most aggrieved identity in American life today. Having LGBTQ conservatives vouch for this – at the 2016 Republican National Convention, Caitlyn Jenner told an audience of supporters, 'It was easy to come out as trans. It was harder to come out as a Republican,' so it isn't just gay white men saying this — is powerful. It mobilizes the Right's version of identity politics that rejects minority groups as deserving special recognition or accommodation while portraying conservatives as the most marginalized and persecuted demographic today.\nLastly, LGBTQ conservatives have asserted their inclusion in the Republican Party and broader conservative movement through this very language. This discourse demonstrates their belonging. We, like you, are harassed and targeted because of our political beliefs, while our sexual orientation is no longer a public matter that needs 'special' protection. And our sexuality is secondary, or even incidental, to our political identity which is paramount. It's a variation of that Mike Pence line, 'I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order.' Gay Republicans are saying they are, 'Conservative, Republican, and gay, in that order.' Or, as one popular gay Fox News talking head once said, 'I'm a Christian, a patriotic American, and a free-market, shrink-the-government conservative — who also happens to be gay.'\nLastly, LGBTQ conservatives have asserted their inclusion in the Republican Party and broader conservative movement through this very language.

This is a big one, so please take it in whatever direction feels right to you (or feel free to skip if it's just too much). You end the book by looking at the current state of anti-trans and anti-'woke' legislation — and the very tenuous assumption, on the part of so many Gay Republicans, that the persecution of trans people and criminalization of trans bodies has no bearing on them, even when they are also trans (see: Caitlyn Jenner). As a gay man and a gay historian, how do you think others should process this moment of unprecedented but incredibly fraught freedom?\nThis is a big one, so please take it in whatever direction feels right to you (or feel free to skip if it's just too much).

As a gay man and a gay historian, how do you think others should process this moment of unprecedented but incredibly fraught freedom? This was probably the most challenging part to write for a number of reasons. First, these developments are taking place so quickly, and as a historian it always feels a bit awkward to write about something you are in the midst of. I want a good twenty years of distance to really make sense of something! And as you know, when you write a book you wrap things up about a year before the thing actually comes out. It made me nervous to write about the anti-trans efforts because I knew so much would happen between submitting my manuscript and the book showing up in people's hands. Unfortunately, what has followed has only further substantiated the arguments I make.\nPerhaps more importantly, as a historian I also believe that nothing is secure. That history is not a story of inevitable progress. Instead, everything is contingent, and backlashes and regressions are guaranteed, often with even more brutal and devastating consequences than what came before. So, as much as I strove through most of the book for a tone of scholarly objectivity — to the extent that such a thing even exists — I felt like I had to sound the alarm bells in the book's conclusion because I am a historian who thinks we are quite possibly turning a very dire corner.\nPerhaps more importantly, as a historian I also believe that nothing is secure.

I found this especially frustrating in interviewing today's gay Republicans, including the current president of Log Cabin Republicans. All of them were almost entirely focused on the great freedoms LGBTQ persons have gained as a security for the future. They pointed to laws and Supreme Court decisions as the proof of this. This was maddening to me! Nothing is written in stone; laws can be struck down; Supreme Court decisions overturned. Dobbs , anyone? But they wouldn't budge on holding onto a view of history that felt, frankly, un-conservative to me in its blind trust in human progress.\nI found this especially frustrating in interviewing today's gay Republicans, including the current president of Log Cabin Republicans.

I know I'm not alone in worrying that the recent slate of anti-trans efforts is the opening wedge in a broader, coordinated assault against LGBTQ rights, including same-sex marriage. Yet the gay Republicans I interviewed believe that will not and cannot happen. They insist that these are specific and discrete pieces of legislation, not part of a larger anti-LGBTQ policy agenda. When I asked about Ron DeSantis's 'Don't Say Gay' bill, Log Cabin's president promised that this was only meant for children in the K-3rd grades, and what normal person would want a second grader having to hear about sex in a public classroom?\nI know I'm not alone in worrying that the recent slate of anti-trans efforts is the opening wedge in a broader, coordinated assault against LGBTQ rights, including same-sex marriage.

After the Florida legislature expanded that legislation through the twelfth grade, as I knew would happen, and as it has served as a blueprint for other states across the nation, I reached out to him for further comment, but he never got back to me.\nTo its credit, Log Cabin has spoken out against some of these recent developments and have seemed to sour on DeSantis. But I suppose my plea to the rest of us is that we not be as naïve about what is happening here. I certainly hope that Log Cabin Republicans will return to its long tradition of serving as a thorn in the side of the Republican Party, by calling out anti-LGBTQ efforts, pressuring Republican legislators to defeat anti-LGBTQ legislation, and backing progressive Republican candidates and policies. But for the time being, the organization – and the bigger LGBTQ conservative movement – continues to participate in the Republican Party's collapse into full-blown Trumpism.\nLog Cabin is unlikely to extricate itself from this entanglement, although a second Trump administration may force them to reckon with their choices. For the rest of us, we shouldn't have to get to that point to be vigilant, especially when it may be too late. The Far Right that owns the Republican Party has plainly announced their plans for the future. We would do well to take them at their word. ●\nYou can find more about Neil's work here — and you can buy Coming Out Republican here .\nYou can find more about Neil's work here — and you can buy Coming Out Republican here .",

            "excerpt": "Leading up to the 2024 election, the party affiliation gap between Democrats and Republicans has closed, a new Pew report finds",
            "summary": "A new report from Pew Research Center shows the GOP has closed the gap with Democrats on the number of voters who are registered Republicans, while both parties have become more diverse.\n'Many of the factors long associated with voters' partisanship remain firmly in place,' the report reads. 'For decades, gender, race and ethnicity, and religious affiliation have been important dividing lines in politics. This continues to be the case today.'\nSome notable changes, however, have affected the makeup of both parties: Republicans have made noteworthy gains among rural voters, white evangelicals and voters without a college degree, The New York Times noted. 'At the same time, Democrats have held onto key constituencies, such as Black voters and younger voters, and have gained ground with college-educated voters.'\nHere are five key takeaways from the report on how the Democratic and Republican parties have changed over the last three decades:\nRepublicans close the gap Four years ago, leading up to the 2020 election, the Democratic Party had the 'clear edge' over Republicans with 51% of voters identifying as Democrats vs. 46% identifying as Republican.\nNow, leading up to the 2024 election, that gap has closed. The survey found that registered voters are now evenly split along party lines: 49% identify as Democrats or lean toward the Democratic Party and 48% identify as Republicans or lean Republican.\n'In recent decades, neither party has had a sizable advantage, but the Democratic Party has lost the edge it maintained from 2017 to 2021,' according to the report.\nBoth parties have become more diverse Since the 1990s, both the Republican and Democratic parties have become more diverse, the Pew report found.\nIn 1996, 85% of voters were White, 9% were Black, 4% were Hispanic and about 1% were Asian. Now, 67% are White, 11% are Black, 13% are Hispanic and 4% are Asian.\n'Both parties are more racially and ethnically diverse than three decades ago, but not to the same degree,' according to Pew. 'There has been more change in the composition of the Democratic coalition than the Republican coalition.'\nHowever, the Democratic Party's advantages among Black and Hispanic voters, in particular, have narrowed somewhat in recent years.\nHere are how the percentage of different ethnic and racial groups have changed in both parties since 1996:\nIn 1996, 93% of Republicans were white. Now, 79% are white — a 14% drop. The percent of white voters dropped 21% in the Democratic party (from 77% to 56%).\nThe percentage of Hispanics in both parties has tripled: from 3% to 9% for Republicans and from 5% to 16% for Democrats.\nAsian voters have increased from less than 1% of Democrats' coalition to 6%.\n'The share of Black voters within the Democratic coalition has remained fairly stable, and they currently make up 18% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters,' per Pew. Black voters make up 3% of Republicans. While 44% of Democrat voters are Hispanic, Black, Asian, another race or multiracial, only 20% of Republicans are non-white. 'However, the Democratic Party's advantages among Black and Hispanic voters, in particular, have narrowed somewhat in recent years,' Pew found.\nChurch attendance linked to Republican Party — except in this group The Pew survey found that registered voters who regularly attended religious services were more likely to identify as Republican.\n'In 2023, 62% of registered voters who attended religious services once a month or more aligned with Republicans, compared with 41% of those who attend services less often,' according to the report.\nThis has been the pattern for years, Pew says, among white, Hispanic and Asian voters. Black voters are the exception to this trend.\n'Only about one-in-ten Black voters who are regular attenders (13%) and a similar share (11%) of those who attend less often identify as Republicans or Republican leaners,' the report found.\nOlder voters identify, younger voters lean While the Democratic Party has an advantage among younger voters and the Republican Party has the edge among the older generations, the study found a significant age difference in the way generations approach political parties: Older voters overwhelmingly identify with a political party, while a substantial number of younger voters say they lean towards one party or the other\nidentify with a political party, while a substantial number of younger voters say they lean towards one party or the other 'Younger voters are considerably more likely than older voters to opt out of identifying directly with a party,' according to Pew.\nAmong voters 80 and older, 77% identify with a party. For voters under 25, only 52% identify with a party. The other half say they are 'something else or independent, with 28% leaning Democratic and 20% leaning Republican.'\nPartisan gap is bigger between unmarried men and women There is a gender gap in partisan affiliation. Men are more likely than women to associate with the Republican Party, and women tend to lean toward the Democratic party. The Pew report found that a majority of women voters continue to align with the Democratic Party, with 51% of women identifying as Democrats, and 44% as Republicans.\n'Nearly the reverse is true among men (52% align with the Republican Party, 46% with the Democratic Party)' according to the report. 'The gender gap is about as wide among married men and women.' However, this gap is even wider among unmarried men and women — 37% of never-married men identify as Republicans compared with 24% of never-married women.",

            "summary": "(HAMILTON COUNTY REPORTER) — A new billboard campaign advocating for Democrats to decide which Republican candidates win the May primary has two party leaders in Hamilton County in agreement.\nBoth Democratic Party Chair Jocelyn Vare and Republican Party Chair Mario Massillamany told The Reporter they stand against this brand of election manipulation.\nThe billboards, which are reportedly coming to the borders of Hamilton County in the near future, read, 'Even Democrats can vote in the Republican Primary.' The billboards are paid for and authorized by ReCenter Indiana PAC.\nDemocrats can vote in the Republican Primary.' The billboards are paid for and authorized by ReCenter Indiana PAC. The website ReCenterIndiana.org states, 'Many races, including the governor, will likely be decided on May 7, not November 5. Participating in the Republican primary gives Democrats, Libertarians, and independents a say in selecting nominees who are likely to be elected.'\nThe website goes on to point out six 'key races to watch' when organizers believe participation in the Republican primary by non-Republicans could affect the outcome. Three of those races will be decided in whole or in part by Hamilton County: Indiana House District 24, from which Donna Schaibley is retiring, House District 29, which is being vacated by Chuck Goodrich in his bid for Congress, and Indiana Governor.\nThe website lists all the candidates and provides links to some – but not all – of their campaign websites.\nVare told The Reporter she spoke with Massillamany and found they are in complete agreement in standing against the actions of this political action committee.\n'I want Democratic voters to vote in the Democratic primary and Mario wants Republicans to vote in the Republican primary,' Vare said. 'We were in alignment when we had a conversation about how we want people to vote genuinely, but even before that, we want people to vote .'\nvote .' Massillamany told The Reporter he agreed.\n'We want people to come out and vote,' Massillamany said, 'My main push is that people should take advantage of the ability to participate in one of the greatest countries' election processes and vote on May 7. We have so many important races that influence not only national, but also local levels. Republicans, Democrats, get out and vote. Democrats vote in theirs. Republicans vote in ours.'\nVare said she wants people to vote genuinely.\n'We want people to come out and vote for this primary,' Vare said. 'On top of that, vote genuinely, and not be influenced by tricky strategy or – I don't even know what to call it.'\nMassillamany called the tactics advocated for in these billboards deceitful.\n'Hamilton County GOP is welcoming to everyone and we want everyone to become a Republican, but we want people to actually who identify with the Republican Party or believe that they identify with Republican values to vote in a Republican primary – not to try and somehow influence Republican primaries in some deceitful or nefarious way,' Massillamany said.\nOne consideration in voting in an opposing party's primary is that it could block voters from later becoming candidates for their own party. In Indiana, in order to run for office as a member of either the Republican or Democratic parties, a person must have voted in a party's primary election each of the last two times that person voted. Otherwise, the individual must obtain and file a certificate from the appropriate county chair of the party declaring the individual's membership of that party.\n'I know I know most people don't have aspirations to run for office,' Vare said. 'I also point out that coming out and voting genuinely helps in other ways. We see a desire for more political balance. This is a step to political balance in our county.'\nMassillamany said he would like to see more people become Republicans, rather than just vote to influence the Republican primary.\n'I take my job seriously,' Massillamany said. 'While we are welcoming and want people to identify as Republicans and participate in the process as Republicans, we want to make sure that it's truly people that identify with the Republican Party and Republican values that are participating in our Republican primary.'\nIn Hamilton County, if you call yourself a Republican or a Democrat, your party leadership encourages you to vote for your own party in the May 7 primary rather than being influenced by a PAC with no apparent ties to this community.\nIf you want to be more informed about the candidates on your ballot, The Reporter is currently publishing a full list of candidates and polling locations. We are also publishing short summaries of each candidate who chooses to fill out this form on our website, which candidates can fill out at readthereporter.com/2024-candidate-info.\nThat information is in today's edition and will appear in every online edition of The Reporter up to and including our May 7 special election edition.",

            "summary": "In a dramatic turn of events on Capitol Hill, the House of Representatives witnessed a stark divide among Republicans over an amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) reauthorization bill. The amendment, proposed by Republican Arizona Representative Andy Biggs, aimed to introduce a warrant requirement to prevent the U.S. government from conducting surveillance on Americans without their knowledge. However, the amendment faced stiff opposition from within the Republican ranks, ultimately leading to its defeat in a tiebreaker vote cast by House Speaker Mike Johnson.\nThe vote tally on Biggs' amendment stood at 212-212, with prominent Republicans such as Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Majority Whip Tom Emmer, and Texas Representative Dan Crenshaw siding against it. This decision sparked criticism from within the party, with some Republicans expressing concerns over potential violations of Americans' Fourth Amendment rights.\nTexas Representative Troy Nehls condemned the move, labeling it a 'dark day for America' and highlighting past instances of abuse of FISA by the Department of Justice and the FBI. He argued that significant reforms, including a warrant requirement, were necessary to prevent the mass surveillance of the American people.\nFollowing the passage of the FISA reauthorization bill without Biggs' amendment by a vote of 273-147, several conservative Republicans voiced their discontent. Colorado Representative Lauren Boebert warned that the legislation would empower the 'deep state' to violate citizens' rights, echoing concerns raised by fellow Republicans Thomas Massie and Chip Roy.\nFormer President Donald Trump, a vocal critic of FISA, publicly opposed the bill, citing its previous misuse against him and others during his presidential campaign. His opposition influenced Republican House members, who initially voted against advancing the legislation but later agreed to do so after securing concessions from leadership during negotiations.\nThe revised bill extends Section 702 of FISA for two years, a departure from the original five-year plan. FISA, which came under scrutiny in recent years due to its role in authorizing surveillance of Trump's campaign during the 2016 election, has been a contentious issue within conservative circles.\nIn a twist of procedural drama, Republican Florida Representative Anna Paulina Luna intervened, delaying the final vote on the FISA bill without Biggs' amendment until Monday. Her objection prompted further maneuvers on the House floor, prolonging the legislative process. Despite passing through the House, the FISA bill faces uncertainty in the Senate until the delayed vote occurs.",

            "summary": "In early April 1924, Arizona \"pioneers\" gathered over two days in Phoenix for a nostalgia-filled \"reunion\" event sponsored by The Arizona Republican, as this news outlet was then called.\n\"Arizona pioneers grew young again when they gathered in Phoenix yesterday,\" The Republican reported on April 9 about the Fourth Annual Pioneers Reunion. \"Dignified dowagers and serious-minded men forgot the weight of many years and danced the old-time steps to the strains of music produced by a modern orchestra with as much zest and enthusiasm as they ever did in the days of their youth.\"\nTo be considered a \"pioneer\" in 1924, according to The Republican, a settler had to have lived in the state for 35 years or more — 1889 or earlier. The event was not inclusive of Indigenous people. That's clear from a 10-page special section The Republican published after the event's first day. It is filled with tales of Native Americans and white settlers interacting, all presented from the settlers' perspectives.\nReuniongoers registered with The Republican at its offices, which were located in the Heard Building on Central Avenue at Adams Street. More than 1,000 people registered for the 1924 reunion. The earliest pioneer at the event was Asa Wills of Phoenix, who had lived in the area since 1845. The second-earliest present was Tom Sims of Prescott, an 1860 pioneer. Many of the registered pioneers established Arizona residency sometime in the 1870s.\nSetting off from The Republican offices, the pioneers paraded down Central Avenue until they hit the banks of the Salt River. Where there are now industrial parks and a stretch of Interstate 17, there was Riverside Park at the time.\n\"Hundreds of residents of the city generously donated the use of their cars for conveying the pioneers to and from Riverside,\" according to The Republican.\nPioneers enjoyed musical entertainment and \"old-fashioned Down South\" barbecue, according to a contemporary account in The Republican. Square dancing brought many folks out of their seats. \"Old-timers who dance only once a year were as nimble as youths,\" The Republican reported.\nThere was also plenty of time for storytelling. On the second day of the reunion, pioneers met at the Columbia Theater on Adams Street at First Avenue to hear pioneer anecdotes, musical acts, and remarks from Col. James H. McClintock, a Rough Rider for whom Tempe's McClintock High School is named. The Republican billed McClintock as Arizona's \"former state historian.\"\n\"One of the pioneers whom he mentioned in terms of highest praise was Joe Drew, who, he said, erected a tall pole and hung a lighted lantern at its top to guide the desert traveler to his place during the night. This, he said, was called 'the lighthouse in the desert,'\" The Republican recorded McClintock as saying.\nReach the reporter at marcus.reichley@gannett.com.\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Republic archives: 100 years ago, reunion of 'pioneers' in Phoenix",

            "summary": "(Idaho Capital Sun) — Thanks to a series of deadline issues, the responsibility for selecting about 20% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention that normally fell to a broad group of Republicans at the state convention will now be handled by a much smaller executive committee chaired by Idaho Republican Party Chairwoman Dorothy Moon.\nThe delegates will be sent to the July 15 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which is where the Republican Party is expected to officially nominate its candidate for president.\nThe Idaho Republican Party's 17-member executive committee, of which Moon is the chair, is scheduled to confirm the delegates during a meeting at 11 a.m. Saturday at Crane Creek Country Club in Boise, according to two Idaho Republican party officials and documents obtained by the Idaho Capital Sun.\nDorothy Moon In past presidential election cycles, hundreds of Republicans who attended the state convention as state delegates got to vote on selecting the delegates to the national convention.\nPart of the issue is that because the Republican Party does not control the White House, its national convention will be held first this year. The issue arises with Rule 16 from the Rules of the Republican Party. That rule states, in part, that no primary election, caucus or convention for selecting delegates to the national convention shall occur 'less than 45 days before the national convention is scheduled to begin.'\nThe Republican National Convention is scheduled to begin July 15, which means the deadline to select delegates is May 31. The problem is the Idaho GOP Convention doesn't begin until June 13, well after the Republican Party's deadline to name delegates.\nIn a written statement to the Idaho Capital Sun, Moon and Brent Regan, the rules committee chairman, said the Idaho Republican Party made new rules to respond to the deadline issue and is following those new rules.\n'We have gone through a very deliberate process sanctioned by the RNC,' Moon wrote.\nRegan also wrote that Moon will vote only to break a tie on the executive committee and does not have the authority to pick any delegates by herself.\n'The chairman does not have the authority or mechanism to select ANY of the delegates,' Regan wrote, capitalizing the word 'any' to add emphasis. 'A review of party rules will show that whoever claims otherwise is either ignorant or malicious.'\nWhy does it matter who picks delegates for the national GOP convention? Idaho gets 32 delegates at the Republican National Convention this year, and being a delegate is a big deal in political circles. National conventions can feature a roaring, party-like atmosphere that is televised nationally, where delegates would typically cheer on a series of high profile speeches from the party's A-listers and rising stars and then hear directly from the party's nominees for president and vice president.\n'If you like politics, it's a great place to be and be participating,' said Cindy Siddoway, who represents Idaho on the Republican National Committee and has participated in multiple Republican national conventions.\n'It does cost to go, but it is a wonderful opportunity to participate in history,' Siddoway added.\nThe change in selecting delegates is happening as some longtime Republican officials say Moon and her supporters are purging officials from the Republican Party who do not fall in line and agree with them. For example, during the Idaho Republican Party's 2023 summer meeting in Challis, the party stripped executive committee voting rights from the Idaho Federation of Republican Women, the Idaho Young Republicans and the Idaho College Republicans. That's the same executive committee that is being asked to sign off on the new delegates to the Republican National Convention.\nAlthough the Idaho Republican Party's executive committee is going to consider confirming the list of delegates Saturday, two Republican officials – Region Six vice chair Trent Clark, who is a former chairman of the Idaho Republican Party, and Siddoway, told the Sun on Tuesday they have not yet seen the list of delegates.\n'The selection of delegates needs to follow the rules,' Clark said in an interview Tuesday. 'For 137 years we've been having our convention to name our delegates, even before we were a state.'\nSiddoway said she has always known delegates to be picked at the state convention, which she supported.\n'In my knowledge, it has never ever been done this way, but they are trying to meet all of the deadlines,' Siddoway told the Sun.\n'I wish we could have done it through a convention the way we normally do,' Siddoway added.\nSix other Idaho Republican officials expressed concern about the delegate selection issue in a March 26 letter that was sent to Idaho Republican Party Treasurer Steve Bender and obtained by the Sun.\nIn the letter, the six Idaho GOP officials said they have a duty to make an inquiry 'when a problem exists or a report on its face does not make sense,' citing the Idaho attorney general's office's guidance for nonprofit board membership. In their letter, the six officials said the early deadline issue was a topic of a discussion at a January 2023 Republican National Committee meeting held in Dana Point, California, which would have given Moon and Idaho Republican Party officials 18 months to come up with a plan to move up the state primary election and state convention.\n'Several states, and the District of Columbia, consulted with the (Republican National Committee) at the Dana Point meeting to resolve early deadline challenges,' the six GOP officials wrote, before switching to all capital letters in the next sentence. 'WHY DIDN'T IDAHO?'\nThe six Idaho Republicans who signed the letter were state committeewoman Marsha Bjornn from Madison County, state committeewoman Shellie Blanchard from Fremont County, Bannock County Chair Char Tovey, Jefferson County Chair Kaye Field, Caribou County youth committee chair Christin Clark and Clark County Chair Connie Barg.\nIn his written statement Regan, the GOP rules committee chair, said the Idaho Republican Party's state convention is as early as it practically can be. Part of the reason is because of how political parties are made up. The Republican Party's county central committees are responsible for sending delegates to the state convention. But the county central committees are made up of locally elected precinct committeemen, who are elected in the primary election every two years. The date of the primary election is May 21 this year, and there was not enough time to allow the new precinct committeeman to take office, organize at the county central committee level, select delegates to the state convention and have the state convention begin before the May 31 deadline to select delegates for the national convention.\n'We discussed the 45-day (May 31) deadline for submitting delegates with the RNC, but they were unable to accommodate a delay due to the need to conduct background checks and other security measures,' Regan wrote. 'If we miss the deadline we lose all but 12 of our delegates (under) RNC Rule 17a. Clearly, moving the primary and or moving the convention to an earlier date is not practical.'\nWhy is there an early deadline for naming delegates to the Republican National Convention? Most of Idaho's delegates were already picked by former President Donald Trump who Idaho Republican Party officials said won the March 2 Idaho Republican Presidential Caucus.\nRELATED | Donald Trump or Nikki Haley? How Idaho Republicans voted in the presidential caucus\nRELATED | Donald Trump or Nikki Haley? How Idaho Republicans voted in the presidential caucus But the party does get to pick about 20% of the delegates. This year, that includes six delegates that are split between the state's two congressional districts. Normally, those are the delegates that would be selected by a broad group of Republicans at the state convention, if not for the 45-day deadline.\nFor example, the 2021 version of the Idaho Republican Party's rules states that the remaining 20% of delegates are selected by the nominating committee at the Idaho State Republican Convention, where they are voted on on the floor.\nIdaho state law also states that at the state party conventions, each political party may 'in the year of presidential elections … elect delegates to the national convention in the manner prescribed by national party rules …'\nBut faced with the deadline issue, the Idaho Republican Party's state central committee changed its rules for nominating delegates instead of pushing for an earlier primary election and an earlier state convention to meet the 45-day deadline.\nThe latest version of the Idaho Republican Party's rules, adopted in January, says that rather than selecting the remaining 20% of delegates at the convention, the nominations committee of the Idaho Republican Party will select the delegates, which 'shall be confirmed at a special meeting of the executive committee.' The new rule also states the Idaho Republican Party chairman, who is Moon, will serve as the delegation chairman responsible for sending the list of delegates, alternates and guests to Republican national party headquarters by the deadlines unless the delegation selects a different chairman based on a majority vote.\nWe hope you appreciated this story.

            "excerpt": "Known for holding a grudge, the former president is continuing his revenge tour with his first endorsement against a Republican incumbent this election cycle.",
            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump has continued his revenge tour during the 2024 election cycle as he endorsed a primary challenger to Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-WA), one of the two remaining Republicans who voted to impeach him in 2021.\nLate Friday afternoon, Trump sent out a Truth Social post endorsing Newhouse's primary opponent, Jerrod Sessler, calling him 'MAGA all the way' and making clear this endorsement is because Newhouse voted to impeach him following the Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.\n'He is running against a weak and pathetic RINO named Newhouse, who voted to, for no reason, Impeach me. Newhouse has to go!' Trump said in his post.\nTrump is known for holding a grudge and does not easily forget when people act in a way he views as 'disloyal.' He often rails against them on his social media site and, at times, endorses them in hopes of forcing them out of office.\nThis is Trump's first endorsement against a Republican incumbent this election cycle. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) had worked overtime to ensure that Trump supported even the most moderate incumbents as Republicans tried to retain control of the House. Their efforts had been mostly successful, but they clearly fell short when it came to Newhouse.\nThis appears to be just the latest example of Trump trying to exact revenge against those who voted to impeach him. In the 2022 cycle, the former president used his political capital to successfully try and oust each Republican who voted to impeach him. Some opted to retire instead of facing a heated primary, others lost their re-election bid, and only two survived—Newhouse and Rep. David Valadao (R-CA).\nValadao advanced to the general election this cycle, and Trump did not endorse his Republican challenger. However, the same cannot be said for Newhouse, who represents a safer seat for Republicans than Valadao.\nNewhouse's opponent, Sessler, is a NASCAR driver and a Navy veteran who has never held political office. In 2022, he attempted to primary Newhouse but fell short, receiving only 12.3 percent of the vote.\nSessler has labeled Newhouse an 'impeacher' and has run on him not being loyal to Trump. He has tried to cast himself as the 'American First candidate' and as the only Republican in the race who would support Trump.\nWhile Trump's endorsement carries a lot of weight in Republican primaries, it does not guarantee Sessler will win. In 2022, Trump endorsed Loren Culp, a Republican attempting to primary Newhouse. Culp only amassed 21.6 percent of the vote and failed to advance to the general election.\nIn Washington, the elections are not divided into partisan primaries. Rather, they are what is known as 'jungle primaries,' where Democrats and Republicans run on the same ticket, and the top two advance regardless of party affiliation. This could result in a Republican versus Republican general election.\n'Jerrod Sessler is not a real conservative, and he has no business representing this district; he's not a serious person,' one GOP operative told The Daily Beast.\nRepresentatives for Newhouse and Sessler did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

            "excerpt": "Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, who helped negotiate the Senate's bipartisan border deal, has a message for his party as the November election nears.",
            "summary": "One key Democrat believes his party must correct course on how it communicates with Americans about the U.S.-Mexico border challenge or risk ceding the issue to Republicans as the November election nears.\nSenator Chris Murphy of Connecticut played a crucial role in negotiating a bipartisan deal to reform America's asylum system, reduce the millions of cases mired in immigration court backlog and bolster enforcement at the border, among other issues.\nHis February bill, negotiated with Republican Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma and independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, secured the endorsements of the Border Patrol's union, the Chamber of Commerce and the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial board.\nHowever, former President Donald Trump has been positioning border security as arguably his campaign's top issue. When time came for the Senate to pass the bill, Trump made it clear to Republicans that he did not want to see it pass, and they withheld their support.\n\"It's incumbent upon us to repeat the truth that Republicans don't care about the border; they killed a bill that would have fixed the border,\" Murphy told Newsweek. \"I think it would be a big mistake for us as a party to not talk about immigration, given that they have gifted us with an ability to get on the offense.\"\nDemocratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on February 6.

Murphy has been among his party's loudest messengers regarding Republicans' role in killing a bipartisan border deal.\nMore Kent Nishimura for The Washington Post via Getty Images\nMurphy is concerned that his party hasn't repeated that message enough to the point that it's \"burned in with voters.\" He believes Democrats could significantly reframe the issue if they speak about their party's solution and juxtapose it with the message of Republicans wanting to politicize the issue without offering solutions.\nPolling suggests that Murphy may be right. On Thursday, congressional-focused outlet Punchbowl News published the results of a poll commissioned by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the body tasked with ensuring Democrats take the House.\nThe poll, conducted from March 5 to March 10 of more than 1,000 likely voters across 63 battleground districts, found that 33 percent of respondents said they couldn't support a candidate who didn't share their views on immigration.\nWhen asked whether they preferred a Democrat supporting stricter immigration enforcement and immigration reform over a Republican advocating for a border wall and aggressive deportation of undocumented migrants, the Democrat won 51 percent to 44 percent among voters, the poll found.\nYet, for now, they appear weak on the issue. The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research released a poll last week that found nearly half of adults blame President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats for the border strife as opposed to 41 percent pinning it on Republicans in Congress.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection has seen a record number of crossings under Biden's tenure, with encounters between the agency and migrants clocking in at 1.15 million in financial year 2024 alone. Republicans believe voters will hold Democrats accountable and won't take issue with the GOP for opposing the bipartisan deal, a measure that most Republicans condemned for not going far enough.\n\"Joe Biden and Senate Democrats have spent years opening the border and now that American cities are being crushed by their policies, they're trying to pretend it never happened,\" Philip Letsou, spokesman for the National Republican Senate Committee (NRSC), told Newsweek in a statement. \"Voters know the truth and won't buy [Senate Democratic Leader Chuck] Schumer's spin.\"\nNRSC Chairman Steve Daines—the Montana senator who's responsible for ensuring Republicans flip the upper chamber—has made the border a focus of his speeches during weekly Senate GOP leadership press conferences.\nRepublicans argue that the Biden administration has failed to enforce laws, with some lawmakers arguing that it has done so intentionally. The administration holds the position that current laws are not sufficient to address 21st century migration patterns. Newsweek contacted the White House for comment.\nSenator Gary Peters of Michigan, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, rejects these claims from the GOP. Like Murphy, he believes voters must understand Republicans' role in bucking the bipartisan deal. He urges his peers to tell this story as they defend control of the upper chamber in November.\n\"We've been working to solve the problem,\" Peters told Newsweek. \"We had a bipartisan agreement, and Republicans don't want to solve the problem and they walked away—people need to know that.\"",

            "summary": "A pair of retired deputies will face the current sheriff's wife in the June Republican primary for York County's top law enforcement job.\nYet by Wednesday, there could be more.\nRepublican candidates have until Wednesday to file for York County sheriff after the county party reopened filing earlier this week. Multiple candidates means the possibility of a runoff after the June 11 Republican primary.\nIf no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote plus one on June 11, there would be a runoff of the top two vote-getters on June 25, said Alan Helms, York County Voter Registration and Elections director.\nThere is no limit to the number of Republican candidates who can file provided they meet the legal qualifications for the office, Helms said.\nThree Republicans had filed as of Friday at 5 p.m. when the elections office closed, according to Helms and the S.C. Election Commission Website that tracks candidates statewide. No Democrat or anyone from another party filed for sheriff during regular filing March 16 through April 1.\nThe general election is Nov. 5.\nRepublican filing was reopened because current Republican Sheriff Kevin Tolson filed for the seat March 18, but withdrew from the race after his wife, Beth Bryant Tolson, filed as a Republican for the seat on the last day of filing on April 1. That left her as the one candidate, and South Carolina law allowed the party to reopen filing.\nThe public and several area elected Republicans pressured York County Republican Party leaders to reopen filing.\nChris Blevins became an official candidate Friday afternoon, a day after Heath Clevenger filed. Both Blevins and Clevenger recently retired as lieutenants after more than 25 years of service.\nBlevins' filing Friday came after his campaign signs were already put up Thursday throughout York County. Blevins, 52, has operated businesses since he retired.\nThe Herald first reported Monday that Clevenger was running even before the county Republicans re-opened filing in a vote by party leaders Tuesday night. Clevenger, 47, officially filed as a Republican Thursday.\nBeth Tolson remains a candidate. The Herald was first to report her candidacy on April 1, and that Kevin Tolson was withdrawing from the race. She has more than 30 years experience in law enforcement, and is the daughter of former sheriff Bruce Bryant.\nThe sheriff is paid an annual salary of $209,260.83. The sheriff runs the county jail and has more than 300 employees in law enforcement and detention.\nThe sheriff's office is separate from municipal police departments in Rock Hill, Fort Mill, York, Clover, and Tega Cay, and has countywide jurisdiction. York County has almost 300,000 residents.\nIn South Carolina, any registered voter can vote in one party primary in the county where they live. South Carolina voters do not register to vote as Republican, Democrat or unaffiliated as voters do in North Carolina and some other states.\nFiling for the Republican nomination for sheriff ends Wednesday at noon. Other current and retired law enforcement officials have been talked about as potential candidates by party members.\nThe filing fee for sheriff is $7,770.43. The sheriff must have at least five years of law enforcement experience to hold the office under state law. The sheriff elected in November will take office in early 2025.\nKevin Tolson was first elected sheriff in 2016 and re-elected in 2020. He told The Herald on April 1 he plans to serve out the rest of his term before taking a job with a non-profit that assists first responders and law enforcement across the country.",

            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump has continued his revenge tour during the 2024 election cycle as he endorsed a primary challenger to Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-WA), one of the two remaining Republicans who voted to impeach him in 2021.\nLate Friday afternoon, Trump sent out a Truth Social post endorsing Newhouse's primary opponent, Jerrod Sessler, calling him 'MAGA all the way' and making clear this endorsement is because Newhouse voted to impeach him following the Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.\n'He is running against a weak and pathetic RINO named Newhouse, who voted to, for no reason, Impeach me. Newhouse has to go!' Trump said in his post.\nTrump is known for holding a grudge and does not easily forget when people act in a way he views as 'disloyal.' He often rails against them on his social media site and, at times, endorses them in hopes of forcing them out of office.\nThis is Trump's first endorsement against a Republican incumbent this election cycle. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) had worked overtime to ensure that Trump supported even the most moderate incumbents as Republicans tried to retain control of the House. Their efforts had been mostly successful, but they clearly fell short when it came to Newhouse.\nTrump Bond's Cayman Connection ‘Stinks to High Heaven'\nThis appears to be just the latest example of Trump trying to exact revenge against those who voted to impeach him. In the 2022 cycle, the former president used his political capital to successfully try and oust each Republican who voted to impeach him. Some opted to retire instead of facing a heated primary, others lost their re-election bid, and only two survived—Newhouse and Rep. David Valadao (R-CA).\nValadao advanced to the general election this cycle, and Trump did not endorse his Republican challenger. However, the same cannot be said for Newhouse, who represents a safer seat for Republicans than Valadao.\nNewhouse's opponent, Sessler, is a NASCAR driver and a Navy veteran who has never held political office. In 2022, he attempted to primary Newhouse but fell short, receiving only 12.3 percent of the vote.\nSessler has labeled Newhouse an 'impeacher' and has run on him not being loyal to Trump. He has tried to cast himself as the 'American First candidate' and as the only Republican in the race who would support Trump.\nWhile Trump's endorsement carries a lot of weight in Republican primaries, it does not guarantee Sessler will win. In 2022, Trump endorsed Loren Culp, a Republican attempting to primary Newhouse. Culp only amassed 21.6 percent of the vote and failed to advance to the general election.\nIn Washington, the elections are not divided into partisan primaries. Rather, they are what is known as 'jungle primaries,' where Democrats and Republicans run on the same ticket, and the top two advance regardless of party affiliation. This could result in a Republican versus Republican general election.\n'Jerrod Sessler is not a real conservative, and he has no business representing this district; he's not a serious person,' one GOP operative told The Daily Beast.\nRepresentatives for Newhouse and Sessler did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

            "excerpt": "Campaign toils to convince Republicans to vote early, crucial to winning the election, while ensuring they don't annoy Trump",
            "summary": "Donald Trump's attacks on mail-in voting have increasingly caused heartburn for the Trump 2024 campaign as they attempt to undo the self-sabotage by ramping up operations in key battleground states encouraging Republicans to vote early and by mail ahead of the presidential election.\nThe former US president has continued his crusade in recent months: in December he called for the end of mail-in voting entirely, before claiming in an interview last month that 'any time the mail is involved, you're going to have cheating'.\nTrump's attacks are complicating efforts at the Trump campaign to convince Republicans to vote early, which advisers know is crucial to win the election given Democratic voters have no qualms about voting by mail or organizing ballot initiatives and have given their party a major advantage.\nJust 28% of Republicans support allowing any voter to cast a ballot by mail, compared with 84% of Democrats, according to a study in February by the Pew Research Center. A large part of that thinking, sources close to Trump concede, has been driven by the former president's criticism of early voting.\nThe problem has become multi-faceted, sources familiar with the situation say. The Trump campaign needs to convince Republicans who believe Trump's every word that they can discount his fearmongering, while ensuring they do not anger Trump by undercutting his position.\nIn essence, the Trump campaign has the delicate task of persuading Republican voters to participate in early voting methods that Trump has falsely said were the reason why there was rampant fraud in the 2020 election that meant he lost to Joe Biden.\nThe undertaking is made difficult by the fact that Trump's voters typically take him at his word. The fear instilled in them of early voting means that Trump and down-ballot Republican candidates are far more at the mercy of election day problems like bad weather, long lines or voting machine issues.\nAt the same time, Trump advisers are spending time trying to make sure they do not appear like they are trying to control the former president or are deliberately trying to undermine him – perceptions he particularly hates.\nThe internal concern at the campaign, the sources suggested, is not wanting to aggravate Trump could ultimately mean that efforts to push early voting and mail-in voting are not managed or pursued as aggressively by the top levels of the campaign for fear of incurring Trump's fury.\nA Trump spokesperson did not directly comment on Thursday but said Trump's position is that Republicans need to use early voting initiatives because Democrats are, even if in an ideal world, there would be no early voting for either party. The spokesperson added that Trump encouraged voters to turn out early in town-halls and video messages, especially during the Republican primaries.\nStill, Trump's logic on canceling mail-in voting has never been clear. If Democrats supposedly used mail-in voting to steal the election, it would make little sense to rail against the use of mail-in voting and convince Republicans to abandon the practice.\nThe available data on early voting, which was popular among Democrats and Republicans until the 2020 election, also shows that the practice is enormously effective and efficient for presidential campaigns in turning out their base.\nThe benefits of 'banking' votes are many: campaigns don't have to spend time and resources chasing their voters and reminding them to cast their ballot if they already have done so, freeing up resources, and ensuring high-propensity voters aren't lost due to unforeseen problems on election day.\nRepublican strategists have separately warned the Trump campaign privately that having aggressive early voting and mail-in voting operations in key battleground states could decide the outcome of the election, particularly in Arizona and Georgia.\nIn the 2020 election, when many Americans voted by mail because of the Covid pandemic, 7 million more Democrats than Republicans voted early in the 20 states that compile party data, the United States Elections Project found. In the 2022 midterms, 2 million more Democrats than Republicans voted early in 24 states.\nIn both years, Republican candidates lost narrowly to Democratic opponents, including when the Republican candidate for Arizona governor, Kari Lake, lost to the Democratic candidate, Katie Hobbs, by about 17,000 votes. Meanwhile, about 19,000 more Democrats than Republicans voted by mail.\nTo undo the damage done by Trump, the campaign is ramping its efforts telling Maga voters to cast their ballot early through a blitz of television ads, door knocking and mailing flyers, among other initiatives including the RNC's Bank Your Vote program that was shelved then restarted.\nThe Trump campaign is also expected to rely on adjacent groups to help with get-out-the-vote measures. Turning Point USA, a far-right Trump group that slammed mail-in voting, recently created a $108m Chase the Vote program to convince Maga voters who trust the group to vote early.\nBut the pitch to Republican voters will always be hobbled by Trump's own remarks, one of the sources conceded, and may have to make the false argument that the only way to combat Democratic cheating is to cheat themselves – even if the premise of the argument itself was false.",

            "excerpt": "In battleground election year, Republican Party of Wisconsin hires Andrew Iverson as executive director",
            "summary": "MADISON — The Republican Party of Wisconsin has hired Andrew Iverson, an operative with experience on Wisconsin-based campaigns and the Republican National Committee, as its executive director as the party's national convention in Milwaukee approaches.\nIverson, a Wisconsin native, most recently served as regional political director for the RNC. He has also held roles as state director for the Trump Victory (a joint operation of the RNC and former President Donald Trump's campaign) and on the campaigns of U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil. He is a graduate of Wisconsin Lutheran College.\n\"I am thrilled to bring Andrew on board as our new executive director. His wide breadth of experience and ability will prove crucial for us winning in November,\" said RPW chairman Brian Schimming in a statement. \"Wisconsin will decide the 2024 race. Andrew Iverson is the right man for the job in this pivotal election.\"\nIverson will step into a role most recently held by Mark Jefferson, who stepped down in February and took over as executive director of the Tavern League of Wisconsin in March. The executive director is responsible for the party's day-to-day operations.\nAppointed executive director of the party for the second time in early 2019, Jefferson presided over Wisconsin Republicans during some of their more tumultuous times. The party became divided over challenges to the 2020 election, and it drew national attention when 10 Wisconsin Republicans, including the party's then-chairman, signed false paperwork claiming to be electors for former President Donald Trump. Jefferson at the time privately expressed concerns about the plan.\nIn his role with Trump Victory, Iverson made headlines when The Associated Press reported on an audio recording of a post-election strategy session.\n'At the end of the day, this operation received more votes than any other Republican in Wisconsin history,' Iverson said in the recording. 'Say what you want, our operation turned out Republican or DJT supporters. Democrats just got 20,000 more than us, out of Dane County and other shenanigans in Milwaukee, Green Bay and Dane. There's a lot that people can learn from this campaign.'\nIverson's hiring comes about three months before the Republican National Convention is set to take place in Milwaukee from July 15-18.\nBoth parties have Wisconsin in focus as Trump challenges Democratic President Joe Biden — a rematch of the 2020 election, in which Biden carried Wisconsin by a margin of about 20,000 votes. The battleground state will also have a high-profile Senate race as Republican businessman Eric Hovde takes on Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, helping determine the balance of power in the Senate, along with the first legislative races under the state's newly redrawn maps.\n'Wisconsin is the cornerstone of the Republican Party's chances this November,' Iverson said in a statement. 'I am eager to get to work on behalf of all of our candidates to take back the White House and usher in a new era of conservative leadership.'\nJessie Opoien can be reached at jessie.opoien@jrn.com.\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Wisconsin Republican Party names Andrew Iverson executive director",

The event was not inclusive of Indigenous people. That's clear from a 10-page special section The Republican published after the event's first day. It is filled with tales of Native Americans and white settlers interacting, all presented from the settlers' perspectives.\nReuniongoers registered with The Republican at its offices, which were located in the Heard Building on Central Avenue at Adams Street. More than 1,000 people registered for the 1924 reunion. The earliest pioneer at the event was Asa Wills of Phoenix, who had lived in the area since 1845. The second-earliest present was Tom Sims of Prescott, an 1860 pioneer. Many of the registered pioneers established Arizona residency sometime in the 1870s.\nSetting off from The Republican offices, the pioneers paraded down Central Avenue until they hit the banks of the Salt River. Where there are now industrial parks and a stretch of Interstate 17, there was Riverside Park at the time.\n\"Hundreds of residents of the city generously donated the use of their cars for conveying the pioneers to and from Riverside,\" according to The Republican.\nPioneers enjoyed musical entertainment and \"old-fashioned Down South\" barbecue, according to a contemporary account in The Republican. Square dancing brought many folks out of their seats. \"Old-timers who dance only once a year were as nimble as youths,\" The Republican reported.\nThere was also plenty of time for storytelling. On the second day of the reunion, pioneers met at the Columbia Theater on Adams Street at First Avenue to hear pioneer anecdotes, musical acts, and remarks from Col. James H. McClintock, a Rough Rider for whom Tempe's McClintock High School is named. The Republican billed McClintock as Arizona's \"former state historian.\"\n\"One of the pioneers whom he mentioned in terms of highest praise was Joe Drew, who, he said, erected a tall pole and hung a lighted lantern at its top to guide the desert traveler to his place during the night. This, he said, was called 'the lighthouse in the desert,'\" The Republican recorded McClintock as saying.\nReach the reporter at marcus.reichley@gannett.com .\nReach the reporter at marcus.reichley@gannett.com .",

By comparison, just 43% of Republicans living in states with split control – and only 22% of Republicans living in states with Democratic leadership – have a positive view,' Pew found.

            "summary": "MAGA Republican traitors, or as Forbes calls them 'Russia-friendly Republicans,' are doing everything they can for Russia at a critical time. The Republican traitors' blocking of weapons to Ukraine has created an opening for the Russians that they have been and will continue to use to their advantage. It's sick and demented what Republicans have done. Reagan is rolling over and over in his grave.\nThe MAGA traitors are hoping the Russians will again help them win the next presidential election. The regular Republicans are wringing their bloody hands because they know EXACTLY what is going on: blocking weapon shipments to Ukraine so Trump can get help from Russia.\nIt SHOULD go down in history as the worst treason in history but…. history gets written by the victors and Russia's puppets could win in 2024 and try to end democracy, using Russian anocracy as their template. So I guess we'll see….\nThe Clock Is Ticking: Russia Has A One-Year Reserve Of Weapons\nAs Russia's wider war on Ukraine grinds into its third year, three main dynamics are shaping the battlefield.\nFirst: Russia is fully mobilized—politically, industrially and militarily. But this mobilization is depleting resources the Kremlin can't renew. Most importantly, stocks of old Cold War-vintage weapons.\nIn other words, Russia is strong, but fragile.\nSecond: Ukraine is mobilizing, too, but it still relies on foreign aid to meet urgent financial and military needs—and Russia-friendly Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives are withholding a decisive portion of that aid.\nHere at Daily Kos, RO37 explained the situation with Russia running out of soviet-era weapons. All Republicans have to do it get out of the way so Ukraine can stop this war from spreading across Europe and the rest of the world.\n'All Johnson has to do is bring to a vote an overwhelmingly popular bill that would send $60 billion in aid to Ukraine.'",

Chris Sununu (R) said he supports former President Trump despite believing he 'contributed' to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.\nSununu went back and forth with co-anchor George Stephanopoulos on ABC's 'This Week' on Sunday to explain why he is backing Trump despite condemning his actions leading up to Jan. 6. Stephanopoulos pressed Sununu on his statement released after the Jan. 6 attacks that stated Trump's 'rhetoric and actions contributed to the insurrection.'\nSununu, who has endorsed Trump, said Sunday that he stood by his statement.\n'I think he — his actions absolutely contributed to that. There's no question about that. I hate the election denialism of 2020. Nobody wants to be talking about that in 2024,' he said.\nHe said that while he believes Trump 'contributed' to the attack, he is backing Trump to elect a Republican to the White House.\n'Because for me, it's not about him as much as it is having a Republican administration — Republican secretaries, Republican rules, a sense where states' rights come first, individual rights come first, parents' rights come first,' he said.\n'It's not about Trump with me,' he added.\nSununu supported former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley (R) during the Republican presidential primaries before she dropped out of the race last month. He has frequently criticized the former president and said last year that he would work to narrow the 2024 GOP field in an effort to defeat Trump.\nStephanopoulos continued to press Sununu on his support for the former president on Sunday.\n'And you believe that someone — you believe that a president who contributed to an insurrection should be president again?' he asked.\n'As does 51 percent of America, George. I mean, really,' Sununu responded. 'I understand you're part of the media. I understand you're in this New York City bubble or whatever it is, but you've got to look around what's happening across this country. They're not — it's not about just supporting Trump. It's getting rid of what we have today.'\nSununu later reiterated that it is about the party ticket, not Trump.\n'I know you're shocked that the Republican governor is supporting a Republican president and the Republican ticket, but it's about the ticket. It's about up and down the ballot, right?' he said.\n'I want Republican governors and senators and congressmen, and that type of culture, if you will. I keep going back to that because that's exactly what it is. That's the change America is looking for,' he added.",

            "summary": "DENVER (KDVR) — Some prominent Colorado Republicans are calling for the state's party chair to step down, accusing him of bending the rules to advance his own agenda.\nColorado GOP Chair Dave Williams is a former state lawmaker from Colorado Springs who is now running for Congress to replace Doug Lamborn, who's retiring.\nOver the weekend, a journalist from The Colorado Sun was removed from the Colorado GOP assembly because Williams thinks her reporting is unfair. That upset a lot of people, including Republican state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, who called the move 'disgusting.'\nThen, Williams decided Colorado Republicans are endorsing Lauren Boebert in the race to replace former U.S. Rep. Ken Buck. In the past, endorsements have been saved for after primaries.\nAnother Republican candidate in that 4th Congressional District race, Richard Holtorf, called for Williams to be investigated for possible ethics and election law violations.\nWilliams released a statement to ' Colorado Point of View ' in response.\n'We make no apologies for kicking out a fake journalist, who actually snuck into our event, because her publication is just an extension of the Democrat Party's PR efforts, and the only backlash we see is from the fake news media, radical Democrats, and establishment RINOs who hate our conservative base and who always look for opportunities to boot lick the crooked press or pundits who hate true Republicans and President Trump.'\nDave Williams\nUnder Williams' leadership, are Republican voters in Colorado getting a fair chance to weigh in on elections? ' Colorado Point of View ' asked Republican and Democratic analysts this week.\n'Absolutely not,' Democratic analyst Andy Boian said.\n'There are competitive congressional seats, there are competitive state legislative seats that Dave Williams has a direct effect on when he speaks like this, and every time the chairman speaks — of either party — people listen,' Boian said. 'And in this case, when Dave Williams spoke and when he continues to speak, people listen and they vote accordingly, and it helps us.'\n'I think ultimately they will have these people in front of them,' Republican analyst Michael Fields said. 'In order to vote in the primary, they will have a say in that. But again, Republicans only make up 24% of the electorate right now. You need to get to 51(%) in order to win elections. So you need unity, you need people working together. You need to be on the same team. And I think going after fellow Republicans is not the way to build a winning coalition come November.'\nWatch the full conversation this week on 'Colorado Point of View. It airs at 7:30 p.m. Saturday and again at 7:30 a.m. Sunday on Colorado's Very Own Channel 2.",

            "excerpt": "Primary voters will soon cast ballots in narrowly divided Pennsylvania. The state is sure to be a presidential battleground in the fall.",
            "summary": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The two parties in Pennsylvania's state House and its congressional delegation are nearly evenly divided, and that won't change once results are in from next week's primary election.\nBut come November, the candidates the parties will select April 23 for hundreds of legislative seats could alter what has been years of policy paralysis in Harrisburg and the similar partisan deadlock in Congress.\nThe state's voters will also cast primary ballots for this year's marquee contests for president and U.S. Senate. Democratic incumbents Joe Biden and Bob Casey and Republican challengers Donald Trump and Dave McCormick are shoo-ins to appear on the fall ballot.\nBoth parties will pick candidates for state attorney general, which was in Republican hands before Democrats went on a winning streak starting in 2012.\nIn the two other statewide 'row office' contests, Republicans Stacy Garrity, the treasurer, and Tim DeFoor, the auditor general, will find out which Democrats will try to unseat them in the fall.\nGENERAL ASSEMBLY\nIt took months and several special elections before Democrats were able to nail down their return to majority control of the state House last year, elevating one of their own to speaker in a chamber where the partisan breakdown is now 102-100. One seat, in a Poconos district where a Republican resigned in February, is vacant and will be filled by special election on primary day.\nWith the entire chamber on the ballot this year, Republicans would love to flip it back, denying Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro legislative leverage in policy and budget battles.\nIn the state Senate, where Republicans hold a 28-22 majority, Democrats would need to flip at least three seats in order for Democratic Lt. Gov. Austin Davis' tie-breaking vote to give them control.\nAmong the 25 Senate seats up this year, nearly half the total, or 12 incumbent senators, face no opponents this year.\nThere are contested Senate primaries in both parties for notable vacancies in a Republican-held seat in the Harrisburg area and a Democratic-held seat in Pittsburgh. The third vacancy is a Republican majority district in northern York County.\nLEGISLATIVE SHAKEUP\nDemocratic Rep. Nick Pisciottano, of Allegheny County, is leaving the House to run, along with two other Democrats and two Republicans, for a state Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Jim Brewster, D-Allegheny.\nRep. Dawn Keefer, R-York, is departing the lower chamber in a run to succeed retiring Sen. Mike Regan, R-York. Another House departure is Rep. Patty Kim, of Dauphin County, facing off against another Democrat for the nomination in the third Senate district involving a retirement, that of Sen. John DiSanto, R-Dauphin. Two Republicans also are vying to succeed DiSanto.\nDiSanto's seat is widely seen as the Senate Democrats' best chance for a pickup. Their longshot bid for the majority also likely would require beating Sen. Dan Laughlin, R-Erie, and Sen. Devlin Robinson, a first-term Republican whose district surrounds the western side of Pittsburgh.\nSen. Dave Argall, of Schuylkill County, who heads the GOP's Senate campaign effort, said a razor-close win for Brewster four years ago makes that a battleground, but their efforts to stay in the majority are wider.\n'There are going to be battles all across the state, but it's still pretty early to predict which ones are going to rise to the top of the list,' Argall said.\nLawmakers in nearly half of the 203 House seats, and slightly more Democrats than Republicans, have no primary or General Election opponents this year and can plan on serving another term starting in January.\nThere aren't many House vacancies this cycle: just nine seats held by Republicans and four by Democrats. Retiring members include Berks County Rep. Mark Rozzi, who spent a brief but notable time as House speaker early last year before fellow Democrats could muster the votes to elect their first choice to lead the chamber, Speaker Joanna McClinton of Philadelphia.\nReps. Ryan Mackenzie, of Lehigh County, and Rob Mercuri, of Allegheny, are relinquishing House seats to run in Republican primaries for Democratic-held congressional seats. Hedging their bets are Rep. Ryan Bizzarro, of Erie, and Rep. Jared Solomon, of Philadelphia, seeking reelection in the state House and running in Democratic primaries for state treasurer and state attorney general, respectively.\nCONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION\nAll 17 of Pennsylvania's incumbent members of the U.S. House of Representatives are running for another term, each with at least one opponent in the primary or fall elections. Court-ordered redistricting after the 2020 Census produced a 9-8 Democratic edge, and when the incumbents ran for reelection two years ago, all 17 were reelected.\nIn Allegheny County, freshman U.S. Rep. Summer Lee has a Democratic primary opponent, Bhavini Patel, as well as a Republican positioned to take on the Democratic winner in November.\nIn a district Democrats hope to flip, a race north of Philadelphia could signal how much power the abortion issue has in the suburbs. U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a centrist Republican, has a primary opponent whose anti-abortion position would not permit exceptions for rape or incest.\nThere is a three-way GOP primary for the nomination to take on Lehigh Valley Democratic U.S. Rep. Susan Wild in the fall. Wild's previous two wins were by single-digit margins. Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Democrat from the Scranton area who also has been repeatedly targeted in recent years, has no primary opponent, but a Republican looks to challenge him in November.\nSix Democrats are on the primary ballot in a district held by U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, a York County Republican who was deeply involved in efforts by then-President Donald Trump to overturn Trump's 2020 election defeat. Perry's prominent role in the ultra-right Freedom Caucus in Congress and some close reelection contests over the past six years also are making him a target for Democrats this year.\nSTATEWIDE ROW OFFICES\nAfter Shapiro's election as governor two years ago created a vacancy in his former job as state attorney general, he nominated his protege, Michelle Henry, to serve through the end of this year. She is not seeking to stay in the job.\nFive Democrats are running for the nomination: Philadelphia attorney Keir Bradford-Grey, former auditor general and state Rep. Eugene DePasquale, of Allegheny County, former prosecutor and Bucks County solicitor Joe Khan, Philadelphia state Rep. Jared Solomon and Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer.\nTwo Republicans are running: York County District Attorney Dave Sunday and state Rep. Craig Williams, of Delaware County. Sunday received his party's endorsement, while Williams has been helping lead House Republicans' efforts to remove from office progressive Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat.\nFor auditor general, state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, of Philadelphia, and Lehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley are the Democrats seeking to run against DeFoor in November. Kenyatta finished third in the Democratic U.S. Senate primary in 2022 won by John Fetterman.\nGarrity, the state treasurer, has no opposition in the GOP primary. Democratic voters will choose between Bizzarro and Erin McClelland, an addiction recovery and human services professional from Allegheny County.",

            "summary": "New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R) said he supports former President Trump despite believing he 'contributed' to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\nSununu went back and forth with co-anchor George Stephanopoulos on ABC's 'This Week' on Sunday to explain why he is backing Trump despite condemning his actions leading up to Jan. 6. Stephanopoulos pressed Sununu on his statement released after the Jan. 6 attacks that stated Trump's 'rhetoric and actions contributed to the insurrection.'\nSununu, who has endorsed Trump, said Sunday that he stood by his statement.\n'I think he — his actions absolutely contributed to that. There's no question about that. I hate the election denialism of 2020. Nobody wants to be talking about that in 2024,' he said.\nHe said that while he believes Trump 'contributed' to the attack, he is backing Trump to elect a Republican to the White House.\n'Because for me, it's not about him as much as it is having a Republican administration — Republican secretaries, Republican rules, a sense where states' rights come first, individual rights come first, parents' rights come first,' he said.\n'It's not about Trump with me,' he added.\nSununu supported former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley during the Republican presidential primaries before she dropped out of the race last month. He has frequently criticized the former president and said last year he would work to narrow the 2024 GOP field in an effort to defeat Trump.\nStephanopoulos continued to press Sununu on his support for the former president on Sunday.\n'And you believe that someone — you believe that a president who contributed to an insurrection should be president again?' he asked.\n'As does 51 percent of America, George. I mean, really,' Sununu responded. 'I understand you're part of the media. I understand you're in this New York City bubble or whatever it is, but you've got to look around what's happening across this country. They're not — it's not about just supporting Trump. It's getting rid of what we have today.'\nSununu later reiterated that it is about the party ticket, not Trump.\n'I know you're shocked that the Republican governor is supporting a Republican president and the Republican ticket, but it's about the ticket. It's about up and down the ballot, right?' he said.\n'I want Republican governors and senators and congressmen, and that type of culture, if you will. I keep going back to that because that's exactly what it is. That's the change America is looking for,' he added.\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.",

            "summary": "DENVER (KDVR) — Some prominent Colorado Republicans are calling for the state's party chair to step down, accusing him of bending the rules to advance his own agenda.\nColorado GOP Chair Dave Williams is a former state lawmaker from Colorado Springs who is now running for Congress to replace Doug Lamborn, who's retiring.\nOver the weekend, a journalist from The Colorado Sun was removed from the Colorado GOP assembly because Williams thinks her reporting is unfair. That upset a lot of people, including Republican state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, who called the move 'disgusting.'\nThen, Williams decided Colorado Republicans are endorsing Lauren Boebert in the race to replace former U.S. Rep. Ken Buck. In the past, endorsements have been saved for after primaries.\nAnother Republican candidate in that 4th Congressional District race, Richard Holtorf, called for Williams to be investigated for possible ethics and election law violations.\nWilliams released a statement to 'Colorado Point of View' in response.\n'We make no apologies for kicking out a fake journalist, who actually snuck into our event, because her publication is just an extension of the Democrat Party's PR efforts, and the only backlash we see is from the fake news media, radical Democrats, and establishment RINOs who hate our conservative base and who always look for opportunities to boot lick the crooked press or pundits who hate true Republicans and President Trump.'\nDave Williams\nUnder Williams' leadership, are Republican voters in Colorado getting a fair chance to weigh in on elections? 'Colorado Point of View' asked Republican and Democratic analysts this week.\n'Absolutely not,' Democratic analyst Andy Boian said.\n'There are competitive congressional seats, there are competitive state legislative seats that Dave Williams has a direct effect on when he speaks like this, and every time the chairman speaks — of either party — people listen,' Boian said. 'And in this case, when Dave Williams spoke and when he continues to speak, people listen and they vote accordingly, and it helps us.'\nLawsuit alleges Democratic Party nominee may be ineligible to run\n'I think ultimately they will have these people in front of them,' Republican analyst Michael Fields said. 'In order to vote in the primary, they will have a say in that. But again, Republicans only make up 24% of the electorate right now. You need to get to 51(%) in order to win elections. So you need unity, you need people working together. You need to be on the same team. And I think going after fellow Republicans is not the way to build a winning coalition come November.'\nWatch the full conversation this week on 'Colorado Point of View. It airs at 7:30 p.m. Saturday and again at 7:30 a.m. Sunday on Colorado's Very Own Channel 2.\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to FOX31 Denver.",

            "summary": "By David Morgan and Nathan Layne\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump is due to make a public appearance with embattled U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson on Friday, in a bid to demonstrate unity as the chamber's new leader struggles to wrangle his thin and fractious majority.\nJohnson gained the speaker's gavel in a weeks-long October nominating battle after a handful of House Republican hardliners orchestrated the ouster of his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, a historic first.\nAnother party hardliner, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, has threatened to make a similar move against Johnson if he allows a vote on more aid for Ukraine as it struggles to fight off a Russian invasion. Greene has also voiced opposition to a surveillance bill the House was struggling to pass this week.\nThe appearance at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Florida resort with the Republican presidential candidate could help buck up Johnson's standing with his 218-213 majority. His own members have repeatedly torpedoed his legislative priorities, including this week by temporarily blocking the surveillance bill, passing a revised version on Friday, and in February, when it took two efforts to advance a bid to approve articles of impeachment against Democratic President Joe Biden's top border official, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\nTrump, who holds great sway with congressional Republicans, has also regularly weighed in on legislation, including killing a bipartisan U.S.-Mexico border security deal, passage of which could have weakened one of his key attacks against Biden.\nThe meeting presents Johnson with a chance to demonstrate a united front with the former president that Republicans say is necessary if the party is to retain control of the House and capture both the Senate and the White House in November.\n\"We've got to get on the same page about where we want the party to go,\" said Representative Kevin Hern, who leads the conservative Republican Study Committee, the biggest House Republican caucus.\n\"I don't think we've all heard directly how the president and the speaker are aligned,\" Hern added. \"We've got to get in lockstep as the Republican Party.\"\nGreene this week has repeated her threats to force a vote to remove Johnson from leadership.\n\"Our voters will not support a Republican Party that continues like his leadership has been,\" Greene told reporters after a meeting with Johnson on Wednesday. \"We have to have changed behavior that supports the policies that the American people are supporting under President Trump.\"\nDisorder within the caucus has repeatedly forced Johnson to use a parliamentary maneuver bypassing Republican hardliners and relying on substantial Democratic support to pass critical legislation, such as bills averting government shutdowns.\nBut strong support from Trump could neutralize Greene's ouster threat and spare a repeat of the chaos that ensued after McCarthy's ouster.\nTrump could also determine which path the speaker takes on Ukraine aid, despite appeals to approve the assistance from an unprecedented number of foreign leaders.\n\"As far as being able to move anything in the House, his support or lack thereof is actually incredibly impactful,\" Republican Representative Kelly Armstrong said.",

            "excerpt": "In a written statement to the Idaho Capital Sun, Moon and Brent Regan, the rules committee chairman, said the Idaho Republican Party made new rules to respond to the deadline issue and is following…",
            "summary": "Thanks to a series of deadline issues, the responsibility for selecting about 20% of the delegates to the Republican National Convention that normally fell to a broad group of Republicans at the state convention will now be handled by a much smaller executive committee chaired by Idaho Republican Party Chairwoman Dorothy Moon.\nThe delegates will be sent to the July 15 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which is where the Republican Party is expected to officially nominate its candidate for president.\nThe Idaho Republican Party's 17-member executive committee, of which Moon is the chair, is scheduled to confirm the delegates during a meeting at 11 a.m. Saturday at Crane Creek Country Club in Boise, according to two Idaho Republican party officials and documents obtained by the Idaho Capital Sun.\nIn past presidential election cycles, hundreds of Republicans who attended the state convention as state delegates got to vote on selecting the delegates to the national convention.\nPart of the issue is that because the Republican Party does not control the White House, its national convention will be held first this year. The issue arises with Rule 16 from the Rules of the Republican Party. That rule states, in part, that no primary election, caucus or convention for selecting delegates to the national convention shall occur 'less than 45 days before the national convention is scheduled to begin.'\nThe Republican National Convention is scheduled to begin July 15, which means the deadline to select delegates is May 31. The problem is the Idaho GOP Convention doesn't begin until June 13, well after the Republican Party's deadline to name delegates.\nIn a written statement to the Idaho Capital Sun, Moon and Brent Regan, the rules committee chairman, said the Idaho Republican Party made new rules to respond to the deadline issue and is following those new rules.\n'We have gone through a very deliberate process sanctioned by the RNC,' Moon wrote.\nRegan also wrote that Moon will vote only to break a tie on the executive committee and does not have the authority to pick any delegates by herself.\n'The chairman does not have the authority or mechanism to select ANY of the delegates,' Regan wrote, capitalizing the word 'any' to add emphasis. 'A review of party rules will show that whoever claims otherwise is either ignorant or malicious.'\nWhy does it matter who picks delegates for the national GOP convention?\nWhy does it matter who picks delegates for the national GOP convention? Idaho gets 32 delegates at the Republican National Convention this year, and being a delegate is a big deal in political circles. National conventions can feature a roaring, party-like atmosphere that is televised nationally, where delegates would typically cheer on a series of high profile speeches from the party's A-listers and rising stars and then hear directly from the party's nominees for president and vice president.\n'If you like politics, it's a great place to be and be participating,' said Cindy Siddoway, who represents Idaho on the Republican National Committee and has participated in multiple Republican national conventions.\n'It does cost to go, but it is a wonderful opportunity to participate in history,' Siddoway added.\nThe change in selecting delegates is happening as some longtime Republican officials say Moon and her supporters are purging officials from the Republican Party who do not fall in line and agree with them. For example, during the Idaho Republican Party's 2023 summer meeting in Challis, the party stripped executive committee voting rights from the Idaho Federation of Republican Women, the Idaho Young Republicans and the Idaho College Republicans. That's the same executive committee that is being asked to sign off on the new delegates to the Republican National Convention.\nAlthough the Idaho Republican Party's executive committee is going to consider confirming the list of delegates Saturday, two Republican officials — Region Six vice chair Trent Clark, who is a former chairman of the Idaho Republican Party, and Siddoway, told the Sun on Tuesday they have not yet seen the list of delegates.\n'The selection of delegates needs to follow the rules,' Clark said in an interview Tuesday. 'For 137 years, we've been having our convention to name our delegates, even before we were a state.'\nSiddoway said she has always known delegates to be picked at the state convention, which she supported.\n'In my knowledge, it has never ever been done this way, but they are trying to meet all of the deadlines,' Siddoway told the Sun.\n'I wish we could have done it through a convention the way we normally do,' Siddoway added.\nSix other Idaho Republican officials expressed concern about the delegate selection issue in a March 26 letter that was sent to Idaho Republican Party Treasurer Steve Bender and obtained by the Sun.\nIn the letter, the six Idaho GOP officials said they have a duty to make an inquiry 'when a problem exists or a report on its face does not make sense,' citing the Idaho attorney general's office's guidance for nonprofit board membership. In their letter, the six officials said the early deadline issue was a topic of a discussion at a January 2023 Republican National Committee meeting held in Dana Point, California, which would have given Moon and Idaho Republican Party officials 18 months to come up with a plan to move up the state primary election and state convention.\n'Several states, and the District of Columbia, consulted with the (Republican National Committee) at the Dana Point meeting to resolve early deadline challenges,' the six GOP officials wrote, before switching to all capital letters in the next sentence. 'WHY DIDN'T IDAHO?'\nThe six Idaho Republicans who signed the letter were state committeewoman Marsha Bjornn from Madison County, state committeewoman Shellie Blanchard from Fremont County, Bannock County Chair Char Tovey, Jefferson County Chair Kaye Field, Caribou County youth committee chair Christin Clark and Clark County Chair Connie Barg.\nIn his written statement Regan, the GOP rules committee chair, said the Idaho Republican Party's state convention is as early as it practically can be. Part of the reason is because of how political parties are made up. The Republican Party's county central committees are responsible for sending delegates to the state convention. But the county central committees are made up of locally elected precinct committeemen, who are elected in the primary election every two years. The date of the primary election is May 21 this year, and there was not enough time to allow the new precinct committeeman to take office, organize at the county central committee level, select delegates to the state convention and have the state convention begin before the May 31 deadline to select delegates for the national convention.\n'We discussed the 45-day (May 31) deadline for submitting delegates with the RNC, but they were unable to accommodate a delay due to the need to conduct background checks and other security measures,' Regan wrote. 'If we miss the deadline we lose all but 12 of our delegates (under) RNC Rule 17a. Clearly, moving the primary and or moving the convention to an earlier date is not practical.'\nWhy is there an early deadline for naming delegates to the Republican National Convention?\nWhy is there an early deadline for naming delegates to the Republican National Convention? Most of Idaho's delegates were already picked by former President Donald Trump who Idaho Republican Party officials said won the March 2 Idaho Republican Presidential Caucus.\nBut the party does get to pick about 20% of the delegates. This year, that includes six delegates that are split between the state's two congressional districts. Normally, those are the delegates that would be selected by a broad group of Republicans at the state convention, if not for the 45-day deadline.\nFor example, the 2021 version of the Idaho Republican Party's rules states that the remaining 20% of delegates are selected by the nominating committee at the Idaho State Republican Convention, where they are voted on on the floor.\nIdaho state law also states that at the state party conventions, each political party may 'in the year of presidential elections … elect delegates to the national convention in the manner prescribed by national party rules …'\nBut faced with the deadline issue, the Idaho Republican Party's state central committee changed its rules for nominating delegates instead of pushing for an earlier primary election and an earlier state convention to meet the 45-day deadline.\nThe latest version of the Idaho Republican Party's rules, adopted in January, says that rather than selecting the remaining 20% of delegates at the convention, the nominations committee of the Idaho Republican Party will select the delegates, which 'shall be confirmed at a special meeting of the executive committee.' The new rule also states the Idaho Republican Party chairman, who is Moon, will serve as the delegation chairman responsible for sending the list of delegates, alternates and guests to Republican national party headquarters by the deadlines unless the delegation selects a different chairman based on a majority vote.",

            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump has continued his revenge tour during the 2024 election cycle as he endorsed a primary challenger to Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-WA), one of the two remaining Republicans who voted to impeach him in 2021.\nLate Friday afternoon, Trump sent out a Truth Social post endorsing Newhouse's primary opponent, Jerrod Sessler, calling him 'MAGA all the way' and making clear this endorsement is because Newhouse voted to impeach him following the Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.\n'He is running against a weak and pathetic RINO named Newhouse, who voted to, for no reason, Impeach me. Newhouse has to go!' Trump said in his post.\nTrump is known for holding a grudge and does not easily forget when people act in a way he views as 'disloyal.' He often rails against them on his social media site and, at times, endorses them in hopes of forcing them out of office.\nThis is Trump's first endorsement against a Republican incumbent this election cycle. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) had worked overtime to ensure that Trump supported even the most moderate incumbents as Republicans tried to retain control of the House. Their efforts had been mostly successful, but they clearly fell short when it came to Newhouse.\nThis appears to be just the latest example of Trump trying to exact revenge against those who voted to impeach him. In the 2022 cycle, the former president used his political capital to successfully try and oust each Republican who voted to impeach him. Some opted to retire instead of facing a heated primary, others lost their re-election bid, and only two survived—Newhouse and Rep. David Valadao (R-CA).\nValadao advanced to the general election this cycle, and Trump did not endorse his Republican challenger. However, the same cannot be said for Newhouse, who represents a safer seat for Republicans than Valadao.\nNewhouse's opponent, Sessler, is a NASCAR driver and a Navy veteran who has never held political office. In 2022, he attempted to primary Newhouse but fell short, receiving only 12.3 percent of the vote.\nSessler has labeled Newhouse an 'impeacher' and has run on him not being loyal to Trump. He has tried to cast himself as the 'American First candidate' and as the only Republican in the race who would support Trump.\nWhile Trump's endorsement carries a lot of weight in Republican primaries, it does not guarantee Sessler will win. In 2022, Trump endorsed Loren Culp, a Republican attempting to primary Newhouse. Culp only amassed 21.6 percent of the vote and failed to advance to the general election.\nIn Washington, the elections are not divided into partisan primaries. Rather, they are what is known as 'jungle primaries,' where Democrats and Republicans run on the same ticket, and the top two advance regardless of party affiliation. This could result in a Republican versus Republican general election.\n'Jerrod Sessler is not a real conservative, and he has no business representing this district; he's not a serious person,' one GOP operative told The Daily Beast.\nRepresentatives for Newhouse and Sessler did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nRead more at The Daily Beast.",

            "excerpt": "Campaign toils to convince Republicans to vote early, crucial to winning the election, while ensuring they don't annoy Trump",
            "summary": "Donald Trump's attacks on mail-in voting have increasingly caused heartburn for the Trump 2024 campaign as they attempt to undo the self-sabotage by ramping up operations in key battleground states encouraging Republicans to vote early and by mail ahead of the presidential election.\nThe former US president has continued his crusade in recent months: in December he called for the end of mail-in voting entirely, before claiming in an interview last month that 'any time the mail is involved, you're going to have cheating'.\nTrump's attacks are complicating efforts at the Trump campaign to convince Republicans to vote early, which advisers know is crucial to win the election given Democratic voters have no qualms about voting by mail or organizing ballot initiatives and have given their party a major advantage.\nJust 28% of Republicans support allowing any voter to cast a ballot by mail, compared with 84% of Democrats, according to a study in February by the Pew Research Center. A large part of that thinking, sources close to Trump concede, has been driven by the former president's criticism of early voting.\nThe problem has become multi-faceted, sources familiar with the situation say. The Trump campaign needs to convince Republicans who believe Trump's every word that they can discount his fearmongering, while ensuring they do not anger Trump by undercutting his position.\nIn essence, the Trump campaign has the delicate task of persuading Republican voters to participate in early voting methods that Trump has falsely said were the reason why there was rampant fraud in the 2020 election that meant he lost to Joe Biden.\nThe undertaking is made difficult by the fact that Trump's voters typically take him at his word. The fear instilled in them of early voting means that Trump and down-ballot Republican candidates are far more at the mercy of election day problems like bad weather, long lines or voting machine issues.\nAt the same time, Trump advisers are spending time trying to make sure they do not appear like they are trying to control the former president or are deliberately trying to undermine him – perceptions he particularly hates.\nThe internal concern at the campaign, the sources suggested, is not wanting to aggravate Trump could ultimately mean that efforts to push early voting and mail-in voting are not managed or pursued as aggressively by the top levels of the campaign for fear of incurring Trump's fury.\nA Trump spokesperson did not directly comment on Thursday but said Trump's position is that Republicans need to use early voting initiatives because Democrats are, even if in an ideal world, there would be no early voting for either party. The spokesperson added that Trump encouraged voters to turn out early in town-halls and video messages, especially during the Republican primaries.\nStill, Trump's logic on canceling mail-in voting has never been clear. If Democrats supposedly used mail-in voting to steal the election, it would make little sense to rail against the use of mail-in voting and convince Republicans to abandon the practice.\nThe available data on early voting, which was popular among Democrats and Republicans until the 2020 election, also shows that the practice is enormously effective and efficient for presidential campaigns in turning out their base.\nThe benefits of 'banking' votes are many: campaigns don't have to spend time and resources chasing their voters and reminding them to cast their ballot if they already have done so, freeing up resources, and ensuring high-propensity voters aren't lost due to unforeseen problems on election day.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Trump on Trial\nTrump on Trial Stay up to date on all of Donald Trump's trials.

In the 2022 midterms, 2 million more Democrats than Republicans voted early in 24 states.\nIn both years, Republican candidates lost narrowly to Democratic opponents, including when the Republican candidate for Arizona governor, Kari Lake, lost to the Democratic candidate, Katie Hobbs, by about 17,000 votes. Meanwhile, about 19,000 more Democrats than Republicans voted by mail.\nTo undo the damage done by Trump, the campaign is ramping its efforts telling Maga voters to cast their ballot early through a blitz of television ads, door knocking and mailing flyers, among other initiatives including the RNC's Bank Your Vote program that was shelved then restarted.\nThe Trump campaign is also expected to rely on adjacent groups to help with get-out-the-vote measures. Turning Point USA, a far-right Trump group that slammed mail-in voting, recently created a $108m Chase the Vote program to convince Maga voters who trust the group to vote early.\nBut the pitch to Republican voters will always be hobbled by Trump's own remarks, one of the sources conceded, and may have to make the false argument that the only way to combat Democratic cheating is to cheat themselves – even if the premise of the argument itself was false.",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump is due to make a public appearance with embattled U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson on Friday, in a bid to demonstrate unity as the chamber's new leader struggles to wrangle his thin and fractious majority.\nJohnson gained the speaker's gavel in a weeks-long October nominating battle after a handful of House Republican hardliners orchestrated the ouster of his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, a historic first.\nAnother party hardliner, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, has threatened to make a similar move against Johnson if he allows a vote on more aid for Ukraine as it struggles to fight off a Russian invasion. Greene has also voiced opposition to a surveillance bill the House was struggling to pass this week.\nThe appearance at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Florida resort with the Republican presidential candidate could help buck up Johnson's standing with his 218-213 majority. His own members have repeatedly torpedoed his legislative priorities, including this week by temporarily blocking the surveillance bill, passing a revised version on Friday, and in February, when it took two efforts to advance a bid to approve articles of impeachment against Democratic President Joe Biden's top border official, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\nTrump, who holds great sway with congressional Republicans, has also regularly weighed in on legislation, including killing a bipartisan U.S.-Mexico border security deal, passage of which could have weakened one of his key attacks against Biden.\nThe meeting presents Johnson with a chance to demonstrate a united front with the former president that Republicans say is necessary if the party is to retain control of the House and capture both the Senate and the White House in November.\n\"We've got to get on the same page about where we want the party to go,\" said Representative Kevin Hern, who leads the conservative Republican Study Committee, the biggest House Republican caucus.\n\"I don't think we've all heard directly how the president and the speaker are aligned,\" Hern added. \"We've got to get in lockstep as the Republican Party.\"\nGreene this week has repeated her threats to force a vote to remove Johnson from leadership.\n\"Our voters will not support a Republican Party that continues like his leadership has been,\" Greene told reporters after a meeting with Johnson on Wednesday. \"We have to have changed behavior that supports the policies that the American people are supporting under President Trump.\"\nDisorder within the caucus has repeatedly forced Johnson to use a parliamentary maneuver bypassing Republican hardliners and relying on substantial Democratic support to pass critical legislation, such as bills averting government shutdowns.\nBut strong support from Trump could neutralize Greene's ouster threat and spare a repeat of the chaos that ensued after McCarthy's ouster.\nTrump could also determine which path the speaker takes on Ukraine aid, despite appeals to approve the assistance from an unprecedented number of foreign leaders.\n\"As far as being able to move anything in the House, his support or lack thereof is actually incredibly impactful,\" Republican Representative Kelly Armstrong said.\n(Reporting by Nathan Layne and David Morgan; Editing by Scott Malone and Jonathan Oatis)\nBy David Morgan and Nathan Layne",

            "summary": "New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R) said he supports former President Trump despite believing he 'contributed' to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\nSununu went back and forth with co-anchor George Stephanopoulos on ABC's 'This Week' on Sunday to explain why he is backing Trump despite condemning his actions leading up to Jan. 6. Stephanopoulos pressed Sununu on his statement released after the Jan. 6 attacks that stated Trump's 'rhetoric and actions contributed to the insurrection.'\nSununu, who has endorsed Trump, said Sunday that he stood by his statement.\n'I think he — his actions absolutely contributed to that. There's no question about that. I hate the election denialism of 2020. Nobody wants to be talking about that in 2024,' he said.\nHe said that while he believes Trump 'contributed' to the attack, he is backing Trump to elect a Republican to the White House.\n'Because for me, it's not about him as much as it is having a Republican administration — Republican secretaries, Republican rules, a sense where states' rights come first, individual rights come first, parents' rights come first,' he said.\n'It's not about Trump with me,' he added.\nSununu supported former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley during the Republican presidential primaries before she dropped out of the race last month. He has frequently criticized the former president and said last year he would work to narrow the 2024 GOP field in an effort to defeat Trump.\nStephanopoulos continued to press Sununu on his support for the former president on Sunday.\n'And you believe that someone — you believe that a president who contributed to an insurrection should be president again?' he asked.\n'As does 51 percent of America, George. I mean, really,' Sununu responded. 'I understand you're part of the media. I understand you're in this New York City bubble or whatever it is, but you've got to look around what's happening across this country. They're not — it's not about just supporting Trump. It's getting rid of what we have today.'\nSununu later reiterated that it is about the party ticket, not Trump.\n'I know you're shocked that the Republican governor is supporting a Republican president and the Republican ticket, but it's about the ticket. It's about up and down the ballot, right?' he said.\n'I want Republican governors and senators and congressmen, and that type of culture, if you will. I keep going back to that because that's exactly what it is. That's the change America is looking for,' he added.\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.",

            "excerpt": "Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump feuded in the GOP presidential primary, but it didn't hurt DeSantis in Florida, a new poll finds.",
            "summary": "The contentious 2024 presidential primary contest between Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump didn't sour Republicans on the governor in the state both men call home.\nIn fact, more Florida Republicans view DeSantis favorably than Trump, and the governor also has a higher overall favorability rating, according to a new survey.\nThe USA TODAY/Ipsos poll found that 90% of Florida Republicans view DeSantis favorably, compared with 80% for Trump. Among all Floridians 18 and older, DeSantis is viewed favorably by 47% and Trump 42%.\nBoth Republicans fared better than President Joe Biden, who is viewed favorably by 34% of Floridians.\nThe survey found Trump leading Biden in Florida by eight percentage points, which is not surprising in a state that increasingly has trended red. DeSantis coasted to reelection in 2022 by 19 percentage points.\nThat DeSantis is more popular than Trump in their home state after being thrashed by the former president is notable, though.\nTrump disparaged the governor as 'DeSanctimonious' and mocked him relentlessly for months. DeSantis dropped out of the presidential race shortly after a distant second place finish to Trump in the Iowa Caucus and well before Florida's March 19 primary that Trump won handily over former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.\nPolls showed DeSantis poised to lose badly to Trump in Florida, noted University of Central Florida political science professor Aubrey Jewett. So while DeSantis may have broader appeal, Trump still has the hearts of many Florida Republicans.\n'This suggests that while DeSantis popularity among Florida Republicans is wider than Trump, Trump's support is deeper than DeSantis,' Jewett said.\nStill, DeSantis doesn't appear to have permanently damaged himself within the GOP by running against Trump. That's despite Trump saying his MAGA base had turned on the governor for his perceived disloyalty.\n'MAGA will never support DeSanctimonious again,' Trump posted on Truth Social last year.\nHard right governing could be a challenge for DeSantis in 2028\nThe new survey indicates Trump's voters aren't as angry about DeSantis challenging him as the former president.\n'It sort of feels like the Republican electorate is sort of let bygones be bygones,' said Ipsos pollster Chris Jackson, who noted that 87% of respondents who are voting for Trump still have a favorable view of DeSantis.\nDeSantis campaigned to the right of Trump, assiduously courting base conservatives. His attacks on Trump were typically limited to policy issues, or arguments about electability, and not harsh personal criticism.\nThat might have limited his effectiveness in the Republican presidential primary, \"but in the longer run he did not alienate most Florida Republicans,' Jewett said.\n\"DeSantis clearly has not harmed himself permanently among Florida Republicans by challenging Trump,\" Jewett said. \"Most GOP voters did not want DeSantis to run right now, but they still like him and apparently are not holding it against him.\"\nHowever, Jackson noted that just 15% of Florida Democrats and 39% of independents view DeSantis favorably after years of hard right governing and campaigning. That could be a problem for the term-limited Florida governor should he make it to a future general election for president.\n'It does sort of illustrate the challenges with MAGA republicanism,\" Jackson said. \"You can be extremely popular with the base but it risks alienating everyone not part of that MAGA base and it looks like that's something DeSantis has done to himself.\"\nDeSantis rocketed to national prominence as governor with an aggressive conservative agenda, including legislation targeting how racial issues are taught in schools and a bill limiting discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom. The later measure prompted a high-profile fight with Disney.\nSince losing to Trump, DeSantis has remained active, traveling the state to promote tough-on-crime legislation and other bills. He is viewed as a potential candidate for president in 2028.\nThe USA TODAY/Ipsos survey of 1,014 Floridians 18 and older was conducted April 5-7. It has 4.1 point margin of error, and 6.4 points for Republicans.",

            "excerpt": "More Americans now say the U.S. is not doing enough to assist Ukraine in its war with Russia, while a majority still favor helping Ukraine reclaim its territory.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON, D.C. -- As military aid for Ukraine remains stalled in the U.S. House of Representatives, Americans themselves are equally split, at 36% each, between those who believe the United States is doing too much to help Ukraine and those saying it's not doing enough. However, this is a more favorable balance of opinion for Ukraine than last fall, when more thought the U.S. was doing too much (41%) than not enough (25%).\nThis comes as Americans' perceptions of who is winning the war have also shifted, with more now saying Russia rather than Ukraine has the upper hand, although a majority of U.S. adults still see neither side as winning.\nPartisans remain sharply divided in their opinions of the war, with Democrats more supportive than Republicans of helping Ukraine. However, the gap is now at a record high, given the surge in Democrats' belief since last fall that the U.S. is not doing enough. Republicans' minimal agreement with this position hasn't changed, and political independents' views are closer to Republicans' than Democrats'.\nUptick in Percentage of Americans Who Think U.S. Is Not Helping Ukraine Enough This is the first time that less than 30% of Americans say the U.S. is doing the right amount to support Ukraine, which was the most common view as recently as June, when 43% held this opinion. Last fall saw a surge in the percentage saying the U.S. was doing too much, though that view has subsided since then.\nThe latest data are from a Gallup poll conducted March 1-17, several weeks after the U.S. Senate passed a bipartisan aid package that included $60 billion in funding for Ukraine. The bill has been stuck in the U.S. House as Speaker Mike Johnson has been working to get support from his Republican caucus, which currently holds a slim two-vote majority. Conservative House Republicans have vowed to withhold support for any foreign aid bill that does not include funding for strengthening the U.S. southern border.\nDemocrats -- and, to a lesser extent, independents -- are driving the increase since October in views that the U.S. is not doing enough in the conflict. Sixty percent of Democrats (up by 22 percentage points) say U.S. support for Ukraine is insufficient, while 34% of independents (up by nine points) agree. At the same time, Republicans' view is essentially unchanged, with 15% saying the U.S. is not doing enough.\nIn addition, between 25% and 28% of all three party groups think the current level of help for Ukraine is about right, while 57% of Republicans, 39% of independents and 13% of Democrats think the U.S. is doing too much. Before October, no more than 50% of Republicans and 35% of independents said the U.S. was doing too much.\nMajority Still Favors Supporting Ukraine in Reclaiming Territory Fifty-five percent of Americans think the U.S. should continue to support Ukraine in reclaiming its territory, even if that requires prolonged involvement, rather than ending the conflict as quickly as possible, even if that means ceding territory to Russia (43%). These findings are unchanged from the previous readings in October. However, the percentage of Americans who now favor continuing the fight to win back Ukraine's territory is lower than the 62% to 66% who preferred that approach between August 2022 and June 2023.\nAs has been the case since August 2022, a broad majority of Democrats (77%) prefer helping Ukraine reclaim the land it has lost to Russia. In contrast, 45% of Republicans and 47% of independents favor the same approach, while slim majorities of both party groups support a quick end to the war.\nMore Say Russia Winning, but Majority Still See Neither Side Prevailing The majority of Americans, 65%, continue to think the war in Ukraine is at a stalemate, but they are more likely now (23%) than they were in October (14%) to say Russia is winning. The 12% of U.S. adults who believe Ukraine is winning the war is down from 20% in October.\nSince the last survey, Russia has made some gains in Ukraine, while Ukraine has not been able to do much in its counteroffensive effort.\nPartisans' perceptions of the war are nearly identical, but this has not always been the case. In the two previous readings, Democrats were much more likely than Republicans and independents to say Ukraine was winning. Last June, 45% of Democrats said Ukraine was winning the war, but that figure fell to 32% in October and now stands at 15%. Meanwhile, 11% of Republicans and 10% of independents now say Ukraine is winning.\nRepublicans Hold Slight Edge on Handling the U.S. Response to the War Americans are slightly more likely to say the Republicans in Congress are doing a better job of handling the U.S. response to the war in Ukraine than to say Joe Biden is (49% vs. 44%, respectively). Likewise, Donald Trump (50%) edges out Biden (46%) as potentially better at handling the U.S. response.\nBroad majorities of Republicans and Democrats choose their own party's congressional leaders and 2024 presidential contender as the better managers of the United States' response to the Russia-Ukraine war, while slim majorities of independents favor Republican leaders.\nBottom Line Two years after Russia invaded Ukraine, Americans are divided over whether the United States' support for Ukraine is sufficient. Still, a majority continues to believe that helping reclaim Ukrainian territory is worth the effort, however long it may take. Partisans hold drastically different views on the subject, with Democrats much more supportive than Republicans of helping Ukraine. This has played out among congressional Republicans as U.S. aid for Ukraine has been delayed in the House. Johnson is attempting to forge a compromise, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has issued a dire warning that help is needed now, but Johnson could lose his position as speaker if he does not satisfy differing segments of the Republican caucus.\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X .\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X .

            "excerpt": "Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump feuded in the GOP presidential primary, but it didn't hurt DeSantis in Florida, a new poll finds.",
            "summary": "The contentious 2024 presidential primary contest between Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump didn't sour Republicans on the governor in the state both men call home.\nIn fact, more Florida Republicans view DeSantis favorably than Trump, and the governor also has a higher overall favorability rating, according to a new survey.\nThe USA TODAY/Ipsos poll found that 90% of Florida Republicans view DeSantis favorably, compared with 80% for Trump. Among all Floridians 18 and older, DeSantis is viewed favorably by 47% and Trump 42%.\nBoth Republicans fared better than President Joe Biden, who is viewed favorably by 34% of Floridians.\nThe survey found Trump leading Biden in Florida by eight percentage points, which is not surprising in a state that increasingly has trended red. DeSantis coasted to reelection in 2022 by 19 percentage points.\nThat DeSantis is more popular than Trump in their home state after being thrashed by the former president is notable, though.\nTrump disparaged the governor as 'DeSanctimonious' and mocked him relentlessly for months. DeSantis dropped out of the presidential race shortly after a distant second place finish to Trump in the Iowa Caucus and well before Florida's March 19 primary that Trump won handily over former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.\nPolls showed DeSantis poised to lose badly to Trump in Florida, noted University of Central Florida political science professor Aubrey Jewett. So while DeSantis may have broader appeal, Trump still has the hearts of many Florida Republicans.\n'This suggests that while DeSantis popularity among Florida Republicans is wider than Trump, Trump's support is deeper than DeSantis,' Jewett said.\nStill, DeSantis doesn't appear to have permanently damaged himself within the GOP by running against Trump. That's despite Trump saying his MAGA base had turned on the governor for his perceived disloyalty.\n'MAGA will never support DeSanctimonious again,' Trump posted on Truth Social last year.\nHard right governing could be a challenge for DeSantis in 2028\nThe new survey indicates Trump's voters aren't as angry about DeSantis challenging him as the former president.\n'It sort of feels like the Republican electorate is sort of let bygones be bygones,' said Ipsos pollster Chris Jackson, who noted that 87% of respondents who are voting for Trump still have a favorable view of DeSantis.\nDeSantis campaigned to the right of Trump, assiduously courting base conservatives. His attacks on Trump were typically limited to policy issues, or arguments about electability, and not harsh personal criticism.\nThat might have limited his effectiveness in the Republican presidential primary, \"but in the longer run he did not alienate most Florida Republicans,' Jewett said.\n\"DeSantis clearly has not harmed himself permanently among Florida Republicans by challenging Trump,\" Jewett said. \"Most GOP voters did not want DeSantis to run right now, but they still like him and apparently are not holding it against him.\"\nHowever, Jackson noted that just 15% of Florida Democrats and 39% of independents view DeSantis favorably after years of hard right governing and campaigning. That could be a problem for the term-limited Florida governor should he make it to a future general election for president.\n'It does sort of illustrate the challenges with MAGA republicanism,\" Jackson said. \"You can be extremely popular with the base but it risks alienating everyone not part of that MAGA base and it looks like that's something DeSantis has done to himself.\"\nDeSantis rocketed to national prominence as governor with an aggressive conservative agenda, including legislation targeting how racial issues are taught in schools and a bill limiting discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom. The later measure prompted a high-profile fight with Disney.\nSince losing to Trump, DeSantis has remained active, traveling the state to promote tough-on-crime legislation and other bills. He is viewed as a potential candidate for president in 2028.\nThe USA TODAY/Ipsos survey of 1,014 Floridians 18 and older was conducted April 5-7. It has 4.1 point margin of error, and 6.4 points for Republicans.",

            "excerpt": "Primary voters will soon cast ballots in narrowly divided Pennsylvania",
            "summary": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The two parties in Pennsylvania 's state House and its congressional delegation are nearly evenly divided, and that won't change once results are in from next week's primary election.\nBut come November, the candidates the parties will select April 23 for hundreds of legislative seats could alter what has been years of policy paralysis in Harrisburg and the similar partisan deadlock in Congress.\nThe state's voters will also cast primary ballots for this year's marquee contests for president and U.S. Senate. Democratic incumbents Joe Biden and Bob Casey and Republican challengers Donald Trump and Dave McCormick are shoo-ins to appear on the fall ballot.\nBoth parties will pick candidates for state attorney general, which was in Republican hands before Democrats went on a winning streak starting in 2012.\nIn the two other statewide 'row office' contests, Republicans Stacy Garrity, the treasurer, and Tim DeFoor, the auditor general, will find out which Democrats will try to unseat them in the fall.\nIt took months and several special elections before Democrats were able to nail down their return to majority control of the state House last year, elevating one of their own to speaker in a chamber where the partisan breakdown is now 102-100. One seat, in a Poconos district where a Republican resigned in February, is vacant and will be filled by special election on primary day.\nWith the entire chamber on the ballot this year, Republicans would love to flip it back, denying Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro legislative leverage in policy and budget battles.\nIn the state Senate, where Republicans hold a 28-22 majority, Democrats would need to flip at least three seats in order for Democratic Lt. Gov. Austin Davis' tie-breaking vote to give them control.\nAmong the 25 Senate seats up this year, nearly half the total, or 12 incumbent senators, face no opponents this year.\nThere are contested Senate primaries in both parties for notable vacancies in a Republican-held seat in the Harrisburg area and a Democratic-held seat in Pittsburgh. The third vacancy is a Republican majority district in northern York County.\nLEGISLATIVE SHAKEUP\nDemocratic Rep. Nick Pisciottano, of Allegheny County, is leaving the House to run, along with two other Democrats and two Republicans, for a state Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Jim Brewster, D-Allegheny.\nRep. Dawn Keefer, R-York, is departing the lower chamber in a run to succeed retiring Sen. Mike Regan, R-York. Another House departure is Rep. Patty Kim, of Dauphin County, facing off against another Democrat for the nomination in the third Senate district involving a retirement, that of Sen. John DiSanto, R-Dauphin. Two Republicans also are vying to succeed DiSanto.\nDiSanto's seat is widely seen as the Senate Democrats' best chance for a pickup. Their longshot bid for the majority also likely would require beating Sen. Dan Laughlin, R-Erie, and Sen. Devlin Robinson, a first-term Republican whose district surrounds the western side of Pittsburgh.\nSen. Dave Argall, of Schuylkill County, who heads the GOP's Senate campaign effort, said a razor-close win for Brewster four years ago makes that a battleground, but their efforts to stay in the majority are wider.\n'There are going to be battles all across the state, but it's still pretty early to predict which ones are going to rise to the top of the list,\" Argall said.\nLawmakers in nearly half of the 203 House seats, and slightly more Democrats than Republicans, have no primary or General Election opponents this year and can plan on serving another term starting in January.\nThere aren't many House vacancies this cycle: just nine seats held by Republicans and four by Democrats. Retiring members include Berks County Rep. Mark Rozzi, who spent a brief but notable time as House speaker early last year before fellow Democrats could muster the votes to elect their first choice to lead the chamber, Speaker Joanna McClinton of Philadelphia.\nReps. Ryan Mackenzie, of Lehigh County, and Rob Mercuri, of Allegheny, are relinquishing House seats to run in Republican primaries for Democratic-held congressional seats. Hedging their bets are Rep. Ryan Bizzarro, of Erie, and Rep. Jared Solomon, of Philadelphia, seeking reelection in the state House and running in Democratic primaries for state treasurer and state attorney general, respectively.\nCONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION\nAll 17 of Pennsylvania's incumbent members of the U.S. House of Representatives are running for another term, each with at least one opponent in the primary or fall elections. Court-ordered redistricting after the 2020 Census produced a 9-8 Democratic edge, and when the incumbents ran for reelection two years ago, all 17 were reelected.\nIn Allegheny County, freshman U.S. Rep. Summer Lee has a Democratic primary opponent, Bhavini Patel, as well as a Republican positioned to take on the Democratic winner in November.\nIn a district Democrats hope to flip, a race north of Philadelphia could signal how much power the abortion issue has in the suburbs. U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a centrist Republican, has a primary opponent whose anti-abortion position would not permit exceptions for rape or incest.\nThere is a three-way GOP primary for the nomination to take on Lehigh Valley Democratic U.S. Rep. Susan Wild in the fall. Wild's previous two wins were by single-digit margins. Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Democrat from the Scranton area who also has been repeatedly targeted in recent years, has no primary opponent, but a Republican looks to challenge him in November.\nSix Democrats are on the primary ballot in a district held by U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, a York County Republican who was deeply involved in efforts by then-President Donald Trump to overturn Trump's 2020 election defeat. Perry's prominent role in the ultra-right Freedom Caucus in Congress and some close reelection contests over the past six years also are making him a target for Democrats this year.\nSTATEWIDE ROW OFFICES\nAfter Shapiro's election as governor two years ago created a vacancy in his former job as state attorney general, he nominated his protege, Michelle Henry, to serve through the end of this year. She is not seeking to stay in the job.\nFive Democrats are running for the nomination: Philadelphia attorney Keir Bradford-Grey, former auditor general and state Rep. Eugene DePasquale, of Allegheny County, former prosecutor and Bucks County solicitor Joe Khan, Philadelphia state Rep. Jared Solomon and Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer.\nTwo Republicans are running: York County District Attorney Dave Sunday and state Rep. Craig Williams, of Delaware County. Sunday received his party's endorsement, while Williams has been helping lead House Republicans' efforts to remove from office progressive Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat.\nFor auditor general, state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, of Philadelphia, and Lehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley are the Democrats seeking to run against DeFoor in November. Kenyatta finished third in the Democratic U.S. Senate primary in 2022 won by John Fetterman.\nGarrity, the state treasurer, has no opposition in the GOP primary. Democratic voters will choose between Bizzarro and Erin McClelland, an addiction recovery and human services professional from Allegheny County.",

I believed not every Democrat was right on every issue, nor was every Republican wrong on every issue. I felt reasonableness on both sides of the political divide was a virtue to be rewarded.\nI still believe in that ideal, but over the last few decades the most intolerant and irrational voices in the Republican Party have eclipsed those open to moderation and compromise. These days, the most extreme, hostile and irrational voices in the Republican party are the ones that dominate. Not one Republican board member, nor the Republican County Board chair, spoke against the deletion of those noble ideals. Therefore, they are all responsible for their removal.\nAs a member of the Democratic Party of McHenry County, I am proud to stand with a party that views; diversity as a strength, equality of opportunity as essential to universal fulfillment of each citizen's potential, and universal inclusion as vital to a healthy democratic society and a truly great America for all.\nVoting for any Republican candidate in 2024 is a vote against progress towards 'A More Perfect Union.'

            "summary": "Donald Trump threw his support behind embattled US House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson on Friday, seeking to demonstrate unity as Johnson struggles to quell dissent within his fractious Republican majority.\n'He's doing a really good job under very tough circumstances,' Trump said at a press conference with Johnson at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\nJohnson gained the speaker's gavel in a weeks-long October nominating battle after a handful of House Republican hardliners orchestrated the ousting of his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, a historic first.\nAnother party hardliner, congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, has threatened to make a similar move against Johnson if he allows a vote on more aid for Ukraine as it struggles to fight off a Russian invasion. Greene had also voiced opposition to a surveillance bill the House passed on Friday.\nUS congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene looks on next to House Speaker Mike Johnson at the US Capitol on Thursday. Photo: Reuters Trump referred to Greene as a friend but expressed clear disapproval of her threat to oust Johnson.\n'It's unfortunate that people bring it up, because right now we have much bigger problems,' Trump said. 'I'm sure that Marjorie understands that she's a very good friend of mine. And I know she has a lot of respect for the speaker.'\nGreene did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.\nThe appearance with the Republican presidential candidate could help buck up Johnson's standing with his 218-213 majority.\nZelensky urges US House Speaker on aid after escalation in Russian attacks His own members have repeatedly torpedoed his legislative priorities, including this week by temporarily blocking the surveillance bill and in February, when it took two efforts to advance a bid to approve articles of impeachment against Democratic US President Joe Biden's top border official, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\nTrump, who holds great sway with congressional Republicans, has also regularly weighed in on legislation, including killing a bipartisan US-Mexico border security deal, passage of which could have weakened one of his key attacks against Biden.\nThe meeting presented Johnson with a chance to show a united front with the former president that Republicans say is necessary if the party is to retain control of the House and capture both the Senate and the White House in November.\n'We've got to get on the same page about where we want the party to go,' said congressman Kevin Hern, who leads the conservative Republican Study Committee, the biggest House Republican caucus.\n'I don't think we've all heard directly how the president and the speaker are aligned,' Hern said on Thursday. 'We've got to get in lockstep as the Republican Party.'\nUS congressman Kevin McCarthy speaks to reporters in Washington hours after he was ousted as speaker of the House in October 2023. Photo: AP Greene this week has repeated her threats to force a vote to remove Johnson from leadership.\n'Our voters will not support a Republican Party that continues like his leadership has been,' Greene told reporters after a meeting Johnson on Wednesday. 'We have to have changed behaviour that supports the policies that the American people are supporting under President Trump.'\nDisorder within the caucus has repeatedly forced Johnson to use a parliamentary manoeuvre bypassing Republican hardliners and relying on substantial Democratic support to pass critical legislation, such as bills averting government shutdowns.\nBut strong support from Trump could neutralise Greene's threat to out the speaker and spare a repeat of the chaos that ensued after McCarthy's ousting. Trump could also determine which path the speaker takes on Ukraine aid, despite appeals to approve the funding from an unprecedented number of foreign leaders.",

If additional poll workers are needed, election officials hire unaffiliated people.\nThe RNC alleges Milwaukee used 215 Democratic poll workers and 49 Republicans, and Madison used 60 Democrats and 51 Republicans. It also alleges Republicans submitted more than 250 names in Milwaukee, and about 150 in Madison. The complaint argues this amounts to most of their nominees being arbitrarily and unfairly rejected.\nThe Milwaukee complaint states Woodall did not adequately explain the use of a new online portal to Republican applicants.\nIn a statement, Woodall said all workers who complete their application and training are assigned to a polling location, or to central count, but some people do not complete those required steps.

'Contact logs, application status reports, etc. was all proactively provided by our office throughout this Spring.'\nThe Madison complaint states 'unaffiliated and Democrat Party election inspectors received more favorable treatment than' Republican applicants.\nHaas, the city attorney, likewise argued some Republican nominees did not complete their process.\n'All proper procedures were followed in appointing election inspectors and many individuals nominated by the Republican Party did not complete required paperwork to be hired or respond to communications from the Clerk's Office regarding their availability,' he said.\nAn attorney for the Republicans who filed the complaints did not respond to WPR's request for comment.\nGOP alleges Milwaukee, Madison elections officials discriminated against its poll workers was originally published by Wisconsin Public Radio.\nwas originally published by Wisconsin Public Radio.",

That could be a problem for the term-limited Florida governor should he make it to a future general election for president.\n'It does sort of illustrate the challenges with MAGA republicanism,\" Jackson said. \"You can be extremely popular with the base but it risks alienating everyone not part of that MAGA base and it looks like that's something DeSantis has done to himself.\"\nDeSantis rocketed to national prominence as governor with an aggressive conservative agenda, including legislation targeting how racial issues are taught in schools and a bill limiting discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom. The later measure prompted a high-profile fight with Disney.\nSince losing to Trump, DeSantis has remained active, traveling the state to promote tough-on-crime legislation and other bills. He is viewed as a potential candidate for president in 2028.\nThe USA TODAY/Ipsos survey of 1,014 Floridians 18 and older was conducted April 5-7. It has 4.1 point margin of error, and 6.4 points for Republicans.",

            "excerpt": "Across the country, fractures are emerging among conservative and centrist Republican women, as they confront an unrelenting drumbeat of new abortion bans and court rulings.",
            "summary": "By Elizabeth Dias and Lisa Lerer New York Times\nBy Elizabeth Dias and Lisa Lerer\nNew York Times\nRebecca Gau, a self-described 'reasonable Republican' in Mesa, Arizona, is conflicted about many things that her party promotes. But she knows exactly what she thinks about Arizona's new — or rather, very old — Civil War-era abortion ban. And about the idea that Republicans like her might be happy with the outcome.\n'Are you nuts?' she said, adding that she was frustrated with the ban and Republican politicians inserting themselves into women's health choices.\nGau, 52, said she probably would not have chosen an abortion for herself. But she said she would never judge a woman for making her own decision. 'It is not a cut and dry line,' she said.\nAcross the country, fractures are emerging among conservative and centrist Republican women, as they confront an unrelenting drumbeat of new abortion bans and court rulings. For years, the party's message was simple and broad: Republicans oppose abortion. Its politicians rarely dove into the specifics of what the position meant for reproductive health issues like miscarriage, medical emergencies and fertility treatments.\nNow, those complicated realities are everywhere. In Alabama, the state Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos could be considered children, raising concerns over future access to in vitro fertilization procedures. In Florida, women are preparing for a new six-week abortion ban to soon go into effect.\nNowhere is the conversation more intense this week than in Arizona, a key battleground state in the 2024 election. On Tuesday, the state Supreme Court ruled 4-2 in favor of reinstating an 1864 law banning all abortion from the moment of conception, except to save the life of the mother. It made no exceptions for rape or incest.\nThe ruling came just one day after former President Donald Trump, who rose to power in large part through an alliance with anti-abortion activists, said he believed that abortion policy should be left to the states.\nConversations with Republican women revealed a spectrum of views about abortion and its effect on their political identities as they looked ahead to November.\nSome disagree with the bans but say the new laws are not shaking their support for Trump and Republican candidates. Another group, the most committed opponents of abortion, see the bans as victories, thanks in part to Trump, and as a moral call to action to further advance their cause. And some self-described Republicans who backed Joe Biden in 2020 say the bans have solidified their support for his reelection.\nFor Gau, who works in education policy, the new law challenged the long-held conservative tenet that abortion policy should be returned to the states. Leaving some decisions up to the states is not necessarily bad, she said, but some issues need consistency over time, and even across states. 'This is one of those issues.'\nShe was frustrated with politicians, especially Republicans, who treated reproductive rights like just another 'red meat' political issue. The ruling seemed to her like another reminder of how her party had betrayed her values. When she casts her vote, she plans to vote for Biden, as she did in 2020.\nA majority of Republicans continue to oppose abortion. About 60% of Republicans oppose a law that would guarantee a federal right to abortion, and half support banning the use of mifepristone, a common medication used in terminating pregnancies, according to a recent poll by KFF, a nonprofit health policy organization. And about 2 in 3 Republican women say they trust Trump to move abortion policy in the right direction, according to KFF.\nBut many women's views are more nuanced than a broad survey can capture. And there is a portion of conservative women whose views are evolving in real time, in response to changes that have swept the nation since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\nAccording to Tresa Undem, a public opinion researcher who studies abortion, the share of Republican women who believe their party's views on abortion are 'too extreme' increased in February to 39%, from 22% in June 2022 before the ruling.\nOver the past year, abortion as an issue has quickly become tied with health, medicine, safety and security, on top of bodily autonomy, Undem said. A majority of Republican women also now cite 'women's rights' as an 'extremely or very important issue' in their vote, up from 31%, a phrase Undem says is closely associated with abortion rights.\n'Becoming pregnant has become an even scarier prospect than it already was,' she said. 'Everyone knows someone who has had a complication in pregnancy, so this issue is far-reaching.'\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\nStill, a vocal contingent of the Republican Party remains committed to opposing abortion. For these women, the fall of Roe was the beginning, not the end, of their efforts to end abortion nationwide.\nAshley Trussell, the chair of Arizona Right to Life, was elated by the state Supreme Court's decision and furious that Arizona's attorney general, Kris Mayes, a Democrat, had called the ruling 'an existential crisis' for residents.\n'We have an attorney general who is saying she will not enforce the law, which is terrifying,' Trussell said. 'If you don't have an attorney general enforcing the law, that is anarchy.'\nTrussell said her group had gained fresh local momentum in the past couple of years and was working with Students for Life, a national anti-abortion group, to push residents to oppose a ballot initiative that would enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution, a measure that has received a groundswell of support from Democrats.\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\nYet surveys are also clear that Republicans generally feel less politically motivated by the issue than Democrats, a reversal from the mobilizing power that abortion had before Roe was overturned. Even some women who oppose abortion are more politically motivated by a broader set of social issues this year.\nIn Scottsdale, Arizona, Kimberly Miller, 61, who founded Arizona Women of Action, a group of Christian women that aims to 'protect kids and restore schools,' said she supported the state Supreme Court ruling.\n'To the people who want to ‘keep religion out of it,' just realize that most every law is based on a moral premise,' she said in a statement. 'We believe that every single life is precious, and we commit ourselves to saving lives rather than ending them.'\nBut while Miller is working to defeat the Arizona ballot initiative, the women in her network are particularly mobilized against the 'politics of using race and gender as means of creating division and activism,' she said. 'Parents want nonpolitical academics.'\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\nThe issue of fertility treatments presented new challenges for Republicans this election cycle.\nIn Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, Lorraine Mory, 70, had always voted Republican as a single-issue voter, with that issue being abortion, she said. But now she says she can't imagine voting for a Republican ever again.\nHer evolution on abortion took time, and happened through conversations she had with her daughter, an OB-GYN, throughout the Trump presidency. Mory had supported Trump's Supreme Court nominees, until they overturned Roe.\n'I wouldn't have my grandchildren if it weren't for IVF,' she said. 'I am a very strong Christian, I think that is why the abortion issue was such a black and white thing for me before. Now I consider myself pro-choice.'\nFor other Republican women who back some form of abortion rights, the rise of new restrictions hasn't been significant enough to shake their support of Trump.\nOn a sunny day last August at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines, just weeks after the governor signed a law banning abortion in the state after six weeks, Shirley Grandstaff, 60, explained why she believed abortion should be all-but-unregulated by the government.\n'I'm not your judge and jury,' said Grandstaff, a physician assistant. 'I don't think we should govern what we do with your body. Right or wrong biblically, whatever it is, I don't believe it.'\nStill, she planned to cast her third vote for her party's nominee in November. 'I'm all Trump,' Grandstaff said.\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\nIn north Phoenix, Lisa Hoberg, a Republican committeeperson, said she was 'barely hanging on' to her Republican registration.\nThe Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol was the turning point for her with Trump. At this moment, she said, abortion policy is important but only one of many concerning issues. She plans to vote for a mix of Republicans and Democrats in November and struggles to categorize her views as 'pro-life' or 'pro-choice.'\n'My ideals are small government, freedoms,' Hoberg said. 'Stay out of our classrooms, stay out of our bedrooms, stay out of my exam rooms.'\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.",

            "summary": "The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) was passed as a result of the public hysteria that was orchestrated in response to a non-existent 'Muslim terrorist threat' that was spun off of 9/11, the only claimed Muslim terrorist act in the US, an event now understood as a neoconservative operation to create 'the New Pearl Harbor' necessary for their wars in the Middle East against Israel's enemies.\nThe FISA Act was totally unconstitutional as it vitiated the US Constitution's prohibitions against arrest and spying without warrants. The FISA Act is a police state measure and nothing else. That Americans, Congress, and the federal courts accepted it proves the absence of any commitment to freedom.\nIn this pre-election fundraising season we hear from Republicans how much they do for freedom and all that they are going to do to preserve it. But what do they really do?\nDespite President Trump's plea to the House Republicans, a plea from the Republican Presidential Nominee and in the opinion of many Republicans the actual President of the US as his reelection was stolen with Republican Party complicity by the Democrats, the Republican Speaker of the House and all but 19 Republicans tried to keep the unconstitutional FISA Act, which expires April 19, in force by re-authorizing it.\nThe Democrats, not wanting Trump, the next President, to have the power to do to them what they did to him, voted uniformly with 19 Republicans to kill the police state act Americans have lived under for many years by a vote of 226 against and 193 for.\nIt is almost a certainly that by one means or the other the police state will get the FISA Act renewed. But notice: It was the Democrats, not the Republicans, who responded to Trump and voted down the renewal of the police state legislation.\nSo much for the Republican Party in which so many false hopes are placed.\nTrump should have created his own party, a party that represents Americans.\nHere are the 19 Republicans who stood up for freedom:\nReps. Greene, Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), Dan Bishop (R-N.C), Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), Michael Cloud (R-Texas), Bob Good (R-Va.), Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), Chip Roy (R-Texas.), Eli Crane (R-Ariz.), Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), Clay Higgins (R-La.), Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), Cory Mills (R-Fla.), Scott Perry (R-Pa.), Matt Rosendale (R-Md.), and Greg Steube (R-Fla.).\nNotice that neither Republican US Representatives Jim Jordan nor James Comer are among the 19 Republicans who voted for freedom instead of for a police state.\nNotice that neither Republican US Representatives Jim Jordan nor James Comer are among the 19 Republicans who voted for freedom instead of for a police state. Considering the massive and unattended problems threatening the US and the total absence of leadership and recognition of reality, the prospect that the US will exist beyond 2024 is in question.\nAll but 3 of the 19 Republicans who voted for freedom are from the South, the repository of Freedom in America.\nThe only freedom favored by the West and NE coasts liberal populations is the freedom for criminals and sexual perverts to be normalized and unpunished, and for preferred minorities to be permitted to riot and loot without consequence to them.\nThe Best of Paul Craig Roberts\nTags:\nTags: $post_author: WP_User Object ( [data] => stdClass Object ( [ID] => 179 [user_login] => paul-craig-roberts [user_pass] => 81c4d39335d8fb75beae24f3000c9e4e [user_nicename] => paul-craig-roberts [user_email] => [email protected] [user_url] => [user_registered] => 2011-12-07 15:12:37 [user_activation_key] => [user_status] => 0 [display_name] => Paul Craig Roberts [type] => wpuser ) [ID] => 179 [caps] => Array ( [contributor] => 1 ) [cap_key] => wp_capabilities [roles] => Array ( [0] => contributor ) [allcaps] => Array ( [edit_posts] => 1 [read] => 1 [level_1] => 1 [level_0] => 1 [delete_posts] => 1 [email_single_user] => 1 [contributor] => 1 ) [filter] => [site_id:WP_User:private] => 1 ) get_the_author_meta: $bio: Paul Craig Roberts, a former Assistant Secretary of the US Treasury and former associate editor of the Wall Street Journal, has been reporting shocking cases of prosecutorial abuse for two decades.

            "summary": "The contentious 2024 presidential primary contest between Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump didn't sour Republicans on the governor in the state both men call home.\nIn fact, more Florida Republicans view DeSantis favorably than Trump, and the governor also has a higher overall favorability rating, according to a new survey.\nThe USA TODAY/Ipsos poll found that 90% of Florida Republicans view DeSantis favorably, compared with 80% for Trump. Among all Floridians 18 and older, DeSantis is viewed favorably by 47% and Trump 42%.\nBoth Republicans fared better than President Joe Biden, who is viewed favorably by 34% of Floridians.\nThe survey found Trump leading Biden in Florida by eight percentage points, which is not surprising in a state that increasingly has trended red. DeSantis coasted to reelection in 2022 by 19 percentage points.\nThat DeSantis is more popular than Trump in their home state after being thrashed by the former president is notable, though.\nTrump disparaged the governor as 'DeSanctimonious' and mocked him relentlessly for months. DeSantis dropped out of the presidential race shortly after a distant second place finish to Trump in the Iowa Caucus and well before Florida's March 19 primary that Trump won handily over former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.\nPolls showed DeSantis poised to lose badly to Trump in Florida, noted University of Central Florida political science professor Aubrey Jewett. So while DeSantis may have broader appeal, Trump still has the hearts of many Florida Republicans.\n'This suggests that while DeSantis popularity among Florida Republicans is wider than Trump, Trump's support is deeper than DeSantis,' Jewett said.\nStill, DeSantis doesn't appear to have permanently damaged himself within the GOP by running against Trump. That's despite Trump saying his MAGA base had turned on the governor for his perceived disloyalty.\n'MAGA will never support DeSanctimonious again,' Trump posted on Truth Social last year.\nHard right governing could be a challenge for DeSantis in 2028\nThe new survey indicates Trump's voters aren't as angry about DeSantis challenging him as the former president.\n'It sort of feels like the Republican electorate is sort of let bygones be bygones,' said Ipsos pollster Chris Jackson, who noted that 87% of respondents who are voting for Trump still have a favorable view of DeSantis.\nDeSantis campaigned to the right of Trump, assiduously courting base conservatives.

That could be a problem for the term-limited Florida governor should he make it to a future general election for president.\n'It does sort of illustrate the challenges with MAGA republicanism,\" Jackson said. \"You can be extremely popular with the base but it risks alienating everyone not part of that MAGA base and it looks like that's something DeSantis has done to himself.\"\nDeSantis rocketed to national prominence as governor with an aggressive conservative agenda, including legislation targeting how racial issues are taught in schools and a bill limiting discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom.

            "summary": "Arizona Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Kari Lake is personally reaching out to GOP lawmakers in the state Legislature in an effort to drum up support to repeal the 1864 abortion law that threatens her chances in November's election, Politico reported Thursday.\nOn Tuesday the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that the state could indeed criminally prosecute women who get an abortion unless, and only if, the life of the mother were in danger. A day later, Lake was on the phone whipping votes with members of the GOP-controlled Arizona House and Senate, according to the report.\n\"In the 1860s, we weren't even a state. We used to hang people who were stealing horses and cattle. We don't do that anymore. They didn't have the medical expertise; we didn't have the research; and women couldn't even vote. Slavery was still legal in the United States,\" state Republican Rep. David Cook told Politico. \"We need to modernize this law for people today.\"\nAt stake is Lake's race against Democrat Rep. Ruben Gallego. The Arizona Senate seat, to replace independent Kyrsten Sinema, is one of a handful that will determine whether Republicans can take back the Senate in November.\nLake also released a video Thursday, stressing her opposition to \"this total ban on abortion.\" However, she's also on record showing support for it. Democrats have been propagating a 2022 video of an interview during which Lake called the 1864 ban a \"great law,\" adding that \"life begins at conception.\"\n\"Anytime we're talking about something from the mid-19th century, it's problematic,\" a GOP strategist told Politico. \"It reflects poorly on Arizona, and it distracts from the issues that are beneficial to Republicans.\"\nFormer President Donald Trump weighed in Wednesday, saying that the court \"went too far\" but that it would \"be straightened out\" and \"taken care of, I think, pretty quickly.\"\nHowever, Politico reported that only a handful of Republicans in the Legislature are willing to repeal the law. Republican state Rep. Matt Gress tried to start a vote to repeal Wednesday but was shot down by fellow Republicans.\nPro-choice advocates have already been collecting signatures in an effort to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot in November that would enshrine the right to an abortion up to 24 weeks.",

            "excerpt": "Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump feuded in the GOP presidential primary, but it didn't hurt DeSantis in Florida, a new poll finds.",
            "summary": "The contentious 2024 presidential primary contest between Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump didn't sour Republicans on the governor in the state both men call home.\nIn fact, more Florida Republicans view DeSantis favorably than Trump, and the governor also has a higher overall favorability rating, according to a new survey.\nThe USA TODAY/Ipsos poll found that 90% of Florida Republicans view DeSantis favorably, compared with 80% for Trump. Among all Floridians 18 and older, DeSantis is viewed favorably by 47% and Trump 42%.\nBoth Republicans fared better than President Joe Biden, who is viewed favorably by 34% of Floridians.\nThe survey found Trump leading Biden in Florida by eight percentage points, which is not surprising in a state that increasingly has trended red. DeSantis coasted to reelection in 2022 by 19 percentage points.\nThat DeSantis is more popular than Trump in their home state after being thrashed by the former president is notable, though.\nTrump disparaged the governor as 'DeSanctimonious' and mocked him relentlessly for months. DeSantis dropped out of the presidential race shortly after a distant second place finish to Trump in the Iowa Caucus and well before Florida's March 19 primary that Trump won handily over former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.\nPolls showed DeSantis poised to lose badly to Trump in Florida, noted University of Central Florida political science professor Aubrey Jewett. So while DeSantis may have broader appeal, Trump still has the hearts of many Florida Republicans.\n'This suggests that while DeSantis popularity among Florida Republicans is wider than Trump, Trump's support is deeper than DeSantis,' Jewett said.\nStill, DeSantis doesn't appear to have permanently damaged himself within the GOP by running against Trump. That's despite Trump saying his MAGA base had turned on the governor for his perceived disloyalty.\n'MAGA will never support DeSanctimonious again,' Trump posted on Truth Social last year.\nHard right governing could be a challenge for DeSantis in 2028\nThe new survey indicates Trump's voters aren't as angry about DeSantis challenging him as the former president.\n'It sort of feels like the Republican electorate is sort of let bygones be bygones,' said Ipsos pollster Chris Jackson, who noted that 87% of respondents who are voting for Trump still have a favorable view of DeSantis.\nDeSantis campaigned to the right of Trump, assiduously courting base conservatives. His attacks on Trump were typically limited to policy issues, or arguments about electability, and not harsh personal criticism.\nThat might have limited his effectiveness in the Republican presidential primary, \"but in the longer run he did not alienate most Florida Republicans,' Jewett said.\n\"DeSantis clearly has not harmed himself permanently among Florida Republicans by challenging Trump,\" Jewett said. \"Most GOP voters did not want DeSantis to run right now, but they still like him and apparently are not holding it against him.\"\nHowever, Jackson noted that just 15% of Florida Democrats and 39% of independents view DeSantis favorably after years of hard right governing and campaigning. That could be a problem for the term-limited Florida governor should he make it to a future general election for president.\n'It does sort of illustrate the challenges with MAGA republicanism,\" Jackson said. \"You can be extremely popular with the base but it risks alienating everyone not part of that MAGA base and it looks like that's something DeSantis has done to himself.\"\nDeSantis rocketed to national prominence as governor with an aggressive conservative agenda, including legislation targeting how racial issues are taught in schools and a bill limiting discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom. The later measure prompted a high-profile fight with Disney.\nSince losing to Trump, DeSantis has remained active, traveling the state to promote tough-on-crime legislation and other bills. He is viewed as a potential candidate for president in 2028.\nThe USA TODAY/Ipsos survey of 1,014 Floridians 18 and older was conducted April 5-7. It has 4.1 point margin of error, and 6.4 points for Republicans.",

            "excerpt": "Mike Johnson, relatively unknown on the national stage when he emerged as a compromise candidate among Republicans to become speaker, finds his job in jeopardy",
            "summary": "washington — An inexperienced House speaker facing a brewing intraparty rebellion as he seeks bipartisan compromise to push through defense funding for Ukraine and Israel got a boost on Friday from the presumptive Republican party presidential nominee, Donald Trump. \"He's doing a really good job under very tough circumstances,\" Trump, at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, said at the start of a news conference with House Speaker Mike Johnson. Trump suggested Republicans push for making additional U.S. military aid to Ukraine \"in the form of a loan rather than a gift.\" Johnson, a Republican congressman from the state of Louisiana who has been House speaker since October, made no statement about the aid. But Trump's stance is likely to hold sway over many House Republicans. Johnson, according to Republican Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, has been negotiating with the White House about a package that would deviate from the Senate's $95 billion foreign security legislation.\nThe most contentious elements involve aid for Ukraine, locked in a defensive war against Russia, and for Israel, which has been on the offensive in Gaza against Hamas.\nJohnson's job in jeopardy\nJohnson's job in jeopardy Johnson, relatively unknown on the national stage when he emerged as a compromise candidate among Republicans to become House speaker, finds his job in jeopardy. Republicans are bitterly divided on further U.S. military aid for Ukraine.\n\"I'm not giving Ukraine any money, never have, never will,\" responded Representative Troy Nehls to a question from VOA's Ukrainian Service on Thursday. \"Can anybody tell me what the strategy is for Ukraine?\"\nNehls — who is among the Republican lawmakers who falsely assert the 2020 presidential election was \"rigged\" in favor of President Joe Biden — predicted if Trump is again elected president in November, Russian forces \"will be out of Ukraine by April 1st.\"\nAnother Republican in the House, Keith Self of the state of Texas, wants any support for Ukraine tied to increased funding for security at the U.S. Southern border with Mexico.\nSelf told VOA that while Kyiv awaits further aid from Washington, it should turn to European countries for help.\n\"I think Europe is starting to realize that they need to take care of their own backyard,\" said Self, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\nIf Johnson is seen as acceding to the desires of Democrats, it would likely expand the number of Republican lawmakers dissatisfied with his leadership.\nJohnson is compelled to work with the Democrats on major legislation because his party retains a thin majority in the House.\nDemocrats disagree about Israel\nDemocrats disagree about Israel The Democratic Party leader in the House, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New Jersey, has suggested Democrats will help Johnson retain his position if the speaker helps push over the finish line the national security package sent by the Senate, where Democrats enjoy a majority, to the Republican-controlled House chamber.\nThe Democrats face their own disagreement over the bill, with some opposing sending offensive weaponry from the United States to Israel while it engages in its campaign in Gaza that, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry, has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians.\n\"I'm looking at the possibility of a Ukraine-only [funding] bill\" to avoid further delays, Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from the state of Washington who is chair of the left-wing congressional progressive caucus, told VOA's Ukrainian Service.\nNot aiding Ukraine \"is malpractice on our part,\" according to Representative Madeleine Dean, who termed the hesitation among some lawmakers in both parties \"literally un-American\" and appeasing Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\"I can't tell you how strongly I feel about it, how upset and angry I am,\" the Pennsylvania Democrat added as she became emotional on the steps of the Capitol.\nThe task of reaching consensus in the House rests primarily on the shoulders of Johnson, a hard-right litigator who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential election. The Trump loyalist is the least experienced speaker in nearly a century and a half.\nJohnson's visit on Friday to Trump's Florida resort home was seen as an attempt by the weakened House speaker to be shored up by the former president. Trump's backing has been pivotal for top Republicans to stay in their positions or gain them.\nHis lack of support for the previously elected House speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California, and Republican National Committee Chair Ronna Romney McDaniel led to exits from their respective leadership jobs.",

            "summary": "Combination picture showing Mike Johnson and Donald Trump.\nThe Republican Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, travelled to Florida yesterday to huddle with Donald Trump in the latest sign of the hard-right presidential candidate's informal, yet undisputed leadership of the party.Little was said about the agenda for the gathering, other than it will cover 'election integrity' – Trump code words for his attacks on US democracy based around the false claim of widespread voter fraud.A news conference was scheduled later.Trump was ejected from the White House in 2020 by Democrat Joe Biden and was shunned by most senior Republicans for his attempts to overturn the election result, culminating with a riot by his supporters through the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.However, Trump has regained his political momentum on the right as he seeks a shock return to the presidency this November and he exercises a powerful grip in Congress – notably steering the Republican blockage of US war aid to Ukraine.For Johnson, the trek from Washington to see Trump comes as he tries to save himself from a rebellion on the far-right of his party, which threatens to eject him from the speakership.Johnson, a long-time Trump loyalist, is walking a tightrope as he tries to balance the demands from his party's relative moderates and the Democrats to pass bills, including the aid to embattled Ukraine.The result so far has largely been paralysis in the House.For Ukraine, the results have been dire, with ammunition-strapped forces increasingly unable to fend off Russian bombardments of the frontlines and civilian targets.President Joe Biden has implored Congress to approve a bill worth $60bn in war aid. However, despite Republicans and Democrats coming together in the Senate, Johnson has so far refused even to set a vote in the House.Trump and his closest congressional allies have turned sharply on Ukraine, which has been battling a Russian invasion for more than two years.In his latest comments on Wednesday, Johnson remained vague about his plans on Ukraine, saying: 'There are a lot of different ideas.'Johnson gained the Speaker's gavel in a weeks-long October nominating battle after a handful of House Republican hardliners orchestrated the ouster of his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy.Another party hardliner, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, has threatened to make a similar move against Johnson if he allows a vote on more aid for Ukraine.The appearance at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Florida resort with the Republican presidential candidate could help Johnson's standing with his 218-213 majority.His own members have repeatedly torpedoed his legislative priorities, including this week by temporarily blocking the surveillance bill and in February, when it took two efforts to advance a bid to approve articles of impeachment against Biden's top border official, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.The meeting with Trump presents Johnson with a chance to demonstrate a united front with the former president that Republicans say is necessary if the party is to retain control of the House and capture both the Senate and the White House in November.'We've got to get on the same page about where we want the party to go,' said Representative Kevin Hern, who leads the conservative Republican Study Committee, the biggest House Republican caucus.'I don't think we've all heard directly how the president and the speaker are aligned,' Hern added. 'We've got to get in lockstep as the Republican Party.'Greene this week has repeated her threats to force a vote to remove Johnson from leadership.'Our voters will not support a Republican Party that continues like his leadership has been,' Greene told reporters after a meeting with Johnson on Wednesday. 'We have to have changed behaviour that supports the policies that the American people are supporting under President Trump.'Disorder within the caucus has repeatedly forced Johnson to use a parliamentary manoeuvre bypassing Republican hardliners and relying on substantial Democratic support to pass critical legislation, such as bills averting government shutdowns.",

            "excerpt": "The Senate candidate has called state legislators to offer her support in any effort to repeal the law and revert to the 15-week abortion ban, according to a person familiar with the outreach.",
            "summary": "A handful of Arizona Republican legislators looking to overturn a 160-year-old state law that bans nearly all abortions have a new high-profile supporter: Kari Lake, a prominent Senate candidate and a close ally of Donald Trump.\nThe state Supreme Court's ruling Tuesday that upheld the 1864 law, from before Arizona was a state, set off a political firestorm, with Democrats predicting it would cause women to turn out in droves in a key swing state to protect access to abortion rights.\nNow, some Republicans are looking for a way out of their political dilemma after their party blocked efforts to reverse the law. They see Lake, who is in a competitive race that could determine control of the Senate, as an important ally. Lake has called a handful of state legislators to offer her support in any effort to repeal the law and revert to the 15-week abortion ban that was in effect in Arizona, according to a person familiar with the outreach.\nThe new stance is an abrupt about-face for many Arizona Republicans, who cheered when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and then pushed quickly for reinstating the near-total ban from 1864. Lake herself had praised the 160-year-old ban during her 2022 run for governor, calling it a 'great law,' but Tuesday condemned the court decision, saying it was 'out of step with Arizonans.'\nOther Republicans followed suit.\n'It is time for my legislative colleagues to find common ground of common sense: the first step is to repeal the territorial law,' state Sen. Shawnna Bolick posted on X. It was a departure for Bolick, who once signed on to a law that would require prosecutors to charge women who have abortions with homicide and voted for the 15-week ban in 2022, legislation that included a provision allowing the 1864 law to go into effect.\nThe Republican backtracking reflects just how sharply public opinion has shifted on abortion since the Supreme Court's consequential ruling and how damaging the issue has been to their party. State laws on abortion enacted since Roe was overturned fueled strong showings by Democratic candidates in the 2022 midterms, and voters have turned out in force to protect abortion rights when they have been on the ballot, even in red states.\nStill, the shift in tone went only so far. As Arizona Democrats clamored for votes and debate on proposals to repeal the 1864 ban Wednesday, they were blocked by Republicans, who quickly shut down legislative proceedings and voted to adjourn until next week.\nThe 1864 law outlaws abortion from the moment of conception, with an exception only to save the life of a mother, and does not make allowances for rape or incest. The 15-week ban also lacks exceptions for rape or incest.\nThe state Senate president, Warren Petersen, and the state House speaker, Ben Toma, both Republicans, supported the abortion ban. Despite pressure from Democrats, women's groups and even some Republicans, they have signaled they are in no hurry to repeal it.\n'We as an elected body are going to take the time needed to listen to our constituents,' Toma said, adding that the Republican-controlled House would not 'rush legislation on a topic of this magnitude.'\nDemocrats said it was urgent to pass a repeal before the court's ruling upholding the 1864 law takes effect. 'Today's legislative action was unconscionable,' Gov. Katie Hobbs of Arizona, a Democrat, wrote on X. 'The extremist Republican majority had the chance to do the right thing for their constituents, and they failed.'\nTrump, after months of mixed signals — including privately telling allies he liked the idea of a 16-week federal ban — said this week that abortion restrictions should be left to the states, and then Wednesday criticized the Arizona ruling and said he would not sign a federal ban.\nLake, who frequently stated her opposition to abortion on the campaign trail in 2022 and called it the 'ultimate sin,' has been emblematic of a Republican shift on the issue. Last year, she said she opposed a federal ban on the procedure and would focus on passing policies giving financial benefits to women who chose to have children.\nOn Thursday, she posted a 5 1/2-minute video on X, trying to carve out a middle ground on the issue by describing her own decision to have a baby.\n'I agree with President Trump: We must have exceptions for rape, incest and the life of a mother,' Lake said in the video. 'As your senator, I will oppose federal funding for abortion and federal banning of abortion.'\nOther Arizona Republicans have come out against the near-total ban, including Reps. Juan Ciscomani and David Schweikert, both of whom are in competitive districts. Ciscomani said he still supported the 15-week ban, while Schweikert, who in the past co-sponsored a bill that would have amounted to a federal abortion ban, called on the state Legislature 'to address this issue immediately.'\nDemocrats highlighted the Republicans' shift, saying they were hypocritical and papering over their anti-abortion histories.\n'Arizona's MAGA Republicans are lying about their long and detailed history of following Trump's lead in taking away reproductive rights,' one email from the state Democratic Party read, echoing national Democrats' messaging on abortion. Hannah Goss, a spokesperson for Rep. Ruben Gallego, the Democrat who is poised to face Lake, said her 'long-standing record of wanting to ban abortion is clear.'",

            "summary": "PHOENIX — Pew Research Center has been surveying registered voters for decades to ask if they consider themselves Republicans or Democrats.\nIn the late 90s, the gap between the two parties was narrow with Democrats having a slight advantage.\nIn 2003, Democrats took the lead and never relinquished it.\nThe gap spread to its widest in 2008 but narrowed to the parties running even in 2022. By the following year, Democrats had shifted a point ahead but it was the closest the parties have been before a presidential election year in two decades.\nA major reason for the narrow gap is the trend of voters sorting into the two parties by large demographic cohorts like age, race, and education which has continued with little change in momentum.\nBefore 1999, there was little difference between the party preferences of voters by what decade they were born in. In the decade that followed, a pattern emerged in which older voters began identifying at higher rates as Republicans and younger voters as Democrats.\nBy 2023, the difference between voters born in the 1940s and those born in the 1990s preferred the opposing party by a twenty-point margin.\nAnother big trend reported by Pew is the sorting of voters by education and gender.\nBy gender alone men are more Republican by a six-point margin while women are seven points more Democratic.\nIn recent years, more than half of men with college degrees said they were Democrats while men without college degrees, already more Republican, now lean to the right by ten points.\nFor women, the effect is the opposite. The largest spread by gender and education belongs to women with college degrees who are twenty-three points more Democratic. Women who do not have a college degree historically have also leaned Democratic, according to Pew's data, but since 2022 most of them now identify as Republican.\nPew also identified key demographic groups who identify most with either political party.\nFor Republicans, white evangelical protestants were the most loyal group. They make up 17% of registered voters and 85% of them identify as Republicans.\nBy contrast, the most loyal Democratic group was Black voters, who make up 11% of registered voters and 83% identify as Democrats.\nTo see the full report, click here.",

            "excerpt": "Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump feuded in the GOP presidential primary, but it didn't hurt DeSantis in Florida, a new poll finds.",
            "summary": "The contentious 2024 presidential primary contest between Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump didn't sour Republicans on the governor in the state both men call home.\nIn fact, more Florida Republicans view DeSantis favorably than Trump, and the governor also has a higher overall favorability rating, according to a new survey.\nThe USA TODAY/Ipsos poll found that 90% of Florida Republicans view DeSantis favorably, compared with 80% for Trump. Among all Floridians 18 and older, DeSantis is viewed favorably by 47% and Trump 42%.\nBoth Republicans fared better than President Joe Biden, who is viewed favorably by 34% of Floridians.\nThe survey found Trump leading Biden in Florida by eight percentage points, which is not surprising in a state that increasingly has trended red. DeSantis coasted to reelection in 2022 by 19 percentage points.\nThat DeSantis is more popular than Trump in their home state after being thrashed by the former president is notable, though.\nTrump disparaged the governor as 'DeSanctimonious' and mocked him relentlessly for months. DeSantis dropped out of the presidential race shortly after a distant second place finish to Trump in the Iowa Caucus and well before Florida's March 19 primary that Trump won handily over former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.\nPolls showed DeSantis poised to lose badly to Trump in Florida, noted University of Central Florida political science professor Aubrey Jewett. So while DeSantis may have broader appeal, Trump still has the hearts of many Florida Republicans.\n'This suggests that while DeSantis popularity among Florida Republicans is wider than Trump, Trump's support is deeper than DeSantis,' Jewett said.\nStill, DeSantis doesn't appear to have permanently damaged himself within the GOP by running against Trump. That's despite Trump saying his MAGA base had turned on the governor for his perceived disloyalty.\n'MAGA will never support DeSanctimonious again,' Trump posted on Truth Social last year.\nHard right governing could be a challenge for DeSantis in 2028\nThe new survey indicates Trump's voters aren't as angry about DeSantis challenging him as the former president.\n'It sort of feels like the Republican electorate is sort of let bygones be bygones,' said Ipsos pollster Chris Jackson, who noted that 87% of respondents who are voting for Trump still have a favorable view of DeSantis.\nDeSantis campaigned to the right of Trump, assiduously courting base conservatives. His attacks on Trump were typically limited to policy issues, or arguments about electability, and not harsh personal criticism.\nThat might have limited his effectiveness in the Republican presidential primary, \"but in the longer run he did not alienate most Florida Republicans,' Jewett said.\n\"DeSantis clearly has not harmed himself permanently among Florida Republicans by challenging Trump,\" Jewett said. \"Most GOP voters did not want DeSantis to run right now, but they still like him and apparently are not holding it against him.\"\nHowever, Jackson noted that just 15% of Florida Democrats and 39% of independents view DeSantis favorably after years of hard right governing and campaigning. That could be a problem for the term-limited Florida governor should he make it to a future general election for president.\n'It does sort of illustrate the challenges with MAGA republicanism,\" Jackson said. \"You can be extremely popular with the base but it risks alienating everyone not part of that MAGA base and it looks like that's something DeSantis has done to himself.\"\nDeSantis rocketed to national prominence as governor with an aggressive conservative agenda, including legislation targeting how racial issues are taught in schools and a bill limiting discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom. The later measure prompted a high-profile fight with Disney.\nSince losing to Trump, DeSantis has remained active, traveling the state to promote tough-on-crime legislation and other bills. He is viewed as a potential candidate for president in 2028.\nThe USA TODAY/Ipsos survey of 1,014 Floridians 18 and older was conducted April 5-7. It has 4.1 point margin of error, and 6.4 points for Republicans.",

It is their first public meeting since Mr Johnson became speaker in November.\nIt comes as members of Mr Johnson's party are calling for him to be ousted from his leadership post.\nHouse Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a motion to remove Mr Johnson three weeks ago, accusing him of aligning with Democrats on Ukraine aid.\nFriday's Mar-a-Lago meeting could prove mutually beneficial for the two men.\nThe announced purpose of the visit is to address \"election integrity\", which has been one of the former president's top issues. Mr Trump has attributed his 2020 presidential defeat to ballot fraud, but he has provided no evidence to substantiate his claims.\nThe speaker's visit and expected remarks on the topic would lend further Republican institutional support to the former president's grievances.\nFor Mr Johnson, the meeting could act as a counterweight to Ms Greene's efforts to push him out of the speakership. She considers herself a close ally of the former president and has acted as a surrogate for him on the presidential campaign trail.\nIn a letter penned on Tuesday to her Republican colleagues, Ms Greene warned that she will not tolerate Mr Johnson \"serving the Democrats and the Biden administration\" over his own party \"and helping them achieve their policies\".\nShe has accused him of helping Democrats to pass spending legislation, but his recent effort to provide Ukraine more military aid appeared to spark her objection.\nOn 22 March, she filed her motion to vacate Mr Johnson, telling reporters that he had \"betrayed\" Republicans.\nBut she has not yet indicated if or when she plans to force a floor vote on her motion.\nMr Trump and his campaign will want to avoid another chaotic leadership battle among Republicans in the House of Representatives ahead of the US presidential election in November. Polling showed that the fight in October undermined voters' confidence in the party.\nBy appearing publicly with Mr Johnson and showing support for the beleaguered speaker, the former president likely intends to dissuade Ms Greene from pushing her effort further.\nMr Johnson, for his part, could also use the former president's backing for several of his legislative priorities.\nMr Trump derailed the speaker's effort to renew a provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act earlier this week, but the legislation's passage has returned to the negotiating table.\nThe speaker is also planning to bring a long-awaited Ukraine military aid bill to a vote next week. The former president's backing, or at least a lack of vocal opposition, could pave the way for passage months after existing aid funding had lapsed.\nFriday's meeting is not the first between a Republican House leader and Mr Trump at Mar-a-Lago since the former president left the White House.\nJust over three years ago, in the aftermath of the 6 January attack on the US Capitol, Kevin McCarthy, who was then the House minority leader, travelled to Florida to meet with the former president.\nAt the time, Mr Trump was struggling to maintain his hold on the Republican Party after the chaotic end to his first presidential term.\nMr McCarthy provided a lifeline to Mr Trump, and the former president would go on to support the California congressman's bid to become the Speaker of the House when Republicans took control in January 2023.\nThe relationship became strained in the ensuing months, however, and the former president did little to help Mr McCarthy when a handful of Republicans launched a successful effort to oust him from the top congressional post last October.\nMr Johnson, who succeeded Mr McCarthy, is facing similar unrest in Republican ranks now - albeit from a smaller group. He, and many in the party's leadership, hope he will avoid his predecessor's fate.\nRepublican Party\nDonald Trump\nUS politics\nUnited States",

            "excerpt": "A new congressional resolution aligns Republicans with the financial industry's fight to preserve sky-high credit card late fees.",
            "summary": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's $8 cap on credit card late fees has had a wild ride on the road to implementation. After being finalized last month, the rule drew a lawsuit from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which sought an injunction in Fort Worth. No credit card companies are located in Fort Worth; the venue choice was made purely to ensure that the case would be heard by a right-wing federal judge.\nThe first district court judge assigned to the case owned a bunch of credit card company stocks and recused himself; the second judge, a Trump appointee, showed remarkable candor in saying the case had no business being in Fort Worth and should be heard in Washington. Then the far-right Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed with the Trump judge and tried to pull the case back to Texas. Then one of the authors of that opinion, it turned out, also owned a bunch of credit card company stocks. He has asked for briefings on whether he should recuse himself, basically seeking outside opinions on his own personal corruption.\nthat opinion, it turned out, also owned a bunch of credit card company stocks. He has asked for briefings on whether he should recuse himself, basically seeking outside opinions on his own personal corruption.\nThat's not the only attack on the late fee rule. Now congressional Republicans are coming after it, in the process finally setting up a partisan fight over the popular issue of junk fees, which the Biden administration has been pushing for the past few years. Republicans, it turns out, are objectively in favor of junk fees. And by next week, they'll be on the record for them.\nMore from David Dayen\nMore from David Dayen\nRepublicans in the House and Senate have filed resolutions of disapproval of the late fee rule. Under the timetable set by the Congressional Review Act, such resolutions are fast-tracked through the Senate, giving the minority party the ability to get them to the floor, regardless of the majority leader's prerogatives. In the House, where Republicans are in charge (sort of), we could see the resolution get an up-or-down vote as soon as next week. That means Republicans themselves will have forced a vote on whether credit card late fees should be higher or lower. (Spoiler alert: They want them higher.)\nNot only that, but Tim Scott, the South Carolina senator who is on the short list to be Donald Trump's vice-presidential running mate, has taken on the role of the leading champion of junk fees. Scott, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, proudly announced this week that he's introduced the resolution to kill the late fee rule. He even listed all the corporate lobbyists who support him in the effort: 'the Consumer Bankers Association, America's Credit Unions, Independent Community Bankers of America, Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Americans for Tax Reform, Competitive Enterprise Institute, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.'\nSo here we have a potential VP pick and the financial industry teaming up to support junk fees. Every Republican, including those in swing districts, will now have to decide whether they support higher costs on Americans, which will be redistributed to the banks and the card companies.\nNot only does this vote put Republicans on the spot over junk fees, it's a doomed vote, completely initiated by their own possible VP nominee.\ndoomed vote, completely initiated by their own possible VP nominee.\nLet's step back and describe this late fee rule. The CARD Act of 2009, passed by Congress and signed by President Obama, barred credit card companies from imposing 'excessive' penalties and fees on customers. The Federal Reserve, an agency so bad at consumer protection that Congress created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to do the job for them, implemented the CARD Act rule by saying that late fees could only be equivalent to the costs credit card companies incur from late payments. But then the Fed instituted an absurdly large safe harbor, granting immunity for late fees as high as $30 for the first offense and $41 for subsequent ones.\nThis is in no way equivalent to the costs credit card companies actually incur from late payments. The CFPB did that work and calculated the amount to be around $8. Which meant the Fed's rule was giving a giant windfall to the credit card industry. It's expected that, when the rule is implemented, consumers will save $10 billion per year on reduced late fees; all of that, according to the CFPB's calculations, was excess profit for the banks.\nSen. Scott's claim is that there's no way such companies can provide credit without oversized fees. 'It will decrease the availability of credit card products and important financial services, particularly for Americans who need them most,' Scott said in a statement. In other words, poor Americans who struggle with their bills should be thankful that they're being squeezed for profit by financial institutions.\nThe CFPB did nothing more with this rule but apply the CARD Act as written, remove a handout to big banks, and limit a junk fee worth $10 billion a year. This is at a time when higher costs are top of mind for lots of Americans. Now there will be an actual vote in Congress, where Republicans will likely line up to unanimously demand higher costs.\nThe even crazier part about this is that there is no chance whatsoever that this gambit will work for Republicans. Democrats control the Senate, and I'd be surprised if any of them want to join with Republicans in supporting higher costs. Even on the off chance that this gets through the Senate, President Biden has championed eliminating junk fees and would surely veto the bill. There's no chance Republicans have enough votes to override him.\nSo not only does this vote put Republicans on the spot over junk fees, it's a doomed vote, completely initiated by their own possible VP nominee. It puts Republicans in an incredibly lonely position politically. Few causes poll better than eliminating junk fees. One poll from Data for Progress found junk fee prevention to be at nearly 80 percent support, including 72 percent of self-identified Republicans .\ndoomed vote, completely initiated by their own possible VP nominee. It puts Republicans in an incredibly lonely position politically. Few causes poll better than eliminating junk fees. One poll from Data for Progress found junk fee prevention to be at nearly 80 percent support, including 72 percent of self-identified Republicans.\nIn politics, an argument typically needs two sides for it to be elevated in the national conversation. 'We've seen Democratic unity on fighting surprise junk fees and naming corporate villains like credit card companies, banks, and airlines,' said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Institute, which worked with the Biden administration last year to arrange local events on junk fees in places like Michigan and Pennsylvania. 'What's been missing is opponents smoking themselves out and raising the volume of this fight so the public knows who is on their side.'\nNot only will there now be a debate, but there will be votes that can be pointed to in campaign ads. One party wants to save people from excessive and unnecessary fees, and the other wants to help companies impose those fees. The votes will help illustrate that.\nMaking this work requires competent campaign strategies and political communications. But for a while, the raw materials were not there. That's over. Republicans are objectively pro–junk fee.\nAnd the Democrats are eager to use that fact. White House Assistant Press Secretary Michael Kikukawa gave the Prospect this statement: 'As the most pro-competition president in decades, President Biden strongly supports the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's work to lower costs for consumers and take on corporate greed—including by cutting credit card late fees and saving Americans more than $20 billion in junk fees every year. Unfortunately, Congressional Republicans are siding with special interests and big corporations to try to undercut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which would raise costs and reduce options for consumers. The President won't let Republicans undercut hardworking families for the sake of corporate profits.'\nProspect this statement: 'As the most pro-competition president in decades, President Biden strongly supports the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's work to lower costs for consumers and take on corporate greed—including by cutting credit card late fees and saving Americans more than $20 billion in junk fees every year.

            "summary": "Sunday, April 14, 2024 | 2 a.m.\nSixteen months ago, incoming House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., was riding high. Despite the lack of an anticipated 'red wave,' Republicans had successfully taken control of the U.S. House of Representatives, breaking the Democratic legislative trifecta.\nScalise promised an 'ambitious' agenda that included 11 'ready-to-go' bills that would pass the House within the first two weeks of the new session.\nInstead, House Republicans spent the first week of the session bickering over who would be their own leader.\nRep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., described the fight for the speakership as 'chaotic.' Zinke would know: As Donald Trump's secretary of the interior, Zinke was an agent of chaos. He rode a horse down the streets of Washington, D.C. his first day of work, demanded a special flag be flown above the Interior Department when he was present and blamed wildfires on 'environmental terrorist groups.' If Zinke thought the process was chaotic, we can't imagine what was going on behind closed doors.\nAfter 15 floor votes, newly elected Speaker Kevin McCarthy promised to get to work governing the nation.\nWe all know what happened next.\nDuring its first year in power, one of the only accomplishments House Republicans could claim was ousting McCarthy and spending another three weeks bickering over who their next leader would be.\nMost its other accomplishments were the product of Democrats, who negotiated bipartisan compromises that kept the government from shutting down or defaulting on our debt despite the Republicans' enthusiastic efforts to demolish the American economy.\nThis year hasn't shown any signs of significant progress, as Speaker Mike Johnson has yet to quell the dysfunction, putting the 118th Congress on track to be the least productive since the Great Depression.\nAmerica — well, its red states at least — gave the House majority to a party that has no idea how to govern and never learned how to do it on the job.\nPersonal feuds, profound ideological differences and the presence of far-right extremists who don't believe in governance have eliminated the GOP's ability to accomplish anything without the help and support of Democrats.\nThe chaos, dysfunction and open fear of the threats of violence of a large faction of conservative voters have grown to such proportions that long-time GOP lawmakers are calling it quits and retiring early.\nFollowing the forced resignation of scandal-ridden Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., and the early retirement of seven other Republican lawmakers, the GOP will soon have only a two-vote majority.\nMoreover, 21 current Republican congressmen have announced that they won't seek reelection this year. According to reporting by The Washington Post, several more House Republicans have seriously considered retiring but decided to remain in office to prevent far-right extremists from gaining additional seats or power.\nAmong those leaving are four committee chairs and eight subcommittee chairs, including Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., a former Marine Corps intelligence officer who serves as chairman of the House Select Committee on Competition with the Chinese Communist Party.\nIn short, even far-right Republican lawmakers admit there is no hope for an America run by today's Republican Party.\nUpon announcing his retirement, former Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., a radical in his own right but not radical enough for today's party, condemned members of his party for their unwillingness to govern seriously in the interests of the American people and 'obsessively fixating on retribution and vengeance for contrived injustices of the past.'\nBuck isn't exactly a RINO, or 'Republican in name only.' His conservative credentials date back to the Koch-funded tea party movement, which was known for, among other shocking things, having followers who formed a gauntlet yelling racial slurs and spitting on Black congressmen on their way to the Capitol. It is telling that Buck thinks his party has sunk even lower from that gutter behavior. Recently he told The Washington Post that he believes the GOP is now focused exclusively on defending Trump and scoring political points.\n'Now, we're impeaching people like it's some kind of carnival,' Buck said, 'and the Constitution is just a thing of the past to the very same people who were tea party patriots 10 to 12 years ago.'\nHe said it was 'ironic' that he 'got a lot more good work done with the Democrats in charge' of the House than with his fellow Republicans leading. Unlike the MAGA extremists who now control the Republican Party, Democrats still believe in working for Americans and in institutions of government that compromise to pass laws in the interests of the nation as a whole.\nMAGA Republicans, on the other hand, refused to pass a Republican immigration bill because it might hurt Donald Trump's chances of being elected.\nRep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, admitted it by saying he wouldn't vote for the bill because 'I'm not willing to do too damn much right now to help a Democrat and to help Joe Biden's approval rating.'\nTake note: Nehls didn't say the bill was poorly written or unnecessary or contained bad policy, he said he wouldn't vote for it because it might help Biden's approval rating — America be damned.\nInstead, House Republicans impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for failing to take action to address the crisis at the border. Pot, meet kettle.\nThe damage the MAGA wing of the GOP is doing is lasting and not just on the border. Their refusal to provide aide to Ukraine is handing the country to Russia.\nIf all of that weren't enough, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. — recently and accurately dubbed 'Moscow Marge' for carrying Vladimir Putin's water — now wants to bring us back to where it all began, by removing Johnson as speaker and wasting even more time selecting yet another replacement.\nListen up, America. MAGA Republicans are telling us, straight to our face, that they don't have any constructive ideas for America and aren't interested in governance. Even if they were, their long-time Republican colleagues are telling us the MAGA wing of the party is incapable of anything more than vengeance politics and culture wars. They aren't serious people, they're just angry people who lack a vision for an American future.\nWe must not give them power in November. Not in the House, not in the Senate and certainly not in the White House.",

            "summary": "The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives voted to reauthorize a controversial surveillance program on Friday, in a major step toward keeping a key element of the United States' foreign intelligence-gathering operation in place.\nThe House passed a bill reauthorizing Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in a 273-147 vote. The FISA bill now moves to the Senate, which is expected to give it bipartisan approval. Without congressional action, the program will expire on April 19.\nFISA bill now moves to the Senate, which is expected to give it bipartisan approval. Without congressional action, the program will expire on April 19. Approval came after the duration of the bill was changed to two years from a previous version of five years, as some Republicans had sought.\nFISA has attracted criticism from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, who argue it violates Americans' constitutional right to privacy. The bill was blocked three times in the past five months by House Republicans bucking their party.\nFISA has attracted criticism from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, who argue it violates Americans' constitutional right to privacy. The bill was blocked three times in the past five months by House Republicans bucking their party. The White House, intelligence chiefs, and top lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee have warned of potentially catastrophic effects of not reauthorizing the program, which was first created in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\nThe reauthorization was thwarted earlier this week when House Republicans refused to support the bill House Speaker Mike Johnson had put forward, which fell short of the changes they wanted.\n\"We will go blind on April 19\" without the program, Representative Mike Turner, the Republican chair of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Wednesday.\nAlthough the right to privacy is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, the data of foreign nationals gathered by the program often includes communications with Americans, and can be mined by domestic law enforcement bodies such as the FBI without a warrant.\nThat has alarmed both hardline Republicans and far-left Democrats. Recent revelations that the FBI used this power to hunt for information about Black Lives Matter protesters, congressional campaign donors and U.S. lawmakers have raised further doubts about the program's integrity.\nA key issue has been an amendment which would require domestic law enforcement agencies to obtain warrants before searching the database. Executive branch officials argue that such a change would undermine the program's utility for agencies such as the FBI.\nThe amendment barely failed in a 212-212 vote ahead of the vote on the bill's final passage.",

            "summary": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The two parties in Pennsylvania's state House and its congressional delegation are nearly evenly divided, and that won't change once results are in from next week's primary election.\nBut come November, the candidates the parties will select April 23 for hundreds of legislative seats could alter what has been years of policy paralysis in Harrisburg and the similar partisan deadlock in Congress.\nThe state's voters will also cast primary ballots for this year's marquee contests for president and U.S. Senate. Democratic incumbents Joe Biden and Bob Casey and Republican challengers Donald Trump and Dave McCormick are shoo-ins to appear on the fall ballot.\nBoth parties will pick candidates for state attorney general, which was in Republican hands before Democrats went on a winning streak starting in 2012.\nIn the two other statewide 'row office' contests, Republicans Stacy Garrity, the treasurer, and Tim DeFoor, the auditor general, will find out which Democrats will try to unseat them in the fall.\nGENERAL ASSEMBLY\nIt took months and several special elections before Democrats were able to nail down their return to majority control of the state House last year, elevating one of their own to speaker in a chamber where the partisan breakdown is now 102-100. One seat, in a Poconos district where a Republican resigned in February, is vacant and will be filled by special election on primary day.\nWith the entire chamber on the ballot this year, Republicans would love to flip it back, denying Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro legislative leverage in policy and budget battles.\nIn the state Senate, where Republicans hold a 28-22 majority, Democrats would need to flip at least three seats in order for Democratic Lt. Gov. Austin Davis' tie-breaking vote to give them control.\nAmong the 25 Senate seats up this year, nearly half the total, or 12 incumbent senators, face no opponents this year.\nThere are contested Senate primaries in both parties for notable vacancies in a Republican-held seat in the Harrisburg area and a Democratic-held seat in Pittsburgh. The third vacancy is a Republican majority district in northern York County.\nLEGISLATIVE SHAKEUP\nDemocratic Rep. Nick Pisciottano, of Allegheny County, is leaving the House to run, along with two other Democrats and two Republicans, for a state Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Jim Brewster, D-Allegheny.\nRep. Dawn Keefer, R-York, is departing the lower chamber in a run to succeed retiring Sen. Mike Regan, R-York. Another House departure is Rep. Patty Kim, of Dauphin County, facing off against another Democrat for the nomination in the third Senate district involving a retirement, that of Sen. John DiSanto, R-Dauphin. Two Republicans also are vying to succeed DiSanto.\nDiSanto's seat is widely seen as the Senate Democrats' best chance for a pickup. Their longshot bid for the majority also likely would require beating Sen. Dan Laughlin, R-Erie, and Sen. Devlin Robinson, a first-term Republican whose district surrounds the western side of Pittsburgh.\nSen. Dave Argall, of Schuylkill County, who heads the GOP's Senate campaign effort, said a razor-close win for Brewster four years ago makes that a battleground, but their efforts to stay in the majority are wider.\n'There are going to be battles all across the state, but it's still pretty early to predict which ones are going to rise to the top of the list,' Argall said.\nLawmakers in nearly half of the 203 House seats, and slightly more Democrats than Republicans, have no primary or General Election opponents this year and can plan on serving another term starting in January.\nThere aren't many House vacancies this cycle: just nine seats held by Republicans and four by Democrats. Retiring members include Berks County Rep. Mark Rozzi, who spent a brief but notable time as House speaker early last year before fellow Democrats could muster the votes to elect their first choice to lead the chamber, Speaker Joanna McClinton of Philadelphia.\nReps. Ryan Mackenzie, of Lehigh County, and Rob Mercuri, of Allegheny, are relinquishing House seats to run in Republican primaries for Democratic-held congressional seats. Hedging their bets are Rep. Ryan Bizzarro, of Erie, and Rep. Jared Solomon, of Philadelphia, seeking reelection in the state House and running in Democratic primaries for state treasurer and state attorney general, respectively.\nCONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION\nAll 17 of Pennsylvania's incumbent members of the U.S. House of Representatives are running for another term, each with at least one opponent in the primary or fall elections. Court-ordered redistricting after the 2020 Census produced a 9-8 Democratic edge, and when the incumbents ran for reelection two years ago, all 17 were reelected.\nIn Allegheny County, freshman U.S. Rep. Summer Lee has a Democratic primary opponent, Bhavini Patel, as well as a Republican positioned to take on the Democratic winner in November.\nIn a district Democrats hope to flip, a race north of Philadelphia could signal how much power the abortion issue has in the suburbs. U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a centrist Republican, has a primary opponent whose anti-abortion position would not permit exceptions for rape or incest.\nThere is a three-way GOP primary for the nomination to take on Lehigh Valley Democratic U.S. Rep. Susan Wild in the fall. Wild's previous two wins were by single-digit margins. Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Democrat from the Scranton area who also has been repeatedly targeted in recent years, has no primary opponent, but a Republican looks to challenge him in November.\nSix Democrats are on the primary ballot in a district held by U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, a York County Republican who was deeply involved in efforts by then-President Donald Trump to overturn Trump's 2020 election defeat. Perry's prominent role in the ultra-right Freedom Caucus in Congress and some close reelection contests over the past six years also are making him a target for Democrats this year.\nSTATEWIDE ROW OFFICES\nAfter Shapiro's election as governor two years ago created a vacancy in his former job as state attorney general, he nominated his protege, Michelle Henry, to serve through the end of this year. She is not seeking to stay in the job.\nFive Democrats are running for the nomination: Philadelphia attorney Keir Bradford-Grey, former auditor general and state Rep. Eugene DePasquale, of Allegheny County, former prosecutor and Bucks County solicitor Joe Khan, Philadelphia state Rep. Jared Solomon and Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer.\nTwo Republicans are running: York County District Attorney Dave Sunday and state Rep. Craig Williams, of Delaware County. Sunday received his party's endorsement, while Williams has been helping lead House Republicans' efforts to remove from office progressive Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat.\nFor auditor general, state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, of Philadelphia, and Lehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley are the Democrats seeking to run against DeFoor in November. Kenyatta finished third in the Democratic U.S. Senate primary in 2022 won by John Fetterman.\nGarrity, the state treasurer, has no opposition in the GOP primary. Democratic voters will choose between Bizzarro and Erin McClelland, an addiction recovery and human services professional from Allegheny County.",

            "summary": "Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson is set to appear side-by-side with Donald Trump on Friday at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.\nIt is their first public meeting since Mr Johnson became speaker in November.\nIt comes as members of Mr Johnson's party are calling for him to be ousted from his leadership post.\nHouse Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a motion to remove Mr Johnson three weeks ago, accusing him of aligning with Democrats on Ukraine aid.\nFriday's Mar-a-Lago meeting could prove mutually beneficial for the two men.\nWho is the Speaker of the House Mike Johnson?\nThe announced purpose of the visit is to address \"election integrity\", which has been one of the former president's top issues. Mr Trump has attributed his 2020 presidential defeat to ballot fraud, but he has provided no evidence to substantiate his claims.\nThe speaker's visit and expected remarks on the topic would lend further Republican institutional support to the former president's grievances.\nFor Mr Johnson, the meeting could act as a counterweight to Ms Greene's efforts to push him out of the speakership. She considers herself a close ally of the former president and has acted as a surrogate for him on the presidential campaign trail.\nIn a letter penned on Tuesday to her Republican colleagues, Ms Greene warned that she will not tolerate Mr Johnson \"serving the Democrats and the Biden administration\" over his own party \"and helping them achieve their policies\".\nShe has accused him of helping Democrats to pass spending legislation, but his recent effort to provide Ukraine more military aid appeared to spark her objection.\nOn 22 March, she filed her motion to vacate Mr Johnson, telling reporters that he had \"betrayed\" Republicans.\nBut she has not yet indicated if or when she plans to force a floor vote on her motion.\nMr Trump and his campaign will want to avoid another chaotic leadership battle among Republicans in the House of Representatives ahead of the US presidential election in November. Polling showed that the fight in October undermined voters' confidence in the party.\nBy appearing publicly with Mr Johnson and showing support for the beleaguered speaker, the former president likely intends to dissuade Ms Greene from pushing her effort further.\nMr Johnson, for his part, could also use the former president's backing for several of his legislative priorities.\nMr Trump derailed the speaker's effort to renew a provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act earlier this week, but the legislation's passage has returned to the negotiating table.\nThe speaker is also planning to bring a long-awaited Ukraine military aid bill to a vote next week. The former president's backing, or at least a lack of vocal opposition, could pave the way for passage months after existing aid funding had lapsed.\nFriday's meeting is not the first between a Republican House leader and Mr Trump at Mar-a-Lago since the former president left the White House.\nJust over three years ago, in the aftermath of the 6 January attack on the US Capitol, Kevin McCarthy, who was then the House minority leader, travelled to Florida to meet with the former president.\nAt the time, Mr Trump was struggling to maintain his hold on the Republican Party after the chaotic end to his first presidential term.\nMr McCarthy provided a lifeline to Mr Trump, and the former president would go on to support the California congressman's bid to become the Speaker of the House when Republicans took control in January 2023.\nThe relationship became strained in the ensuing months, however, and the former president did little to help Mr McCarthy when a handful of Republicans launched a successful effort to oust him from the top congressional post last October.\nMr Johnson, who succeeded Mr McCarthy, is facing similar unrest in Republican ranks now - albeit from a smaller group. He, and many in the party's leadership, hope he will avoid his predecessor's fate.",

DeSantis coasted to reelection in 2022 by 19 percentage points.\nThat DeSantis is more popular than Trump in their home state after being thrashed by the former president is notable, though.\nTrump disparaged the governor as 'DeSanctimonious' and mocked him relentlessly for months. DeSantis dropped out of the presidential race shortly after a distant second place finish to Trump in the Iowa Caucus and well before Florida's March 19 primary that Trump won handily over former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.\nPolls showed DeSantis poised to lose badly to Trump in Florida, noted University of Central Florida political science professor Aubrey Jewett. So while DeSantis may have broader appeal, Trump still has the hearts of many Florida Republicans.\n'This suggests that while DeSantis popularity among Florida Republicans is wider than Trump, Trump's support is deeper than DeSantis,' Jewett said.\nStill, DeSantis doesn't appear to have permanently damaged himself within the GOP by running against Trump. That's despite Trump saying his MAGA base had turned on the governor for his perceived disloyalty.\n'MAGA will never support DeSanctimonious again,' Trump posted on Truth Social last year.\nHard right governing could be a challenge for DeSantis in 2028\nThe new survey indicates Trump's voters aren't as angry about DeSantis challenging him as the former president.\n'It sort of feels like the Republican electorate is sort of let bygones be bygones,' said Ipsos pollster Chris Jackson, who noted that 87% of respondents who are voting for Trump still have a favorable view of DeSantis.\nDeSantis campaigned to the right of Trump, assiduously courting base conservatives. His attacks on Trump were typically limited to policy issues, or arguments about electability, and not harsh personal criticism.\nThat might have limited his effectiveness in the Republican presidential primary, \"but in the longer run he did not alienate most Florida Republicans,' Jewett said.\n\"DeSantis clearly has not harmed himself permanently among Florida Republicans by challenging Trump,\" Jewett said. \"Most GOP voters did not want DeSantis to run right now, but they still like him and apparently are not holding it against him.\"\nHowever, Jackson noted that just 15% of Florida Democrats and 39% of independents view DeSantis favorably after years of hard right governing and campaigning. That could be a problem for the term-limited Florida governor should he make it to a future general election for president.\n'It does sort of illustrate the challenges with MAGA republicanism,\" Jackson said. \"You can be extremely popular with the base but it risks alienating everyone not part of that MAGA base and it looks like that's something DeSantis has done to himself.\"\nDeSantis rocketed to national prominence as governor with an aggressive conservative agenda, including legislation targeting how racial issues are taught in schools and a bill limiting discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom. The later measure prompted a high-profile fight with Disney.\nSince losing to Trump, DeSantis has remained active, traveling the state to promote tough-on-crime legislation and other bills. He is viewed as a potential candidate for president in 2028.\nThe USA TODAY/Ipsos survey of 1,014 Floridians 18 and older was conducted April 5-7. It has 4.1 point margin of error, and 6.4 points for Republicans.",

            "summary": "New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R) said he supports former President Trump despite believing he 'contributed' to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\nSununu went back and forth with co-anchor George Stephanopoulos on ABC's 'This Week' on Sunday to explain why he is backing Trump despite condemning his actions leading up to Jan. 6. Stephanopoulos pressed Sununu on his statement released after the Jan. 6 attacks that stated Trump's 'rhetoric and actions contributed to the insurrection.'\nSununu, who has endorsed Trump , said Sunday that he stood by his statement.\n'I think he — his actions absolutely contributed to that. There's no question about that. I hate the election denialism of 2020. Nobody wants to be talking about that in 2024,' he said.\nHe said that while he believes Trump 'contributed' to the attack, he is backing Trump to elect a Republican to the White House.\n'Because for me, it's not about him as much as it is having a Republican administration — Republican secretaries, Republican rules, a sense where states' rights come first, individual rights come first, parents' rights come first,' he said.\n'It's not about Trump with me,' he added.\nSununu supported former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley during the Republican presidential primaries before she dropped out of the race last month. He has frequently criticized the former president and said last year he would work to narrow the 2024 GOP field in an effort to defeat Trump.\nStephanopoulos continued to press Sununu on his support for the former president on Sunday.\n'And you believe that someone — you believe that a president who contributed to an insurrection should be president again?' he asked.\n'As does 51 percent of America, George. I mean, really,' Sununu responded. 'I understand you're part of the media. I understand you're in this New York City bubble or whatever it is, but you've got to look around what's happening across this country. They're not — it's not about just supporting Trump. It's getting rid of what we have today.'\nSununu later reiterated that it is about the party ticket, not Trump.\n'I know you're shocked that the Republican governor is supporting a Republican president and the Republican ticket, but it's about the ticket. It's about up and down the ballot, right?' he said.\n'I want Republican governors and senators and congressmen, and that type of culture, if you will. I keep going back to that because that's exactly what it is. That's the change America is looking for,' he added.\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.",

Dan Newhouse in a notch against the Sunnyside, Wash., Republican who voted to impeach Trump follow the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n'Newhouse has to go,' Trump wrote in a Friday post to Truth Social. 'Jerrod Sessler is MAGA all the way, and has my complete and total endorsement — he will never let you down.'\nTrump also called the incumbent a 'weak and pathetic RINO,' or Republican in name only.\nNewhouse plans to run for a sixth term in Congress this year. The Tri-City Herald reached out to his campaign for comment but has not heard back yet.\nSessler is a businessman, U.S. Navy veteran and fellow Republican from Prosser.\nHe previously told the Herald that he's running to 'clinch up the purse strings' of Congress and unseat Newhouse, who he says doesn't represent the conservative values of central Washington voters.\nWhile he's never held public office, Sessler considers himself a political firebrand.\nHis time in the public spotlight also has been mired with controversies, including threats made against a Benton County code enforcement officer who visited his home in 2022 and tiffs against another candidate's campaign manager that same year.\n'#Honored,' Sessler wrote in a short post to X/Twitter that included a screenshot of Trump's endorsement.\nThis year will be Sessler's second try at ousting Newhouse.\nSessler and five other Republicans tried in 2022 to unseat the Fourth District congressman, but a crowded Republican field divided conservative votes and allowed the Sunnyside farmer to surf to an easy reelection victory.\nHe placed fourth in the August 2022 top-two primary election, earning 12% of the vote. Sessler was ultimately beaten out by Democrat Doug White, who received 25% and advanced alongside Newhouse to the general election.\nLoren Culp, the Trump-backed candidate in that primary, also outdid Sessler with 22% of the vote.\nNewhouse was the only pro-impeachment Republican to defeat a Trump-endorsed primary challenger that year.\nBut Republicans appear to be going for a more unifying strategy this cycle.\nWhen they meet next week in Spokane for their state convention, Republican delegates for the first time will vote to endorse a single candidate running in each of the major federal and statewide offices.\nThe Fourth Congressional District encompasses central Washington, stretching from the U.S.-Canada border down to the Columbia River. It includes Omak, East Wenatchee, Moses Lake, Yakima, the Yakama Indian Reservation and the Tri-Cities.\nIt's also Washington's most conservative-leaning congressional district. The 2022 Cook Partisan Voting Index rated it R+11 in 2022.",

            "summary": "The race for control of the White House and Congress in November are slated to be hotly contested elections, and both Republicans and Democrats face different challenges in those battles.\nWhile the presidential election between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will be the marquee matchup, several other races will be affected by key factors that could be make or break for both parties. Here are two issues likely to play a role in the key states in November.\nAbortion\nWith the overruling of Roe v. Wade in the Supreme Court ‘s 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the midterm elections later that year — which had been hyped as a 'red wave' — saw surprising Democratic over-performance. In states where abortion was on the ballot in 2022, including Michigan, it did not fare well for Republicans.\nLooking ahead to November, several key states may have abortion measures on the ballot alongside key Republican races.\nIn Florida, the state Supreme Court approved a ballot measure that would enshrine abortion into the state constitution if approved by 60% of voters in November. Democrats, who have not won a Senate or presidential race in the Sunshine State since 2012, are feeling better about their odds with abortion now on the ballot. The Florida GOP does not think it will tip the scales in Florida.\n'Florida voters know better and they will reject the radical agenda being pushed by FL Dems this November,' Florida Republican Party chairman Evan Power said in a statement earlier this month.\nIn several other states, including Montana, Arizona, and Nevada, where Democrats are hoping to keep Senate seats within their caucus, abortion measures may be on the ballot — but still have some steps to go.\nIn Arizona, the state Supreme Court upheld a strict ban, which outlaws the practice unless the mother faces immediate life-threatening conditions. The law, which dates back to 1864, has caused bipartisan backlash in the state, with Democrats and some Republicans arguing it is too restrictive.\nWith abortion becoming a hot-button issue in the Grand Canyon State, a critical state for Trump's electoral chances, the GOP's odds at flipping the Senate could be in jeopardy.\nDemocratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison outlined the stakes Democrats hope to convey for the November election.\n'The stakes are clear: Reproductive freedom is on the ballot in November, and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the only candidates who will fight to codify Roe and stand up for women's right to make their own health care decisions,' Harrison said in a statement after the Arizona Supreme Court ruling.\nTrump has attempted to neutralize the abortion issue for his race, by arguing it is a state's decision and calling for little action either way at the federal level. He did slam the 1864 Arizona law as being too far and called on lawmakers in the state to 'act immediately' on a 'common sense' solution.\nVoter registration advantage\nWhile Republicans may have abortion as a weakness going into November, Democrats are facing a numbers problem in some key states – voter registration.\nData from Pew Research shows that in the past four years, Democrats have lost a decisive edge it held over Republicans with registered voters. In 2020, 51% of registered voters identified or leaned Democrat compared to only 46% who said they identified or leaned Republican, but data from Pew now suggest Democrats only have a 49%-48% advantage over the GOP.\nIn Florida, where Democrats are hoping to make a play with abortion on the ballot, the GOP has overtaken Democrats in terms of voter registration since the last presidential election.\nAt this time in 2020, Democrats had a 97,215 voter registration advantage over Republicans. The Florida GOP currently has a registration of 892,034 voters compared to Florida Democrats, as of state data from the end of March.\nIn the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, Republicans have narrowed the gap with Democrats since the 2020 election as Democratic registration numbers have fallen in the succeeding years.\nRepublicans trailed Democrats in terms of registered voters by 685,818 voters in November 2020, but now the GOP only trails by 397,241 voters, according to the latest data from the state.",

            "summary": "Reuters | Washington DC | Updated: 13-04-2024 03:09 IST | Created: 13-04-2024 02:56 IST\nReuters | Washington DC | Updated: 13-04-2024 03:09 IST | Created: 13-04-2024 02:56 IST\nDonald Trump threw his support behind embattled U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson on Friday, as the two made a bid to demonstrate unity at a time when Johnson is trying to quell dissent within his fractious Republican majority.\n\"He's doing a really good job under very tough circumstances,\" Trump said at the start of a press conference with Johnson at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Johnson gained the speaker's gavel in a weeks-long October nominating battle after a handful of House Republican hardliners orchestrated the ouster of his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, a historic first.\nAnother party hardliner, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, has threatened to make a similar move against Johnson if he allows a vote on more aid for Ukraine as it struggles to fight off a Russian invasion. Greene had also voiced opposition to a surveillance bill the House passed on Friday. The appearance at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Florida resort with the Republican presidential candidate could help buck up Johnson's standing with his 218-213 majority. His own members have repeatedly torpedoed his legislative priorities, including this week by temporarily blocking the surveillance bill and in February, when it took two efforts to advance a bid to approve articles of impeachment against Democratic President Joe Biden's top border official, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\nTrump, who holds great sway with congressional Republicans, has also regularly weighed in on legislation, including killing a bipartisan U.S.-Mexico border security deal, passage of which could have weakened one of his key attacks against Biden. The meeting presented Johnson with a chance to show a united front with the former president that Republicans say is necessary if the party is to retain control of the House and capture both the Senate and the White House in November.\n\"We've got to get on the same page about where we want the party to go,\" said Representative Kevin Hern, who leads the conservative Republican Study Committee, the biggest House Republican caucus. \"I don't think we've all heard directly how the president and the speaker are aligned,\" Hern added. \"We've got to get in lockstep as the Republican Party.\"\nGreene this week has repeated her threats to force a vote to remove Johnson from leadership. \"Our voters will not support a Republican Party that continues like his leadership has been,\" Greene told reporters after a meeting with Johnson on Wednesday. \"We have to have changed behavior that supports the policies that the American people are supporting under President Trump.\"\nDisorder within the caucus has repeatedly forced Johnson to use a parliamentary maneuver bypassing Republican hardliners and relying on substantial Democratic support to pass critical legislation, such as bills averting government shutdowns. But strong support from Trump could neutralize Greene's ouster threat and spare a repeat of the chaos that ensued after McCarthy's ouster.\nTrump could also determine which path the speaker takes on Ukraine aid, despite appeals to approve the assistance from an unprecedented number of foreign leaders. \"As far as being able to move anything in the House, his support or lack thereof is actually incredibly impactful,\" Republican Representative Kelly Armstrong said.\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

            "excerpt": "Primary voters will soon cast ballots in narrowly divided Pennsylvania. The state is sure to be a presidential battleground in the fall.",
            "summary": "The two parties in Pennsylvania's state House and its congressional delegation are nearly evenly divided, and that won't change once results are in from next week's primary election.\nBut come November, the candidates the parties will select April 23 for hundreds of legislative seats could alter what has been years of policy paralysis in Harrisburg and the similar partisan deadlock in Congress.\nThe state's voters will also cast primary ballots for this year's marquee contests for president and U.S. Senate. Democratic incumbents Joe Biden and Bob Casey and Republican challengers Donald Trump and Dave McCormick are shoo-ins to appear on the fall ballot.\nBoth parties will pick candidates for state attorney general, which was in Republican hands before Democrats went on a winning streak starting in 2012.\nIn the two other statewide 'row office' contests, Republicans Stacy Garrity, the treasurer, and Tim DeFoor, the auditor general, will find out which Democrats will try to unseat them in the fall.\nIt took months and several special elections before Democrats were able to nail down their return to majority control of the state House last year, elevating one of their own to speaker in a chamber where the partisan breakdown is now 102-100. One seat, in a Poconos district where a Republican resigned in February, is vacant and will be filled by special election on primary day.\nWith the entire chamber on the ballot this year, Republicans would love to flip it back, denying Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro legislative leverage in policy and budget battles.\nBreaking news and the stories that matter to your neighborhood.\nIn the state Senate, where Republicans hold a 28-22 majority, Democrats would need to flip at least three seats in order for Democratic Lt. Gov. Austin Davis' tie-breaking vote to give them control.\nAmong the 25 Senate seats up this year, nearly half the total, or 12 incumbent senators, face no opponents this year.\nThere are contested Senate primaries in both parties for notable vacancies in a Republican-held seat in the Harrisburg area and a Democratic-held seat in Pittsburgh. The third vacancy is a Republican majority district in northern York County.\nDemocratic Rep. Nick Pisciottano, of Allegheny County, is leaving the House to run, along with two other Democrats and two Republicans, for a state Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Jim Brewster, D-Allegheny.\nRep. Dawn Keefer, R-York, is departing the lower chamber in a run to succeed retiring Sen. Mike Regan, R-York. Another House departure is Rep. Patty Kim, of Dauphin County, facing off against another Democrat for the nomination in the third Senate district involving a retirement, that of Sen. John DiSanto, R-Dauphin. Two Republicans also are vying to succeed DiSanto.\nDiSanto's seat is widely seen as the Senate Democrats' best chance for a pickup. Their longshot bid for the majority also likely would require beating Sen. Dan Laughlin, R-Erie, and Sen. Devlin Robinson, a first-term Republican whose district surrounds the western side of Pittsburgh.\nSen. Dave Argall, of Schuylkill County, who heads the GOP's Senate campaign effort, said a razor-close win for Brewster four years ago makes that a battleground, but their efforts to stay in the majority are wider.\n'There are going to be battles all across the state, but it's still pretty early to predict which ones are going to rise to the top of the list,\" Argall said.\nLawmakers in nearly half of the 203 House seats, and slightly more Democrats than Republicans, have no primary or General Election opponents this year and can plan on serving another term starting in January.\nThere aren't many House vacancies this cycle: just nine seats held by Republicans and four by Democrats. Retiring members include Berks County Rep. Mark Rozzi, who spent a brief but notable time as House speaker early last year before fellow Democrats could muster the votes to elect their first choice to lead the chamber, Speaker Joanna McClinton of Philadelphia.\nReps. Ryan Mackenzie, of Lehigh County, and Rob Mercuri, of Allegheny, are relinquishing House seats to run in Republican primaries for Democratic-held congressional seats. Hedging their bets are Rep. Ryan Bizzarro, of Erie, and Rep. Jared Solomon, of Philadelphia, seeking reelection in the state House and running in Democratic primaries for state treasurer and state attorney general, respectively.\nAll 17 of Pennsylvania's incumbent members of the U.S. House of Representatives are running for another term, each with at least one opponent in the primary or fall elections. Court-ordered redistricting after the 2020 Census produced a 9-8 Democratic edge, and when the incumbents ran for reelection two years ago, all 17 were reelected.\nIn Allegheny County, freshman U.S. Rep. Summer Lee has a Democratic primary opponent, Bhavini Patel, as well as a Republican positioned to take on the Democratic winner in November.\nIn a district Democrats hope to flip, a race north of Philadelphia could signal how much power the abortion issue has in the suburbs. U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a centrist Republican, has a primary opponent whose anti-abortion position would not permit exceptions for rape or incest.\nThere is a three-way GOP primary for the nomination to take on Lehigh Valley Democratic U.S. Rep. Susan Wild in the fall. Wild's previous two wins were by single-digit margins. Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Democrat from the Scranton area who also has been repeatedly targeted in recent years, has no primary opponent, but a Republican looks to challenge him in November.\nSix Democrats are on the primary ballot in a district held by U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, a York County Republican who was deeply involved in efforts by then-President Donald Trump to overturn Trump's 2020 election defeat. Perry's prominent role in the ultra-right Freedom Caucus in Congress and some close reelection contests over the past six years also are making him a target for Democrats this year.\nAfter Shapiro's election as governor two years ago created a vacancy in his former job as state attorney general, he nominated his protege, Michelle Henry, to serve through the end of this year. She is not seeking to stay in the job.\nFive Democrats are running for the nomination: Philadelphia attorney Keir Bradford-Grey, former auditor general and state Rep. Eugene DePasquale, of Allegheny County, former prosecutor and Bucks County solicitor Joe Khan, Philadelphia state Rep. Jared Solomon and Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer.\nTwo Republicans are running: York County District Attorney Dave Sunday and state Rep. Craig Williams, of Delaware County. Sunday received his party's endorsement, while Williams has been helping lead House Republicans' efforts to remove from office progressive Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat.\nFor auditor general, state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, of Philadelphia, and Lehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley are the Democrats seeking to run against DeFoor in November. Kenyatta finished third in the Democratic U.S. Senate primary in 2022 won by John Fetterman.\nGarrity, the state treasurer, has no opposition in the GOP primary. Democratic voters will choose between Bizzarro and Erin McClelland, an addiction recovery and human services professional from Allegheny County.",

            "summary": "An inexperienced House speaker facing a brewing intraparty rebellion as he seeks bipartisan compromise to push through defense funding for Ukraine and Israel got a boost on Friday from the presumptive Republican party presidential nominee, Donald Trump.\n\"He's doing a really good job under very tough circumstances,\" Trump, at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, said at the start of a news conference with House Speaker Mike Johnson.\nTrump suggested Republicans push for making additional U.S. military aid to Ukraine \"in the form of a loan rather than a gift.\"\nJohnson, a Republican congressman from the state of Louisiana who has been House speaker since October, made no statement about the aid. But Trump's stance is likely to hold sway over many House Republicans.\nJohnson, according to Republican Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, has been negotiating with the White House about a package that would deviate from the Senate's $95 billion foreign security legislation.\nThe most contentious elements involve aid for Ukraine, locked in a defensive war against Russia, and for Israel, which has been on the offensive in Gaza against Hamas.\nJohnson's job in jeopardy\nJohnson, relatively unknown on the national stage when he emerged as a compromise candidate among Republicans to become House speaker, finds his job in jeopardy. Republicans are bitterly divided on further U.S. military aid for Ukraine.\n\"I'm not giving Ukraine any money, never have, never will,\" responded Representative Troy Nehls to a question from VOA's Ukrainian Service on Thursday. \"Can anybody tell me what the strategy is for Ukraine?\"\nNehls — who is among the Republican lawmakers who falsely assert the 2020 presidential election was \"rigged\" in favor of President Joe Biden — predicted if Trump is again elected president in November, Russian forces \"will be out of Ukraine by April 1st.\"\nAnother Republican in the House, Keith Self of the state of Texas, wants any support for Ukraine tied to increased funding for security at the U.S. Southern border with Mexico.\nSelf told VOA that while Kyiv awaits further aid from Washington, it should turn to European countries for help.\n\"I think Europe is starting to realize that they need to take care of their own backyard,\" said Self, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\nIf Johnson is seen as acceding to the desires of Democrats, it would likely expand the number of Republican lawmakers dissatisfied with his leadership.\nJohnson is compelled to work with the Democrats on major legislation because his party retains a thin majority in the House.\nDemocrats disagree about Israel\nThe Democratic Party leader in the House, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New Jersey, has suggested Democrats will help Johnson retain his position if the speaker helps push over the finish line the national security package sent by the Senate, where Democrats enjoy a majority, to the Republican-controlled House chamber.\nThe Democrats face their own disagreement over the bill, with some opposing sending offensive weaponry from the United States to Israel while it engages in its campaign in Gaza that, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry, has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians.\n\"I'm looking at the possibility of a Ukraine-only [funding] bill\" to avoid further delays, Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from the state of Washington who is chair of the left-wing congressional progressive caucus, told VOA's Ukrainian Service.\nNot aiding Ukraine \"is malpractice on our part,\" according to Representative Madeleine Dean, who termed the hesitation among some lawmakers in both parties \"literally un-American\" and appeasing Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\"I can't tell you how strongly I feel about it, how upset and angry I am,\" the Pennsylvania Democrat added as she became emotional on the steps of the Capitol.\nThe task of reaching consensus in the House rests primarily on the shoulders of Johnson, a hard-right litigator who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential election. The Trump loyalist is the least experienced speaker in nearly a century and a half.\nJohnson's visit on Friday to Trump's Florida resort home was seen as an attempt by the weakened House speaker to be shored up by the former president. Trump's backing has been pivotal for top Republicans to stay in their positions or gain them.\nHis lack of support for the previously elected House speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California, and Republican National Committee Chair Ronna Romney McDaniel led to exits from their respective leadership jobs.",

The two candidates are also reportedly tied in Wisconsin, which Biden had previously won by a margin of 0.6% in the 2020 election.\nWall Street Journal survey released last week. The two candidates are also reportedly tied in Wisconsin, which Biden had previously won by a margin of 0.6% in the 2020 election. The seven key swing states account for 93 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to be elected as president. A majority of respondents also said Trump was the better candidate to handle the economy (54%) and border security (52%), as well as 48% claiming Trump had the requisite mental and physical capabilities, compared to 28% favoring Biden's \"mental and physical fitness needed to be president,\" according to the Wall Street Journal .\nWall Street Journal .

Trump reportedly held a 40% to 38% advantage among respondents who were asked whom they would vote for if the presidential election were held today.\nUSA TODAY poll released after both officially secured their respective parties' nominations.

Additionally, one in four respondents said they could possibly change their minds about their current choice once the election takes place in November, which includes 14% of current Biden voters and 15% of current Trump voters. Biden did, however, see an increase in Americans reporting green shoots in the economy, which was the most positive assessment since the beginning of his presidency.\nIn February, Emerson College Polling/ The Hill survey found that Trump had a 46% to 44% advantage over Biden among Michigan voters in a potential 2024 presidential matchup, with 10% voting undecided.

Prince William and Prince Harry have allegedly been at odds with each other for quite some time.\nEven though they have been photographed together on multiple occasions, royal experts believe that they have not yet resolved their issues. Reports claimed that Prince William and Prince Harry's falling out started shortly after the latter started dating Meghan Markle. And the brothers' rift worsened after the Duke of Sussex announced his engagement.\nSince then, Prince William and Prince Harry have shown little progress when it comes to repairing their relationship. The last time that they were photographed together was in July 2021 when they attended the unveiling of Princess Diana's statue.It must be upsetting to the Queen to see that in her family, that two boys that grew up together, they played soldiers together, they had their treehouse at Highgrove together and learned to fly together. They flew helicopters together and now they're not even talking to each other. I don't know what he's got to do to make it right. But it's got to come from him and it's got to come from him in a big way. And from Meghan. I think it's possible you can change any situation if you really both want to. While this feud is going on with his brother where they barely talk to each other, it's not nice,\" Edwards told Express.\nAndrew Neil added that Prince William and Prince Harry's ongoing rift could also sideline important events within the royal family.

But eagle-eyed royal fans were more focused on his interactions with the royal family, particularly Prince William and Prince Charles. However, the brothers remained distant during this outing. And Prince Harry was photographed chatting with Kate Middleton instead.\nRoyal Experts Weigh In On Prince William, Prince Harry's RiftLast year, royal expert Camilla Tominey also weighed in on Prince William and Prince Harry's feud in the Channel 5 documentary, 2021: The Queen's Terrible Year . Tominey said that Prince William and Prince Harry's ongoing feud must be impacting the queen negatively.\n\"I think we knew that Harry and William's relationship had changed over the years just because Harry himself admitted that they were on different paths. There were reports that there had been tensions, the Queen is a conflict avoider by nature. The idea of Harry and William not being close, I think would really trouble her,\" she said.\nRoyal expert Emily Nash also talked about Prince William and Prince Harry's relationship in the documentary.\n\"The Queen made it clear in her statement in response to the Oprah interview that Harry and Megan remained much-loved members of the family. And it's clear that you know, the falling out between the brothers, in particular, will be very hard for her to bear. Particularly given that she took a close interest in their upbringing following the loss of their mother. You know, these are two brothers who have been inseparable for many years. And it's incredibly sad to see things end the way they have,\" Nash said.\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE: Jennifer Lopez Shock: Ben Affleck's Girlfriend Forcing Him To Have A Baby Via Surrogate?

But the latter opened up about it in passing during his interview with Oprah Winfrey. At the time, the Duke of Sussex said that he will always love Prince William because they are brothers.\n\"You know, as I've said before, I love William to bits. He's my brother. We've been through hell together. I mean, we have a shared experience. But, you know, we're on different paths. The relationship is space, at the moment.

Mr Trump has attributed his 2020 presidential defeat to ballot fraud, but he has provided no evidence to substantiate his claims.\nThe speaker's visit and expected remarks on the topic would lend further Republican institutional support to the former president's grievances.\nFor Mr Johnson, the meeting could act as a counterweight to Ms Greene's efforts to push him out of the speakership. She considers herself a close ally of the former president and has acted as a surrogate for him on the presidential campaign trail.\nIn a letter penned on Tuesday to her Republican colleagues, Ms Greene warned that she will not tolerate Mr Johnson \"serving the Democrats and the Biden administration\" over his own party \"and helping them achieve their policies\".\nShe has accused him of helping Democrats to pass spending legislation, but his recent effort to provide Ukraine more military aid appeared to spark her objection.\nOn 22 March, she filed her motion to vacate Mr Johnson, telling reporters that he had \"betrayed\" Republicans.\nBut she has not yet indicated if or when she plans to force a floor vote on her motion.\nMr Trump and his campaign will want to avoid another chaotic leadership battle among Republicans in the House of Representatives ahead of the US presidential election in November. Polling showed that the fight in October undermined voters' confidence in the party.\nBy appearing publicly with Mr Johnson and showing support for the beleaguered speaker, the former president likely intends to dissuade Ms Greene from pushing her effort further.\nMr Johnson, for his part, could also use the former president's backing for several of his legislative priorities.\nMr Trump derailed the speaker's effort to renew a provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act earlier this week, but the legislation's passage has returned to the negotiating table.\nThe speaker is also planning to bring a long-awaited Ukraine military aid bill to a vote next week. The former president's backing, or at least a lack of vocal opposition, could pave the way for passage months after existing aid funding had lapsed.\nFriday's meeting is not the first between a Republican House leader and Mr Trump at Mar-a-Lago since the former president left the White House.\nJust over three years ago, in the aftermath of the 6 January attack on the US Capitol, Kevin McCarthy, who was then the House minority leader, travelled to Florida to meet with the former president.\nAt the time, Mr Trump was struggling to maintain his hold on the Republican Party after the chaotic end to his first presidential term.\nMr McCarthy provided a lifeline to Mr Trump, and the former president would go on to support the California congressman's bid to become the Speaker of the House when Republicans took control in January 2023.\nThe relationship became strained in the ensuing months, however, and the former president did little to help Mr McCarthy when a handful of Republicans launched a successful effort to oust him from the top congressional post last October.\nMr Johnson, who succeeded Mr McCarthy, is facing similar unrest in Republican ranks now - albeit from a smaller group. He, and many in the party's leadership, hope he will avoid his predecessor's fate.",

Organizers have already collected more than a half million signatures, and after the Arizona Supreme Court and Republican Legislature sent women's rights to the trash bin, abortion rights activists are now aiming for 800,000 signatures and will likely exceed even that, when they need fewer than 400,000 to add the proposition to the ballot.

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — House Republicans have sent to the Senate two articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, a step that launches a trial in the Senate as GOP lawmakers seek to highlight President Joe Biden's handling of immigration policy.\nThe Democratic-controlled Senate, however, is expected to quickly dismiss the charges without a trial or conduct a speedy trial that ends without a conviction.\nMayorkas, who took the helm at the start of the Biden administration, is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years . House Republicans voted to impeach Mayorkas in February over his handling of the southern border by a narrow margin after failing to do so on their first try.\n. House Republicans voted to impeach Mayorkas in February over his handling of the southern border by a narrow margin after failing to do so on their first try. Republicans targeted Mayorkas as soon as they took control of the House last year, blaming the high number of border crossings on the Homeland Security secretary as the party faced pressure from its base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue.\nMultiple constitutional experts, however, have said the evidence Republicans have put forward does not reach the high bar set by the US Constitution of high crimes and misdemeanors. Democrats have argued that the impeachment proceedings have been politically motivated and meritless.\nThe issue now moves to the Senate where Democratic senators — joined by some Republicans — have said they expect the chamber will move to dismiss the case before a full trial.\nSenators could be sworn in as jurors as soon as Wednesday if it does not get dismissed outright without holding a trial.\nThe tumultuous way the impeachment process against Mayorkas has played out has led many Republicans to grow even more skeptical about the prospects of impeaching Biden, arguably their top investigative target this Congress. House Republicans do not have the votes or concrete evidence to impeach Biden given their razor-thin majority, leaving that separate impeachment inquiry stalled.\nMayorkas has pushed back against criticism of his leadership, and DHS has called the impeachment effort against him a baseless political attack.\n'Despite warnings from fellow Republicans that this baseless impeachment effort ‘distorts the Constitution,' House Republicans continue to ignore the facts and undermine the Constitution by wasting even more time on this sham impeachment in the Senate,' a DHS spokesperson said in a statement.\nRepublicans have targeted Mayorkas in an effort to attack Biden and his administration's handling of the southern border. With border crossings reaching record highs and US cities across the country struggling to manage the influx of migrants, immigration has been a political vulnerability for Biden .\n. But the White House is trying to flip the script, citing Republicans blocking a bipartisan border deal as evidence that the party isn't serious about border security.\nAfter months of negotiations, Senate Republicans blocked a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year that would have marked a tough change to immigration law and would have given the president far-reaching powers to restrict illegal migrant crossings at the southern border. The legislation was aimed at closing loopholes in the asylum process, limiting the use of parole for migrants and giving the president new authority to essentially shut down the border to migrants when attempted crossings got too high.\nThe deal faced relentless attacks from former President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, who said the bill would be dead on arrival in his chamber - if it ever made it out of the Senate. Trump, who has made immigration a key plank of his presidential campaign, suggested on Truth Social that approving additional resources for the border would make Republicans 'look bad.'\nReferring to the Mayorkas impeachment proceedings, White House counsel's office spokesman Ian Sams wrote in a memo, 'this effort is a complete waste of time that constitutional and legal experts have said is ‘unconstitutional' and that even Senate Republicans have made clear they don't want to focus on.'\n'But the worst part is that extreme Republicans have promoted this silly, baseless stunt at the same time they have killed an actual bipartisan border security bill that would have addressed the challenges at the border and delivered needed resources to DHS,' he continued.\nWhen Johnson originally informed Schumer he would be sending the impeachment articles over to the Senate, he laid out why he believed a Mayorkas impeachment was justified. Johnson claimed that Mayorkas directed department employees to violate US immigration laws and argued that the administration's use of parole authority was unlawful.\nHouse Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green of Tennessee who led the House investigation into Mayorkas argued the secretary committed high crimes and misdemeanors that amount to impeachable offenses.\n'These articles lay out a clear, compelling, and irrefutable case for Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas' impeachment,' Green said in a statement provided to CNN. 'He has willfully and systemically refused to comply with immigration laws enacted by Congress. He has breached the public trust by knowingly making false statements to Congress and the American people, and obstructing congressional oversight of his department.'\nAnd he has cited Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, arguing that he has indicated Congress could 'employ the weapons of inter-branch warfare,' including impeachment, in light of a Supreme Court ruling that states could not challenge federal immigration law.\nDemocrats have slammed the impeachment effort, saying that policy disagreements are not a justification for the rarely used constitutional impeachment of a Cabinet official.\nLegal scholars have also poured cold water on the legal arguments Republicans are using to support their impeachment effort.\npoured cold water on the legal arguments Republicans are using to support their impeachment effort. Ross Garber, a Tulane University law professor who has represented many Republican officeholders as both the prosecution and defense in impeachment cases, told CNN that House Republicans have not presented evidence of impeachable offenses.\n'I think that what the House Republicans are asserting is that Secretary Mayorkas is guilty of maladministration,' Garber said. 'At least as framed right now, the charges don't rise to the level of a high crime or misdemeanor.'\nFormer DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff, who served under Republican President George W. Bush, wrote in an op-ed, 'as a former federal judge, U.S. attorney and assistant attorney general — I can say with confidence that, for all the investigating that the House Committee on Homeland Security has done, they have failed to put forth evidence that meets the bar.'\nConstitutional law expert Jonathan Turley, who has been called by Republicans to serve as a witness in hearings, said: 'There is no current evidence he is corrupt or committed an impeachable offense.' More than two dozen law professors wrote in an open letter that impeaching Mayorkas would be 'utterly unjustified as a matter of constitutional law.'\nQuestions remain over Senate trial The question now for Senate Democratic leadership is what a trial will look like and how exactly they will handle the impeachment articles.\nWhile Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has not specified exactly how he plans to handle the trial procedurally, the Senate could pass a motion to dismiss or table the articles on a simple majority vote on Thursday, the same day senators are sworn in. But some hard-right Republican senators are trying to find a way to force a full trial.\nSchumer has previously said that they will wrap up the impeachment trial 'as quickly as possible,' but he did not say if he will move to dismiss or table the articles.\nEven if the Senate does not vote to quickly dismiss, it is highly doubtful the chamber would vote to convict Mayorkas, which would require a two-thirds majority vote – an exceedingly high bar to clear.\nSenate Majority Whip Dick Durbin noted that he thinks it will be over 'quickly,' and that several Republicans have indicated to him that they don't support convicting Mayorkas.\n'I'm not sure how Chuck's going to approach it. There's two or three procedural opportunities,' he told CNN's Manu Raju. 'I think it will be done quickly. I've talked to some Republicans who candidly don't – they don't take it very seriously.'\nRepublican Whip John Thune said that Senate Democrats running for reelection in red states would be in a 'difficult position' if they vote to dismiss impeachment charges against Mayorkas when that trial gets underway.\nVoting to dismiss would make Democrats appear they are turning a 'deaf ear and blind eye' to the crisis at the border, he said.\nHe said he expects a 'large majority' of Republicans to vote to have a full trial. But he also acknowledged that it's unlikely all Republicans will vote together on that question and that some Republicans will join Democrats to dismiss the case.\nBut he also acknowledged that it's unlikely all Republicans will vote together on that question and that some Republicans will join Democrats to dismiss the case. Johnson has called on Schumer to not dismiss the articles quickly.\n'We call upon you to fulfill your constitutional obligation to hold this trial' Johnson wrote to Schumer last month. 'To table articles of impeachment without ever hearing a single argument or reviewing a piece of evidence would be a violation of our constitutional order and an affront to the American people whom we all serve.'\nSenate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray, a Democrat of Washington, will oversee the proceedings.\nIn addition to Green, the other House Republicans tapped to serve as impeachment managers in the Senate include: Reps. Michael McCaul of Texas, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Clay Higgins of Louisiana, Ben Cline of Virginia, Michael Guest of Mississippi, Andrew Garbarino of New York, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, August Pfluger of Texas, Harriet Hageman of Wyoming and Laurel Lee of Florida.\nCNN's Ted Barrett and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.\nCNN's Ted Barrett and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.",

            "summary": "Defiant and determined, the House speaker Mike Johnson pushed back on Tuesday against mounting Republican anger over his proposed US aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other allies, and rejected a call to step aside or risk a vote to oust him from office.\n'I am not resigning,' Johnson said after a testy morning meeting of fellow House Republicans at the Capitol.\nJohnson referred to himself as a 'wartime speaker' of the House and indicated in his strongest self-defense yet he would press forward with a US national security aid package, a situation that would force him to rely on Democrats to help pass it, over objections from his weakened majority.\n'We are simply here trying to do our jobs,' Johnson said, calling the motion to oust him 'absurd … not helpful.'\nTuesday brought a definitive shift in tone from both the House Republicans and the speaker himself at a pivotal moment as the embattled leader tries, against the wishes of his majority, to marshal the votes needed to send the stalled national security aid for Israel, Ukraine and other overseas allies to passage.\nJohnson appeared emboldened by his meeting late last week with Donald Trump when the Republican former president threw him a political lifeline with a nod of support after their private talk at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. At his own press conference Tuesday, Johnson spoke of the importance of ensuring Trump, who is now at his criminal trial in New York, is re-elected to the White House.\nJohnson also spoke over the weekend with President Joe Biden as well as other congressional leaders about the emerging US aid package, which the speaker plans to move in separate votes for each section – with bills for Ukraine, Israel, the Indo-Pacific region. He spoke about it with Biden again late Monday.\nIt's a complicated approach that breaks apart the Senate's $95bn aid package for separate votes, and then stitches it back together for the president's signature.\nThe approach will require the speaker to cobble together bipartisan majorities with different factions of House Republicans and Democrats on each measure. Additionally, Johnson is preparing a fourth measure that would include various Republican-preferred national security priorities, such as a plan to seize some Russian assets in US banks to help fund Ukraine and another to turn the economic aid for Ukraine into loans.\nThe plan is not an automatic deal-breaker for Democrats in the House and Senate, with leaders refraining from comment until they see the actual text of the measure, due out later Tuesday.\nHouse Republicans, however, were livid that Johnson will be leaving their top priority – efforts to impose more security at the US-Mexico border – on the sidelines. Some predicted Johnson will not be able to push ahead with voting on the package this week, as planned.\nRepresentative Debbie Lesko, a Republican from Arizona, called the morning meeting an 'argument fest'.\nShe said Johnson was 'most definitely' losing support for the plan, but he seemed undeterred in trying to move forward despite 'what the majority of the conference' of Republicans wanted.\nWhen the speaker said the House GOP's priority border security bill HR 2 would not be considered germane to the package, Representative Chip Roy, a Republican from Texas, a chief sponsor, said it's for the House to determine which provisions and amendments are relevant.\n'Things are very unresolved,' Roy said.\nRoy said Republicans want 'to be united. They just have to be able to figure out how to do it.'\nThe speaker faces a threat of ouster from Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, the top Trump ally who has filed a motion to vacate the speaker from office in a snap vote – much the way Republicans ousted their former speaker, Kevin McCarthy, last fall.\nWhile Greene has not said if or when she will force the issue, and has not found much support for her plan after last year's turmoil over McCarthy's exit, she drew at least one key supporter on Tuesday.\nRepresentative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, rose in the meeting and suggested Johnson should step aside, pointing to the example of John Boehner, an even earlier House speaker who announced an early resignation in 2015 rather than risk a vote to oust him, according to Republicans in the room.\nJohnson did not respond, according to Republicans in the room, but told the lawmakers they have a 'binary' choice' before them.\nThe speaker explained they either try to pass the package as he is proposing or risk facing a discharge petition from Democrats that would force a vote on their preferred package – the Senate approved measure. But that would leave behind the extra Republican priorities.",
