Managers at major media companies are so concerned with the anger of their rebels and the denunciations on social media that they frequently cave.PROSECUTORS PUSH SALACIOUS PORTRAIT OF TRUMP, WINNING SOME BUT NOT ALL BATTLES\nThe subject of the latest eruption, and not for the first time, is the New York Times.\nAnd the information comes to us from the Wall Street Journal, which has this tantalizing lead:\n\"The New York Times is investigating itself.\"\nTurns out there was a potentially damaging leak, and a top Times editor, Charlotte Behrendt, has interviewed nearly 20 staffers to find out whodunit.\nThe subject is coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas.\nIt's no secret that many younger liberals blame Israel for the war, even though it was launched by Hamas terrorists in the unspeakably brutal massacre launched on Oct. 7. Some Times employees questioned the reporting behind a story saying Hamas weaponized sexual violence during these attacks, the Journal says, and complained that the suffering of Gaza residents isn't getting the same attention.\nTo his credit, Times Executive Editor Joe Kahn, the lowest-profile person to run the paper in decades, speaks on the record.ISRAEL'S SUCCESS, IRAN'S FAILURE AND THE CHANCES OF IGNITING THE MIDEAST POWDER KEG\n\"The idea that someone dips into that process in the middle, and finds something that they considered might be interesting or damaging to the story under way, and then provides that to people outside, felt to me and my colleagues like a breakdown in the sort of trust and collaboration that's necessary in the editorial process,\" he said. \"I haven't seen that happen before.\"\nKahn also nails this point: that digital workers weren't trained in independent journalism and haven't learned tolerance on college campuses.\n\"Young adults who are coming up through the education system are less accustomed to this sort of open debate, this sort of robust exchange of views around issues they feel strongly about than may have been the case in the past,\" says Kahn.\nThe leak of the internal debate, to the liberal site Intercept, has sparked a backlash. Reporter Stacy Cowley, a union official who sat in on some interviews, accused the company of going after those who feel their concerns about Gaza have been ignored.\n\"Instead of taking them seriously, the company is turning around and bullying that group into silence,\" Cowley says. A union grievance says the company was targeting a group of staffers of Arab and Middle Eastern descent, which the Times denies.\nWay down in the story is this CYA sentence:\n\"War coverage has also fueled tensions at the Wall Street Journal, with some reporters in meetings and internal chat groups complaining that coverage is skewed \u2013 either favoring Israel or Palestinians.\" Just in case anyone was wondering.\nA similar explosion just occurred at NPR, where award-winning senior business editor Uri Berliner resigned under pressure yesterday. He had been suspended for five days without pay for publishing a piece (without permission) in the Free Press about how the radio network has moved from merely left-leaning to blatant liberal activism, triggered by the election of Donald Trump.\nBerliner, no fan of Trump, cited example after example of NPR being anti-Israel, having a pro-transgender agenda, and blowing off the Hunter Biden laptop story on grounds that it wasn't really a story. He pointed to the hiring of CEO Katherine Maher, a former Biden campaign worker whose past tweets show a history of far-left activism and intolerance. (She says she was a private citizen then.)\n\"I cannot work in a newsroom where I am disparaged by a new CEO whose divisive views confirm the very problems at NPR I cite in my Free Press essay,\" tweeted Berliner, who says he repeatedly complained to management to no avail.\nAnd it was only three weeks ago that an on-air revolt by MSNBC's liberal hosts, openly trashing their NBC bosses, forced them to fire ousted RNC chief Ronna McDaniel just four days after the network had trumpeted her hiring.SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIESThe Times was the first major news organization to capitulate by firing Editorial Page Editor James Bennet for the sin of running an online column by GOP Sen.

It exposed a refusal to be wrong.\nOn Tuesday, NPR editor Uri Berliner issued a lengthy rebuke of NPR's media coverage of major news stories over the last few years, such as the Hunter Biden laptop and the COVID lab leak theory, and called out the outlet's \"efforts to damage\" Trump's presidency.\nThe article caused a scandal at NPR, as several people claimed this exposed the outlet as a den of liberal bias despite presenting itself as a neutral source for years.\nThe Chicago Tribune agreed that the \"nuanced and thoughtful\" essay by Berliner presented evidence of NPR's liberal bias but went further to decry its journalists' \"reluctance\" to even admit it was wrong in those above stories.\n\"We suspect few of our readers would be surprised to hear evidence that NPR has a liberal bias, both nationally and within its local affiliates. And we'll point out that in all three of the cases cited above, the issue perhaps wasn't so much political bias so much as a reluctance to admit mistakes had been made in past coverage or follow up sufficiently when there's new evidence,\" the editorial read. \"We journalists hate to fess up as a breed; only the best of us do so in a timely and complete way. In all three cases, those same charges also have been credibly leveled against The New York Times and others. Even many progressive journalists in many newsrooms quietly acknowledge those errors. The pendulum swung too far, and it's swung back only a little.\"\nPart of the reason, the publication argued, included the \"chicken-and-egg segmentation of the audience\" where progressive journalists are increasingly targeting an equally progressive audience. Another included a rejection of open-minded thinking, particularly for issues involving race or Donald Trump.\n\"Part of the answer has to be the rise of critical race theory and the George Floyd-induced reckoning, wherein old-line centrism came to be seen by many on the left as unhelpful at best or a continuance of historical racism at worst,\" the publication wrote.\nIt added, \"And a big part of the blame goes to Donald J. Trump, who convinced plenty of young journalists he was such a threat to democracy that refusing to write a story which might help him win the presidency was a patriotic act. Of course, that only backfired, as we all now can see. But plenty of smart, leftist journalists still openly decry \u2018bothsidesism,' once a defining ethos of journalists in a free society.\"\nReached for comment, an NPR spokesperson directed Fox News Digital to a memo to staff by editor-in-chief Edith Chapin, where she said she and her team \"strongly disagree\" with Berliner's assessment of the quality of NPR's journalism and integrity.\n\"We're proud to stand behind the exceptional work that our desks and shows do to cover a wide range of challenging stories. We believe that inclusion \u2014 among our staff, with our sourcing, and in our overall coverage \u2014 is critical to telling the nuanced stories of this country and our world,\" she wrote.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Lindsay Kornick","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/CHICAGO-TRIBUNE-NPR.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":8.2616005,"_id":"fb50c26f6380ffba25f684e672d73dcb"},{"title":"Former U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss & Her Political Journey","author":"Kaitlyn Miller","published_date":"2024-04-19 19:30:17","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://radio.foxnews.com/2024/04/19/former-u-k-prime-minister-liz-truss-her-political-journey","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Though she only served for fifty days in 2022, Former Prime Minister Liz Truss has left a permanent political impact on the U.K. In an exclusive interview, the former Prime Minister discusses being\u2026","summary":"Though she only served for fifty days in 2022, Former Prime Minister Liz Truss has left a permanent political impact on the U.K. In an exclusive interview, the former Prime Minister discusses being raised by liberal parents, discovering conservative views, and what went into crafting her political point of view.

NPR is unwilling to tolerate a *single* journalist,\" Fox News contributor Mollie Hemingway reacted.\n\"This is shameful yet predictable. We don't need state-backed media in the U.S.,\" former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy wrote.\n\"NPR has become a hard left propaganda machine that tolerates no dissent,\" X owner Elon Musk declared.\nThe suspension, which was handed down on Thursday, was reportedly based on Berliner violating NPR's policy of seeking approval before \"outside work\" for other news platforms. Berliner was apparently given a \"final warning\" that would result in his firing if he violated such policies again.\nFolkenflik also reported that \"several\" NPR journalists told him they refuse to work with Berliner going forward \"as they no longer have confidence that he will keep private their internal musings about stories as they work through coverage.\"\nA former NPR colleague of Berliner's told Fox News Digital that his essay will prompt a \"long overdue corrective\" for the organization to be more \"intellectually open and generous\" to conservatives, pointing to the new monthly meetings that are being implemented, according to a memo to staff by NPR CEO Katherine Maher.\nHowever, the former colleague added that \"it's going to be difficult for Uri to stay there\" based on the hostility he is up against, telling Fox News Digital: \"Uri may find it more uncomfortable than he expected.\"\nBerliner, a self-described anti-Trump liberal, called for a change in leadership after a trove of old posts Maher had written on X, formerly Twitter, had surfaced, displaying liberal activism and woke ideologies, two things Berliner wrote had already plagued NPR.\n\"We're looking for a leader right now who's going to be unifying and bring more people into the tent and have a broader perspective on, sort of, what America is all about,\" Berliner told Folkenflik. \"And this seems to be the opposite of that.\"\nIn a statement given to Folkenflik, Maher defended her posts, saying, \"In America everyone is entitled to free speech as a private citizen.\"\nNPR did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\nMaher, who just joined NPR as its president and CEO last month, has faced scrutiny from critics for her social media rhetoric.

Surrounding the students are other banners that read \"Stop Investing in Genocide,\" \"Jews for Ceasefire Now,\" \"Yale is Complicit,\" and \"Stop the Genocide.\"\nThe video also shows a woman and man banging on drums before the man stands up and begins playing a horn.\nAnother shot captured protesters marching across campus while holding signs and chanting their demands.\n\"Up, up with liberation. Down, down with occupation,\" they chanted.\n\"Down, down with genocide. Free, free, free Palestine,\" the protesters continued, as they held signs reading \"shame \"and \"Free Palestine.\"\nTents were put up in a communal area, and beyond the tents people could hear chants.\nThen, a Jewish man was seen speaking with a man wearing a shirt that read, \"F- -k Hamas.\"\nThe man wearing the shirt attempted to record the protest while walking among the protesters, but they began to hound him by blocking his view and shoving flags and umbrellas in his face.\nCornell Law Professor William Jacobson, who has been studying the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement for about 15 years, told Fox News Digital the protests at Ivy League universities like Columbia and Yale are reminiscent of the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011. During the movement, protesters raised issues with economic inequality, corporate greed and how money influenced politics, while setting up an encampment in Zuccotti Park in the financial district in New York City.\n\"It's kind of a different topic here, but it's really the same topic. I mean, it's an anti-capitalist movement. It's about the movement. It's a \u2018tear down our society' movement,\" Jacobson said. \"I think it's essentially a similar phenomenon which has been directed toward Israel as the object of their hate, instead of Wall Street or instead of something else.\"\nWhile protesters at Yale established a \"Liberated Zone\" it really did not mean they were liberated from anything because they still rely on the system to provide water, food and other things, he said.\nJacobson also said he thinks the protests are the result of 20 plus years of \"gross dehumanization\" of Israeli Jews on campuses, through the BDS movement as well as through radical faculty members found on most campuses across the U.S., particularly at Columbia.\nWhile covering the BDS movement, Jacobson found the boycott was just a tactic. He said he never understood how it was just a tactic at first, but then it clicked.\n\"They don't really care if you boycott Chablis in the dining hall. They don't really care about those things,\" Jacobson said. \"What they care about is having the entire campus spend 3 or 4 months debating how evil Israel is, and if they lose the vote, they declare victory anyway.\"\nUltimately, he said the anti-capitalist movement focuses on Israel, which results in the dehumanization of Jews because Jews support Israel.\nWith that, though, there are other factors feeding into the protests, according to the Cornell law professor.\nThere could be a psychological aspect affecting students because they are told they have to go deeply into debt to attend elite colleges, only to find out their dreams were crushed by a system that lured them into taking on enormous debt.\nThen there are those who did not take on debt but cannot find a solid career path.\n\"I think there's a bunch of different things going on, and Israel and Jews are the convenient scapegoat, as historically has been the case,\" Jacobson said.\nNearly 500 students were seen protesting at Columbia University on Saturday night, just two days after tensions reached a breaking point when the New York City Police Department arrested 108 people who refused to leave an encampment created on the main lawn.\nThe daughter of U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Isra Hirsi, was also arrested during the protest on Thursday. According to sources, Hirsi was taken into custody, put into flex cuffs or zip ties and will face trespassing charges.\nEarlier that day, Hirsi said she was suspended from Barnard College, located near Columbia, for \"standing in solidarity with Palestinians facing a genocide.\"\nThe Columbia Spectator, a student newspaper, reported, \"While suspended Columbia students may remain in their individual rooms in their residence halls, suspended Barnard students have been evicted from their college housing.\"\nSocial media posts also show several New York City council members arriving to check out the ongoing protest.\nWhile protests continue at Columbia, Jacobson said a BDS referendum was sent to the Cornell University student body for a vote, though the results were not immediately known to the faculty.\nStill, movements like those seen at Columbia, Yale and several other campuses across the U.S. are, as Jacobson said, \"dead end movements.\"\n\"I don't think there's really a future for them because they're built around tearing things down,\" he said. \"They have no positive agenda. Their agenda is to tear things down, and I think what people need to understand is that these protesters, who ostensibly are anti-Israel, are also anti-American.\n\"It's almost a complete overlap between the anti-Israel, anti-American and anti-capitalist protesters,\" he added. \"That's what this movement is about.

This is the only way they can do it,\" he said.\nSmith also gave a warning about where this strategy will lead, especially if Trump is never put in jail, predicting there will \"never be peace in this country\" as a result.\n\"And if you don't put him in jail, and he still goes from being the presumptive GOP nominee to the official GOP nominee, and he goes to the polls, even though he was going to whine about winning and being rigged again, you have given more fodder to that argument, which means we'll never have peace in this country.\"\n\"Because tens of millions of people see what extent the other side is willing to go through just to keep him out of office because they can't beat him on their own merits,\" he added.\nSmith expressed frustration last month that the Democratic Party seems to be relying on court cases to hurt Trump rather than find a candidate who can beat him at the ballot box.\n\"Four indictments, 91 counts and the man gets more campaign dollars, climbing in the polls, okay?\" he continued. \"And last time I checked, he still ain't been in cuffs, he still ain't been put behind bars.

Ron DeSantis' ill-fated presidential campaign, Bloomberg reported.\nFox News Digital reached out to Soros' Open Society Foundations for comment, but did not receive a response.\nSoros recently handed control of his political empire last year to his son, Alex, and his various organizations have continued to exert significant financial influence, including millions of dollars aimed at flipping Texas to Democrats.\nFox News Digital reported last fall that a Soros-funded group pushed more than $15 million to a nonprofit tied to President Biden's main outside super PAC for the 2024 elections to evaluate crucial policy matters.\nThe Soros network appears to be closely involved in doing what it can to help ensure President Biden is re-elected, as evidenced by Alex Soros huddling with high-ranking Democrats shortly after taking over the Open Society Foundations.Alex's social media profiles have dozens of pictures of him and leading House and Senate Democrats since 2018. The two who appear the most are Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. Alex had at least nine meetings with Schumer, whom he referred to as his \"good friend.\"\nAlex had at least eight visits with Pelosi, calling her the \"greatest Speaker of the House in American History!\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Andrew Miller","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/01/E-2X-fdXsAgDq8L.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.874922,"_id":"cfcccf46eb6e6440abd9676c09834914"},{"title":"Yale students set up 'Liberated Zone' encampment in solidarity with Columbia University protesters","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-21 00:59:20","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6351336307112","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Video shows an encampment set up by students at Yale University to show solidarity with the pro-Palestine protesters at Columbia University in New York.","summary":"All times eastern FOX News Saturday Night with Jimmy Failla FOX News Radio Live Channel Coverage\nAll times eastern FOX News Saturday Night with Jimmy Failla FOX News Radio Live Channel Coverage","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/5322714f-11ac-4957-8127-fe118fdd4673/c9b7da17-ab83-45d0-9c2e-6f0eaff2fe35/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.6500216,"_id":"6a777fb5f2dd5255f4a74fa4be87ea3c"},{"title":"Uri Berliner resigns from NPR after exposing the organization's liberal bias","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-17 16:05:23","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6351109827112","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Fox News' Mike Emanuel provides details on former NPR editor Uri Berliner's statement regarding his resignation.","summary":"All times eastern Making Money with Charles Payne FOX News Radio Live Channel Coverage WATCH LIVE: Senate begins DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas' impeachment trial\nAll times eastern Making Money with Charles Payne FOX News Radio Live Channel Coverage WATCH LIVE: Senate begins DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas' impeachment trial","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/74a30138-4ef8-4932-bdc8-f78a82f83197/13ed6328-9f61-4fb1-89dc-acfa88e44513/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.542781,"_id":"1c4e3fde470a4d8d74d2a206b0d19375"},{"title":"Latest Woke Newsroom Battle: NPR Editor Resigns After Ripping Network for Liberal Activism","author":"John Toldi","published_date":"2024-04-18 16:06:08","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://radio.foxnews.com/2024/04/18/latest-woke-newsroom-battle-npr-editor-resigns-after-ripping-network-for-liberal-activism","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Howie Kurtz on a NPR editor resigning after blasting the network for bias, GOP rejecting aid to Ukraine and Arizona Republicans again blocking abortion ban repeal.

But its intensity and scope suggests the Times's leadership, after years of fights with its workforce over a variety of issues involving journalistic integrity, is sending a signal: Enough,\" the WSJ report said.\nTimes Executive Editor Joe Kahn was irked when The Intercept recently reported an episode of the Times' podcast \"The Daily\" about sexual violence committed by Hamas was shelved after \"an intense internal debate\" about the story.\nKahn told the WSJ that he's open to \"the normal push and pull of any newsroom\u2014journalists challenging each other's assumptions and debating whether coverage is fair,\" but opposition to the Hamas sexual-violence article \"crossed a line when confidential Times work-product was allegedly shared outside the newsroom.\"\nThe WSJ report also indicates that Times employees are bickering over the probe and whether it's justified while some feel particular staffers are being bullied, but leadership wants to figure out who spoke to The Intercept.\n\"The union has filed a grievance alleging that the company was targeting a group of staffers of Arab and Middle Eastern descent.

He suggested the paper has \"lost its way,\" and said publisher A.G. Sulzberger forced him to resign with \"icy anger that still puzzles and saddens me\" because liberal staffers were offended by an op-ed he published by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who suggested the military could be deployed to quell urban riots that summer.\nBennet called out his former employer, accusing the Times of graduating from liberal bias to illiberal bias and shutting down opposing viewpoints. He recalled top editor Dean Baquet asking in the midst of newsroom revolt over Cotton's op-ed, \"Are we truly so precious?\"\n\"The answer, it turned out, was yes,\" Bennet wrote.\nBennet's criticism of the Gray Lady echoed claims made by former New York Times opinion editor Bari Weiss in 2020, who published a scathing resignation letter saying she was bullied by colleagues in an \"illiberal environment.\" Weiss noted that her own \"forays into Wrongthink\" made her the subject of \"constant bullying by colleagues\" who disagreed with her views.\nAlso last year, nearly 200 Times contributors wrote an open letter bashing their own outlet and claiming the paper was following the \"far-right\" in its coverage of transgender stories.\nNew York Times Magazine poetry editor Anne Boyer resigned in protest of what she calls Israel's \"U.S-backed war against the people of Gaza\" following the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brian Flood","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/joseph-kahn-new-york-times.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.308141,"_id":"a8be11f993ab9c2fd8b178b0f716124d"},{"title":"NPR suspends veteran editor who blew whistle on liberal bias at organization","author":"Brian Flood","published_date":"2024-04-16 13:15:55","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/npr-suspends-veteran-editor-who-blew-whistle-liberal-bias-organization","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"NPR has suspended veteran editor Uri Berliner after he detailed his employer's \"absence of viewpoint diversity\" last week in a stunning rebuke of the news organization.","summary":"NPR has suspended veteran editor Uri Berliner after he detailed his employer's \"absence of viewpoint diversity\" last week in a stunning rebuke of the news organization.\nNPR media reporter David Folkenflik reported the five-day suspension without pay began on Friday.\nBerliner penned a bombshell piece in the Free Press that criticized NPR's coverage of Russiagate, the COVID lab leak theory, Hunter Biden's scandalous laptop, embrace of the theory of systemic racism and accused the organization of downplaying antisemitism following Oct. 7.\nThis is a developing story, more to come\u2026","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brian Flood","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/BelinerNPR.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.3010445,"_id":"400c40af5bcf393908f73e29aa04f020"},{"title":"John Mellencamp scolds audiences to have 'etiquette' at his shows after viral video of him yelling at hecklers","author":"Nikolas Lanum","published_date":"2024-04-16 14:47:31","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/john-mellencamp-scolds-audiences-have-etiquette-shows-viral-video-yelling-hecklers","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Rock icon John Mellencamp is asking rowdy fans to avoid his shows in the future after a March incident when the singer stormed off stage after yelling at hecklers.","summary":"Singer-songwriter John Mellencamp is urging loud and intoxicated audience members to avoid his shows going forward following a viral video of the singer yelling at hecklers.\n\"I do expect etiquette inside of the theater, the same way you would at a Broadway show,\" Mellencamp told The Washington Post.\n\"My shows are not really concerts anymore.

Brian Fitzpatrick and say he is not conservative enough, in essence boosting his primary opponent, Mark Houck, Politico first reported this week.\nFox News Digital obtained some of those mailers that framed Fitzpatrick as a \"RINO\" (\"Republican in name only\") and implied he wasn't conservative enough for the base that supports former President Trump.\n\"MAGA is ready to bag the biggest RINO in Congress,\" reads one of the mailers along with a photo of Fitzpatrick photoshopped onto a rhinoceros body. \"We sent Brian Fitzpatrick to D.C. to represent our values, instead, he became best friends with Kamala Harris and the Democrats,\" another mailer said.\nFEC records show True Patriots PA spent roughly $26,000 on the mailer.\nMeagan Olson is listed as treasurer for both True Patriots PA and the Swalwell campaign.\n\"I consider Brian a friend and someone who has bravely defied his party to help secure Ukraine aid,\" Rep.

That was a chronic habit,\" Houck said in a 2010 interview, which Defending America PAC included in an ad titled \"Beat it.\"\nIn a recent statement, Houck said he \"fell victim to the dehumanizing effects of the pornography industry\" over \"two decades ago.\" He also defended the conversation about his son, saying the clips circulating online \"seizes on de-contextualized comments I made with my son present in public pursuit of this transformative ministry\" meant to steer people away from pornography.\nThe Democrat group boosting Houck is the latest example of a recent trend in which liberal funds have been used to back Republican challengers in an effort to sink candidates who support or are supported by former President Trump.\nPACs linked to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have spent millions meddling in GOP primaries this cycle, including in swing state Senate races in Ohio and Montana.\nDuty and Country PAC, affiliated with Schumer, ran ads during the Ohio GOP Senate primary that accused Trump-backed businessman Bernie Moreno of being \"too conservative for Ohio.\" That effort proved unsuccessful in the primary as Moreno won every county in the Buckeye State, beating his nearest challenger by almost 20 points.\nIn 2022, Democrats spent more than $40 million to boost six pro-Trump candidates in Republican primaries, and all six of those Republicans lost their general election races to Democrats.\nFitzpatrick, who has so far declined to say if he will endorse Trump, voted against impeaching Trump twice and won re-election in 2022 by almost 10 points, despite Biden carrying the 1st Congressional district.\n\"After years of brutal losses, the far-left has finally figured out they have no chance of beating Congressman Fitzpatrick, so they've now tagged California left-wing extremists to meddle in his primary using the same violent political rhetoric they claim to stand against,\" Fitzpatrick campaign spokesperson Ben Trundy told Fox News Digital in statement.\n\"This lame attempt to prop up Mark Houck, an admitted porn addict and serial grifter who believes in complete abortion bans with no exceptions, shows just how desperate they are to force their extreme policies on Bucks and Montgomery County voters.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Andrew Miller","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-2056532467.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.0584707,"_id":"ffe496120a24f35d876a79b29fa022d5"},{"title":"Wikipedia co-founder blasts successor Katherine Maher, says NPR should 'let her go right away'","author":"Joseph Wulfsohn","published_date":"2024-04-19 11:28:24","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/wikipedia-co-founder-blasts-successor-katherine-maher-says-npr-let-go-right-away","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger is urging NPR to purge its CEO, former Wikimedia chief Katherine Maher, for her past comments being critical of a \"free and open\" internet.","summary":"Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger took aim at his successor, Katherine Maher, whose past comments about free speech have resurfaced since taking over the now scandal-plagued NPR as its CEO and president.\nCity Journal's Christopher Rufo has been unearthing comments Maher had made during her tenure as executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation.\nIn one clip Rufo shared Thursday morning, Maher criticized Wikipedia's founding mission of being \"free and open,\" something she said ended up \"recapitulating\" power structures and how its content was based on the \"White male Westernized construct.\"\n\"For the ex-CEO of Wikipedia to say that it was somehow a mistake for Wikipedia to be \u2018free and open,' that it led to bad consequences\u2014my jaw is on the floor,\" Sanger told Rufo in an interview on Thursday. \"I can't say I'm terribly surprised that she thinks it, but I am surprised that she would say it.\"\nSanger, who left Wikipedia in 2002 and has been an outspoken critic of the platform's left-wing bias over the years, slammed comments Maher made suggesting Wikipedia coordinated with the government to crack down on so-called \"misinformation.\"\n\"When she says that she's worked with government to shut down what they consider \u2018misinformation,' that, in itself, means that it's no longer free and open,\" Sanger said.\nMaher left Wikimedia in 2021 and joined NPR last month, days before veteran editor Uri Berliner came forward with his bombshell essay accusing NPR of systemic liberal bias.\nSanger told Rufo if NPR wants to commit to objectivity and free speech principles, \"they would let her go right away.\"\n\"I don't expect them to do that.

Kennedy, Jr. has been a longtime opponent of requiring voters to show proof of identification to cast a ballot, a number of his resurfaced writings and interviews show.\nThe material reviewed by Fox News Digital was published throughout 2008 in the run-up to that year's presidential election, and included Kennedy referencing voter ID laws as \"racially rancid,\" and claiming voter fraud was \"non-existent.\"\nOne of his past writings \u2013 a comic book co-authored with investigative journalist Greg Palast and sponsored by numerous liberal and left-wing organizations \u2013 specifically claimed voter ID requirements were discriminatory against Black people.\n\"One out of every ten Americans don't have a government-issued ID because they don't travel abroad, so they don't have passports, and they don't drive a car[,] so they don't have drivers['] licenses. The number rises to one in five when you're dealing with the African American community. And, indeed, for those people to get a government-issued ID \u2013 it's an obstacle,\" Kennedy wrote on page 16 of the comic.\nOn the same page, Kennedy described voter ID laws as \"racially rancid,\" citing thousands of voters rejected at the polls for having an expired license \u2013 or no license at all \u2013 during an unnamed previous election being \"disproportionately\" Black.\nKennedy wrote on another page that an Idaho requirement for newly registered voters in the state to show ID to have a mail-in ballot counted was \"a new voter Block-the-Vote trick.\" He later described voter ID laws as \"the newest scam to steal your vote,\" and specifically called those turned away from the polls for not being able to prove their identity as \"stolen votes.\"\n\"Voter fraud is non-existent\u2026 everybody who has ever studied this \u2013 non-partisan, bi-partisan groups \u2013 [has] said that it is simply not a problem in this country,\" Kennedy also wrote in the comic.\nKennedy also claimed voter fraud \"doesn't exist\" during a 2008 HuffPost interview while comparing voter ID requirements to Jim Crow laws and accusing Republicans of using fear surrounding voter fraud as an excuse to make it harder for minorities to vote.\n\"Republicans have seized on this in order to erect all kinds of obstacles and impediments that essentially mimic the old poll taxes that were used in the southern states during the Jim Crow period, to keep Black people from voting. Today, they're directed toward suppressing the votes, not only Blacks, but Hispanics and American Indians, of young people of senior citizens,\" Kennedy said.\nThat same year, Kennedy admitted in a piece published by liberal outlet Rolling Stone that \"the requirement to show a government-issued ID doesn't seem unreasonable,\" but claimed again that traditional Democrat voters, which, at the time, he described as young voters, minorities and seniors, \"often have no driver's licenses or state ID cards.\"\nHe repeated similar claims during an interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow just days ahead of the 2008 presidential election. \"One in five Black voters does not have a driver's license. That means if you require a driver's license, you're getting rid of 20% of the Black voters in this country,\" he said.\nFox News Digital has reached out to Kennedy's campaign for comment.\nDespite his past claims about them, voter ID laws remain popular across the country. Numerous polls taken in recent years have shown more than three-quarters of Americans support requiring proof of identification to cast a ballot.\nKennedy is running alongside wealthy entrepreneur and philanthropist Nicole Shanahan, a former Democrat who he announced would join his ticket during a rally in Oakland, California, last month.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brandon Gillespie","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2147997630.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.9398217,"_id":"ee91d5393f50c88e56b80b086dbdb374"},{"title":"Ivy League anti-Israel agitators' protests spiral into 'actual terror organization,' professor warns","author":"Emma Colton","published_date":"2024-04-21 20:43:23","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/ivy-league-students-anti-israel-protests-spiral-actual-terror-organization-professor-warns","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Columbia University student, professor and alum react to anti-Israel protests on campus, including saying the protesters have crossed the line and become violent.","summary":"Anti-Israel agitators on Columbia University's campus have \"crossed the line\" and become a terrorist organization amid ongoing protests at the Ivy League school, a professor told Fox News Digital.\n\"Yesterday, what we saw is that the pro-terrorist student organizations have crossed the line to being an actual terror organization,\" business professor Shai Davidai told Fox Digital.\nDavidai cited video footage from Saturday as a breaking point for when protesters \"crossed the line.\" One demonstrator was seen holding a sign reading, \"Al-Qasam's next targets,\" while pointing at a group of Jewish students who were singing and waving Israel's flag. Al-Qassam is the military wing of the terrorist organization Hamas.\nHundreds of protesters were seen on Columbia's campus again Saturday, with social media videos showing them releasing red smoke while chanting in front of the Columbia East Gate.\n\"Up, up with liberation. Down, down with occupation,\" they yelled through the locked campus gate.\nThe protesters also shouted and chanted: \"Al-Qassam you make us proud, kill another soldier now,\" \"We say justice, you say how. Burn Tel Aviv to the ground!\" and \"Hamas we love you. We support your rockets too!\"\nThe protests, which follow war breaking out in Israel on Oct. 7, focus on demands from students and protesters that Columbia completely divest from Israel.\n\"We demand that Columbia sever academic ties with Israeli universities and we demand that Columbia stop censoring and intimidating students who are standing up and advocating for Palestinian liberation,\" one protester yelled last week, the New York Post reported.\nDavidai pinned blame for the antisemitism on campus to the administration and faculty who, he says, encouraged the protesters after they failed to take any action on campus antisemitism since war broke out in Israel.\n\"All the faculty that were named in the congressional hearing, and more, are not just egging them on, not just cheering them on, but they have been repeatedly showing up in the illegal encampment of terrorists and telling them to keep going. And encouraging them to fight until the end, no matter what. And finally, they are being encouraged by the administration, who did a big show on Thursday of bringing in the NYPD, arrested 108 students for trespassing, and like a turnstile, brought them back on campus,\" he said.\nDavidai compared the protests and antisemitism to a fire, arguing that \"student mobs that are being brainwashed are the burning material,\" while the \"administration that has done absolutely nothing for six freaking months\" serves as the oxygen that feeds the fire, and the \"the pro-Hamas professors are the arsonists.\"\nAt least three people were arrested Saturday, according to the New York Post, including for disorderly conduct. Another person was seen being carried out on a stretcher by EMS and treated for an unknown issue.\n\"We want justice, you say how? Stop arming Israel now!\" the protesters chanted Saturday.\nThe protest Saturday comes after more than 100 protesters were arrested on Thursday, when police raided a tent encampment they set up, dubbed the \"Gaza Solidarity encampment\" and \"liberated zone.\" Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar's daughter was among those arrested on Thursday, after she said earlier that day she was suspended from Barnard College for \"standing in solidarity with Palestinians facing a genocide,\" Fox Digital previously reported.\nDavidai also took issue with New York politicians who have remained silent on the protests, pointing specifically to Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand as \"shameful.\"\n\"And Chuck Schumer, who's the senator of New York, has said absolutely nothing. And Gillibrand has said absolutely nothing. And these people are shameful. They are shameful. And I hope to see them go, not because I don't believe in their liberal values, but I don't believe in their morals. You cannot just say things and let the Jewish students fend for themselves. And last night, and this morning, and for the past four days, and for the past six months, we have seen the Jewish students fending for themselves,\" Davidai said.\n\"And it's time not just for the NYPD, but for the National Guard. Gov. Hochul has to come in and say something,\" he added.\nNew York native and Jewish influencer Lizzy Savetsky told Fox that the protests are \"deeply troubling\" considering New York City is home to the world's largest Jewish community outside of Israel, and echoed Davidai that more local leaders need to step up and take action on the protests.\n\"Columbia's violent protests contrast sharply with our city's values of diversity and mutual respect. As a Jewish activist in NYC, I stand with students facing threats and discrimination on campus. Columbia must prioritize the safety of all students and ensure that access to education is protected. With the alarming rise in antisemitic attacks across our city, state and local officials must urgently step up to protect the Jewish community at Columbia and combat these terrorist supporters in our streets,\" she said.\nRepublican New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who has been publicly condemning U.S. campus antisemitism for months, called for Columbia President Minouche Shafik to \"immediately resign\" last week and for the school to appoint an individual \"who will protect Jewish students and enforce school policies.\"\nBarnard College, Columbia University student Yola Ashkenazie told Fox News Digital on Sunday that the environment on campus is \"scary, dangerous, and untenable\" and that protesters have crossed a line and become \"violent.\"\n\"On Saturday night, student protesters proudly chanted for the death of Jewish and Israeli students. They did so by chanting in support of Hamas' military wing and called on them to strike Israeli cities and pro-Israel students at Columbia. As a university that prides itself on critical thinking, I've seen a complete loss of it this week,\" she said.\n\"Jewish students are unable to be on campus right now. Prohibiting us from receiving the education that we work so hard to be able to obtain is unacceptable, and university administration must do everything they can to ensure that we can resume our studies as soon as possible,\" Ashkenazi said.\nColumbia alum Sheila Nazarian, a plastic surgeon originally from Iran, told Fox Digital that she's stopped donating to the school over campus antisemitism, and said it's time for the National Guard to respond to campus, while the administration must expel students who take part in the protests.\n\"Having studied in the classrooms of Columbia University, I've always valued the institution's dedication to intellectual diversity and open discourse. However, the recent events unfolding on campus, with anti-Israel protests and inflammatory rhetoric, are deeply troubling. As an alumna, I believe it's crucial for Columbia to uphold its principles of inclusivity while safeguarding the rights of all students, including those of Jewish descent. Columbia has stopped receiving donations from many alumni, including me, since they failed to stop the student body from passing a BDS resolution. They will continue to not receive a penny from me in donations until this antisemitism problem is cleaned up,\" she said.\n\"It's imperative for the university administration to start taking definitive steps to address and condemn any form of discrimination or hostility targeting Jewish students. Call in the National Guard. Stop taking money from foreign bad actors. Fire terrorist sympathizers on staff. Expel terrorist students. These are all adults. And they must be held accountable,\" she added.\nFox News Digital reached out to the school for comment on the reactions to the protests, but did not immediately receive replies.\nThis weekend, the Orthodox rabbi at Columbia University and Barnard College told students in a message to leave campus \"as soon as possible\" until the situation improves, noting that \"what we are witnessing in and around campus is terrible and tragic.\"\n\"The events of the last few days, especially last night, have made it clear that Columbia University's Public Safety and the NYPD cannot guarantee Jewish students' safety in the face of extreme antisemitism and anarchy,\" Rabbi Elie Buechler wrote. \"It deeply pains me to say that I would strongly recommend you return home as soon as possible and remain home until the reality in and around campus has dramatically improved.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Emma Colton","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2147940573.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.9131494,"_id":"c06eb131d58fbc4e14de601bf6631a7f"},{"title":"The rot runs deep at NPR.

Why should American taxpayers, who lean conservative, support the organization with their money?","summary":"Imagine if the Federal Highway Administration spent just 11% of its congressional funding on roads in red states and 67% of its funding on roads in blue states. Would that last long?\nOf course, not--Republicans and moderates in Congress would put an end to it immediately. It would be clearly unfair to taxpayers and a dysfunctional way to operate a federally funded highway system.\nBut that's how things work at the nation's largest public radio news organization, and that's why I am introducing the Defund NPR Act.\nNational Public Radio (NPR) has 87 registered Democrats and zero registered Republicans working in its Washington, D.C.. newsroom, and they've been preaching to the choir. Over two-thirds of NPR listeners are liberals and barely more than one out of every ten leans conservative.\nBut the U.S. taxpayers -- who are sending NPR nearly $100 million dollars a year in federal funding\u2014i.e. the American people\u2014lean conservative.\nWhy should they pay for a radio station that they don't like to listen to? Their money doesn't go to a conservative alternative to NPR, which is fine, but we shouldn't make an exception for far-left radio.\nOf course, the problem isn't just that NPR doesn't appeal to conservative Americans\u2014it's far worse than that. The heart of the issue is that NPR despises Republicans and their values.\nJust listen to their new CEO, Katherine Maher, who said that the \"the number one challenge here [to censoring Americans] that we see is, of course, the First Amendment in the United States.\"\nMaher believes that \"our reverence for the truth might be a distraction that's getting in the way of finding common ground and getting things done.\" Maher, who is expected to take in about $600,000 a year from American taxpayers, is openly contemptuous of our Constitution and objective journalism, and advocates for suppressing speech she disagrees with. Of course, according to Maher, \"Donald Trump is a racist.\" I'm sure she feels the same way about his supporters.\nUnfortunately, the rot runs deep at NPR and there's no easy fix. Firing Maher won't save the station, though it's still the right thing to do.\nNPR has a massive DEI staff that ensures that everything the outlet publishes is sufficiently woke. According to Uri Berliner, a 25-year NPR veteran who recently resigned, these partisan administrators monitor reporters' interviewees, run \"unconscious bias\" training sessions, and host employee affinity groups, including a \"Marginalized Genders and Intersex People of Color mentorship program\" and a group for \"Women, Gender-Expansive, and Transgender People in Technology Throughout Public Media.\"\nNPR has been a liberal propaganda machine for years.\nThe last and final time I went on NPR was during the first hoax impeachment of President Trump in 2019. I pointed out that Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who was leading the impeachment hoax, had lied about his relationship with the supposed Ukraine \"whistleblower,\" a man we now know to be Eric Ciaramella. The New York Times published a report confirming my statement the same day as my interview. But NPR still published a ridiculous \"correction\" accusing me of \"misinformation\" and apologizing to their listeners for airing the interview. Of course, NPR invited Schiff on to spread lies about the Russia hoax 25 times.\nThe fact is that NPR is just as biased, if not more biased, than left-wing outlets like CNN or MSNBC. Activists at NPR like Katherine Maher aren't hiding it anymore: Their mission is to boost Democrat politicians and indoctrinate the American public.\nCongress shouldn't give NPR another dime.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Rep.

Some German women have traveled to neighboring countries such as the Netherlands \u2014 especially during later phases of their pregnancies when abortion is considered completely illegal in Germany except for very grave cases \u2014 to have abortions there.\nOther European countries are in very different places in their approach to abortion. France, for example, inscribed the guaranteed right to abortion in its constitution last month, in a world first and a powerful message of support to women around the globe. Meanwhile, Poland's parliament held a long-awaited debate last week on liberalizing the country's law, which is more restrictive than Germany's, although many women terminate pregnancies at home with pills mailed from abroad.\nWhile the German commission's recommendation for the government to decriminalize abortion is non-binding, it is likely to heat up discussion over the issue in the country again. It could eventually also lead to the current regulation being reformed by parliament, but at this point it is not clear if and when that would happen.\n\"Our recommendation is to move away from this illegality and to label abortion in the early stages of pregnancy as legal,\" Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf, a law professor who is a member of the commission, told reporters in Berlin.\n\"This is not simply a formality, but you can imagine that it makes a big difference to the women concerned, those who are in the situation of considering whether to request an abortion, whether what they are doing is wrong or right,\" she added.\nMany women who have had abortions in Germany have described the mandatory counseling as humiliating, while others have said it helped them in their decision-making.\nIn addition to the tricky legal status of abortions in Germany, the experts also pointed out that in recent years, the number of physicians willing to perform an abortion in the country has gone down and that it's been more difficult for women to find a doctor in their region to help them.\nThe commission said that if the government decides to make abortion legal during the first 12 weeks, it should also ensure that women wishing to have a termination have quick and easy access to organizations and doctors providing it.\nCurrently, about 10% of physicians performing the medical intervention have faced criminal charges, though they are almost never found guilty.\nThe Catholic Church, one of the main opponents of liberalizing abortion regulations in Germany, quickly condemned the commission's recommendations.\n\"The commission is considering legalizing abortion in the early stages of pregnancy. This would mean the end of a clear concept of life protection,\" said Irme Stetter-Karp, the president of the powerful lay group Central Committee of German Catholics.\n\"Human dignity exists from the very beginning,\" she added, calling the proposal \"unacceptable.\"\nIn addition to its recommendations for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, the commission said that for the middle phase of pregnancy, it should be up to lawmakers to decide whether and for how long an abortion should be legal, while in the last trimester, abortions should not be allowed unless there is a strong medical or social reason.\n\"The shorter the pregnancy, the more likely an abortion is permissible; and the more advanced the gestational age, the more important the needs of the unborn child are,\" the commission members said in a summary of their report, which they handed over to government ministers later on Thursday.\nGerman Health Minister Karl Lauterbach said the report's \"scientific expertise is a major help in answering the complex ethical questions on reproductive self-determination and reproductive medicine.\"\nLauterbach warned everyone not to use the publication of the report as a trigger to heat up the discussion about the legitimacy of abortion again.\n\"What we don't need in Germany is another debate that divides society,\" the minister added. \"That's why I appeal to everyone to react objectively, to discuss things objectively, to avoid slipping into an ideological discussion.\"\nHe said the government would also discuss the report in detail and share it with parliament.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Germany-March-For-Life.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.478028,"_id":"4cabf04514ce5af88219aee82cd5f53f"},{"title":"Passover brisket: Holocaust survivor's recipe holds 'special significance' amid Jewish holiday","author":"Perri Blumberg","published_date":"2024-04-18 13:51:49","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/passover-brisket-holocaust-survivors-recipe-holds-special-significance-jewish-holiday","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"This brisket recipe from 'Food, Hope & Resilience: Authentic Recipes and Remarkable Stories from Holocaust Survivors\" is a mouth-watering meal to make at Passover.","summary":"Passover begins Monday, April 22, as members of the Jewish faith gather to commemorate the Israelites' freedom from slavery by God in Egypt.\nIn honor of the holiday, June Hersh, a New York-based author, is offering a brisket recipe from her book titled, \"Food, Hope & Resilience: Authentic Recipes and Remarkable Stories from Holocaust Survivors.\"\nThe dish was originally owned by Judith Ginsburg, a Holocaust survivor who shared it with Hersh.\n\"Born in Lida, Poland, Judith was first ghettoized, then escaped a march to fight alongside Russian partisans in the woods,\" Hersh said of Ginsburg, who died in 2021.\n\"After a short time, she joined the Bielski Brigade of partisans depicted in the acclaimed film, 'Defiance.'

Beijing has ignored rulings not in its favor, particularly in the South China Sea, where it is in dispute with five other parties over islands, waterways and undersea resources.\nJapan continues to defend its control over the uninhabited Senkaku island chain, called Diaoyu by China, in the East China Sea, against incursions by the Chinese coast guard.\nTaiwan last week reinforced its foothold in the disputed South China Sea by establishing satellite communications between the main island and its garrison on Taiping Island, also known as Itu Aba, the largest land feature in the highly contested Spratly Island chain. China has created seven artificial islands in the area by piling sand and cement on coral reefs and equipping them with airstrips and other military infrastructure.\nZhang said China's territorial sovereignty \"brooks no infringement and its core interests cannot be challenged. We do not provoke trouble, but we will never flinch in face of provocation. The Chinese military will resolutely defend the reunification and interest of the motherland.\"\nZhang has spoken in the past of Beijing's determination to take control of the self-governing island republic of Taiwan, which it claims as its own territory, using force if necessary. With its crucial high-tech economy, Taiwan has been building up its defenses on its own and with help from the U.S., where Congress this weekend approved $8 billion in military aid for Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific.\nTaiwan is also building its own submarines and trainer aircraft and waiting on the delivery of upgraded versions of F-16 fighters, battle tanks and other hardware from the U.S.\nZhang appeared to press China's unilateralist approach to foreign relations and military conflicts as espoused by Xi Jinping, the top military commander, Communist Party leader and head-of-state for life, who has eliminated all dissenting views.\nChina \"remains committed to resolving maritime disputes with directly concerned countries through friendly consultations, but we will not allow our good faith to be abused,\" Zhang said. \"Particularly over the self-governing island republic of Taiwan that Beijing threatens to use force to bring under its control. We will take justified actions to defend our rights in accordance with the law.\"\nZhang's comments follow a major shakeup of the Chinese military in recent months that has seen the still-unexplained disappearance of former Defense Minister Li Shangfu and several top officers in the missile corps.\nAlso due to speak at the gathering was the recently appointed head of the Russian navy, Adm. Alexander Moiseyev, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Monday, according to the official Interfax news agency.\nIt said Moiseyev met with Adm. Hu Zhongming, commander of China's People's Liberation Army Navy, in Qingdao on Sunday, and they agreed to further cooperation on search and rescue.\n\"The sides emphasized the importance of further developing cooperation between the two countries' fleets for supporting security and stability on the world's oceans,\" Interfax said.\nChina has refused to criticize Russia's full-on invasion of Ukraine and has held multiple rounds of drills with the Russian navy and other armed forces branches, part of an alignment of their military and political postures to form a joint front against the prevailing U.S.-led Western liberal order.\nUkraine has developed deadly sea drones that have struck Russian navy ships in the Black Sea.

But motherhood is not just rewarding, it's also difficult.","summary":"In a world that constantly bombards mothers with rigid standards and its expectations, it's time to champion the power of acceptance. As mothers, we often find ourselves grappling with insecurities and regrets, burdened by the weight of self-doubt. But what if, instead of striving for unattainable perfection, we chose to embrace acceptance? Acceptance of ourselves, our flaws, and our journey as mothers. Acceptance that acknowledges that we are doing our best and our best is enough.\nLeaving my young son with my family when I left for medical school was one of the most difficult decisions I've ever made. As I packed my bags and said goodbye, a torrent of worries flooded my mind. Would he feel abandoned? Would the separation harm our bond? The fear of being physically apart from him weighed heavily on my heart, overshadowing the excitement of pursuing my professional dreams.\nYet, amidst the uncertainty, I held onto the belief that this sacrifice was necessary for our future. I reassured myself that my family would provide him with the love and care he deserved in my absence. Each night on the phone we would talk about meeting in our dreams and all of the adventures we would go on together in our dreams. Though the separation was heartbreaking, it was also an opportunity for growth\u2014for both him and me. Through the distance, our bond only strengthened, fueled by love, dedication, and the shared hope for a brighter tomorrow.\nMy story is not unique. Motherhood for every woman is a story fraught with challenges, uncertainties, and sacrifices. Yet, amidst the clamor of daily life, it's so important for mothers stop questioning ourselves and allowing insecurities and regret consume us. We have to recognize that every decision we make, every sacrifice we endure, is driven by an unwavering love for our families. Whether it's juggling a career, managing a household, or navigating the complexities of parenting, everything we do is rooted in a deep-seated desire to provide the best possible life for the ones we love.\nThe ability to accept ourselves as women, as mothers, liberates us from the suffocating grip of comparison and judgment. Instead of measuring ourselves against unattainable standards set by society or social media, we must learn to embrace our unique journey and celebrate our individual strengths. There is not a one-size-fits-all approach to motherhood. Each mother, each family, is unique, and what works for one may not work for another. And that's OK.\nAccepting that perfection is not real is the first step towards finding contentment. In a world that often glorifies flawlessness, we have to recognize that perfection is a myth\u2014an unattainable ideal that only serves to breed dissatisfaction and self-doubt. In my new book, \"Love Mom,\" I share three extraordinary stories from moms that are centered on acceptance with incredible insights on how they were able to do so. I believe Jill Churchill said it best when she spoke,\nThere is not a one-size-fits-all approach to motherhood\n\"There's no way to be a perfect mother and a million ways to be a good one.\"\nTrue growth begins when we embrace imperfection, understanding that it is our flaws and mistakes that make us human. By letting go of the impossible quest of being \"perfect\" and the ideals of what people say we should be, we open ourselves up to a journey of self-discovery and self-acceptance. It's through our imperfections that we learn, evolve, and ultimately become our most authentic selves.\nIt took a long time to release myself from the shackles of perfectionism and embrace the beauty of imperfection\u2014in fact, it took decades into motherhood for me to let go of the stigma of having been a teen mom. As I looked around me, I couldn't help but be overwhelmed by the beauty of my life\u2014the love of family and the abundance of blessings that surrounded me.\nI realized that my constant worry about being better, achieving more, was robbing me of the simple joy of living in the present moment. In my pursuit of perfection, I had lost sight of the richness of life unfolding before me. It was a wake-up call\u2014an invitation to let go of the incessant need for proving the naysayers wrong and instead embrace the life of the here and now.\nIn the end, raising children is not about perfection; it's about love, resilience, and finding contentment. It's about embracing our imperfections and vulnerabilities and celebrating our authenticity. When we begin to accept who we are, we find the courage to be unapologetically ourselves.\nBy releasing the grip of expectation and celebrating our unique motherhood path for what it is\u2014a beautiful tapestry of highs and lows, triumphs and challenges\u2014we liberate ourselves from the chains of self-doubt. In doing so, we open our hearts to a deeper sense of joy, gratitude, and life, allowing us to cherish each moment with our children and savor the beauty of the imperfect, yet extraordinary, journey of motherhood.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Nicole Saphier","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Nicole-Saphier-Headshot_2024.jpg","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.339655,"_id":"64b68d6091bc146f5db5f70e00e534b7"},{"title":"Who's Funding NPR?: Editor Resignation, Bias Backlash Sparks Debate Over Tax Dollars","author":"If\ufffd Dancy","published_date":"2024-04-18 11:05:03","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://radio.foxnews.com/2024/04/18/whos-funding-npr-editor-resignation-bias-backlash-sparks-debate-over-tax-dollars","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"After 25 years at National Public Radio, Senior Editor Uri Berliner resigned Wednesday following backlash from fellow journalists regarding comments he made about NPR's political agenda.

Bill Hagerty, states that it will \"amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to further restrict contributions of foreign nationals.\"\nThe move comes after the Senate was briefed on a new report from Americans for Public Trust that shows Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss has sent more than $243 million to the Sixteen Thirty Fund which then invested $97.6 million in ballot campaigns across 25 states over the past decade. Those states included the key swing states of Michigan, Ohio, Colorado, and Nevada.\nThe tens of millions of dollars from the Sixteen Thirty Fund, which has also been funded by George Soros, went into ballot measures promoting abortion access, lessening drug penalties and prison sentences, raising the minimum wage, automatic voter registration and other progressive causes.\nWyss, who is referred to by some as the \"new George Soros\", also allegedly gave more than $135 million between 2016 and 2020 to a nonprofit that gave tens of millions to Super PACs that supported Joe Biden in 2020 and has steered tens of millions of dollars to Democratic fundraising committees, get out the vote efforts, and Democratic candidates via nonprofits.\n\"A single Swiss billionaire, Hansj\u00f6rg Wyss, has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into various left-wing causes meant to influence American politics,\" Honest Elections Project Executive Director Jason Snead told Fox News Digital last year. \"Since 2016 he has given at least $245 million to Arabella Advisors' dark money behemoths New Venture Fund and Sixteen Thirty Fund.

CTCL and its new Alliance are opening avenues for foreign billionaires to pump funds directly into the heart of US elections.\"\nCaitlin Sutherland, who told Fox News Digital last year that Wyss is the \"most influential figure in politics that you've never heard of\", wrote in the report's forward that Sixteen Thirty Fund is using Wyss's money as part of its \"war chest\" to \"support massive get out the vote drives, issue advocacy campaigns bolstering President Biden's agenda, liberal pet projects from abortion to immigration, and attack ads against Republican lawmakers.\"\nHagerty's bill would clarify that the existing foreign-national ban on \"indirect\" contributions covers attempts to circumvent the ban through intermediaries or instructions which conservatives have long argued poses a threat to Democracy when funds are dumped into dark money groups inside the U.S. from abroad.\n\"Foreign nationals are prohibited from donating to U.S. political candidates, committees and super PACs but there is no federal law prohibiting foreign nationals from donating to ballot committees,\" the report's conclusion explains. \"Some state laws exist to try to prevent this type of foreign influence, but in a majority of states, foreign nationals like Hansjorg Wyss, are allowed to write blank checks to fund ballot issues that could prioritize their interests over those of the residents of the state.\"\n\"If state and federal law permits a Swiss billiionaire to fund ballot initiative campaigns, there is nothing stopping U.S. adversaries from Communist China, Russia, or North Korea from doing the same.\"\nThe bill would prohibit foreign nationals from funding ballot harvesting and GOTV efforts, prohibit foreign nationals from funding U.S. election administration, and prohibit foreign nationals from spending money to influence ballot measures.\n\"After years of hysteria over Russiagate and alleged foreign influence in American elections, it turns out Democrats have recently benefited from hundreds of millions of dollars in election-related contributions from a shadowy foreign billionaire, sidestepping the federal ban on foreign-national contributions in U.S. elections,\" Hagerty said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\"This type of influence undermines democracy and self-government here in America, and its staggering scope should be alarming. I'm pleased to introduce this commonsense and critical legislation that will put an end to covert foreign influence on our elections and protect Americans' voice in electing their leaders.\"\nIn a statement, Sutherland said that \"it is irresponsible and alarming that our laws leave the door open to foreign nationals and U.S. adversaries influencing American politics.\"\n\"Our report reveals that Sixteen Thirty Fund alone is acting as a conduit for massive amounts of money from a foreign billionaire with an expressed desire to reshape U.S. politics to align with his out-of-touch worldview.

She also said she never had the chance to meet Berliner, telling Bateman, \"I wish in some ways that I had had that chance so that we could have talked about what his concerns were.\"\n\"I don't have any editorial guidance on the newsroom, but it would have been interesting to hear and be able to think about structurally what can we do,\" Maher said before pointing to quarterly meetings with NPR stations she implemented and a monthly newsroom meeting addressing NPR's coverage.\nShe continued, \"I think another piece of that is making sure we have active and robust debate in the newsroom from a wide variety of perspectives so that those conversations are being had. Again, that is something that is a newsroom leadership imperative. But giving people the ability to feel as though, that those conversations are welcomed, is creating a culture where those conversations are welcomed. Those are incredibly important priorities for us in order to be of service to the widest number of people.\"\nThat isn't exactly how Berliner felt in the statement he released announcing his resignation Wednesday from NPR after 25 years at the outlet.\n\"I am resigning from NPR, a great American institution where I have worked for 25 years. I don't support calls to defund NPR. I respect the integrity of my colleagues and wish for NPR to thrive and do important journalism. But I cannot work in a newsroom where I am disparaged by a new CEO whose divisive views confirm the very problems at NPR I cited in my Free Press essay,\" Berliner said.\nBerliner was referring to Maher's social media posts, which have surfaced in recent days displaying liberal activism and woke ideologies.\nIn his essay, Berliner criticized NPR's mishandling of Russiagate, the COVID lab leak theory, and the Hunter Biden laptop, arguing the 2016 election of Donald Trump quickly encouraged NPR journalists to find ways to \"damage or topple\" him as president.\nBerliner also revealed that among editorial staff in NPR's D.C. headquarters, 87 were registered Democrats and zero were Republicans, which helped drive his public plea for viewpoint diversity at the organization. He also shared how NPR reporters are supposed to enter in demographic data like the race and gender of people they talk to for stories, in order to track the diversity of subjects and sources.\nHis piece angered colleagues, with some telling in-house media reporter David Folkenflik they didn't want to work with him any longer. Berliner was suspended for five days without pay and NPR told him it was a \"final warning\" and he would be shown the door if he violated NPR's policy about appearing on other news platforms without seeking permission.\nInstead, he walked away on his own terms.\nReached for comment on Berliner's resignation, a spokesperson told Fox News Digital, \"NPR does not comment on individual personnel matters.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Joseph Wulfsohn,Cortney O'Brien","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/KatherineMaher3.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.1349244,"_id":"7d35467f14da1b388a44ddeb93f777f5"},{"title":"Republicans want to help Americans leave poverty, not be trapped in it like Democrats want","author":"Newt Gingrich","published_date":"2024-04-22 12:00:13","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/republicans-want-help-americans-leave-poverty-trapped-like-democrats-want","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Republicans and Democrats look at poverty from opposite directions. Republicans want to help Americans find their way out of poverty. Democrats want to keep them poor.","summary":"The left claims to care about income inequality, but time and time again, its members reject solutions that allow more people to accumulate assets and savings. That's because the left wants to end income inequality by leveling everyone down so everyone will be equally miserable. The American way, however, is to help everyone move up in income and have a better life.\nOne example of a dramatic effort to empower the poor and help them enrich themselves was developed by then-Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp, under President George H. W. Bush.\nAs a congressman from Buffalo, Kemp helped develop supply-side economics and authored the Kemp-Roth three-year tax cut, which became the basis for President Ronald Reagan's tax cut plan.\nBoth as a congressman and Secretary of HUD, Kemp was one of the most innovative leaders in finding ways to bring the benefits of capital and ownership to the poor.\nHe and civil rights activist Bob Woodson developed a program to allow people in public housing to eventually own the units in which they lived in exchange for helping to maintain the buildings.\nThis bold idea outraged left-wing Democrats. Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank, one of the most liberal members of the House, objected to the program, pointing out that it would enable poor New York City residents to acquire properties worth $1 million in the New York market.\nYes, the fact that the program could help poor people accumulate wealth was his objection. The left is willing to talk about helping the poor so long as they remain poor \u2013 and are kept dependent on the government.\nAnother example of a bold reform that would give lower income Americans the opportunity to accumulate more wealth is strengthening Social Security with personal savings accounts.\nOne of the major obstacles to fixing the wealth gap in America is the fact that 4-in-10 Americans have no investments in the stock market.\nIndividual accounts to strengthen Social Security would enable every American to have a 401(k) and enjoy larger monthly payments when they retire. Unlike the current Social Security model, this would enable seniors to leave the balance of their accounts to their heirs.\nThis opportunity is particularly important to Americans of lower incomes because the lack of generational wealth transfer is a major driver of persistent inequality.\nOf course, the left objects to this enhancement of Social Security \u2013 not because it would be bad for the poor and minorities, but because it would make these groups more capitalist and less dependent on government.\nIn recent years, we've seen this pattern repeat itself in the left's assault on retail trading platforms that allow customers to access the stock market via apps on their phones.\nBecause they don't charge commissions for trades, retail investment apps lower the barrier to entry by making small dollar investing cost-effective. Instead of making money on commissions, these trading platforms often rely on small rebates from market-making firms that compete to execute the trades \u2013 a process called payment for order flow (PFOF).\nToday, commission-free online investing and trading is the norm. Since the introduction of zero-commission trades in 2013, a slew of commission-free online investing platforms has arisen in the marketplace. As a result, retail investment volume for equities grew to 25% of total investing trading volume in 2021 from 10-15% in the 2010s (BNY Mellon November 2021). This increase in retail investment has brought with it an increase in the number of minorities and women joining the investor class.\nA report by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Foundation showed that since 2015, minorities have entered the investing market at a faster pace than whites. And, these minority investors tend to be younger than the white investors.\nAnother report from Fidelity showed that 67% of women are now investing outside of retirement, up from 44% in 2018. Again, the largest increase comes from younger women. The study also showed that women tend to outperform men as investors.\nBut much like Congressman Frank, who objected to the idea that the poor might get a chance to own a $1 million home, the left objects to the idea of giving more people the opportunity to accumulate wealth through investing. President Joe Biden's U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissioner Gary Gensler, backed by liberal Democrat politicians such as Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, falsely claim that without commissions paid by traders, the trading apps serve the interests of market makers and hedge funds, not the customers. Others on the left claim that options trading is too risky to allow normal Americans easy access.\nSome trading platforms, such as Public.com, have attempted to appease the left, announcing in 2021 that they were eliminating PFOF and would instead rely solely on tips to make money. Public also prohibited its customers from trading even basic options.\nIndividual accounts to strengthen Social Security would enable every American to have a 401(k) and enjoy larger monthly payments when they retire. Unlike the current Social Security model, this would enable seniors to leave the balance of their accounts to their heirs.\nHowever, earlier this year, the company did a 180, announcing the return of PFOF as part of the introduction of options trading to their platform. Like many companies that experienced \"go woke, go broke\" effects, Public discovered it could either give its customers what they want or the left what it wants. Public appears to have chosen its bottom line.\nPoliticians should learn the same lesson. Americans are struggling in the Biden economy and want financial independence. This means providing them with more opportunities to accumulate wealth, not taking those opportunities away by banning the business models that enable more people to invest.\nThe deterioration of our cities and explosion of housing costs under Biden also mean it is time to think more creatively about our welfare and anti-poverty programs. They should support the benefits of savings, investment, and wealth accumulation.\nOur goal should be to help people leave poverty, not keep them stuck there.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Newt Gingrich","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/12/iStock-849242834.jpg","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.102105,"_id":"0293a2f8294a53e76eceb2b13959c329"},{"title":"Georgian opposition parties urge mass protests against 'Russian' bill","author":"Fox News Staff","published_date":"2024-04-22 23:29:44","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/georgian-opposition-parties-urge-mass-protests-against-russian-bill","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Six Georgian opposition parties appealed last week for mass protests against a bill on \"foreign agents\" which they say aims to block the South Caucasus country's path towards the European Union and\u2026","summary":"Six Georgian opposition parties appealed on Thursday for mass protests against a government bill on \"foreign agents\" which they say aims to block the South Caucasus country's path towards the European Union and NATO.\nThe bill, which critics compare to legislation that Russia has used extensively to crack down on dissent, has already prompted three straight nights of demonstrations this week in the capital Tbilisi.\nUp to 10,000 protesters gathered outside the parliament on Wednesday evening before marching on the prime minister's office. At least 13 people have been detained over the past two days and one police officer was injured in altercations, the interior ministry said.\nIn their jointly published statement, the opposition parties hailed the protesters' \"fighting spirit\" and slammed the ruling Georgian Dream party for supporting the bill.\n\"The Russian law initiated by 'Georgian Dream' is in contradiction with the Constitution of Georgia, the will of the Georgian people to become a full-fledged member of the European Union and NATO, and the long-term goal of securing the sovereignty of our country,\" the parties said.\nThe Kremlin has denied any association with the bill.\nThe opposition specifically singled out Bidzina Ivanishvili, a billionaire former prime minister who founded Georgian Dream, for \"trying to kill the European future of Georgia\".\nIvanishvili could not be reached for comment.\nThe bill would require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as agents of foreign influence. Georgian Dream says it will help promote transparency and combat \"pseudo-liberal values\" imposed by foreigners.\nEighty-three of parliament's 150 deputies backed the bill on its first reading on Wednesday in a vote boycotted by opposition parties. It must clear two more readings to become law.\nThe EU said the bill risks blocking Georgia's path to membership, while the U.S. State Department also expressed disappointment over Wednesday's parliamentary vote.\n\"(The bill) could limit freedom of expression, stigmatize organizations that deliver these benefits to the citizens of Georgia, and impede independent media organizations working to provide Georgians with access to high quality information,\" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.\nGeorgia's pro-European opposition is deeply divided, including over the legacy of jailed former president Mikheil Saakashvili, whose United National Movement (UNM) party remains the country's second largest.\nThe UNM was among the six signatories to Thursday's appeal.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Fox News Staff","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/georgia-protests.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.064766,"_id":"be7f80410e04fa29ce68acecd8ceb4a8"},{"title":"Katie Couric blames 'anti-intellectualism,' 'class resentment' driving Trump's MAGA voters","author":"Kristine Parks","published_date":"2024-04-16 14:13:27","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/katie-couric-blames-anti-intellectualism-class-resentment-driving-trumps-maga-voters","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Former TV anchor Katie Couric claimed class resentment and anti-intellectualism was behind the MAGA movement during an appearance on Bill Maher's podcast this week.","summary":"Former TV anchor Katie Couric argued President Trump's MAGA base was driven by \"anti-intellectualism\" and class resentment, in a recent interview.\nOn Sunday's edition of Bill Maher's \"Club Random\" podcast, Couric debated the liberal comedian about the polarization in society and the motivations of Trump supporters.\nCouric argued that the wealth gap in America was wider than ever before and had spurred class resentment in the culture. She argued this was driving the MAGA movement.\n\"The socioeconomic disparities are a lot and class resentment is a lot and anti-intellectualism and elitism is what is driving many of these anti-establishment \u2014 which are Trump voters \u2014 so, I think that is a huge problem that we have to address,\" Couric said.\nShe went on to double down on her argument that class resentment and jealousy drove voters to support Trump.\n\"I mean globalization and the transition from an industrial to a technological society \u2014 I don't know if you've ever been jealous of someone else or resentful \u2014 it is such a corroding and bitter, almost bile feeling,\" she told Maher.\n\"I think that when people who are really struggling see people who have everything, and are on top of that, looking down on them, it is just a recipe for such anger and resentment and grievance,\" she continued.\nHowever, Maher pushed back on Couric's argument, suggesting that Trump voters had legitimate complaints about Democrats, bringing up the border hypocrisy of sanctuary city leaders.\nMaher also said he was \"bored\" with the media's negative treatment of Trump and wished they would understand the perspective of the typical Trump voter.\n\"Not to defend Trump, but to defend the people who still vote for him. Because what they see on the other side, to them, is even more dangerous. Because it's closer to home,\" he said, referencing gender ideology in schools and anti-Trump sentiment in the media.\n\"Those kind of things are what they say, 'That's why I'm voting for Trump,'\" Maher added. \"'We don't like him but he's all that stands between us and madness,' That's their view.

Many feel that someone with such blunt partisan views running NPR on the heels of veteran editor Uri Berliner penning a scathing takedown that detailed the \"absence of viewpoint diversity\" at the organization could be troublesome, but the organization chalked up the resurfaced tweets as \"bad faith\" attacks.\n\"This is a bad faith attack that follows an established playbook, as online actors with explicit agendas work to discredit independent news organizations,\" an NPR spokesperson told Fox News Digital.\n\"In this case, they resorted to digging up old tweets and making conjectures based on our new CEO's resume,\" the spokesperson continued. \"Spending time on these accusations is intended to detract from NPR's mission of informing the American public and providing local information in communities around the country is more important than ever.\"\nRufo has also unearthed old video of Maher saying the First Amendment makes it too difficult to censor \"bad information.\" But much of the controversy surrounding her is the result of posts on X, the platform previously known as Twitter.\nBefore taking over NPR, Maher tweeted essentially whatever was on her mind. For example, she once shared details of a dream where her and Kamala Harris were on a road trip together \"comparing nuts and baklava from roadside stands\" before she \"woke up very hungry.\"\nOthers were more political.\nMaher wrote on X in May 2020 that while \"looting is counterproductive,\" it was \"hard to be mad about protests not prioritizing the private property of a system of oppression founded on treating people's ancestors as private property.\" In another post on the thread, Maher said that property damage was \"not the thing\" Americans should be upset over.\nIn another 2020 post, Maher is seen donning a Biden for president hat and said it was the \"best part\" of her efforts to get out the vote.\n\"I can't stop crying with relief,\" she wrote after Biden won.\nMaher also took issue with the infamous New York Times Tom Cotton op-ed in 2020, saying it was \"full of racist dog whistles.\" She argued it was based on the \"false premise that the country is in a state of \u2018disorder.'\"\nSeveral of her old posts that have resurfaced reference concern over White privilege and \"White silence.\"\nIn June 2020, Maher declared \"White silence is complicity.\"\n\"If you are White, today is the day to start a conversation in your community,\" she continued.\nMaher identified herself as an \"unalloyed progressive\" supporting Clinton in the 2016 election. However, Maher had some criticism for Clinton at the time, saying she wished the then-Democratic presidential nominee \"wouldn't use the language of \u2018boy and girl,'\" because it was \"erasing language for non-binary people.\"\nIn 2018, she wrote, \"I'm angry. Hot angry, slow angry, relentless angry. This anger is going to fuel and burn for a long time, and it will deliver back exponentially,\" during Christine Blasey Ford's testimony accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.\nRufo joined Fox News on Tuesday to explain why he's been busy circulating Maher's old tweets.\n\"I spent the last day or two digging through her tweets to show people exactly what she believes. It's actually incredible. It is the most vapid, left-wing propaganda imaginable,\" Rufo said on \"Jesse Watters Primetime.\"\n\"She's been at it for year. She's a supporter of BLM, she believes in the pseudo-science of White privilege, White fragility, she criticized her own Whiteness,\" he continued. \"It's like Mad Libs for left-wing women.\"\nIn addition to the deluge of old social media messages being resurfaced, NewBusters reported on Wednesday that Maher has donated to Democratic candidates such as Stacey Abrams. NPR did not immediately respond to a request for comment about her donations.\nBerliner, who resigned after blowing the whistle on NPR's liberal bias, doesn't think Maher is fit for the job.\n\"We're looking for a leader right now who's going to be unifying and bring more people into the tent and have a broader perspective on, sort of, what America is all about,\" Berliner told NPR media reporter David Folkenflik prior to quitting. \"And this seems to be the opposite of that.\"\nBerliner also scolded Maher when he stepped down.\n\"I am resigning from NPR, a great American institution where I have worked for 25 years.

He'd announce his task force and the nationwide manhunt for the offenders.\n\u2026\nOf course, the media would lap it all up. They would nod in agreement, as they did to.... They'd talk about how hateful the crowd was, veins bulging. There'd be talk of possible RICO charges, conspiracy to violate civil rights.

It's very dangerous.\nThe discretion to charge generally only is used in one direction now, and that's against conservatives. From the way they went after the J-6ers to how they descended on people like Roger Stone, remember that? And what they're still doing to Donald Trump. Speak about what you consider to be the corruption of the court, and they'll throw you in jail, or at least threaten it. That's a tactic that would make Putin very proud.\nAnd the same analysis really applies to college campuses.

The DOJ argued that the Gun Control Act of 1968 permits the rule because it defines a \"firearm\" to include \"any weapon\u2026which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive,\" as well as \"the frame or receiver of any such weapon.\"\nHowever, gun rights groups say that the rule is \"unconstitutional and abusive.\"\nFirearms Policy Coalition President Brandon Combs, who is challenging the rule in court, said the group is \"delighted that the Supreme Court will hear our case and decide this important issue once and for all.\"\n\"The Fifth Circuit's decision in our case was correct and now that victory can be applied to the entire country,\" he said.\nThe ATF's rule requires unfinished parts of a firearm, like the frame of a handgun or the receiver of a long gun, to be treated like a completed firearm. These parts need to be licensed and must have serial numbers.\nThe rule also requires manufacturers to run background checks before selling these parts, as they are required to do for whole commercial firearms. The Biden administration argued the rule is necessary to respond to rising numbers of untraceable guns.\nThe Justice Department had argued in court that local law enforcement agencies seized more than 19,000 ghost guns at crime scenes in 2021, a more than tenfold increase in just five years.\nThe Supreme Court had previously allowed the regulation to remain in effect while the lawsuit continued through the courts, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett voting with the three liberal members of the court to form the majority.\nJustices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas said they would have kept the regulation on hold while the case made its way through the appeals process.\nArguments in the case Garland v.

Trump also weighed in last month that Merchan's daughter had represented Democratic politicians such as Vice President Kamala Harris and Rep. Adam Schiff.\n\"Judge Juan Merchan, who is suffering from an acute case of Trump Derangement Syndrome (whose daughter represents Crooked Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Adam \u2018Shifty' Schiff, and other Radical Liberals, has just posted a picture of me behind bars, her obvious goal, and makes it completely impossible for me to get a fair trial) has now issued another illegal, un-American, unConstitutional \u2018order,' as he continues to try and take away my Rights,\" Trump posted on Truth Social last month after he was given a gag order limiting what he could publicly say about the case.\nTrump's legal team had also called on Merchan last year to recuse himself, pointing to his daughter's work and previous small donations Merchan made to Democrat causes for the 2020 election. The judge also denied that request for recusal, citing that a judicial ethics advisory committee had determined his daughter's interests would not impact his ability to fairly oversee the case.\nTrump's hush money trial kicked off Monday morning, with the former president seen leaving Trump Tower before heading to the Manhattan Criminal Court, where he slammed the case as \"political persecution.\"\n\"Nothing like this has ever happened before,\" he said in Lower Manhattan. \"This is political persecution. ... It's a case that should have never been brought.\"\n\"This is an assault on America and that's why I'm very proud to be here,\" Trump added. \"This is really an attack on a political opponent.\"\nTrump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The trial focuses on payments made by Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to former pornographic actor Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. The $130,000 payment was to allegedly quiet her claims of an alleged extramarital affair she had with Trump in 2006.\nTrump has denied the affair and pleaded not guilty to the 34 charges against him.\nProsecutors say that the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen and falsely recorded the payments as legal expenses. Falsifying business records is a misdemeanor, and prosecutors are working to prove that Trump falsified records with an intent to commit or conceal a second crime, which is a felony.\nThe case is anticipated to last at least six weeks, with jury selection alone anticipated to last at least a week.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Emma Colton","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/trumpmerchan.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.5426106,"_id":"df250dbd9b9fa5c12ddca1493041cffc"},{"title":"Bill Maher erupts on anti-Israel protesters siding with Hamas, Iran: 'They're being huge a--holes!'","author":"Joseph Wulfsohn","published_date":"2024-04-21 16:00:01","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-erupts-anti-israel-protesters-siding-hamas-iran","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"HBO's Bill Maher took aim at anti-Israel protesters, predicting they'll have a major presence at the upcoming DNC convention in Chicago, mirroring the infamous 1968 riots.","summary":"\"Real Time\" host Bill Maher erupted on anti-Israel protesters, calling them \"huge a--holes\" as their rhetoric and demonstrations continue escalating.\n\"We started out with this with 'Okay, we're for Hamas.' That was the beginning of it and a lot of people were unapologetic about that,\" Maher said during a panel discussion Friday night. \"Then it went to, you know, the kids, they dug up some of Bin Laden's old books.

Hate speech? Totally a different thing.\"\nMaher went on to draw a grim parallel between the ongoing unrest among the anti-Israel wing of the Democratic base to the infamous riots that occurred at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, predicting it will happen again at the 2024 convention in August, which is also in Chicago.\n\"It's going to happen again because the kids are out - they're gonna be out there in force chanting about \u2018Genocide Joe' because this is their new cause now,\" Maher said. \"This they think is the cause of their lifetime, Hamas, to be on their side.\"\n\"So I'm just wondering how the Democrats are gonna come out of that convention.

John Fetterman, D-Penn., made his case for marijuana legalization ahead of April 20, known as a holiday of sorts for those who enjoy smoking or otherwise consuming the drug.\n\"Right now, we're doing this interview in Washington, D.C., and right now I could leave [and] go buy marijuana legally,\" Fetterman told Fox News Digital in an interview on Friday. He compared the capital's policy on the drug to that of his home state Pennsylvania, which only allows residents to legally use marijuana for medicinal purposes.\n\"Pennsylvanians wanted this five years ago,\" he claimed, recalling his time campaigning throughout the state. \"We're still not there.\"\nFetterman noted that most of the states surrounding the Keystone State had already made the drug legal for adults. \"It's not complicated. Other states have done that,\" he said.\nOhio, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, which surround Pennsylvania, have legalized marijuana for adult recreational use in small amounts.\nThe origins of 4/20's association with marijuana are not agreed on, but it has been speculated that the holiday could have started in several ways. Some theorize that the number 420 was used by police to reference the drug, while others point to Bob Dylan's \"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35,\" noting that when the numbers are multiplied they equal 420. Despite the various theories, there does not appear to be consensus on how the day began.\n\"It needs to be safe, pure, taxed and available,\" Fetterman said, explaining that illegally purchased versions of the drug are difficult to trace and could be cut with dangerous substances, such as fentanyl.\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, marijuana in small amounts has been made legal for recreational use by adults in 24 states, as well as Washington, D.C., and two U.S. territories.\n\"Any adult should be allowed to do that legally without any criminal \u2026 blowback,\" the Pennsylania senator said.\nFetterman told Fox News Digital that he has encouraged President Biden directly to take federal steps towards \"liberalizing\" the drug.\nHe has also lobbied Biden to deschedule marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), under which the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) currently lists it as schedule I. This schedule includes drugs \"with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\" Marijuana is included in the list of schedule I substances, alongside heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), ecstasy, and peyote, among others.\nFetterman stressed he doesn't believe \"anyone [should] have their lives impacted criminally for a nonviolent marijuana charge.\"\nAs for illegal markets that still exist in states where marijuana has been legalized, he noted that no states have implemented the policy perfectly, \"but I think you'll see that that will continue to evolve.\"\n\"Marijuana is going to continue\" to become cheaper as policy develops, and \"that will absolutely eliminate any of [those] illegal markets,\" he claimed.\nThe senator also emphasized the bipartisan nature of efforts to reform marijuana policy. \"Republicans want legal weed. Democrats want legal weed,\" he said. \"And I think this is a [place] where we could come together in a bipartisan way to say, 'Look, let's do this and just get on with it.'\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Julia Johnson","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Fetterman-weed-420-leglalize.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.3939786,"_id":"3b78c124aedb3722e2fe8edb8c3ed282"},{"title":"Trump taunts Dems' strategy as hush money trial set to pick back up and more top headlines","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-18 10:53:29","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/trump-taunts-dems-strategy-hush-money-trial-set-pick-back-up-more-top-headlines","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox.","summary":"'REVERSE EFFECT' \u2013 Trump taunts Democrats' sideline strategy as hush money trial set to pick back up.

Kennedy Jr. \u2014 was overshadowed by a male protester yelling unintelligibly immediately behind her.\nThe protester appeared only briefly in CNN's shot of the interview, but video posted on X by a reporter from another outlet captured the man standing behind Kennedy screaming that he has rights and was allowed to be at the event before being physically removed. It was not immediately clear what the man was protesting about.\nFollowing the outburst, the Kennedy family, led by Kerry Kennedy, officially endorsed Biden's re-election bid. The endorsement came as a snub to RFK Jr., who they say is acting as a \"spoiler\" to Biden's re-election chances and could lead to a victory for former President Donald Trump in November.\nRFK Jr. reacted to the endorsement in a post on X, praising his family, but also noting that other family members were supportive of and working for his campaign.\n\"I hear some of my family will be endorsing President Biden today. I am pleased they are politically active \u2014 it's a family tradition. We are divided in our opinions but united in our love for each other,\" he wrote. \"I hold this as a possibility for America, too. Can we disagree without hating our opponents? Can we restore civility and respect to public discourse? I think we can.\"\n\"My campaign, which many of my family members are working on and supportive of, is about healing America \u2014 healing our economy, our chronic disease crisis, our middle class, our environment, and our standing in the world as a peaceful nation. But this will only happen if we heal our national conversation, and move from rage and fear into love and respect,\" he added.\nLast month, the Democratic National Committee launched an effort to silence the threat to Biden's re-election from third-party candidates, namely Kennedy, in the form of a team that is expected to actively combat them with legal challenges and opposition research.\nSince its inception, members of the team have posted near-constant criticism of RFK Jr. on social media and have frequently referred to him as a \"spoiler\" candidate. They have also claimed that Kennedy is in cahoots with Trump in order to help him win.\nEarlier this month, the DNC accused RFK Jr.'s campaign of acknowledging its role as a \"spoiler\" after a woman associated with the campaign was captured on video discussing campaign strategy and how Trump could win the state of New York with the independent candidate on the ballot in November.\nAccording to video reviewed by Fox News Digital, a self-identified Kennedy campaign staffer told a room of Republicans in New York that the only way Trump could win the traditionally Democrat state in November was with Kennedy on the ballot.\n\"If it's Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\" the staffer said.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brandon Gillespie","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Kennedy-Screenshot-2.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.3902583,"_id":"215ea08cdc6560ce3cd8160881c9fc8a"},{"title":"Katie Couric torched for 'cringeworthy' condescension toward Trump supporters reminiscent of Hillary","author":"Charles Creitz","published_date":"2024-04-16 22:19:08","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/katie-couric-torched-cringeworthy-condescension-trump-supporters-hillary","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Katie Couric was ripped for targeting Trump supporters in a way some found similar to Hillary Clinton's remark that they can be categorized in a \"basket of deplorables.\"","summary":"Former NBC \"Today\" show host Katie Couric continued to receive backlash Tuesday after a diatribe against the purported ignorance of supporters of former President Trump that one critic compared to Hillary Clinton's infamous 2016 \"deplorables\" remarks.\nCouric told liberal comic Bill Maher on his \"Club Random\" podcast that \"socioeconomic disparities\" and \"class resentment\" along with \"anti-intellectualism and -elitism\" is driving the populist, anti-establishment bent of Trump's supporters.\nCouric suggested the United States' economic transition from industrial to technological has caused jealousy as well as a \"corroding, bitter, almost bile feeling.\"\nOn \"Outnumbered,\" co-host Harris Faulkner compared Couric's comments to those of Clinton, who told a New York City crowd while running against Trump in 2016 that half of such supporters of the Republican nominee can be categorized in a \"basket of deplorables.\"\nClinton's remark received criticism and has been credited as one of the turning points in the campaign that led to Trump's upset victory.\n\"Not only are they out-of-touch, and look, Katie Couric used to be a great journalist \u2026 I'm not really sure what lane she's in now, but it sounded like what she wanted to say was \u2018basket of deplorables,'\" Faulkner said.\nFox News contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier said the sight of Maher and Couric sitting in armchairs discussing such a topic was \"rather cringeworthy\" and that in a way, even with her own doctorate degree and place on the socioeconomic spectrum described by Couric, she, too, was offended by the ex-\"Today\" anchor.\n\"I don't even know what she's talking about at this point, and so I can't imagine what other people were feeling as well. And at the end of the day, yes, those who have higher socioeconomic stature, you know, they're not feeling the effects of the White House right now and the economics that are going on, the crime in their streets, in their neighborhoods and the cost of things at the grocery store,\" she said.\n\"She's talking down on all these people who are actually suffering, and she just seems so out-of-touch with the American people, which kind of is what's been going on with the White House, the entire administration.\"\nSaphier quipped that Couric might want to seek White House employment.\n\"Outnumbered's\" \"One Lucky Guy\" on Tuesday, talk show host Ben Ferguson, echoed much of his co-panelists' sentiments, saying it reminded him of media figures assessing the need for \"deprogramming\" of Trump voters.\n\"It was like a coordinated effort by the left to say, \u2018Hey, we need to deprogram all these crazies.' I love this type of rhetoric from them because it goes back to the simple issue, \u2018It's the economy, stupid,'\" Ferguson said, quoting former Bill Clinton strategist James Carville's winning message from the 1992 presidential sweeps.\n\"If people are suffering and this is your response to that, that anyone that disagrees with you is somehow ignorant or stupid or dumb, then I think people are going to show up and vote to say, 'No, I'm actually concerned about providing for my family.'\"\nFerguson also noted the average American worker doesn't have \"Katie Couric money,\" which according to recent reports is upwards of $110 million.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Charles Creitz","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/KatieCouric1.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.371087,"_id":"33530c65c1b4c09d2e55cab6c356b3b6"},{"title":"Chicago voter confronts Mayor Johnson over 'disrespectful' migrant funding, says city united against him","author":"Bailee Hill","published_date":"2024-04-19 15:01:15","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/chicago-voter-confronts-mayor-johnson-disrespectful-migrant-funding-city-united-against","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Chicago voters are pushing back against Mayor Brandon Johnson for his 'insulting' and 'disrespectful' migrant funding plan that would re-allocate tax dollars to illegal immigrants.","summary":"An outraged Chicago resident spoke out against Mayor Brandon Johnson for re-purposing tax dollars for illegal immigrants shortly before the city is set to vote on a $70 million proposal to bolster sanctuary city resources.\n\"P-Rae\" Easley called out Johnson for the \"disrespectful\" effort to use residents' hard-earned tax dollars for the migrant crisis during \"Fox & Friends,\" but also thanked him for inadvertently uniting the city against the proposal.\n\"It's the most disrespectful thing we've ever encountered in our lives,\" Easley told Lawrence Jones on Friday.\n\"We've been paying property taxes in the city for generations, and to see them so openly give our money to people who don't deserve it is very insulting. \u2026 I want to thank our mayor for uniting the city in a way that we haven't seen since the '96 Bulls, and that's against him and this progressive agenda,\" she said later in the interview, referencing the NBA team's dynasty under Michael Jordan.\nHer remarks come after she and other residents showed up in force at a City Council meeting on Wednesday to protest the liberal mayor's request for an additional $70 million in taxpayers' funds to be spent on tackling the migrant crisis, while a petition that would give residents the right to recall the mayor is gathering traction.\nThe progressive mayor, who has vigorously defended the city's sanctuary policies in the past, wants aldermen to greenlight the extra cash despite the Windy City having already poured $300 million into housing, food and health care for migrants, according to the city's latest numbers.\n\"They're showing up here in New York and Chicago attacking people in the streets,\" another resident said on Wednesday. \"The police are fighting with them in the\u2026 shelters that you guys are funding.\"\nThe $70 million, should the full City Council approve the proposal, will be drawn from the city's assigned fund balance from 2022, Budget Director Annette Guzman said Monday, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.\nEasley slammed city leaders for entertaining the allocation given the fact the city has struggled to provide funding for basic city resources like education.\n\"It's extremely insulting,\" she said. \"They've been telling us my entire life that they don't have money for this.

That's in addition to $44 million in spending already secured for the program through previous budget moves.\nSpending on migrants in the city skyrocketed last year from $2 million a month in August to $15 million in December. In January, migrant numbers peaked at around 5,000 in shelters but have since dropped to around 1,000, according to official figures.\n\"After more than a year of facing this crisis together, Denver finally has a sustainable plan for treating our newcomers with dignity while avoiding the worst cuts to city services,\" Johnston said.\nThe mayor's office says it will avoid layoffs or furloughs of employees, but there will still be cuts to find the extra $45.9 million in funding. The mayor's office will see its budget cut by nearly 10%.\nDenver's police department, meanwhile, will have its budget cut by $8.4 million, about 1.9% of its budget. And about $5 million of that will come from restricting hiring for open positions, 9News reported. Police officers will still be hired by Denver International Airport, which will pay for the costs of a recruiting class.\nElsewhere, the city's fire department will have its budget cut by less than 1%, about $2.5 million, largely from not filling open positions.\nFunded as part of the new spending will be a new \"Denver Asylum Seekers Program.\" It will apply to around 1,000 people in the shelter system and will connect them with housing assistance options for six months until they can get a work permit under their asylum claims.\nThere will also be a \"WorkReady\" program, described as an \"innovative pre-work authorization readiness program\" by which migrants can be connected with training opportunities, including language instruction.\nThe city says it has helped more than 40,000 migrants in 16 months, the most per capita of any city in the country, at a cost of more than $68 million.\nA spokesperson for Johnston rejected descriptions of the cuts as \"defunding\" the police and said there will be 167 new police recruits added to the force in 2024. The spokesperson also said the 1.9% cut is less than the average of 2.5% cuts to all city agencies and that the cuts will have no impact on public services and result in no officers being taken off the streets.\n\"The City of Denver's adjustment to the Denver Police Department's budget was carefully crafted with safety leaders and Mayor Johnston to ensure there would be no impact to the department's public services. And no officers will be taken off the streets,\" spokesperson Jordan Fuja said.\n\"To say that Denver is 'defunding the police' is a willful mischaracterization of the budget adjustments, which actually just delays the purchase of new furniture and shifts the funding source for one cadet class,\" he said. \"In fact, Mayor Johnston has invested millions to add 167 new police recruits to our force in 2024 and will continue to invest in public safety to ensure every Denverite is safe in their city.\"\nIt's the latest battle by liberal cities to deal with the flow of migrants that have surged into their communities, whether it be the migrants moving by themselves or being bussed in from Texas.\nNew York City last year proposed significant budget cuts, including to police, but later reversed them amid a growth in revenue.

As campaigning for the June 6-9 event heats up, mainstream parties fear that disenchanted voters might turn to the people at NatCon 2024.\n\"This is what we're up against. We're up against a new form of evil ideology,\" Nigel Farage, the man credited with taking Britain out of the European Union, told the gathering of a few hundred stridently nationalist and fundamentalist Christian politicians and think-tankers.\nAnti-migrant sentiment featured in a number of speeches. Some targeted what they saw as the follies of climate policy, \"narco-socialism\" or \"woke indoctrination,\" often with sharp opposition to multinational organizations like the EU.\nLashing out at the bloc's treaties, and the pledge in the preamble of the founding EU texts to an \"ever-closer Union\" among the 27 member countries, Polish lawmaker Ryszard Legutko said it all makes \"medieval monks look almost like intellectual anarchists.\"\nSurveys suggest that mainstream political parties are likely to retain power after the June elections, but quite possibly with a reduced majority.\nBelgian police quietly shut down the conference by barring attendees from re-entering the venue if they dared to leave. A dozen or so officers blocked the main entrance. It was the third venue for the gathering after the owners of two other locations shied away when anti-fascist protesters vowed to disrupt proceedings.\nThis year's NatCon, organized by the conservative U.S. think tank the Edmund Burke Foundation, was held under the banner of \"National Conservatism, Preserving the Nation-State in Europe.\"\nFrench far-right figurehead Eric Zemmour was scheduled to criticize the EU's new migrant and asylum rules but was turned away by police. Suella Braverman, who served as U.K. home secretary for just over a month in 2022 before being fired, railed for 27 minutes against the European Court of Human Rights.\nPoliticians and former leaders from Spain, Poland and the Netherlands were also on the agenda. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was due to speak on Wednesday.\n\"I guess they couldn't take free speech any longer,\" Orban posted on the social media platform X. \"The last time they wanted to silence me with the police was when the Communists set them on me in '88. We didn't give up then and we will not give up this time either!\"\nSpeakers summoned the grand ideas of figures like the Pope, Homer, Dostoyevsky, Leo Strauss, Tocqueville and Gramsci. English was the common language, spattered with classical Latin. Modern liberal democracy was likened to a form of \"neo-Marxist authoritarianism.\"\nMostly though, those who could speak before the gathering was shut down for the day focused on their \"enemies\" among the mainstream political parties.\n\"We have to know our enemies are in panic and they show it every day,\" said EU lawmaker Hermann Tertsch, from Spain's far-right Vox party. \"The enemy knows their time is running out.\"\nAs Brussels police warned that the conference's time was limited, too, Edmund Burke Foundation Chairman Yoram Hazony invited participants to stay as long as they dared.\n\"The new democracy works in mysterious ways.

Jon Tester, D-Mont., in November, touted his campaign's \"incredible momentum\" after bringing in over $3 million for his Senate campaign in the first fundraising quarter of 2024.\nThe funds, shared first with Fox News Digital, include $2.6 million that came from fundraising, with an additional $500k loaned to the campaign from Sheehy himself.\n\"We are humbled by the incredible momentum and support we're seeing across the state. We have been under a relentless assault with millions being spent on attack ads against us. Chuck Schumer, Jon Tester, and their liberal allies are now smearing a combat veteran because they know the hard truth: They are losing this race,\" Sheehy told Fox News Digital in a statement.\n\"Montanans are rallying around a political outsider who will deliver common sense solutions like rebuilding a strong economy with low-inflation, creating more high-paying jobs, securing our border and ending reckless spending,\" the former Navy SEAL said. \"Come November, with the help of my fellow Montanans, we will finally retire Jon Tester and Joe Biden.\"\nTester reported raising $8 million in the first quarter of 2024, setting a new record for first quarter fundraising in a Montana Senate race. The Senator, who is seeking a third term, received donations from individuals in all 56 counties in Montana.\n\"This record-breaking grassroots support shows that Montanans are fired up to send the seven-fingered dirt farmer back to the U.S. Senate,\" Shelbi Dantic, Montanans for Tester campaign manager, said in a press release shared with Fox News Digital. \"Every day, Montanans learn more about Tim Sheehy: that he's a multimillionaire transplant from out-of-state, that he wants to transfer our public lands and shutter our rural hospitals, and that he has repeatedly lied to them about his story and who he is. Montanans know they can't trust Sheehy, and we're so grateful for the enormous enthusiasm we're seeing from our neighbors who are excited to vote for Jon Tester in November.\"\nDemocrats have put an emphasis on the Montana Senate race as they attempt to hold onto their Senate majority in 2024, with a group launched by Sen.

The Senate candidate told the Washington Post that he never reported it to his superiors due to fear of an investigation, prompting the outlet to interview several individuals and question the validity of his story.\nThe Washington Post used Air Force attorney Rachel VanLandingham, who called Sheehy a \"deeply flawed hero whose fitness for office is highly questionable\" in an April 6 post on X, as a reference to question the Republican candidate's story.\nThe outlet also reported that trauma surgeon Joseph V.

She took over at NPR last month.\n\"The number one challenge here that we see is, of course, the First Amendment in the United States. [It] is a fairly robust protection of rights and that is a protection of rights both for platforms, which I actually think is very important that platforms have those rights to be able to regulate what kind of content they want on their sites,\" Maher said.\nShe added, \"But it also means that it is a little bit tricky to really address some of the real challenges of where does bad information come from, and sort of the influence peddlers who have made a real market economy around it.\"\nShe remarked how Wikipedia took an \"active approach to disinformation and misinformation\" in response to the coronavirus pandemic and the 2020 election, though she noted that Wikipedia publishers are \"primarily men\" with \"significant gaps\" of knowledge in content about women and marginalized groups.\nAnother resurfaced video from an August 2021 TED Talk featured Maher discussing how Wikipedia teaches \"balancing truth and beliefs.\" She said trust in the website had increased during a time when public trust in institutions had collapsed. She argued Wikipedia's model worked well, especially in debates over politics or religion.\n\"In our normal lives, these contentious conversations tend to erupt over a disagreement about what the truth actually is. But the people who write these [Wikipedia] articles, they're not focused on the truth. They're focused on something else, which is the best of what we can know right now,\" Maher said.\n\"That perhaps, for our most tricky disagreements, seeking the truth and seeking to convince others of the truth might not be the right place to start. In fact, our reverence for the truth might be a distraction that's getting in the way of finding common ground and getting things done,\" she continued.\nMaher insisted that her view doesn't mean the truth \"doesn't exist\" or \"isn't important\" but emphasized the existence of \"many different truths.\"\n\"And so, in the spirit of that, I'm certain that the truth exists for you and probably for the person sitting next to you. But this may not be the same truth. This is because the truth of the matter is very often, for many people, what happens when we merge facts about the world with our beliefs about the world. So we all have different truths,\" she said.\nNPR defended Maher against \"online actors with explicit agendas\" on Wednesday as her old social media posts continue to go viral for exposing her personal left-wing ideology.\nIn a 2020 post, Maher is seen donning a Biden for President hat and saying it was the \"best part\" of her \"get out the vote\" efforts. In another post, she wrote that while \"looting is counterproductive,\" it is \"hard to be mad about protests not prioritizing the private property of a system of oppression founded on treating people's ancestors as private property.\"\nMaher's political views came out after longtime NPR editor Uri Berliner published a bombshell report blowing the whistle on liberal bias at the organization. After he received a 5-day suspension, Berliner announced his resignation on Wednesday.\n\"I am resigning from NPR, a great American institution where I have worked for 25 years. I don't support calls to defund NPR. I respect the integrity of my colleagues and wish for NPR to thrive and do important journalism. But I cannot work in a newsroom where I am disparaged by a new CEO whose divisive views confirm the very problems at NPR I cited in my Free Press essay,\" Berliner wrote in a statement, referring to Maher.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Hanna Panreck,Lindsay Kornick Hanna Panreck,Lindsay Kornick","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/KatherineMaher.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.981115,"_id":"8b550ee5396d960ab37c60d900068229"},{"title":"'Milkman Homicide' of Florida WWII veteran solved by killer's ex-wife","author":"Christina Coulter","published_date":"2024-04-20 08:00:24","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/milkman-homicide-florida-wwii-veteran-solved-killers-ex-wife","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"For more than 50 years, the \"execution-style\" shooting of Hiram \"Ross\" Grayam remained a mystery \u2014 but Thomas Williams was named as his killer this week after his ex-wife came forward.","summary":"More than five decades after a decorated World War II veteran-turned-milkman was murdered \"execution-style\" on his route, testimony from his killer's ex-wife solved the cold case.\nHiram \"Ross\" Grayam had been shot multiple times when investigators searching the area via airplane spotted his milk truck deep in the woods in Vero Beach, Florida, in April 1968, the Indian River County Sheriff's Office wrote in a Thursday news release.\nThe Purple Heart recipient had witnessed the liberation of two concentration camps and survived the Battle of the Bulge before he was shot dead, CBS reported.\nGrayam's murder went unsolved until this year, when the ex-wife and a friend of Thomas J.

Tony Evers.","summary":"MADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Wisconsin Supreme Court justices questioned Wednesday how much power legislative committees should wield, in a case that Democratic Gov. Tony Evers brought against the Republican-controlled Legislature and that could have a major impact on how state government functions.\nA ruling in favor of Evers would upend decades-old practices in the Legislature and make it easier to approve projects in a land stewardship program. But justices echoed concerns raised by Republicans that the case could have far broader impacts on the separation of power between the executive and legislative branches.\nSiding with Evers would \"overturn how our state government has functioned for almost a century,\" Misha Tseytlin, a lawyer for the Legislature, told the court.\nBut liberal Justice Jill Karofsky, in deflecting arguments that the court should not overturn such established practices, said \"Maybe they've been wrong for the last century and we shouldn't double down on how wrong this is.\"\nEvers argues that the Legislature's powerful budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, which is controlled 12-4 by Republicans, is exceeding its constitutional lawmaking authority and effectively acting as a fourth branch of government. The Legislature counters that the committee's powers, including the approval of certain state conservation projects, are well established in state law and court precedent.\nKarofsky questioned whether the budget committee had too much power.\n\"There doesn't seem to me to be any limits whatsoever,\" she said. \"There are zero guardrails here.\"\nIf the court sides with Evers, then numerous other functions of the budget committee, the state building commission and other legislative committees that have been in place for a century would also be unconstitutional, Tseytlin said.\nConservative Justice Rebecca Bradley questioned whether the court's ruling would apply across a myriad of legislative committees and their powers.\n\"You're asking us to make a big shift,\" she said, adding that the court can't \"slice and dice separation of powers\" between the executive and legislative branches.\n\"Either we're going to apply it strictly or we're not,\" she said.\nLiberal Justice Ann Walsh Bradley echoed some concerns raised by conservative justices.\n\"Your position seems to be black and white: Once the Legislature has passed a bill, hands off,\" she said to Evers' attorney. \"Isn't there any nuance to the position, some kind of limitations on your black-and-white argument? It seems to me there should be.\"\nEvers' attorney Colin Roth said the constitution is clear that once the Legislature passes a law, it is up to the executive branch to carry it out. The Legislature is overreaching its authority when committees can veto actions such as the approval of stewardship projects, he said.\nEvers, speaking about the case on Tuesday, said the state Supreme Court needs to recognize that the Legislature's budget committee has been acting as a fourth branch of government and should be reined in.\n\"The idea that somehow they have the ability to essentially work as a fourth arm of our state is just wrong,\" Evers told reporters.\nThe lawsuit cites the committee's rejection of dozens of conservation projects selected by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program.\nThe Legislature created the stewardship program in 1989. It provides funding primarily to local governments, conservation groups and the DNR to purchase blocks of land to preserve natural areas and wildlife habitat, protect water quality and fisheries, and expand outdoor recreational opportunities. Supporters herald it as a way to further protect natural areas from development.\nRepublicans have been trying for years to scale back stewardship purchases, complaining that they take too much land off the tax rolls, rob northern Wisconsin municipalities of revenue and drive up state debt.\nLegislative oversight of the program increased as concerns grew about the scope and cost of the stewardship program.\nThe Legislature did its job when it passed laws creating and funding the program, attorneys for Evers argue in court filings. But the budget committee's ability to block approval of stewardship projects, essentially vetoing decisions of the executive branch, is an unconstitutional separation of powers violation, they say.\nConservative Chief Justice Annette Ziegler questioned whether the case should be put on hold so the court could gather more facts and take a broader look at legislative and executive powers.\n\"Why rush this case?\" she asked.\nThe court will issue a ruling in the next several weeks or months.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Wisconsin-Governor-Sues-Legislature.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.885383,"_id":"c920cec15d2794c63df4bb37bbd472fa"},{"title":"Columbia student recounts having a \u2018front row seat to the madness' of  anti-Israel protests","author":"Madeline Coggins","published_date":"2024-04-20 18:22:39","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/columbia-student-recounts-having-front-row-seat-madness-anti-israel-protests","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"New York Post columnist and part-time Columbia University student Rikki Schlott shares what she witnessed during several days of pro-Palestine protests on campus.","summary":"Columbia University was the epicenter of the latest string of pro-Palestine protests erupting in New York City.

The demonstrations have gotten more intense as Israel continues to conduct its military offensive in the Gaza Strip against Hamas.\nDozens of protesters camped out in tents on school grounds since early Wednesday, calling on the university to divest itself from companies that have ties to Israel, as Shafik testified on Capitol Hill.\nThe university had locked down its campus to ID holders only in anticipation of unrest relating to Shafik's testimony.\nOn Thursday, demonstrators set up the \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" on a campus lawn just hours before the university President Minouche Shafik testified before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce regarding antisemitism on campus.\n\"Basically what the demands supposedly are of the encampment are that they would like the university to divest any of its investments in Israel through its endowment. And they were saying that they're not going to leave until that happens,\" Schlott explained.\nSchlott also gave credit to the NYPD, who was eventually invited to the university by Shafik and began arresting several protesters.\nIn total, 108 people were arrested and given a summons for trespassing, the New York Police Department (NYPD) said during an early evening press conference. Two people were additionally given a summons for obstruction of governmental administration.\nNYPD officers noted that many of the protesters were peaceful and didn't resist arrest. However, around 500 students left their classrooms and told officers they were the \"KKK,\" \"baby killers\" and to \"go kill ourselves,\" a police official said.\nUnfazed by Thursday's mass arrests, protests continued at Columbia University on Friday and a large police presence \u2014 with officers in riot gear \u2014 was reported.\nSchlott did differentiate between outside protesters and Columbia students, claiming outside agitators were \"more aggressive\" and \"more radical.\"\n\"[Columbia] did shut off the actual campus to anyone who didn't have an ID, so it was students only, which is why I was able to get in. And I would say that actually the protesters outside, including the one who shouted, 'we are Hamas,' who is presumably not a student, in my view and in my experience, were a lot more aggressive and a lot more radical than the students inside,\" she said.\nOver the several days of protests, Schlott said she heard demonstrators shout \"Intifada,\" \"we are Hamas,\" \"Divulge, Divest,\" and others.\n\"Students were trespassing and were clearly in violation of school rules, were being arrested. I saw Lesbians for Liberation, which is really a rich one, considering that it seems like these students don't really understand how LGBTQ people are treated in Palestine,\" the part-time student said.\nSchlott said, although prepared from her previous attendance at NYU, said the protests were \"shocking.\"\nA Columbia University spokesperson previously told Fox News Digital: \"While the encampment has been dismantled, our community has had protest activity on campus since October, and we expect that activity to continue.\"\nThe spokesperson continued, \"We have rules regarding the time, place, and manner that apply to protest activity and we will continue to enforce those.

Polls and analysts warn that for the first time, the ruling African National Congress party that has comfortably held power since Nelson Mandela became the country's first Black president in 1994 might receive less than 50% of votes.\nOne big reason is Jacob Zuma, the former president and ANC leader who stepped down in disgrace in 2018 amid a swirl of corruption allegations but has emerged in recent months with a new political party. It intends to be a major election player as the former president seeks revenge against former longtime allies.\nHere is what you need to know about the 82-year-old Zuma's return to the political ring and how it might play a significant election role.\nWHO IS JACOB ZUMA?\nZuma has long been one of South Africa's most recognizable politicians. He was a senior leader in the ANC during the liberation struggle against apartheid. A former ANC intelligence chief, he has repeatedly threatened to reveal some of the party's secrets. While Zuma was not one of Mandela's preferred choices to succeed him, Mandela trusted Zuma to play an influential role in ending deadly political violence that engulfed KwaZulu-Natal province before the historic 1994 elections. The province has remained a vocal base of support for Zuma ever since, and members of Zuma's Zulu ethnic group make up its majority. Zuma became deputy leader of the ANC in 1997 and was appointed South Africa's deputy president in 1999.\nHOW DID HE BECOME PRESIDENT?\nZuma's path to power included legal challenges. In 2006, he was found not guilty of raping the daughter of a comrade at Zuma's home in Johannesburg. A year earlier, he was fired as South Africa's deputy president after his financial advisor was convicted for corruption for soliciting bribes for Zuma during an infamous arms deal. Alleging a political witch hunt, Zuma launched an aggressive political campaign that saw him elected ANC president in 2007. His campaign appealed to widespread discontent with then-President Thabo Mbeki, who was often described as autocratic and aloof. The corruption charges against Zuma were later dropped, amid controversy, and he was elected South Africa's president in 2009.\nHOW DID HE LOSE POWER?\nZuma's presidency was often under fire. His close friends and allies, the Gupta family, were accused of influencing appointments to key cabinet positions in exchange for lucrative business deals. The allegations of corruption in government and state-owned companies eventually led the ANC force Zuma to resign in 2018. A judicial commission of inquiry uncovered wide-ranging evidence, and Zuma in 2021 was convicted and sentenced to 15 months in jail for refusing to testify. Zuma remains aggrieved with the ANC and his successor, President Cyril Ramaphosa. But few South Africans expected the break to go so far.\nHOW HAS HE REEMERGED?\nZuma shocked the country in December by denouncing the ANC and campaigning against a party that had been at the heart of his political career. His new political party, UMkhonto WeSizwe, was named after the ANC's military wing, which was disbanded at the end of the struggle against white minority rule. The ANC has launched a legal case seeking to stop the new party from using a name and logo that are similar to those of the military wing. The charismatic Zuma continues to crisscross the country, delivering lively speeches, and an image of his face will represent the party on ballots.\nWHAT ARE ZUMA'S ELECTION CHANCES?\nThe ANC already had been facing pressure from other opposition parties. But Zuma's new party threatens to draw support from within the often divided ANC. South Africa's electoral body has cleared him to run for a parliament seat, despite his past conviction. Polls suggest the new party may emerge as one of the country's biggest opposition parties and could play a significant role if the weakening ANC must form coalitions to run the country. Addressing his supporters at a recent rally, Zuma declared that \"I need to return so that I can fix things.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/South-Africa-Zuma-Explainer.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.8661256,"_id":"6d57ecaca6e328e4c97d90f1f5809856"},{"title":"Biden's false cannibal story described as a simple \u2018misstatement' and \u2018off on the details' by the media","author":"Lindsay Kornick","published_date":"2024-04-19 00:21:16","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/bidens-false-cannibal-story-described-simple-misstatement-off-details-media","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Mainstream media reports minimized Biden's claim that one of his relatives might have been eaten by cannibals as a mischaracterization rather than a lie.","summary":"Some media outlets reported on President Biden telling an odd cannibal story twice on Wednesday as a \"misstatement\" rather than an outright lie, which critics say is different from how Trump is normally treated.\nWhile in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Biden shared a story about his uncle, 2nd Lt. Ambrose J. Finnegan Jr., whom he called \"Bosie.\"\n\"He flew those single-engine planes as reconnaissance over war zones, and he got shot down in New Guinea. They never found the body because there used to be, there were a lot of cannibals, for real, in that part of New Guinea,\" he said.\nBiden also told a version of the story earlier that day while visiting the missing-in-action war memorial in his hometown of Scranton claiming, \"He got shot down in an area where there were a lot of cannibals in New Guinea at the time. They never recovered [Finnegan's] body. But the government went back, when I went down there, and they checked and found some parts of the plane and the like.\"\nThough military records from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency showed that Biden's uncle died after a plane crash in the Pacific Ocean with no reference to possible cannibalism, several outlets stopped short of calling it a lie.\nIn contrast, NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck told Fox News Digital, when it comes to \"the likes of Donald Trump, the knee-jerk instinct is to use the word 'lie.'\"\nA headline for NBC on Wednesday read, \"Biden mischaracterizes his uncle's disappearance during World War II,\" and noted that Biden \"was drawing a contrast between the military service of his family and Trump's inflammatory rhetoric about military members.\"\nThough NBC acknowledged that U.S. military records did not reference cannibalism regarding Biden's uncle's death, the article only referred to the comments as an \"apparent misstatement.\"\n\"Biden and his fellow leftists are always given the benefit of the doubt. With the liberal media and the so-called fact-checkers out there, a certain degree of innocence is assigned to Democrats when they say things that are untrue,\" said Houck.\nOther outlets continued the distancing.\nThe Associated Press featured a headline the same day reading, \"Biden is off on details of his uncle's WWII death as he calls Trump unfit to lead the military.\" In the article itself, AP wrote that Biden only \"misstated key details\" about his uncle's death.\nMSNBC's online coverage of Biden's comment on Thursday called the cannibalism suggestion \"odd\" and noted that Biden had never brought up the story before Wednesday. However, the piece described Biden's claims as simply an \"embellishment\" or \"unsubstantiated family lore,\" despite also acknowledging the military records.\nCNN reported simply, \"Biden's accounting of his uncle's death \u2014 and possible cannibalization \u2014 differs from the account published by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting agency.\"\nHouck told Fox News Digital, \"The profession in which accuracy, facts, and truth are supposedly paramount, they turn into armchair psychologists whenever one of their own lies and all but insist so and so didn't really mean it.\n\"Of course, Trump -- like any politician -- plays fast and loose with the facts, but the reality is there isn't just less scrutiny for the other side. In many cases, there's no scrutiny at all,\" he added.\nWhen asked about Biden's claim during a gaggle on Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre avoided directly referencing the cannibal story and instead focused on the event.\n\"You saw the president, he was incredibly proud of his uncle's service in uniform. You saw him at the War Memorial. It was incredibly emotional and important to him,\" Jean-Pierre answered.\nShe continued, \"You saw him respond to all of you when asked about the moment yesterday and his uncle who lost his life when the military aircraft he was on crashed in the Pacific after taking off near New Guinea. The president highlighted his uncle's story as he made the case for honoring our sacred commitment to equip those we send to war and to take care of them and their families when they come home, and, as he reiterated, that the last thing American veterans are suckers or losers, and he wanted to make that clear.\"\nWhen questioned further, she insisted that she didn't \"have anything beyond what [she] just laid out.\"\n\"But it was a really proud moment for him. It was incredibly emotional. I think some of your colleagues \u2026 were there, and they got to witness the president pray at the war memorial, look for his uncle's name, honor him, and I think we can't forget that moment.

He praised Berliner as \"terrific\" to work with during his tenure.\n\"It seems to me that it would be very difficult for him now at NPR. I've seen stuff on the internet that he's come under attack by people who are still at NPR,\" he continued. \"I think he did this out of a sense of principle.\"\nBerliner's longtime colleague also said it's noteworthy that the takedown of NPR was published in former New York Times opinion editor Bari Weiss' Free Press. Weiss' famously left the Times with a scathing resignation letter saying she was bullied by colleagues in an \"illiberal environment.\"\n\"It was definitely well-thought out by him,\" they said. \"The job of journalism has become more frightened than ever before, and it's a kind of cultural McCarthyism, where people are being frightened out of saying what they think.\"\nReached for comment about Berlinger's claims, an NPR spokesperson directed Fox News Digital to a memo to staff by editor-in-chief Edith Chapin, where she said she and her team \"strongly disagree\" with the veteran editor's assessment of the quality of NPR's journalism and integrity.\n\"We're proud to stand behind the exceptional work that our desks and shows do to cover a wide range of challenging stories.

Iranians together with the Israelis and Jews hand-in-hand\u2026supporting each other and demonstrating to the whole world that we as a nation and Israel as a nation have our destiny intertwined.

It's time for the world to finally decide to endorse and back the Iranian people to topple this regime and put an end to all this madness,\" he added.\nHis comment comes a day after Iran launched a barrage of over 300 missiles and drones at Israel Saturday in an apparent response to Israel's reported role in an airstrike that killed a senior Iranian official in the country's embassy in the Syrian capital of Damascus last week.\nIsraeli Defense Forces and allied militaries had been preparing for the possibility of an Iranian retaliatory strike since the attack, with Israel stating that roughly 99% of the Iranian weapons fired at the country had been intercepted by its sophisticated defense systems and military allies in the region.\nPahlavi said the Biden administration's return to the Iran nuclear deal and readiness to pump billions of dollars into Iran's cash-starved economy has emboldened its leadership and sent a message of \"appeasement.\" The Biden administration's reported opposition to a retaliatory strike by Israel against Iran only further drives home that message, he said.\n\"When you release money to a regime and give it more means to finance its proxies and use brutality at home, basically appeasement, has proven it only emboldens the regime,\" he said.\n\"We said that a long time ago. As you indicated last year when I visited Israel, part of our discussions with Israeli leaders \u2013 and for that matter, other leaders around the world \u2013 have been precisely this. If you let the regime be emboldened by the fact that they can count on appeasement or paying ransom for the release of hostages or not imposing sanctions which gave the regime almost one extra hundred billion dollars [and] the fact that the current administration is trying to release even more money to the regime, $10 billion of Iranian electric revenue from the Iraqis. What do you think will happen next?\" he said.\nPahlavi was referring to President Biden's renewal of a sanctions waver last month that allows Iraq to continue to purchase electricity from Iran, effectively allowing the terrorist regime access to $10 billion in funds.\nWhite House national security communications adviser John Kirby told Fox News' Shannon Bream in an interview Sunday that \"the additional funds that have been made available to Iran\" through the sanctions program can only be used for humanitarian goods. \"It doesn't go to the regime,\" he insisted.\n\"I think there's a direct correlation between appeasement in doing this kind of thing and the regime becoming emboldened, the solution is to use every opportunity to put more pressure on the regime,\" Pahlavi said.\nWorld powers, including the U.S. and the United Kingdom, reached a nuclear deal with Iran in 2015, formerly known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, after years of international tensions that Iran was working to build a nuclear bomb. The agreement limited some of Iran's nuclear activities, while allowing international authorities to carry out inspections. Sanctions on Tehran were lifted in exchange.\nFormer President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the agreement in 2018 after slamming it as \"defective at its core.\"\nPahlavi said the U.S. and its European allies should begin to support the Iranian people by classifying the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist group.\n\"But also parallel to that,\" he told Gowdy, \"it's time to use maximum support to the Iranian people in their struggle against this regime. It is the Iranian people's ask to have change. It does not have to be a U.S. senator saying who needs to change. If the Iranian people say loud and clear that we're done with this regime, help us liberate ourselves, that is the message of the Iranian people\u2026 and I hope the U.S. government and other governments will heed this call and finally help us save our world from disaster and more conflict and have an opportunity post this regime to have regional peace and brotherly cooperation.\n\"Not just Iran and Israel,\" he added, \"but the Arab world that's also been a target of this regime.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Yael Halon","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/06/biden-iran-split.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.757586,"_id":"19c64c900c9a1f10341c3516fc411080"},{"title":"Katherine Maher's past political activity flies in the face of NPR's ethics handbook","author":"Joseph Wulfsohn","published_date":"2024-04-22 09:00:15","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/katherine-mahers-past-political-activity-flies-face-nprs-ethics-handbook","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"A review of NPR's ethics handbook shows that Katherine Maher's conduct before being appointed the outlet's president and CEO show several violations of its policies.","summary":"NPR reprimanded Uri Berliner for violating its policies while appearing to turn a blind eye towards the brazen conduct of Katherine Maher before she stepped into her role as the organization's president and CEO.\nBerliner, the veteran editor who penned the bombshell essay about NPR's liberal bias, was handed a five-day unpaid suspension for not seeking NPR's permission to appear on another news platform before going to The Free Press. Berliner resigned from the organization, writing in part, \"I cannot work in a newsroom where I am disparaged by a new CEO whose divisive views confirm the very problems at NPR I cited in my Free Press essay.\"\nWhat he was referencing was the trove of social media posts Maher, who took over NPR in March 2024, had written over the years displaying woke ideologies and pro-Democrat activism, which included explicit support towards Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden and attacks on former President Trump.\nWhile her social media activity came long before she joined NPR, it nevertheless appears to be in clear violation of NPR's staff expectations laid on in its ethics handbook according to a Fox News Digital review of its policies.\n\"We take seriously our democratic role as watchdogs, holding the powerful accountable as we hold ourselves to the core principles of honesty, integrity, independence, accuracy, contextual truth, transparency, respect and fairness for the people we serve and the people we cover,\" NPR's handbook says in its opening \"Guiding Principles\" section.\nUnder its \"Honesty Online\" section, NPR states \"Even on purely recreational or cultural sites and even if what we're doing is personal and not identified as coming from someone at NPR, we understand that what we say and do could still reflect on NPR. So we do nothing that could undermine our credibility with the public, damage NPR's standing as an impartial source of news, or otherwise jeopardize NPR's reputation. In other words, we don't behave any differently than we would in any public setting or on an NPR broadcast.\"\nA clause in its \"Conflicts of Interest\" section states \"In general, we don't do outside work for government or agencies principally funded by a government, or for private organizations that are regularly covered by NPR.\" Notably, Maher shared a photo of herself participating in the get out the vote effort in Arizona on behalf of Biden in 2020, even wearing a \"Biden for President\" hat.\nThe handbook gets even more explicit in its \"Impartiality\" section.\n\"We're not advocates. We may not run for office, endorse candidates or otherwise engage in politics in a participatory or activist manner,\" the handbook reads. \"Since contributions to candidates are part of the public record (and not a private expression of choice in a voting booth), those of us connected with news coverage may not contribute to political campaigns or referendums, as doing so would call into question NPR's journalistic independence and impartiality.\nIt was reported by The Center Square last week that Maher has a history of donating to Democrats as well as Stacey Abrams' PAC.\nThe section also delves into social media activity, writing \"NPR encourages active participation in civic life and expressions of values. However, the decision to participate in community or national events, including posting on social media, can conflict with NPR's core values when that participation calls into question the credibility, fairness or independence of NPR's coverage or our respect for the people we cover and serve. The intent of this guidance is to allow NPR staff the freedom to show up as their full selves in society as much as possible, while also upholding NPR's journalistic values. This guidance is intended to help staff, supervisors and newsroom managers work together to find that balance.\"\n\"NPR journalists may participate in civic and cultural events that do not pose conflicts of interest,\" the handbook continues. \"However, it is always wise to anticipate ahead of time what political or partisan issues or causes might emerge within a civic or cultural event to avoid ethical problems. And we let our supervisors know about any such civic and cultural organizations we do actively engage with, so that any potential conflicts of interest can be headed off.\"\nUnder the \"Accountability\" section, the ethics handbook implores NPR staff, \"Don't be careless. Keep your opinions to yourself. Imagine what you say or write landing in an AP story or in The Washington Post, and imagine the damage that could cause you or NPR.\"\n\"Do not advocate for political issues online. This extends to your Facebook page or a personal blog. Don't express personal views on a political issue that you could not write for the air or post on NPR.org,\" NPR says in its social media section.\nIn a statement previously given to NPR's in-house media correspondent David Folkenflik, Maher defended her posts, saying, \"In America everyone is entitled to free speech as a private citizen.\"\nFox News Digital asked NPR whether it had reviewed Maher's social media activity and political donations before it offered her a job and whether such posts would be in violation of NPR's policies had she made them as an employee.

It's Trump versus the New York Attorney General, or the Manhattan District Attorney. They're not just Democrats, they're elected Democrats, building a career on taking down Trump. Leaving that out of the story is irresponsible,\" NewsBusters executive editor Tim Graham told Fox News Digital.\nRich Noyes, contributing editor for MRC NewsBusters, led a team of analysts who reviewed \"NBC Nightly News,\" \"CBS Evening News\" and ABC's \"World News Tonight\" from January 1, 2023 through April 10, 2024. They found networks failed to inform viewers during at least 90% of coverage that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney Fani Willis, and New York Attorney General Letitia James are Democrats.\n\"It's as if the networks prefer to disingenuously portray the indictments and civil lawsuits as the work of nonpartisan career prosecutors, rather than as partisan attempts to use the court system to hobble the electoral prospects of the country's top Republican,\" Noyes said.\nBragg, last April, charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to alleged hush-money payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign. Noyes wrote that \"Bragg isn't just a mainstream Democrat\" and that he is \"clearly on the far-left wing of the party,\" especially considering his ties to liberal billionaire George Soros.\n\"ABC's \u2018World News Tonight' has aired 56 stories discussing Bragg's \u2018hush money' case against Trump, yet sharp-eared viewers only once heard that Bragg was a Democrat \u2014 on February 26, 2024, when correspondent Aaron Katersky relayed how \u2018a spokesman for Trump... called Bragg another deranged Democrat prosecutor,'\" Noyes wrote.\n\"That's still better than the \u2018CBS Evening News,' which aired 48 stories discussing Bragg's case, none of which revealed that the District Attorney is a Democrat,\" he continued. \"'NBC Nightly News' was the most informative on this score, informing viewers that Bragg is a Democrat in 16 out of 59 stories, or about 27% of the time \u2014 still barely one-fourth of stories.\"\nBetween ABC, CBS and NBC, Bragg was labeled a Democrat 17 times out of 163 stories, according to the study.\n\"Bragg's partisanship was omitted from nearly 90% of evening news stories about his election-season indictments of the former President,\" Noyes wrote.\nThere has been even less rhetoric about AG James' partisanship, according to the study.\n\"Through April 10, ABC's \u2018World News Tonight' has aired 44 stories mentioning James's suit against Trump and his businesses, yet only one \u2014 back on November 6 \u2014 identified the state Attorney General as a \u2018Democrat,' in a fleeting on-screen graphic that was shown for less than two seconds,\" Noyes wrote.\n\"Similarly, the CBS Evening News produced 35 stories that discussed James's civil case, but only once did viewers learn about James's partisanship,\" he continued. \"Compared to its competitors, \u2018NBC Nightly News' was again the most informative. The newscast discussed the civil case in 26 stories, seven of which mentioned James's party affiliation.\"\nBetween ABC, CBS and NBC, James was labeled a Democrat only nine times out of 105 stories, according to the study.\nIt was much of the same when evening newscasts covered scandal-plagued DA Willis, who wasn't labeled a Democrat once during 99 segments between ABC's \"World News Tonight\" and \"CBS Evening News,\" according to the study. NBC managed to identify Willis as a Democrat in eight out of 50 segments.\n\"Add it all up, and out of 149 evening news stories about the Georgia election case against Trump, a scant 5% revealed that Willis was a Democrat, vs. 95% that kept viewers in the dark,\" Noyes said.\n\"Clearly, the editorial choices made by these broadcast networks shows they are framing these cases as the actions of nonpartisan law enforcement officials \u2014 all of whom just happen to be Democrats,\" he continued. \"But if it were a leading Democrat who had been placed under the legal microscope by a trio of elected Republicans, does anyone think that the media would be so reluctant to even mention the partisanship of the prosecutors? Of course not.\"\nABC, NBC and CBS didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\nGraham feels things were much different back in the Clinton era.\n\"Anchormen like Dan Rather couldn't mention Kenneth Starr investigating the Clintons without saying \u2018Republican independent counsel,' so that the first word could cancel the second,\" he said.\n\"The most obvious field for investigating media bias is scandals and scandal investigations.

The 2024 version is a mix of woke and political correctness and at war with useful scientific discoveries like plastics.","summary":"\"Planet vs Plastics\" is the theme of Earth Day this year. Why? Because, according to the event's organizers, \"plastics are a danger to humanity and all living creatures, disrupting the balance of life on Earth.\" Therefore, \"EARTHDAY.ORG is unwavering in our commitment to end plastics for the sake of human and planetary health, demanding a 60% reduction in the production of ALL plastics by 2040.\"\nThat sort of hyperbolic condemnation is typical of many recent Earth Days. The reality is that Earthlings and plastics must coexist. In many ways, plastics improve our quality of life. They have revolutionized medicine with life-saving devices, made space travel possible, lightened cars and planes (conserving fuel and lowering air pollution), and made all manner of consumer goods less expensive.\nIt is true that their convenience and low cost have spawned a throw-away culture that has a dark side: Single-use plastics currently account for about 40% of the plastic produced every year. That percentage could and should be reduced, but the absolutism of the Earth Day organizers illustrates what is wrong with today's environmental movement.\nThe first Earth Day celebration, a nationwide environmental teach-in held in 1970, was the brainchild of Democratic Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, who was interested in environmental issues.\nHe recruited Pete McCloskey, a conservation-minded liberal Republican California congressman, to serve as his co-chair. In the spirit of the time, it was a touchy-feely, consciousness-raising New Age experience, and most activities were organized at the grassroots level.\nSadly, today's Earth Day shares much with the current zeitgeist: It reeks of wokeness, political correctness and virtue signaling. It has devolved into an occasion for environmental activists to prophesy apocalypse, dish anti-technology dirt and allow passion and zeal to trump reality.\nA generation ago, the mantra was simple and broadly accepted: \"reduce, re-use and recycle.\" However, we hasten to note, as John Tierney highlighted in his classic New York Times Magazine piece, \"Recycling is Garbage,\" recycling isn't always beneficial.\nInstead of setting up a false dichotomy of \"Planet vs. Plastics,\" environmental activists would do well to redirect their zeal and predictions of catastrophe to imagining what we can do to protect the planet. A little innovation can go a long way toward protecting our environment.\nYet, unfortunately, many of those stumping for Earth Day on April 22 this year will oppose environment-friendly advances in science and technology. Consider these several examples:\nWe are now scratching the surface for ingenious ways to remediate contaminated soil by using plants with the ability to remove toxins such as heavy metals from soil. A comprehensive review of the progress and promise of this technique, known as phytoremediation, states that, \"Plant abilities to uptake, translocate, and transform heavy metals, as well as to limit their toxicity, may be significantly enhanced via genetic engineering.\"\nHowever, most prominent environmental groups oppose genetic engineering and would rather soil a promising technology than abandon a deeply held ideological position.\nSimilarly, some green groups opposed one of the most innovative efforts to address allegations of climate change caused by animal agriculture \u2013 the Impossible Burger, an ingredient of which is a plant-sourced protein, leghemoglobin.\nThe protein contains heme, also present in animal meat, and is partly responsible for the taste, texture and appearance of bloody-good meat. As Business Insider noted, \"a handful of environmental activists have also taken issue with the burger. But their issue with the burger isn't heme \u2014 it's the fact that the Impossible Burger is made using genetically engineered ingredients, or GMOs. Those concerns largely take the shape of the old and unsubstantiated claim that GMOs cause everything from autism to cancer, despite the scientific consensus that they are safe.\"\nA pervasive Earth Day meta-message will be disdain for the capitalist system that drives the innovation needed for effective environmental protection and conservation. (It's no coincidence that low-income countries tend to be the most polluted.)\n\"Education\" features prominently in Earth Day activities, as in, \"Fifty four years ago, the first Earth Day started an environmental revolution. Now, we are igniting an education revolution to save the planet. EARTHDAY.ORG passionately envisions a world where every student ... is embraced by a rich education weaving together climate and environmental understanding, coupled with a strong civic engagement component.\"\nWell, education can take many forms. For a previous Earth Day, seventh graders at a tony private school near San Francisco were given an unusual Earth Day assignment: Make a list of environmental projects that could be accomplished with Bill Gates's fortune.\nThis approach to environmental awareness fits in well with the progressive worldview that the right to private property is subsidiary to undertakings that enlightened thinkers deem worthwhile.\nAnd how interesting that the resources made \"available\" for the students' thought experiment were not, say, the aggregate net worth of the members of Congress but the wealth of one of the nation's most successful and most innovative entrepreneurs.\nAnother Earth Day assignment for those same students was to read Rachel Carson's best-selling 1962 book, \"Silent Spring,\" an emotionally charged but deeply flawed excoriation of the widespread spraying of chemical pesticides to control insects.\nAs described by Roger Meiners and Andy Morriss in their scholarly yet eminently readable 2012 analysis, \"Silent Spring at 50: Reflections on an Environmental Classic,\" Carson exploited her reputation as a well-known nature writer to advocate and legitimatize \"positions linked to a darker tradition in American environmental thinking: neo-Malthusian population control and anti-technology efforts.\"\nCarson's proselytizing and advocacy led to the virtual banning of DDT and restrictions on other chemical pesticides even though \"Silent Spring\" was replete with gross misrepresentations and atrocious scholarship.\nHer observations about DDT were meticulously rebutted point by point by J. Gordon Edwards, a professor of entomology at San Jose State University, a longtime member of the Sierra Club and the Audubon Society, and a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences.\nIn his stunning 1992 essay, \"The Lies of Rachel Carson,\" Edwards demolished her arguments and assertions and called attention to critical omissions, faulty assumptions, and outright fabrications.\nMeiners and Morriss concluded correctly that the influence of \"Silent Spring\" \"encourages some of the most destructive strains within environmentalism: alarmism, technophobia, failure to consider the costs and benefits of alternatives, and the discounting of human well-being around the world.\" Sounds a lot like the agenda of Earth Day 2024.\nHenry Miller, a physician and molecular biologist, is the Glenn Swogger Distinguished Fellow at the American Council on Science and Health.

The city's commercial heart, Union Square, began 2024 with the highest rate of office vacancies in the nation. In just the last month, two more large retailers announced closures -- North Face and Zara.\nThe situation is no better in downtown Seattle, another supposedly progressive \"utopia\" (where I live) that's still reeling under the grip of homeless drug addicts who have claimed the streets as their own. The exodus of major retailers, most recently Lululemon, fleeing what was once a bustling, high-end mall, speaks volumes.\nA 2023 poll by the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce found that 68% of voters now avoid downtown more than before the explosion of homelessness and crime. If there are no visitors, there are no customers. The crisis even scared away Amazon, announcing last week it's resuming construction in nearby business-friendly Bellevue -- all while the Seattle tech giant's footprint shrinks.\nRecently, a man was randomly stabbed in the head while walking his dog in a notoriously dangerous downtown Seattle corner \u2014 a place where the air is so saturated with the smell of urine that it clings to the back of your throat. Yet, progressive leaders and the radical activists they enable pretend the city is thriving, shaming anyone who says otherwise.\nThe radical left disguises harm reduction as an \"evidence-based\" solution to substance abuse. Yet, in practice, it does little more than enable addicts, providing them with clean drug paraphernalia like fentanyl pipes, clean needles and \"booty-bumping\" kits for taking drugs under the guise of \"reducing harm.\"\nHousing first, meanwhile, offers \"permanent supportive housing\" to the homeless, followed by a claim to address their underlying issues through on-site, wraparound services. In reality, these places often turn into drug dens with virtually no conditions on use. If you're homeless because of drug addiction, you continue to use \u2014 and likely die \u2014 in what inevitably become taxpayer-funded drug havens.\nI dissect these flawed approaches in my book, \"What's Killing America: Inside the Radical Left's Tragic Destruction of Our Cities,\" a critique the left-wing media won't give you. Their refusal to challenge these feelgood yet destructive policies only serves to push a partisan agenda under the radar. My book can help you save your community from the progressive policy creep.\nWith these strategies in mind, the radical left opposes sweeping homeless encampments, calling that cruel and inhumane, while cruelly using the homeless as pawns in their demands for free housing. They even fight to keep squatters and delinquent renters in properties they have no right to, driven by an ideology that rejects private property rights and repeats a lazy bumper sticker talking point: \"housing is a human right.\"\nIn the Seattle area, homelessness has worsened following drug decriminalization, yet instead of admitting failures, activist-politicians have poured tens of millions into converting hotels into permanent supportive housing.\nIn one recent move, the city council in nearby Redmond colluded with county officials to secretly transfer property without public notice. Their message to residents fed up with the encampments? Shut up and let officials spend millions more for subsidized housing and only then will tents be cleared.\nWhile the homeless remain outdoors waiting for \"free\" housing, diseases spread. Recently in downtown Portland, a Shigella outbreak \u2014 a highly contagious bacteria spread through fecal matter \u2014 was traced to the homeless. Seattle faced a Hepatitis A scare from homeless in January. And last August, in Los Angeles, homeless encampments contributed to a significant rise in flea-borne typhus.\nBut the progressive reign of despair may soon come to an end if conservative United States Supreme Court justices come to the rescue after hearing arguments for The City of Grants Pass Oregon v. Johnson on April 22. It might return a tool that can be part of a broader strategy to address homelessness more effectively.\nThe radical left disguises harm reduction as an \"evidence-based\" solution to substance abuse. Yet, in practice, it does little more than enable addicts, providing them with clean drug paraphernalia like fentanyl pipes, clean needles and \"booty-bumping\" kits for taking drugs under the guise of \"reducing harm.\"\nThis legal battle about whether cities can enforce public camping bans may be a defining moment for homelessness policy. A decision in favor of Grants Pass could empower cities across the nation to reclaim their public spaces, reducing crime and disease spread, while providing a truly meaningful pathway out of homelessness.\nMore importantly, it could signal the beginning of the end for the unchecked spread of radical left policies that have been long shielded behind claims of good intentions.\nIf the Supreme Court, fortified by Trump-appointed conservatives, sides with pragmatic policies, we might just see cities finally be released from the grip of progressive overreach, returning to an approach where compassion and regulation can actually coexist and assist the homeless. This isn't just about cleaning up the streets \u2014 it's about wrestling control back from the radical left.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jason Rantz","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/03/Oakland-California-Homeless-Closed-Businesses_06.jpg","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.230177,"_id":"68a9bbb0a99d3f2f4aac28ef640051f0"},{"title":"Passover holds the key to comprehending today's 'vicious' antisemitism, says rabbi and spiritual leader","author":"Eve Glover","published_date":"2024-04-21 09:30:24","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/passover-holds-key-comprehending-antisemitism-rabbi-leader","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The chief rabbi of South Africa shared thoughts about Passover, faith, the Jewish people and today's rampant antisemitism just ahead of the holiday's start on Monday at sundown.","summary":"A rabbi who is reaching people all over the world through videos is stressing faith, hope and understanding as Passover begins this year amid the turmoil in and around Israel, including the recent strikes on that country by missiles and drones sent by Iran last Saturday, Friday's retaliatory strikes by Israel at Iran \u2014 and the ongoing antisemitism all over the globe toward Jewish people.\nRabbi Warren Goldstein, chief rabbi of South Africa, grew up in Pretoria and was the youngest person to be elected to this position in 2005, at age 33.\nHe is also a judge with a PhD in human rights and constitutional law.\nHe told Fox News Digital he's always been moved by the scriptural quote, \"It's not in the sky \u2026 It's in your heart\" (Deuteronomy 30) because he applies the spiritual principals of heaven to the physical realm.\nThe videos the rabbi posts online about world events and politics help people grasp a better understanding of what's really happening behind the scenes, he said, in a spiritual dimension they can't see.\nFor instance, in a video titled \"Searching for meaning in a post-October 7 Pesach (Passover),\" he described the miraculous survival of the Jewish people during Passover, which begins this year at sundown on April 22.\nThe holiday recalls that more than 3,300 years ago, Moses was instructed by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt and into the Promised Land of Israel by performing a series of miracles, as described in Exodus.\nSays Rabbi Goldstein in his video on YouTube, \"We were freed not through any liberation movement or natural process, but through the miracles of God, through the 10 plagues, the splitting of the sea, a fulfillment of the covenant God made with Abraham.\"\n\"There is something much bigger at play. It is \u2026 a great civilizational battle that touches on the essence of who we are.\"\nMany people consider the thwarted Iranian attack on April 13, 2024, to be a pre-Passover miracle reminiscent of biblical times.\nIran struck Israel with more than 300 missiles and drones \u2014 but 99% of them were struck down by Israel's missile defense system with the aid of American, French, British and Jordan air-defense forces, as multiple sources reported.\nA seven-year-old Bedouin girl was hit by shrapnel and is in critical condition. She was the only person seriously injured in the attacks, according to reports.\nRabbi Goldstein said in his video on that attack, \"A few days ago, as the night sky across the Middle East lit up with the deadly barrage of drones and missiles being shot down, halting Iran's genocidal intent in its tracks, it was clear to all that I said at the beginning of this conflict: This has never been about Gaza or the Palestinian cause. There is something much bigger at play. It is a war with Iran, a war of values, a great civilizational battle that touches on the essence of who we are.\"\n\"It all seems so surreal, what we've been through over these more than six months.\"\nHe said the survival of the Jewish people has always been a mystery.\nJews comprise less than 1% of the world's population, according to a 2023 Aish report. They've been persecuted for more than two centuries by the Romans, the Russian Cossacks, the Egyptians and the Spanish Inquisitors \u2014 and are now facing the enemy of Iran and its terrorist proxies.\nSaid Goldstein, \"None of the tools and principles that historians have used to analyze the trends of history are useful when it comes to the Jewish people. For a start, we shouldn't even be here.\"\nThe rabbi shared how shocked and bewildered the Jewish community around the world has been since the Oct. 7, 2023 terror attacks.\n\"It all seems so surreal, what we've been through over these more than six months,\" he said.\n\"Antisemitism is marked by its \"unrelenting persistence for centuries, and its unique viciousness,\" said one rabbi.\nAfter about 1,200 people in Israel were massacred and 253 kidnapped by Hamas terrorists, a vitriolic wave of antisemitism rose up across the globe, including on many of America's college campuses \u2014 accompanied by more threats of genocide to the Jewish people.\nIn his video, Rabbi Goldstein says antisemitism is marked by its \"unrelenting persistence for centuries, and its unique viciousness.\"\nJewish students on college campuses, he said, are feeling bewildered and some are wondering if adhering to Judaism is worth the pain and the danger.\nHe described some of them as getting to the point of \"seeking a way out of all of this by exiting our people.\"\nJews around the world \"shouldn't allow ourselves to be defined by the hatred of others or by their antisemitism,\" said the rabbi to Fox News Digital.\nThe Seder is a ceremonial meal symbolically reenacting the trials and tribulations the Israelites faced as they were leaving Egypt.\nHe referred to Passover as \"the festival of freedom and human dignity from oppression\" \u2014 and said he believes that the Seder is the perfect opportunity to connect with the spiritual meaning of what it is to be Jewish.\nThe Seder is a ceremonial meal symbolically reenacting the trials and tribulations the Israelites faced as they were leaving Egypt. Matzoh, which is unleavened bread, is always eaten at a Passover Seder.\nIt's a commemoration of how the Israelites were so rushed to escape Egypt that they didn't have time to wait for the dough to rise as they were baking bread.\nBitter herbs are eaten as reminders of the harsh conditions of slavery.\nCharoset, a mixture of honey, apples and walnuts, symbolizes the mortar the Israelites used to lay bricks, while its sweetness is a reminder to have hope and to be optimistic through adversity.\nFour cups of wine are also consumed to honor the four times God promised the Israelites He would take them out of Egypt and redeem them.\n\"Understanding that the story of our people is taking place on another plane [is] living proof of the presence of God.\"\nRabbi Goldstein said in his video that everything that's happened throughout history to the Jewish people, including antisemitism, was predicted thousands of years ago.\nHe recited the lyrics to a Passover song, Vehi Sheamda (\"This is what has stood by our fathers and us\"): \"Not only one arose to destroy us, but in every generation they rise up to destroy us. And the Holy One, blessed be He, saves us from their hands.\"\nThe song is from the Haggadah, a 2,500-year-old book that means \"telling\" in Hebrew.\nIt is read during the Passover Seder because it tells the story of the exodus of the Israelites out of slavery.\nThe rabbi said \"the somewhat discomforting words\" of Vehi Sheamda are sung at Seder tables \"with joy and pride, glasses raised in defiance, and with clarity of purpose.\"\nGoldstein made his video, he said, because world events are being seen through a narrow political and military lens \u2014 and he believes it's crucial to zoom out and look at them from a spiritual perspective.\n\"The supernatural suffering and success our people have experienced for millennia was predicted in the Torah. Understanding that the story of our people is taking place on another plane [is] living proof of the presence of God,\" said the rabbi.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Eve Glover","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/rabbi-split.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.0823116,"_id":"b6c1ab886a40901013b0ded38070f1da"},{"title":"Ilhan Omar's daughter mocked as 'psycho' after college suspends her for anti-Israel demonstrations","author":"Kyle Morris","published_date":"2024-04-18 20:33:05","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ilhan-omars-daughter-mocked-psycho-college-suspends-anti-israel-demonstrations","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Several social media users mocked Rep.

Perfection,\" Pollak wrote in a post to X.\nHirsi, who co-founded the U.S. Youth Climate Strike and has received fawning coverage from liberal media outlets, added the infamous symbol to her profile at some point in 2021.\n\"Barnard College has just suspended Ilhan Omar's daughter for her involvement in pro-Hamas and Iran protests at Columbia University,\" wrote Brigitte Gabriel, the founder and chairman of ACT For America. \"Supporting terrorism should be grounds for immediate expulsion!\n\"Ilhan Omar doesn't just hate America, she's also teaching her kids to hate America,\" Gabriel wrote in a follow-up post. \"Why are we bringing people to America who hate America? This is a road to terrorism.\"\nEmily Schrader, an Israeli-American human rights activist who campaigns against antisemitism, questioned why Hirsi is only facing a suspension and insisted that she \"should be expelled.\"\n\"Ilhan Omar's daughter suspended from Columbia for her leadership role in unsanctioned antisemitic and pro-terror protests,\" Schrader wrote in a post on X. \"My only question is, why only now, and why only a suspension?

You were told several times to leave the encampment and you didn't. Now you're suffering the consequences.\"\nBrooke Goldstein, a human rights attorney who serves as the executive director of The Lawfare Project, also weighed in on Hirsi's suspension, saying she was not surprised by the news.\n\"Hirsi has acknowledged that she is one of the organizers of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), the hate group that has done so much damage \u2013 not just to Jewish students on campus, but to the rights of all students,\" Goldstein wrote. \"This may be breaking news, but somehow it is not shocking news. A lot of questions need to be answered, including by Rep. Ilhan Omar.\"\nHirsi was named to Forbes' \"40 Under 40 Government and Politics\" list in 2020 and has been featured in New York Magazine. She was described as \"saving the planet\" by Vice News for her climate change work.\nWhile several right-leaning and Israeli-supporting activists took aim at Hirsi over her involvement in the protest, others, including Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., offered words of support.\nTlaib, who was censured by her colleagues in the House in November for anti-Israel comments she made in the wake of the Jewish state's war against terror group Hamas, wrote in a post to X: \"From UM to Vanderbilt to USC to Columbia, students across our country are being retaliated against for using their constitutional rights to protest genocide. It's appalling.\"\nHirsi's suspension came after dozens of protesters camped out in tents on school grounds Wednesday, calling on the university to divest itself from companies that have ties to Israel. The encampment was set up the same day Nemat Shafik, the university's president, testified before Congress about antisemitism on the college campus.\nThe students from both Barnard and Columbia who set up the encampment had a \"stated intention to remain,\" Barnard College said in a statement about the matter.\n\"Before noon on April 17, Columbia made multiple requests that students participating in the unauthorized encampment leave the lawn. A number of Barnard Senior Staff also went to the lawn to ask Barnard students participating in the encampment to leave and to advise Barnard students that they would be subject to sanctions at Barnard if they did not leave the encampment,\" the school said Thursday. \"Members of the Barnard Senior Staff provided participants in the unauthorized encampment with written warnings at approximately 7 p.m. on April 17.

Now, speaking from prison, the disgraced lawyer says Trump is a \"victim of the system.\"","summary":"EXCLUSIVE\u2013 Michael Avenatti, the one-time \"most dangerous enemy\" of Donald Trump who liberals hoped would bring down his presidency, thinks the hush money case against him in New York is flawed, politically motivated and part of a wider anti-democratic effort to take 2024 out of the voters' hands.\nAnd to prove his point, consider the source, Avenatti told Fox News Digital in a phone interview from federal prison.\n\"I certainly see him as a victim of the system,\" he said. \"And that's something that I never thought I would say. So if Michael Avenatti is coming to his defense, and I was one of his staunchest opponents for a very significant period of time, that should tell people something.\"\nThe disgraced former attorney for Stormy Daniels, who once flirted with a White House run himself before his multiple criminal convictions, thinks the four separate criminal cases Trump is facing as he runs for president in 2024 are \"absolute overkill\" and an effort to keep the American people from having their say between him and President Biden.\n\"You've got a group of individuals in the United States who have decided that they know better as to who should be the next president, and they've decided that they don't want to leave it to quote, the little guy, close quote,\" he said of the various cases against Trump. \"So they're going to take matters into their own hands to prevent those people from being heard, and I am deeply disturbed and disgusted by it.\"\nIf you believe in democracy, he says, \"this should be settled at the ballot box.\" Trump is also facing charges on Georgia election interference, federal election interference and mishandling of classified documents.\n\"There is no question that these prosecutors are trying to make a name for themselves. Each of them wants to be governor or president or both at some point,\" Avenatti said, name-dropping Fani Willis in Georgia as a grandstander in his eyes. \"I mean, it's ludicrous. And the fact that so many people on the left are OK with this because the defendant is Donald Trump really makes me sick to my stomach.\"\nAvenatti, an inmate at minimum-security Terminal Island federal prison in California, has been in contact with the Trump defense team about possibly testifying in the New York case and says he'd tell the truth if called to the stand. A source close to the Trump legal team confirmed those conversations to Fox News Digital.\nTrump's historic trial kicked off last week, where he faces 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The case revolves around an accusation that he improperly reimbursed former lawyer Michael Cohen for a $130,000 payoff in 2016 to porn star Stormy Daniels to stay silent about an alleged affair with Trump, which Trump denies.\n\"If the defendant was anybody other than Donald Trump, this stale case would not be being brought right now,\" Avenatti told Fox News Digital. \"He has definitely been targeted\u2026 There is no question that these prosecutors are trying to make a name for themselves.\"\nTrump is the first former president to ever face criminal charges, and he has called the case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, \"political persecution.\" The alleged crime in the case is not making a hush money payment, but rather that Trump knowingly made a campaign expenditure in far excess of legal limits that wasn't properly reported.\nAvenatti burst onto the national scene when he took on Daniels as a client in 2018; they sued Trump to try to reverse the non-disclosure agreement she signed about the alleged affair. That year, Avenatti became a constant cable news presence, doing hundreds of interviews and constantly poking Trump on social media.\nHe frequently predicted Trump wouldn't finish his first term in office, and he and Daniels became media stars, at one point posing for a Vogue photo shoot. Avenatti served as a guest co-host of ABC's \"The View,\" did interviews with Stephen Colbert and Bill Maher, and considered seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.\nBut as quickly as the seasoned litigator became nationally famous, his life collapsed in a sea of scandal and criminal charges beginning in 2019. He's now serving 19 years in prison for a variety of financial crimes, including trying to extort Nike for $25 million, pilfering millions from several clients, obstructing the IRS from collecting taxes, and stealing $300,000 from a book advance from Daniels.\nVarious prosecutors have characterized Avenatti as a \"serial fraudster\" and \"corrupt lawyer who claimed he was fighting for the little guy.\"\nTo say Daniels and his former lawyer have soured on one another since their 2018 partnership and public praising of one another is an understatement. Daniels has said he used his powers for \"evil\" and she never trusted him, only hiring him because he was the only lawyer who would take an adult film star's case.\nAvenatti in turn told Fox News Digital that Daniels fabricated numerous facets of her claims around the hush payment from the Trump campaign. In an affidavit obtained by Fox News Digital that he wrote but was never filed with the court in 2023 \u2013 the matter concerned a separate lawyer's representation of Trump \u2013 he described Daniels as erratic, temperamental and unstable.\n\"If Stormy Daniels was standing in a convent on a stack of Bibles with her tongue notarized and claiming the earth was round, I wouldn't believe it,\" he said, going on to claim he dropped her as a client in 2019 instead of the other way around.\nDaniels attorney Clark Brewster said in a statement that Avenatti was hardly a reliable source, pointing to his imprisonment for stealing from his own clients, including her.\n\"Mr. Avenatti's representation was terminated by Ms. Daniels after she consulted me and I discovered his forgery of her name and embezzlement of her funds,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Prior to her termination of Mr. Avenatti's services he publicly lauded Ms Daniel's courage, honesty and consistency. He presently stands as a thrice convicted felon for fraud, repeated acts of dishonesty and extortion. His recent desperate attempts crying out from his prison home seeking some relevancy are truly pathetic. Great source.\"\nAsked what had compelled him to come forward with his recent media interviews, Avenatti claimed he'd seen the unfairness of \"the system\" firsthand \u2013 he said in another recent interview that his own harsh sentencing for his crimes was due to being Trump's enemy. While he said he didn't see eye-to-eye with Trump on almost anything, it didn't mean he wasn't entitled to due process, and he criticized the gag order against Trump in New York by Judge Juan Merchan.\n\"I know what it's like when the government comes for you,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Regardless of how smart you are or what your resources are, you have little to no hope of prevailing, even if you're a former president of the United States. And I think what is happening to Trump right now is wrong, and it's outrageous.

Fox News Digital answers the top nine questions before the case begins.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump's hush money court case will kick off on Monday, marking the first time a former president will stand trial over criminal charges.\nThe historic trial will require Trump, the Republican Party's presumptive nominee for the 2024 election, to defend himself from the Manhattan courtroom while simultaneously campaigning as the election season heats up.\nFox News Digital compiled the top questions regarding the case ahead of it kicking off Monday at 10 a.m in Lower Manhattan.\nDubbed the \"hush money case,\" the trial's origins reach back to October of 2016, when Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen paid former pornographic actor Stormy Daniels $130,000 to allegedly quiet her claims of an alleged extramarital affair she had with the then-real estate tycoon in 2006. Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels.\nThe case is also expected to feature two other payments, including a $30,000 payment to a Trump Tower doorman who claimed that Trump fathered a child out of wedlock, and arranged a $150,000 payment through a tabloid publisher to a former Playboy model named Karen McDougal, who also claimed she had an affair with Trump and sold her story to the tabloid. Trump has also vehemently denied these allegations.\nProsecutors allege that the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen, and fraudulently logged the payments as legal expenses.\n\"During the election, TRUMP and others employed a \u2018catch and kill' scheme to identify, purchase, and bury negative information about him and boost his electoral prospects,\" Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleged last year. \"TRUMP then went to great lengths to hide this conduct, causing dozens of false entries in business records to conceal criminal activity, including attempts to violate state and federal election laws.\"\n\"Catch-and-kill\" schemes are understood as tactics used by media and publishing companies to buy the rights of a person's story with the intention of burying the information.\nBragg announced Trump's indictment in April of 2023 with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.\nThe charges stem from checks reimbursing Cohen over a roughly 12-month period for paying Daniels in 2016. Cohen was separately arrested in 2018 and pleaded guilty to campaign finance charges and lying to Congress. He was sentenced to three years in prison and has since been released.\nFalsifying business records is a misdemeanor, but prosecutors are working to prove that Trump falsified records with an intent to commit or conceal a second crime, which would be a felony.\nThe charges against Trump carry more than a decade in prison, if he is convicted on the counts.\nLegal experts across the nation have weighed in that it is unlikely Trump would face a long prison sentence, if convicted, speculating that the 45th president would instead be given probation or up to four years in prison if found guilty by the jury, Fox News previously reported.\nCharges of falsifying business records are misdemeanors in New York, with prosecutors teeing up a case arguing that Trump falsified the business records to cover another crime, which makes falsifying the records a felony. Legal experts have weighed in that prosecutors will argue that Trump's alleged actions were to \u200b\u200bconceal campaign finance crimes.\nLegal experts who spoke to Fox News Digital expressed skepticism over the DA's office linking the case to campaign finance crimes, with the Heritage Foundation's senior legal fellow Zack Smith saying that prosecutors are trying to \"bootstrap essentially what would ordinarily be misdemeanor charges into felony offenses.\"\n\"Some of the charges he's trying to bring are false records charges against Donald Trump. Which are ordinarily misdemeanors, unless they were done in furtherance of another felony - simply to cover up another felony. And in this case, as I understand it, Alvin Bragg is saying that the other felony was a federal campaign finance violation. So, you simply have a state prosecutor pursuing a state case against Donald Trump, based on a federal felony offense that the federal government, the Justice Department itself, declined to pursue,\" Smith told Fox News Digital in an interview earlier this month.\nThe Justice Department in 2019 \"effectively concluded\" its investigation into Trump's payments. In 2021, the Federal Elections Commission, the agency dedicated to enforcing campaign finance laws, announced that it had dropped a case looking into whether Trump had violated election laws for the payment to Daniels.\nFormer FEC member Hans Von Spakovsky underscored to Fox News Digital in another interview that both the FEC and DOJ had declined to pursue the case, yet a local DA is working to prove that Trump violated federal law.\n\"The [FEC] looked at this and said that this settlement was not a violation of federal law. The Justice Department also has criminal enforcement authority over federal campaign finance laws, and the Justice Department has also not considered this a crime. And so you have this local DA claiming there's a violation of federal law, when the two federal agencies with enforcement authority over that law say, \u2018Well, no, there there was no violation of federal law.' And look, I say that as a former commissioner on the FEC. My job as a commissioner was to enforce federal campaign finance law, and this is simply not a violation of federal law,\" he said.\nIn the hush money case, Trump could not pardon himself if convicted, and if he wins re-election come November 5. The Constitution dictates that a president's pardoning powers \"grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States,\" meaning the powers only apply to federal cases. The hush money case is a state case.\nManhattan Judge Juan M. Merchan, 61, is presiding over the case. Merchan, originally from Colombia, has served on the New York Supreme Court since 2009, overseeing felony criminal cases. He previously served as an assistant district attorney in the Manhattan DA's office in the 1990s and worked in the New York State Attorney General's office, among other roles.\nMerchan has previously overseen high-profile cases, including in 2012 the case of the \"soccer mom madam,\" when a woman named Anna Gristina was charged with running a high-end prostitution ring in Manhattan. He also presided over the Trump Organization's 2022 criminal trial involving charges of criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records, and he is currently overseeing a case involving Trump-supporter Steven Bannon on charges that he defrauded donors to build a wall along the nation's southern border.\nTrump has railed against Merchan on Truth Social, including last month when he called on the judge to recuse himself and cited Merchan's daughter and her work as a political consultant for Democratic politicians.\n\"Judge Juan Merchan, who is suffering from an acute case of Trump Derangement Syndrome (whose daughter represents Crooked Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Adam \u2018Shifty' Schiff, and other Radical Liberals, has just posted a picture of me behind bars, her obvious goal, and makes it completely impossible for me to get a fair trial) has now issued another illegal, un-American, unConstitutional \u2018order,' as he continues to try and take away my Rights,\" Trump posted on Truth Social last month after he was given a gag order limiting what he could publicly say about the case.\nA large group of potential jurors will gather in the courtroom this week, where they will be presented with an overview of the case and asked whether they are able to serve in a fair and impartial manner.\nThose who show they cannot be impartial will be dismissed, while those who remain will be asked a series of 42 questions, which Merchan released in a letter last week, including:\nJury selection will continue until 12 New Yorkers and a handful of alternates are assigned to the panel.\nTrump has railed against the \"hush money\" case repeatedly, including in Pennsylvania on Saturday, where he held his last scheduled campaign rally ahead of the trial officially beginning Monday.\n\"I will be forced to sit fully gagged. I'm not allowed to talk. They want to take away my constitutional right to talk,\" Trump said in Pennsylvania, referring to the gag order that prevents him from publicly discussing potential witnesses and jurors.\n\"I'm proud to do it for you,\" he continued, calling the trial a \"communist show trial\" which he claims is orchestrated by the Biden administration. \"Have a good time watching.\"\nTrump has repeatedly denied the allegations in the case and has pleaded not guilty to the 34 charges.\nThe 45th president told reporters on Friday that he will testify in the trial, which he described as a \"scam\" and a \"witch hunt.\"\n\"I'm testifying. I tell the truth. I mean, all I can do is tell the truth,\" he said at Mar-a-Lago Friday, Fox News previously reported. \"And the truth is that there's no case.\"\nThe trial will not be televised and is anticipated to last between six and eight weeks. Trump is required under New York law to be in the courtroom throughout court proceedings.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Emma Colton","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Trump-Hush-Money-Explainer.gif","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":3.6041837,"_id":"7397517d940f1f0b671154ad878374cc"}],"user_input":{"q":"liberal","search_in":["title_summary_en"],"lang":["en"],"not_lang":null,"countries":null,"not_countries":null,"from":"2024-04-15 00:00:00","to":null,"ranked_only":"True","from_rank":null,"to_rank":null,"sort_by":"relevancy","page":1,"size":100,"sources":["foxnews.com"],"not_sources":[],"topic":null,"published_date_precision":null}}
