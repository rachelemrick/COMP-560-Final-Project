            "summary": "PITTSBURGH — In the heart of one of America's most prominent historically Jewish neighborhoods, Dan and Baila Cohen keep the front entrance of their 70-year-old Judaica store locked during business hours.\nIt's not how they'd prefer it. But in light of Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack in Israel, Israel's ongoing military campaign in Gaza and tensions at home, they said, the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh told them they needed to be vigilant about who enters their business.\n'That's the reality of the world,' Dan Cohen said.\nIt's not the first time they've had to take additional safety precautions. The couple completed their purchase of Pinsker's Books and Judaica in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood in 2018 just days after a white supremacist gunned down 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue a few blocks away in the deadliest antisemitic attack in American history. But this time feels different.\n'Oct. 27 really unified' Squirrel Hill and Pittsburgh, Baila Cohen said of the Tree of Life massacre. 'Oct. 7 … really started polarizing the community itself, because that's when we started seeing much more of the infighting and conflicts.'\nConversations with more than 30 political strategists, activists and voters outlined how that tension has put Jewish voters in an unfamiliar spot ahead of the 2024 elections: on the front lines of the fight for control of the White House and Congress. Nowhere is that more apparent than in Pennsylvania, the swing state with the largest Jewish population — about 300,000 voting-age Jews in a state President Joe Biden won by roughly 80,000 votes in 2020.\nWhat's more, the congressional district that includes Squirrel Hill features a primary Tuesday that is among the first electoral tests of sentiment on both sides of the conflict in Gaza and concerns over rising antisemitism in the U.S. Democratic Rep. Summer Lee, a 'squad'-aligned progressive critical of Israel's handling of the war and one of the first lawmakers to call for a cease-fire last year, will face Bhavini Patel, an Edgewood Borough Council member who has painted Lee's advocacy as harmful to Biden's re-election chances and out of step with her district.\n'We have communities that are hurting. The Jewish community is one of them. And there are people who are … not going to agree 100% on everything that you say,' Lee said in an interview, adding she has been 'very clear and very upfront' about her cease-fire position. 'I have condemned Hamas. We've worked with the families of hostages; we've done everything that I think is necessary to do that. And at the end of the day, we disagree.'\nA dozen Jewish voters in the district who spoke to NBC News, whether supporting Lee or Patel, almost universally said their votes in November would be driven by issues beyond Israel, saying that the Jewish electorate isn't a 'monolith' and that democracy, abortion rights and the economy weighed heavily on them.\nMost Jewish voters in Squirrel Hill — and nationally — align with the Democratic Party. A Pew Research Center survey released this month found 69% of Jews leaning Democratic, while 29% aligned Republican.\nBut Republicans aren't looking for a massive defection. GOP strategists and Republicans involved in Jewish outreach expressed confidence that Democratic divisions over Israel will help move a small but potentially significant number of Jewish voters into their camp in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona. They pointed to surveys showing President Donald Trump's improved performance among Jews in 2020, compared with his 2016 race, as evidence of a slow shift that could continue.\n'Before Oct. 7, most candidates would say this issue is so messy. … It's not necessarily something that I want to focus on in my campaign,' said Tali deGroot, political director for the liberal Jewish group J Street. 'And I would have said, ‘Absolutely, this isn't a voting issue for people we poll year after year.' And it's too soon to tell if it's going to be a voting issue. But not talking about it is not an option.'‘Playing with fire' In Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, the war and its impact at home took center stage last week at a campaign event where Lee launched her 'Jews for Summer' coalition.\nLee talked about 'how our liberation is tied together,' whether 'in western Pennsylvania or the West Bank.' She spoke about how the district still needs 'deep healing' following both the Oct. 7 attack and the killing of Jews at Tree of Life. And she framed her primary as a covert Republican effort to divide a multiethnic, cross-religious support base by using splits over Israel.\n'There are people who have to convince you that the only reason why I could believe in peace is because I actually hate some of our neighbors, not because we love each other,' said Lee, who overcame significant spending by groups aligned with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group, when she narrowly won her first congressional primary in 2022.\nIsrael didn't have the salience it does now. Lee has accused the Israeli government of committing 'war crimes,\" called for an end to unconditional military aid to the country and joined a handful of other progressives in mid-2022, before the Israel-Hamas war, who voted against a GOP-led resolution that said Israel wasn't 'a racist or apartheid state.' She has also condemned Hamas' attack and repeatedly spoken out against antisemitism.\nOn Saturday, she joined 36 Democrats and 21 Republicans in voting against an aid package to the country, which passed overwhelmingly. She and Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., were the only Pennsylvania members to vote against it.\nHer early call for a cease-fire is now largely in step with Democratic voters, but Jewish leaders have expressed unease with how Lee and some of her allies have discussed the issue. Last month, more than 40 Pittsburgh-area rabbis wrote in a letter, after an earlier meeting with Lee, that she has 'continued to use divisive rhetoric' that the group has at times 'perceived as openly antisemitic.'\nTheir letter didn't describe that rhetoric, but it said Lee opposed House measures to condemn antisemitism and criticized her calls for an 'unconditional cease-fire from one side,' which they said 'devalues the lives and beliefs of one group.' They also called on her to return campaign contributions 'from people who have voiced virulently antisemitic sentiments.' In February, Lee canceled an appearance before the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations amid backlash over other speakers' antisemitic and homophobic remarks, which she condemned.\nKaren Hochenberg, president of a local Democratic club that has endorsed Patel, said Lee has lost considerable support in the Jewish community, including hers. While Hochenberg aligns with Lee on many issues, she and others have been 'hurt' by some of her votes and actions, and she said she wished Lee had been more vocal about the Hamas attack.\n'Many Jews now are starting to question where are we on the road map of intersectionality,' Hochenberg said. 'Jews are starting to really take a look at how comfortable we are and if we're going to send candidates to Congress who's going to be there and have the voice of the Jewish community in mind, as well.'\nJeremy Kazzaz, a Pittsburgher leading a new Jewish voter group, said the pushback Lee faces isn't so much about Israel but about what he called an unwillingness to meet with constituents who don't share her views.\n'She finds the individuals who agree with her already who are anti-Zionist, who are extremist or fringe of the left of politics, and she will hold them up on a pedestal while spreading things' that, Kazzaz said, make local Jews 'less safe.'\nBut overall, Lee is looking stronger in her district now than in her first run, even to some opponents. AIPAC-linked groups aren't getting involved in her primary this time. Lee has framed her campaign around efforts to counter MAGA Republicans and bring federal dollars to the district.\nJonathan Mayo, a Squirrel Hill resident co-leading the Jews for Summer coalition, told NBC News he aligns with Lee's position on Israel but emphasized that he's not a single-issue voter.\n'It is so important to speak out and show that there are members of the Squirrel Hill Jewish community who still very much support Summer Lee,' he said.\nPatel, meanwhile, is framing her challenge to Lee around who offers Biden the most support, hitting Lee for not criticizing activists and groups calling for 'uncommitted' votes against the president in Tuesday's primary.\n'It's essentially playing with fire,' Patel said in an interview, arguing it could boost Trump.\nLee allies have countered that anti-Biden GOP megadonors support Patel's campaign. An outside group boosting Patel recently disclosed that it received an $800,000 donation from right-wing billionaire Jeffrey Yass. (Patel said she 'denounces' Yass, calling any focus on him a distraction.)\nLee has said she is supporting Biden in the fall. She's endorsed by congressional Democratic leadership and by Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who has become arguably the most staunchly pro-Israel Democrat in Congress. And in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, Biden shouted out Lee as someone 'who had my back.'\n'We're going to make sure that the person who's sitting in the White House is not going to be replaced,' Lee said at her event on a recent Sunday.\nSeveral attendees said they were casting anti-Biden protest votes Tuesday. But most said they would support him this fall.\nOne of them, Harry Hochheiser, said Biden 'is the only legitimate choice' against Trump. He said the divisions opened up in the Jewish community over the war have been devastating.\n'I don't think any of us enjoy these divisions,' Hochheiser, a University of Pittsburgh professor and pro-Palestinian activist voting uncommitted in the primary but backing Biden against Trump, said of tensions in the Jewish community over Israel.\n‘More salient than it has been' The fight for Jewish votes in Pittsburgh is only part of a bigger landscape. Across Pennsylvania, Republican Dave McCormick has put Israel at the forefront of his campaign against Democratic Sen. Bob Casey. Nationally, groups in both parties are preparing for what they say could be the largest investment ever made to court the Jewish vote at the presidential level.\nBiden's handling of the war is the main flashpoint. Initially, he was more deferential to Israel. But as the death toll mounted in Gaza and left-wing blowback intensified at home, he has sharpened his criticism of Israeli leadership, pushed for increased humanitarian aid and ramped-up efforts to reach a cease-fire agreement. Still, he hasn't gone as far as his critics to his left would like.\nAs for whether Republicans can pick up voters disaffected by the Democratic divide over Israel, Mark Mellman, president of Democratic Majority for Israel, said it's 'mostly noise' but cautioned 'there is a serious chance' depending how the coming months play out.\nJewish voters have 'been extraordinarily appreciative of the support that President Biden and Democratic leaders have given Israel over the course of this conflict,' he said. 'I hear from some people that is beginning to change as people perceive some change in the positions of those Democratic leaders. But look … Biden has been extraordinary.'\nA 2021 Pew Research Center survey found a wide split in partisanship among Jewish voters depending on which movement they aligned with. Orthodox Jews favored Republicans over Democrats by 75% to 20%, while 70% of Conservative Jews and 80% of Reform Jews backed Democrats.\nSam Markstein, national political director at the Republican Jewish Coalition, said much of the Jewish vote is based in states where Republicans have no shot at all, contributing to the gulf in support between Republicans and Democrats. Pointing to an Associated Press VoteCast survey after the 2020 election that found Trump improved on his 2016 performance among Jewish voters, Markstein predicts the Republican Jewish Coalition will make its 'largest investment at the top of the ticket ever' this cycle to target Jewish voters in battlegrounds.\n'That's where you're going to see the most success this year,' he said.\nSome other surveys had more positive trends for Democrats. This month's Pew survey found the share of Jewish voters who align with Democrats has increased 8 points since 2020.\nDan Siegel, who led Jewish outreach for Biden's 2020 campaign, said Jewish voters' foremost concerns are similar to those of any other voting group: the economy, health care and education.\n'I do think [Israel] may be a little bit more top of mind. But I also think at the end of the day, elections are a binary choice,' Siegel said, predicting Jewish voters 'are going to want that strong, steady hand, not an authoritarian demagogue who is unwieldy at best in a crisis.'\nTrump, who strongly favored Israel as president, has offered limited commentary on the war. Speaking last month with Israel Hayom, an Israeli newspaper, Trump said, 'You have to finish up your war. You have to get it done. We have to get to peace. We can't have this going on.'\nBiden's campaign has zoomed in on recent comments Trump has made about Jewish voters; he said on Real America's Voice that 'any Jewish person who votes for Biden does not love Israel and, frankly, should be spoken to.'\nIn a statement, Karoline Leavitt, Trump's national press secretary, slammed Democrats for caving in 'to the demands of far-left Palestinian extremists.\"\nAsked about Trump's comments on the war, Markstein said he believed Trump 'was just giving voice to the frustration of … people [who] want this to be concluded, with Israel defeating Hamas and rescuing the hostages.' On Trump's remarks about Jewish voters, Markstein said Trump 'was just trying to say in a Trumpian way … why haven't they been more vocal in their opposition to what their own leaders of their party are doing?'\nBack in Pittsburgh, Kipp Dawson, a Jewish civil rights activist backing Lee, said she would be horrified by Trump's re-election and expressed hope that Lee would be able to bring skeptical Democrats back on board with Biden this fall.\n'My sense is that things are extraordinarily in flux in this country right now,' she said. 'The big issue for November is who's going to come out to vote.'\nAt Pinsker's, the Cohens declined to say whom they'd support in next week's primary or the general election, though they said a number of Jews in Squirrel Hill were eager to back Patel.\n'The Jewish community really feels that if they don't take the stand now, [U.S. support for Israel] is not going to be assured,' Baila Cohen said. 'Everyone's very interested in getting actively involved and being part of the political scene in a way that doesn't always play out.'\nAllan Smith Emma Barnett",

            "excerpt": "In an exclusive interview, Naim Qassem considers the looming risk of a region-wide war.",
            "summary": "BEIRUT — Iran-backed Hezbollah is determined not to ramp up its monthslong firefight over Lebanon's southern border, but will respond in kind to any Israeli escalation, the political party and militia's second-in-command told NBC News in a rare and exclusive interview.\nNaim Qassem faulted Israel and the United States for perpetuating tit-for-tat attacks that have killed hundreds in southern Lebanon and displaced tens of thousands of civilians on both sides of the Israeli-Lebanese border. The conflict started with Hamas' terror attack on Israel on Oct. 7, which killed more than 1,200 people and sparked Israel's bloody incursion into the Gaza Strip that has since killed nearly 34,000 people, according to the Ministry of Health in Hamas-ruled Gaza.\n'We didn't expect the war would last this long because we didn't think that Netanyahu was that foolish, same for Biden and the other countries,' Qassem said, as Israel's two-front conflict drags into its seventh month.\nNaim Qassem, the Shia Lebanese cleric and politician who is Hezbollah's second-in-command, speaks with NBC News on Thursday. NBC News As Hezbollah's deputy secretary-general, Qassem ranks second behind the group's revered leader, Hassan Nasrallah.\nQassem's comments came as Israel prepares its response to an unprecedented retaliatory Iranian missile and drone barrage against the Jewish state — an impending reprisal that would bring the Middle East closer to a region-wide war than at any time in recent memory.\nBut the latest round of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah began months before last weekend's direct confrontation between Israel and Iran. Hezbollah is estimated to have upward of 150,000 rockets and missiles, in addition to drones and anti-tank, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, according to a Reuters report, citing data from the CIA.\nHezbollah, a powerful, Iran-backed Shia political party and militant organization, was formed in the early 1980s during the Lebanese civil war and was an active force during the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, when it set a mission to expel Israeli forces from the country. The group has long claimed solidarity with the Palestinian cause. The U.S. considers Hezbollah a terrorist organization.\nHezbollah first struck a disputed border region of northern Israel on Oct. 8, the day after Hamas' attack on Israel. At the time, Hezbollah called that strike an act of 'solidarity' with Hamas. Iran also has backed Hamas for years.\nHezbollah claimed responsibility Wednesday for a missile and drone attack on northern Israel that injured 18 people, 14 of whom were Israeli soldiers, saying the strikes were retaliation for Israel killing two of the group's commanders in a cross-border attack the day before.\nAmong the multiple Iran-backed groups that oppose Israel in the Middle East, Hezbollah is by far the strongest and the largest beneficiary of Iranian largesse.\nIran has declared that its attack Saturday night, which saw it launch more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel, marked the full extent of its retaliation for an April 1 strike by Israel on the Iranian Consulate in Syria's capital, Damascus, that killed two senior commanders and five advisers from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\nQassem said Iran repeated its public messaging to Hezbollah.\n'Tehran speaks publicly and clearly. They do not want war and they have responded to the attack on their embassy and that's it for them,' Qassem said. 'I think Iran is honest. This is what they told us and this is what they keep reiterating to the media.'\nQassem offered measured criticism of the three Arab countries — Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — that assisted in Israel's defense against the Iranian salvo Saturday night.\n'It wasn't adequate for any Arab nation to support Israel no matter what justifications they had,' he said. 'Their populations will hold them accountable for all those who took this decision.'\nQassem laid equal blame for the civilian losses in Gaza on both Israel and the United States, dismissing a recent public rift between U.S. President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as little more than cosmetic politics meant to 'safeguard America's image.'\n'I consider that Biden and Netanyahu are both complicit in one scheme with very minor differences,' Qassem said.\nIn an earlier interview in November, Qassem told NBC News that Hezbollah would push more forcefully into its fight with Israel if the Jewish state continued its incursion into Gaza.\nBut nearly six months later, both Hezbollah and Israel have mostly hewed to 'rules of engagement' — an unstated understanding between both sides that has so far tempered the fighting and confined it to the two states' border regions.\nhewed to 'rules of engagement' — an unstated understanding between both sides that has so far tempered the fighting and confined it to the two states' border regions. 'We will not accept that the Israelis transgress the rules of engagement that are currently set in the south' of Lebanon, he said. 'If the Israelis increase their attacks, we will increase our attacks as well.'\nWhile Israel is playing by the rules of engagement for now, senior Israeli officials have threatened to destroy Lebanon if Hezbollah escalates.\nIn January, an assassination by drone strike in Beirut of a Hamas leader was believed to have been carried out by Israel, ratcheting up tensions then, though Israel did not claim responsibility.\nDespite its limited engagement, Qassem said Hezbollah's fight is 'serving its purpose' by 'luring the Israeli forces to get busy in the north,' referring to their shared border, rather than Gaza, which borders southern Israel.\n'Therefore, we will continue to do so, and we will not wage a full-scale war unless the Israelis decide to get into war against us,' he said. 'Then we are ready for the full confrontation.'\nMatt Bradley Ziad Jaber Natasha Lebedeva",

The recent cycle of violence between Israel and Iran began on April 1 when Israel bombed an Iranian consular building in the Syrian capital of Damascus, killing two generals and five officers in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.\nIran responded 12 days later, launching an unprecedented, direct military attack on Israel involving more than 300 missiles and drones. The assault caused no significant damage, however. Nearly all of the missiles and drones were intercepted by Israeli, U.S. and other allied forces.\nAlthough Israel has been locked in a shadow war with Israel for decades, with Iran arming and training proxy forces hostile to Israel in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and the Palestinian enclave of Gaza, the Iranian aerial barrage marked the first time Tehran had staged an overt military attack on Israel.\nIn the following days, the Biden administration urged Israel to exercise restraint and not conduct a retaliatory attack that could trigger a full-blown war between the two adversaries.\nIsrael retaliated on Thursday night, striking a military airfield near the city of Isfahan in central Iran. Nuclear facilities in the area were not damaged, according to Iranian state media, and there were no reports of casualties.\nThe attack was downplayed by Iranian state media and met with mostly silence from Israeli officials. The limited scope of the strike and the lack of public statements afterward appears to indicate that both sides are looking to ease tensions, experts said.\nU.S. officials called for calm as well. \"We do not want to see this conflict escalate,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Friday.\nAmirabdollahian offered a similar sentiment but warned that Iran would respond with maximum force if Israel engages in what he described as more \"adventurism.\"\n\"If Israel makes another mistake, our next response will be decisive and immediate,\" he said.\nRich Schapiro Dan De Luce",

            "summary": "'Iran understands it's relatively weak in the region, and so it had to make sure that whatever action it took was sufficiently significant to send a very strong message but not so successful that it would invite retaliation not only from Israel, but from Israel's allies,' Rodger Shanahan, a Middle East analyst based in Australia, said in a phone interview Monday from Lebanon.\nWilliam F. Wechsler, senior director of Middle East Programs at the Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank, similarly argued that the nature of Tehran's retaliatory mission was telling.\n'Iran sent an unmistakable signal that it wanted to avoid a further escalation that could spark a truly regional war,' Wechsler said in an analysis. 'It chose long-range attacks that could be readily thwarted by known Israeli defenses and pointedly did not target any U.S. facilities.'\nTehran — which does not officially recognize Israel's existence, has long championed the Palestinian cause and Hamas' Oct. 7 attack as a 'victory' — has worked to frame its weekend strikes as a 'legitimate' and 'responsible' reaction to Israel bombing its consulate in Syria. The West should be 'grateful' for Iran's restraint, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said on Monday.\nYet some in Tehran have described the Saturday attack in more drastic terms. 'We have decided to create a new equation' with Israel, the chief of the country's Revolutionary Guard Corps said.\nIsrael has battled its arch-enemy Iran through clandestine operations and proxy forces, as well as warning Tehran over its intentions as it develops its nuclear programs. (Iran has long insisted that its nuclear program is peaceful — a claim Israel rejects.)\nThrough its proxies, most notably Hezbollah, the powerful and well-armed political party and militant group in Lebanon, Iran has struck at Israel. But before Saturday, neither side had openly and directly attacked the other at home.\nIsraeli Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi leads a situational assessment at the Kirya military base in Tel Aviv on Sunday.

'Regardless of what Israel does next, there is no going back to the status quo ante,' Saad said in a subsequent post.\nWestern leaders nonetheless appear eager for Israel to show restraint in its response.\nU.S. officials told NBC News that Washington was concerned that Israel could respond quickly without thinking through the potential fallout, and Biden told Netanyahu that the U.S. will not participate in offensive operations against Iran, a senior administration official said.\nIran has long viewed its missile arsenal as the ultimate ace card to deter and threaten its adversaries, but Israel's success in defending itself against hundreds of Iranian projectiles raised doubts about Tehran's military power. In an editorial for The Wall Street Journal, a former commander of U.S. Central Command argued that Iran's aerial assault was a display of weakness.\n'The vulnerability of Iran's force has been exposed, and the regime is gravely weakened as a result,' retired Marine Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. wrote. 'Israel has been strengthened by a stunning display of military competence, a striking contrast with that seen on Oct. 7.'\nAn aerial assault on Saudi Arabia by Iranian-backed Houthi forces in 2019, which the U.S. and Israel blamed on Iran, was much more effective. In that attack, which Iran denied responsibility for, drones struck key Saudi oil facilities, penetrating Riyadh's U.S.-made air defense systems. The episode sparked concern in Washington and the region that Iran's missile and drone fleets posed a growing threat.\nIn many respects, Iran and Israel have been on a collision course for nearly half a century.\nIsrael and Iran have been enemies since the Islamic Revolution in the late 1970s. Iran's theocratic regime has vowed to wipe the Jewish state off the map; Israel and the U.S. have long accused Tehran of funding terrorist organizations and armed proxies in the Middle East, including Hamas and Hezbollah.\nThe speech notes of Gilad Erdan, the Israeli ambassador to the U.N., during a Security Council meeting on Sunday. Charly Tribbaleau / AFP via Getty Images But the hostilities between Israel and Iran have never risen to the level of face-to-face military confrontation. Instead, the two countries have carried out furtive attacks on each other by land, sea, air — and cyberspace.\nIran routinely targets Israel through its 'Axis of Resistance,' a network that extends Tehran's influence across the Arab world.\nWhile Iran has denied that it played a role in Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack, and a senior Hamas official has said Iran did not order or sanction the operation, both Israel and the United States say Tehran was complicit in the assault, having armed and trained the militants for years.\nIn the aftermath of Oct. 7, Israel concluded that its past targeting of Iranian arms shipments to Hezbollah in Lebanon and other covert actions had failed to sufficiently deter Iran, prompting it to go after the Revolutionary Guard officers at the diplomatic compound in Damascus this month, former U.S. officials and regional experts said.\nIt is rare for Iran to deploy its capabilities so directly against an enemy, even when its senior commanders are taken out. In 2020, when the U.S. launched a drone strike in Baghdad that killed Tehran's powerful Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran struck back with missiles on Iraqi bases housing American troops, injuring about 100 personnel.\nThe war in Gaza raised tensions between Iran and Israel to new heights, before the Israeli strike on Tehran's diplomatic compound in Damascus on April 1 killed at least seven of its military officers, including two top commanders.\nIran vowed vengeance — and then delivered on that promise Saturday. The question now is how Israel chooses to deliver its response.\nDaniel Arkin Dan De Luce and Jennifer Jett contributed.",

Last Saturday, Iran launched a barrage of missiles and drones on Israel in response to an Israeli airstrike earlier this month that killed several Iranian military officers.\nIsrael responded Friday with a targeted operation in Iran that was limited in scope, a source familiar with the matter said.\nAs a conflict that could further destabilize the Middle East unfolds, here's what to know.\nFollow live updates after Israel's strike on Iran\nFollow live updates after Israel's strike on Iran What did Israel's recent attack on Iran look like? Iran is currently assessing the damage from Friday's attack, a source familiar with the situation told NBC News, but a nuclear facility in the central Iranian city of Isfahan is safe.\nIsraeli armored personnel carriers move along the border after leaving the Gaza Strip on Wednesday. Amir Levy / Getty Images The United States has claimed it was not involved with the Israeli attack on Iran, and U.S. officials publicly encouraged restraint in the days leading up to it.\nOn Friday at a news conference during a G7 meeting in Italy, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. was 'intensely focused' on de-escalating the situation.\nWhy did Iran attack Israel on April 13? Iran's attack on Israel was in response to a deadly Israeli airstrike on April 1 at the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria. Brig. Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force, was among several officers killed in the strike.\nIran's retaliatory attack on Israel left minimal destruction because the vast majority of the more than 300 drones and missiles it fired were shot down by Israeli, U.S. and European forces before reaching Israeli territory.\nIsrael vowed to retaliate for the Iranian strikes, the first-ever direct military attack by Tehran on the Jewish state.\nWhat are Iran and Israel's nuclear capabilities? Iran's nuclear capabilities are still unknown. The 2015 Iran nuclear deal brokered by the Obama administration and several other nations limited the country's nuclear capabilities, but the Trump administration withdrew from the accord.\nA billboard in Tehran on Friday depicts Iranian ballistic missiles. AFP via Getty Images Israel has not confirmed whether it has nuclear weapons, but it's widely believed the country has the technology to produce such equipment.\nWho are the leaders of the two countries? Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been the supreme leader of Iran since 1989. Ali Khamenei was also the country's third president from 1981 to 1989. Ebrahim Raisi is Iran's current president. In Iran, the supreme leader, not the president, is the head of state.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has served three separate tenures as prime minister since 1996. He has drawn fierce criticism in recent months for his failure to stop the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, which killed some 1,200 people. He has also been criticized for his handling of the war against Hamas in Gaza, which has killed more than 33,000 people, according to Palestinian health officials.\nWho are their allies? Iran's allies include proxy groups in the region such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis. The country also has broader support from Syria and ties to other countries in the Middle East and beyond.Israel, also, has alliances with some countries in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. Israel is a \"major non-NATO ally,\" which means member countries are not committed to standing by it if it is attacked, though Israel does have military ties to countries within NATO, like the U.S., and beyond.\nThe U.S., Britain and Jordan claim to have helped defend Israel itself during the April 13 attacks.\nJoy Burton",

            "summary": "Israeli forces appear to have carried out a counterstrike on Iran five days after Tehran targeted Israel with a barrage of drones and missiles in an unprecedented attack in retaliation for Israel's bombing of an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria.\nThe extent of the damage from the strike, which neither the Israeli nor Iranian governments commented on but was confirmed by two people familiar with the situation, remained unclear.\nWhile largely appearing to downplay the strikes, reports from Iranian state media said air defense systems had been engaged in several provinces early Friday morning and there were limited explosions outside Isfahan, a historic city in central Iran that is home to a nuclear installation.\nLater, Iranian state media reported that the sound of several explosions in Isfahan was caused by the destruction of three small drones.\nAn Iranian anchor described Isfahan as being 'in complete peace — people are living their normal lives.'\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency said that there is no damage to Iran's nuclear facilities.\nEarlier in the week, Iranian officials said after their strikes on Israel that they did not want to continue hostilities, but would counterstrike \"immediately\" should Israel attack in response. So far, that has not happened.\nIsraeli officials notified U.S. counterparts on Thursday that a military response was coming, according to a source.\nOn Friday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he would not 'speak to these reported events' but added that U.S. forces had 'not been involved in any offensive operations' when asked about the strike.\nThe U.S. was \"intensely focused de-escalating,\" Blinken added during a press conference in Capri, Italy, during a G7 meeting.\n'Target-rich environment' Whether or not this turns into a dangerous escalatory spiral, 'will depend on how much damage was done inside of Iran,' former CIA Director John Brennan told MSNBC.\nIntelligence agencies will be trying to determine the scope of the Israeli strike's damage, and whether there are casualties or how many could increase pressure on Iran to respond, he added. As of Friday afternoon, there did not appear to be major damage or reported casualties.\nIsfahan is a 'target-rich environment,' with an air base, a missile production facility and other areas that could be of interest, Brennan said.\nIsrael is neither confirming nor denying it was responsible for this morning's attack. When approached by NBC News, both the Israeli prime minister's office and the Israel Defense Forces responded with 'no comment,' there are currently no scheduled plans for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak publicly.\nThe official silence from the Israeli government could indicate a strategy to not further provoke Iran, which might increase public pressure there to retaliate. By remaining silent, Israel is giving Iran space to minimize the incident and plausibly claim there's no need for escalation.\nThe Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., and the CIA also declined to comment.\nPeople demonstrate demanding a regional peace agreement outside of the U.S. Embassy Branch Office in Tel Aviv. Leo Correa / AP Iran's attack last weekend marked the first time the country has launched a direct military assault on Israel. It came less than two weeks after Israel's bombing of an Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus, which killed 12 people, including seven Iranian military commanders.\nIsrael, the U.S. and their allies fended off the Iranian drone and missile attacks, which caused relatively little damage.\nIsrael's counterstrike is the latest escalation in a shadow war between the two countries that has raged since Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979. Until now, the two countries waged battle through proxy forces, top-secret assassinations, audacious cyberattacks and nuclear sabotage — but never head-to-head military engagement.\nThe counterstrike is likely to deepen anxieties in capitals worldwide about the prospect of an all-out war in the Middle East. The region has been on edge since Hamas stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing more than 1,200 people. Israel's devastating military offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip has killed nearly 34,000, according to local health officials.\nIran has vowed to wipe Israel off the map. Israel perceives Iran as an existential threat, and it has accused the country of funding terrorist organizations and armed proxies throughout the Middle East, including Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.\nIn the lead-up to Israel's counteroffensive, world leaders had urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to exercise restraint.\nAn Israeli armored personnel carrier near the Israel-Gaza border on Monday. Amir Cohen / Reuters President Joe Biden told the Israeli leaders that while the U.S. commitment to defend Israel is ironclad, the U.S. would not participate in offensive operations against Iran, a senior administration official told NBC News. U.S. officials told NBC News that Washington was concerned about Israel responding quickly without thinking through the potential fallout.\nEuropean leaders had also implored Israel to weigh its options carefully. French President Emmanuel Macron, for example, described the situation as 'unstable' and emphasized that steps should be taken to keep it from escalating.\nCourtney Kube Mosheh Gains Dan De Luce Andrea Mitchell Daniel Arkin Anna Schecter contributed.",

This is what matters.'\nIran launched hundreds of drones, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles that sought to overwhelm Israel's air defenses in the April 13 attack — the first on Israel by a foreign power since Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein launched Scud missiles at Israel in the 1991 Gulf War.\nHowever, Israeli air defenses and fighter jets, backed by the U.S., the United Kingdom and neighboring Jordan, shot down the vast majority of the incoming fire.\nSatellite images analyzed Saturday by The Associated Press showed the Iranian attack caused only minor damage at the Nevatim air base in southern Israel, including taking a chunk out of a taxiway that Israel quickly repaired.\nIran's attack came in response to a suspected Israeli strike on April 1 targeting a consular building next to the Iranian Embassy in Damascus, Syria, which killed two Guard generals and others.\n'Today, thanks to the work done by our armed forces, the Revolutionary Guard, the army, the police, each in its own way, praise be to Allah the image of the country around the world has become commendable,' added Khamenei, despite Iran facing public anger over its economy and crackdowns on dissent.\nThe Associated Press",

The officials do not expect the response to target senior Iranian officials but to instead strike shipments or storage facilities with advanced missile parts, weapons or components, that are sent from Iran to Hezbollah.\nThe U.S. does not intend to take part in the military response, the officials added. They do expect Israel to share information about the actions with Washington in advance, specifically if it could have negative repercussions for Americans in the region.\nAn Israeli official said Monday, after a meeting of Israel's war cabinet that its response to the Iranian attack may be 'imminent,' noting that decision-makers believed it was important for any response to follow in close proximity to the attack.

'There is no easy position to take for all of them, especially Jordan, which for geopolitical reasons has found itself trapped between two troublemakers — Iran and Israel.'\nAfter Iran's barrage of more than 300 missiles and drones did limited damage, as many of them were shot down by American, British, Israeli and Jordanian forces, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' on Monday that the coordinated operation was 'an extraordinary military success,' that sent 'a strong message about where Israel is in the region versus where Iran is in the region, which is increasingly isolated.'\nOnlookers and security agents stand around the debris of a missile that the Jordanian forces intercepted over Amman. Ahmad Shoura / AFP - Getty Images But there was no such boasting from America's partners in the Middle East, where even acknowledgement of the weekend's events was muted.\nOne sighting of their difficult domestic messaging came Monday, when Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told state television that the country would defend itself against any threat to its sovereignty and airspace, including from Israel.\nThose comments, echoed in foreign media interviews, were among the few public statements Jordanian officials have made about the country's role.\nIran said the salvo was retaliation for an attack on the Iranian consular building in the Syrian capital of Damascus that killed two senior commanders and five advisers from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Israel has not claimed responsibility for that attack, but it is widely believed to be responsible.\nIsrael may test Jordan's commitment in a matter of hours depending on whether and how the Jewish state decides to respond.\nAmong the three Arab states that participated in Israel's defense, Jordan is the only one that shares a border with Israel and the only one that took part in the air operation to destroy the drones.\nIn a measure of the Middle East's new realignment, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates shared with the U.S. intelligence about Iranian plans after they were briefed on them in order to safeguard their airspace, as first reported on Monday by The Wall Street Journal.\nJordan's King Abdullah speaking alongside President Biden at the White House in February. Kevin Lamarque / Reuters While the UAE normalized its diplomatic relations with Israel four years ago, Saudi Arabia was on the verge of doing so before the negotiations were derailed by Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks, which Israeli officials say claimed the lives of 1,200 people.\nBoth of the monied Gulf monarchies are 'heavily reliant on Western states,' according to Tahani Mustafa, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Belgium-based think tank. Saudi Arabia 'wants a U.S. security pact,' he said. 'Until that alliance is kind of fixed, Saudi will try to do all it can to remain in the U.S.' good books.'\nJordan's participation signaled a kind of volte-face for a state that has been unsparing in its criticism of Israel's six-month military campaign in the Gaza Strip. The country was the first to withdraw its ambassador from Israel, has repeatedly called for a cease-fire and has taken the lead on aid delivery into the besieged enclave.\nRather than signaling a newfound affection for its neighbor, Jordan's participation in the operation shows its wholesale reliance on American and Israeli diplomatic and economic support, said Rantawi of the Al Quds Center for Political Studies.\nPeople march through the streets of the Jordanian capital Amman in support of Palestinians in Gaza. Alaa Al Sukhni / Reuters Despite the fact that about half of the population are Palestinian refugees, Jordan became the second Arab country to recognize Israel in 1994. Its reliance on the wider West goes even deeper: Jordan's landscape is dotted with American, French and British military bases, and its economy is largely propped up by humanitarian and military aid.\nJordan's government also signed a 2021 defense agreement that essentially gives the American military free use of the country's land and airspace.\n'I don't think they'll have much choice than to go wherever the tide takes them,' said Mustafa, at the International Crisis Group. 'It's ultimately not up to them.'\nJordan is also eager to parry calls from right-wing Israeli lawmakers to take in more Palestinian refugees — part of a long-standing push to effectively turn Jordan into a de facto Palestinian state, she said.\nBut Jordan's participation in the American 'coalition' could still stand in the way of the government's desire to close the yawning gap between public policy and public opinion, Rantawi said, citing Jordanians' relentless criticism of Israel's war in Gaza.\nSo far, the messaging has appeared to work in all three countries. Tensions between the largely Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the UAE on the one side, and Iran, which is majority Shia, on the other, have dominated the Middle East for decades.\n'There has been a narrative going on for years that Iran is trying to destabilize Jordan,' said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy and a former official in the Palestinian Authority.\nThe ball is now very much in Israel's court. Were Israel to launch a tit-for-tat strike on Iran, it would risk further alienating public opinion among its hard-won Middle East partners, Omari said.\n'Things can become very messy if the Israelis try to retaliate over Jordanian airspace,' al-Omari said.\nMatt Bradley",

            "excerpt": "'If our votes and the votes of people who support the Palestinian human rights are so important, then Biden should be listening,\" one activist said.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — \"Outraged,\" \"point of no return\" and \"absolute disaster\" are how some Muslim American organizers have described their reactions to an aid package for Israel that is making its way through Congress for President Joe Biden to sign into law.\nMany Muslim Americans were already furious with the Biden administration over its handling of the Israel-Hamas war, with activists organizing Democrats to vote 'uncommitted\" rather than support the president in some state primaries this year.\nFor several activists and leaders of prominent Muslim American organizations, Biden's support for $26 billion in aid for Israel reaffirms their view about November's election: They cannot back Biden for a second term.\nAhead of the House's vote to pass the aid package to Israel on Saturday, Muslim American organizations urged voters to contact members of Congress to demand they vote against the aid. It ultimately passed 366-58, with 37 Democrats and 21 Republicans voting against the aid and seven members absent.\nIf Biden signs an Israel aid package, as he intends to, \"that heartless decision could mark the point of no return for what remains of the White House's relationship with the American Muslim community and other Americans opposed to the genocide in Gaza,\" said Council on American-Islamic Relations' government affairs director Robert McCaw in a statement.\n'The administration is already at its lowest point in its relationship with the American Muslim community,' McCaw said.\nFor others, it's too late.\nThe rift between the president and Muslim American voters is unlikely to be repaired \"unless the president can undo what has been done for the past six months\" in Gaza, said Osama Abu Irshaid, the executive director for Americans for Justice in Palestine Action.\nAbu Irshaid, who lives in Virginia, cast a ballot for Biden in 2020 but is not planning to vote for Biden nor former President Donald Trump in November, he said.\nMore than 33,000 people in Gaza have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Gazan health ministry. About 1,200 people in Israel were killed during the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, according to the Israeli government, and more than 240 people were taken hostage. More than 100 hostages remain in Gaza, though it is unclear how many are alive.\nThe aid package, which now heads to the Senate for likely passage next week, would mark a significant boost of U.S. support for Israel, though the U.S. has already sent weapons to the country since the start of its war with Hamas. Democratic lawmakers have been increasingly critical of arms support to Israel as well. Earlier this month, more than three dozen members of Congress — including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. — signed a letter asking the White House to \"reconsider your recent decision to authorize the transfer of a new arms package to Israel.\"\nProgressive Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., is among the lawmakers who voted against the Israel aid Friday. She said that she and her colleagues were working to \"make sure that we don't send more weapons\" to Israel as part of the aid package.\n\"Just because we authorize it doesn't mean it has to be sent immediately,\" she said.\nBiden praised the House's passage in a statement after the vote, urging the Senate to \"quickly send this package to my desk so that I can sign it into law.\"\n\"This package will deliver critical support to Israel and Ukraine; provide desperately needed humanitarian aid to Gaza, Sudan, Haiti, and other locations impacted by conflicts and natural disasters around the world; and bolster security and stability in the Indo-Pacific,\" the president said in the statement.\nIn a close election, anger at Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war could be key in swing states that the president won in 2020 by a slim margin.\nBiden flipped Michigan, which has a sizable Arab American population, winning the state by about 154,000 votes in 2020. In 2016, Trump won the state by about 11,000 votes. But during the 2024 presidential primary, more than 100,000 Michiganders cast ballots for uncommitted, many as an act of protest.\nBut the relatively tiny proportion of uncommitted delegates — just 0.008% of the Democratic delegates awarded so far — points to uncertainty about the movement's impact on the November general election. While Biden has more than 3,000 delegates, only 26 have been designated \"uncommitted.\"\nBiden also flipped Arizona in 2020 by a tight margin, beating Trump by just over 10,000 votes.\nAhmed Ewaisha, the chairman of the Arizona Muslim Alliance, said he was \"very excited\" about Biden in 2020. Now, he serves as the co-chair of the Abandon Biden campaign in the crucial swing state. Ewaisha said he's \"definitely concerned\" about Trump, adding that he \"would never, ever support Trump at all.\"\nStill, he said he wanted to vote against Biden as punishment for the president's policies toward Israel and Gaza.\nIn a statement, a Biden campaign official said that 'the President believes making your voice heard and participating in our democracy is fundamental to who we are as Americans.'\n'He shares the goal for an end to the violence and a just, lasting peace in the Middle East,' the official continued. 'He's working tirelessly to that end.'\nSeparately, a White House official pointed to the administration's numerous meetings with state, local and interfaith leaders, as well as outreach to Muslim, Arab and Palestinian communities.\nBiden administration officials have also traveled to Michigan and Illinois to meet with Arab American and Muslim community leaders.\n'White House officials have had more than 100 conversations with leaders at the local and state level concerning the conflict and humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza,' the official said.\nAyah Ziyadeh, the advocacy director for Americans for Justice in Palestine Action, said she voted for Biden in 2020 and tried \"to convince everybody to vote for him.\"\nNow, her organization is working alongside other groups on an American Muslim election task force, which she said will guide how she votes in November. The task force recommendations are expected in a month or two, she said.\nWhen criticizing Biden's response to the war, she said that she doesn't know \"that anything can change my views because I've had to watch six months of genocide against my people.\"\nAs the war progressed, Biden has increasingly sharpened his rhetoric against Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli military's tactics.\nAfter an Israeli air strike killed aid workers in Gaza, Biden said he was \"outraged and heartbroken\" and argued that \"Israel has also not done enough to protect civilians\" and aid workers.\nSimilarly, Biden expressed support for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's public rebuke of Netanyahu.\nThe New York Democrat roundly criticized Israel's prime minister and called for new elections in the country. Later, Biden said that Schumer \"made a good speech, and I think he expressed a serious concern shared not only by him but by many Americans.\"\nWhile several Muslim American organizations are critical of Biden's policies toward Israel, organizers are contemplating how their November votes could impact Trump's prospects for regaining the Oval Office.\nIn the early days of his 2016 campaign, Trump released a policy plan calling for \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\" In October of last year, he called for expanding travel bans from several Muslim-majority countries and barring potential refugees from Gaza from entering the U.S.\nHowever, several Muslim American organizers say that the onus is on Biden to regain their votes to avoid handing the election to the former president.\n\"We don't think it's on us. It's on Biden,\" Abu Irshaid said. \"If our votes and the votes of people who support the Palestinian human rights are so important, then Biden should be listening.\"\nActivist Linda Sarsour echoed his sentiments, arguing that \"trying to explain that Joe Biden is better right now during a genocide is not a talking point that lands within our communities.\"\nSarsour is the executive director of the Muslim grassroots organization MPower Change and an organizer for the campaign to vote uncommitted to protest Biden. She said she voted for the president in 2020.\n\"There is no community in this country that knows that Donald Trump is worse than we know him,\" she said, referring to the travel ban on Muslim-majority countries.\nSalam Al-Marayati, president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, voted for Biden in 2020 \"because I really care about our democracy. I saw what Trump was doing.\"\nHe said he has not yet decided how he will vote in November. His organization has not decided whether to make an endorsement for the presidential election, adding that some feel that \"it's not worth endorsing anyone.\"\n\"My concern is that you have a candidate for president who cannot do any more public events for fear of protest, who will not be able to galvanize his own party because it is fractured and is not listening to his own base in his own party,\" Al-Marayati said.\nBiden continues to do public events, although he has faced anti-war protesters interrupting his speeches. At an event in March, he conceded that pro-Palestinian protesters who interrupted his remarks \"have a point.\"\n\"We need to get a lot more care into Gaza,\" he said after the protesters, who called for care in Gaza, were escorted out.\nMegan Lebowitz",

The United Kingdom on Thursday announced sanctions against Iranian military figures and organizations, and European Union leaders also said earlier this week that they would increase sanctions against Iran.\n'Let it be clear to all those who enable or support Iran's attacks: The United States is committed to Israel's security,' Biden said. 'We are committed to the security of our personnel and partners in the region. And we will not hesitate to take all necessary action to hold you accountable.'\nThe Treasury Department on Thursday said the U.S. is targeting 16 individuals and two entities enabling Iran's drone production, including engine types that powered the unmanned aerial vehicles used in the attack over the weekend.\n'Today, in coordination with the United Kingdom and in consultation with partners and allies, we are taking swift and decisive action to respond to Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. \"We're using Treasury's economic tools to degrade and disrupt key aspects of Iran's malign activity, including its UAV program and the revenue the regime generates to support its terrorism.

            "excerpt": "Despite calls for restraint from the international community, the Israeli government has insisted for months that it intends to push a ground offensive into the city.",
            "summary": "RAFAH, Gaza Strip — An Israeli airstrike on a house in Gaza's southernmost city killed at least nine people, six of them children, hospital authorities said Saturday, as Israel pursued its nearly seven-month offensive in the besieged Palestinian territory.\nIsrael's war against the Islamic militant group Hamas has led to a dramatic escalation of tensions in an already volatile Middle East.\nThe strike late Friday hit a residential building in the western Tel Sultan neighborhood of the city of Rafah, according to Gaza's civil defense. The bodies of the six children, two women and a man were taken to Rafah's Abu Yousef al-Najjar hospital, the hospital's records showed.\nAt the hospital, relatives cried and hugged the bodies of the children, wrapped in white shrouds, as others comforted them.\nThe fatalities included Abdel-Fattah Sobhi Radwan, his wife Najlaa Ahmed Aweidah and their three children, his brother-in-law Ahmed Barhoum said. Barhoum also lost his wife, Rawan Radwan, and their 5-year-old daughter Alaa.\n'This is a world devoid of all human values and morals,' Barhoum told The Associated Press Saturday morning, crying as he cradled and gently rocked the body of Alaa in his arms. 'They bombed a house full of displaced people, women and children. There were no martyrs but women and children.'\nNo victims were registered from a second overnight strike in the city.\nRafah, which lies on the border with Egypt, currently hosts more than half of Gaza's total population of about 2.3 million people, the vast majority of whom have been displaced by fighting further north in the territory.\nDespite calls for restraint from the international community, including Israel's staunchest ally, the United States, the Israeli government has insisted for months that it intends to push a ground offensive into the city, where it says many of the remaining Hamas militants are holed up.\nSuch a ground operation has not materialized so far, but the Israeli military has repeatedly carried out airstrikes on and around the city.\nThe war was sparked by an unprecedented raid into southern Israel by Hamas and other militant groups on Oct. 7 that left about 1,200 people dead, the vast majority of them civilians, and saw about 250 people kidnapped and taken into Gaza. Israel says about 130 hostages remain in Gaza, although more than 30 have been confirmed to now be dead, either killed on Oct. 7 or having died in captivity.\nThe Gaza Health Ministry said Saturday the bodies of 37 people killed by Israeli strikes were brought to hospitals in Gaza over the past 24 hours. Hospitals also received 68 wounded, it said. The latest figures bring the overall Palestinian death toll from the Israel-Hamas war to at least 34,049, and the number of wounded to 76,901, the ministry said. Although the Hamas-run health authorities do not differentiate between combatants and civilians in their count, they say at least two thirds have been children and women.\nThe war has sent regional tensions spiraling, leading to a dramatic eruption of violence between Israel and its archenemy Iran that threatened to escalate into a full-blown war.\nOn Friday, both Iran and Israel played down an apparent Israeli airstrike near a major air base and nuclear site in central Iran, indicating the two sides were pulling back from what could have become an all-out conflict. Over the past several weeks, an alleged Israeli strike killed two Iranian generals at an Iranian consulate in Syria and was followed by an unprecedented Iranian missile barrage on Israel.\nIsrael has also faced off with the Hezbollah militant group, an Iranian proxy operating from Lebanon, with the two sides there frequently trading rocket and drone attacks across the Lebanese-Israeli border. Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels have also joined the fray, launching strikes against merchant ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in what they say is a campaign of solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza.\nTension has also been high in the occupied West Bank, where an Israeli military raid Friday in the Nur Shams refugee camp killed at least four Palestinians, including three militants, according to the Israeli military, Palestinian health officials and a militant group.\nPalestinian health authorities said one of those killed was a 15-year-old boy shot dead by Israeli fire. The Islamic Jihad militant group confirmed the deaths of three members, including one who it said was a local military commander. The Israeli military said four Israeli soldiers were slightly wounded in the operation.\nSaraya al-Quds, the military arm of Islamic Jihad, said its fighters had engaged in heavy gun battles Saturday morning with Israeli forces in the town of Tulkarem, adjacent to Nur Shams. No further details were immediately available. Residents in Tulkarem went went on a general strike Saturday to protest the attack on Nur Shams, with shops, restaurants and government offices all closed.\nSince the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel, more than 460 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank, Palestinian health officials say. Israel stages frequent raids into towns and cities in the volatile territory. The dead have included militants, but also stone-throwers and bystanders. Some have also been killed in attacks by Israeli settlers.\nThe Associated Press",

            "summary": "A suspected Iranian spy ship appears to be sailing home after nearly three years at sea — a move that comes as the world awaits Israel's response to Tehran's retaliatory attack.\nThe return of the MV Behshad, a cargo ship which U.S. analysts and officials suspect may have provided information and targeting assistance to Houthi rebels in the Red Sea, would remove one possible high-profile target for any Israeli strikes.\nIran has previously warned against targeting the ship, and in a sign of the heightened tensions over possible Israeli targets, a senior Iranian commander warned Thursday that the country could review its nuclear doctrine.\n'If Israel wants to use the threat of attacking nuclear centers to put pressure on Iran, It is likely that the nuclear doctrine and policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran will be reviewed and the considerations announced previously will be cancelled,' Ahmad Haghtalab, the IRGC commander in charge of nuclear security, was quoted as saying by the country's semi-official Tasnim news agency.\nSailing home The Behshad crossed from the Arabian Gulf into the Persian Gulf early Thursday morning, and was due to arrive later this evening at the port of Bandar Abbas on Iran's southern coast, according to ship tracking website MarineTraffic.com. Data provided to the website via the automated identification system of the Behshad said that it had been at sea since June 18, 2021.\nNBC News previously reported that the Behshad had spent a long time at sea, lingering in almost the same spot in the Red Sea between Yemen and Eritrea since Jan. 2023. By Jan. 11 of this year, it had moved to a location near the entrance to the Red Sea, a choke point known as Bab al-Mandeb strait — or 'the Gate of Grief' — according to the ship tracker.\nLater, in February, the Behshad traveled south into the Gulf of Aden and docked off the coast of a Chinese military base in Djibouti, east Africa. The Behshad could be seen in this location on ship tracking websites until the end of March, when it then disappeared from view. It did not reappear until early April, this time sailing close to the coast of Iran in the Gulf of Oman, before passing through the Strait of Hormuz on Wednesday, the ship tracking site showed.\nBloomberg News first reported the ship's return.\nThe Iranian ship had provided electronic intelligence to the Yemen-based Houthis, enabling them to spot and target vessels in the Red Sea region, according to a U.S. official, a U.S. congressional aide with knowledge of the matter and a Middle Eastern official.\nAnalysis by NBC News and several other experts showed that the Behshad was several miles away as Houthi rebels carried out a number of attacks on commercial vessels which created ship diversions and delays in the global supply chain.\nOn April 7 Houthi leaders said they had targeted British and U.S. ships in the Red Sea, while in the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean it had attacked two Israeli vessels heading to port in Israel.\nThe Iranian military warned against any strikes on the Behshad in a video posted to Telegram in February, with a narrator describing the ship as a 'floating armory,' and saying that any aggression towards the ship would 'jeopardize international maritime routes [and] security.'\nThe Behshad's return home comes as Israel weighs how to respond to Iran's launching of more than 300 drones and missiles at the country over the weekend, which Tehran said was in response to the April 1 bombing of an Iranian consular building in Damascus that killed two generals and five officers in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.\nThe U.S. and its allies have been urging Israel not to escalate further, hoping to avoid all-out war in the region. If Israel does respond militarily, it could target Iran itself or choose a less direct option which may prevent the situation spiraling.\n'The ship is likely viewed as one of the targets Israel may hit in the future,' said Michael Horowitz, the head of intelligence at Le Beck International, a security and risk management consultancy, in a post on X.\nThe Behshad has been on its current deployment since 2021, replacing the MV Saviz, another cargo ship which was suspected of being used by the IRGC, and which was anchored for years off the coast of Yemen before it was damaged in an attack Iran alleged was carried out by Israel.\nMatthew Mulligan",

            "summary": "Demonstrators protesting the war in Gaza shut down San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge for around five hours Monday, as protests were also held in other cities in the U.S.\nDemonstrators on the famous bridge held a sign that read 'stop the world for Gaza' in capital letters. They used vehicles and chained themselves together to block travel lanes on the bridge, the California Highway Patrol said, adding that around 20 people were arrested.\nNBC Bay Area reported that the bridge was closed for around five hours and that the traffic there was blocked beginning at around 7:30 a.m. The bridge reopened at around 12:15 p.m., the CHP said.\nIt's not the first time pro-Palestinian protesters blocked traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge in an attempt to draw attention to the war and their cause. A group blocked traffic on the span in February, calling for a cease-fire and demanding the United States stop supplying weapons to Israel.\nOn Interstate 880 in Oakland, California, protesters chained themselves to 55-gallon drums filled with cement, according to the CHP.\n'They are actively working to remove these individuals and lanes will be reopened,' the CHP said in a statement. 'These individuals will be arrested.'\nIn Chicago, around 40 people were arrested at O'Hare International Airport after a group of protesters obstructed traffic, police said.\n'Stop sending bombs,' read the stop sign-like badges on the chests of protesters who blocked the expressway leading to O'Hare by connecting themselves to each others with pipes over their arms.\nThe group Chicago Dissenters said the protest date was picked to coincide with the April 15 tax filing deadline.\n'O'Hare International Airport is one of the largest in the country, and there will be NO business as usual while Palestinians suffer at the hands of American funded bombing by Israel,' the group wrote on social media.\nNew York City police said they were making arrests after protesters there blocked traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge.\nIn Seattle, an expressway leading to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport was also blocked, airport authorities there said.\nThe Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, and Israel's subsequent war against the group in Gaza, has inflamed passions in the United States and in other parts of the world.\nMore than 30,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of civilians, according to health officials there. More than 1,200 people in Israel were killed in the Hamas attacks, and hostages were also taken.\nPhil Helsel",

            "excerpt": "Out of more than 300 missiles and drones Iran fired, only four or five hit Israel, and none caused major damage, William Burns said.",
            "summary": "Iran's missile and drone barrage against Israel last weekend 'turned out to be a spectacular failure,' with nearly all of the projectiles failing to hit Israel, CIA Director William Burns said Thursday.\nSpeaking at an event at the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas, Burns said that the thwarting of the missile and drone assault showed the strength of Israel's military and that it had 'friends' in the world, including the U.S. and other countries that helped, as well.\n'The Iranians fired off something like 330 drones and missiles combined,' Burns said. 'Of those 330 missiles, only four or five actually impacted in Israel, and none of them did any significant damage.\n'It's a reminder of the quality of the Israeli military,' he added. 'It's a reminder of the fact that the Israelis have friends starting with the United States, but others, as well.'\nPresident Joe Biden and other senior U.S. officials hope tensions may ease slightly in the region but said Israel was still weighing how it would respond to Tehran.\nThe Israeli government, 'as we sit here this afternoon, is considering a response to what happened last Saturday night,' Burns said.\n'I think the broad hope of the president and policymakers in the administration is that we'll find a way to de-escalate the situation,' he said.\nAmmunition shortages in Ukraine Burns, a former career diplomat who was ambassador to Russia, said he had visited Ukraine about a month ago and heard firsthand from Ukrainian military officers about their critical ammunition shortages.\nBurns said he was in Ukraine just days after Russian forces captured the town of Adiivka in eastern Ukraine.\n'I talked to one of the senior officers who was there, and he described it in pretty simple terms,' Burns said. 'He said, ‘We fought as long and as hard as we could, but the Russians just kept coming, and we ran out of ammunition.''\nHe said a 2,000-strong Ukrainian brigade in the Adiivka battle tried to fend off Russians with 'a grand total' of 15 artillery rounds a day and 42 mortar rounds.\n'They were overwhelmed, but it wasn't for lack of bravery or determination on their part,' Burns said.\nHe said he feared there would be more battlefield losses in Ukraine unless Congress approved a long-delayed military aid package.\nSleepless night Asked what kept him up at night, Burns mentioned the threat of terrorist attacks, the war in Ukraine, the conflict in Gaza and the risks posed to CIA employees around the world.\nBut he also recounted an experience that literally kept him up all night when he agreed to attend a training session for new CIA clandestine officers at the agency's training ground, known as 'The Farm,' near Williamsburg, Virginia.\nThe overnight instructional course, which included members of the Army's elite Delta Force, featured a training exercise in which CIA colleagues had been taken 'hostage.'\nBut no one told the trainees or the Delta Force commandos that the role player posing as a 'hostage' for the exercise was Burns himself, who had been tied to a chair for the simulation, he said.\n'It's, like, 4:30 in the morning, and this exercise culminates with a hostage rescue mission by Delta group,' Burns said. The Delta Force 'major who was commanding it had only been told that there's this simulated situation where there are some CIA officers with someone impersonating a senior CIA officer. They've been captured and they're held hostage,' Burns said.\n'So it's worth the price of admission to see the look on the face of that young major as he came up the stairs in this hostage rescue effort and saw a real live CIA director tied to a chair,' he said.\nDan De Luce",

            "excerpt": "The uncertainty has undermined international efforts to negotiate a cease-fire deal and the release of at least some of the hostages, U.S. and Israeli officials said.",
            "summary": "More than six months since Hamas militants attacked Israel and seized more than 250 hostages, it remains unclear exactly how many of the captives are still alive in Gaza, according to U.S. and Israeli officials.\nThe uncertainty has caused anguish among the families of those held in Gaza and undermined international efforts to negotiate a cease-fire deal and the release of at least some of the hostages, the officials told NBC News.\nA proposed cease-fire formula calls for Hamas to free 40 hostages who are women, children or sick and elderly men, and in return, Israel would release possibly hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. But Hamas so far has been unable to confirm it has identified 40 hostages who meet those criteria, and that has bogged down the negotiations, U.S., Israeli and Western officials said.\nIn November, more than 100 hostages were released as part of a four-day pause in the fighting in Gaza. Israel says more than 130 hostages remain, and about a quarter of those are believed dead.\nFar fewer hostages may be alive than is publicly known, but it is difficult to say for certain, given there has been limited visibility into the locations and conditions of some of the hostages, U.S. officials said.\nAsked whether there was a firm estimate of how many hostages remained alive, a former senior Israeli official said: 'Not at all. No one reliable has this information. It's all speculation.'\nU.S. officials accused Hamas of making demands that it knows are unobtainable.\n\"Hamas' refusal to accept a hostage-cease-fire deal shows their disregard for the lives of the Palestinian people,\" a senior Biden administration official said Wednesday. \"They started this war and seem to be perfectly fine with this conflict continuing.\"\nAn Israeli official said, 'Hamas is dragging its feet, is not interested in a deal and continues to hope for a regional escalation, which is why the negotiations remain stalled.'\nHamas said in a statement Saturday it was prepared to sign on to a 'serious and true' deal but renewed its demand for a permanent cease-fire and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops.\nAccording to Qatar's prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, whose country has acted as an intermediary for the hostage-cease-fire talks along with Egypt and the U.S., the talks have hit a 'stumbling block.'\n'We are passing through a delicate phase with some stumbling,' he said at a news conference Wednesday, without elaborating. 'We are trying as much as possible to address this stumbling block and to move forward.'\nA relative of one of the several Americans believed to be held in Gaza said families are in the dark about the fates of their loved ones: 'For 185 days, we have received no verification of life of any of these hostages — absent a limited number of videos released early on by the Hamas terrorists.'\nThe family member, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid putting their loved one's fate at risk, said that Israeli security has shown Americans who have traveled to Israel and met with Israel's security forces that they know where many of the hostages are but that the captives are constantly being moved.\n'Every day they are there, we also know that they could die of starvation, illness, injury or murder,' the relative said.\nThe Biden administration is working under the assumption that five U.S. hostages are still alive and unaccounted for, a U.S. official said. But Washington has better visibility into the locations and conditions of some hostages than others, making it difficult to say with any certainty that all five remain alive.\nBeyond the five, the U.S. believes Hamas is holding several more bodies of Americans believed to have been taken into Gaza after they were killed in the militants' Oct. 7 assault on Israel or shortly thereafter.\nIsraeli troops have searched hospitals, tunnels and even graveyards in Gaza for hostages or their remains. In February, an Israeli raid in Rafah in southern Gaza rescued two hostages.\nAviva Siegel, who spent 51 days as a hostage in Gaza until she was released as part of the November deal, said her experience in captivity was a terrifying nightmare.\n'For 186 days I was there. I was treated like I'm nothing. I didn't have any human rights. We weren't allowed to talk. We weren't allowed to even stand,' Siegel told NBC News' Andrea Mitchell last week.\n'They used to starve us and eat in front of us. They used to drink water, and we begged them for water. They used to sometimes bring us just a little bit of water and say that's the water until tomorrow at 5 o'clock. So we used to have one sip every couple of hours, each of us.\"\nHer husband, Keith, of North Carolina, remains captive.\nDan De Luce Peter Alexander Monica Alba Anna Schecter",

Today, the search continues for five more alternate jurors. And then the first week of the former president's criminal trial will come to a close. Looking back, the ways Trump tried to control the narrative are clear. On Monday, Trump stood in front of reporters ready to unleash a grievance-laced tirade that, at times, did not totally reflect reality. He fixated on Judge Juan Merchan's decision to not yet rule on whether Trump can attend his son Barron's high school graduation next month. The key words to keep in mind are 'not yet.'\nBut Trump painted a picture for his supporters of a biased judge blocking a loving father from seeing his son's graduation. The disdain toward Merchan from Trump's supporters was swift.\nThen there were arguments about whether Trump fell asleep at one point and about jury selection rules. Those sorts of distortions and fights about nearly every aspect of the trial dominated the first week — and earned him $1.6 million in small-dollar donations.

Ilhan Omar's daughter, pictured above — were arrested yesterday at a pro-Palestinian protest at New York's Columbia University after school officials voiced concerns about demonstrators violating campus policies. The protests grew throughout the afternoon and eventually, more than 500 students entered the quad area, according to NYPD Commissioner Edward Cuban. The students who were arrested did not resist and said what they wanted to say 'in a peaceful manner,' Cuban said.\nThe demonstration came a day after Columbia President Nemat 'Minouche' Shafik attended a congressional hearing about antisemitism and faced questioning by Rep. Omar and other lawmakers about on-campus demonstrations.

Inside a convention for a far-right sheriffs movement Conspiracy theorists, felons and election deniers flocked to a Las Vegas hotel. They were there to attend a far-right sheriffs convention, where discussions centered around their belief in encroaching federal power and rampant voter fraud, despite a lack of evidence. The event by the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, or CSPOA, included a lackluster Pledge of Allegiance, a smooth jazz rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" disgruntled former politicians and a pizza party. Only a few actual sheriffs attended.\nMark Abramson for NBC News CSPOA, which sees sheriffs as more powerful than the federal government, used the event to set a course for the coming election. The conference's low attendance indicates just how fringe the group's ideas are, but critics fear the organization's focus on U.S. elections will nonetheless legitimize disinformation.\nSenior reporter Brandy Zadrozny was at the annual meeting, where she listened to speakers (and their conspiracy theories) and talked to a few attendees.

Staff Pick: A regional reproductive care void on both sides of the border A growing number of American women are seeking abortion care in Mexico, and they're navigating a medley of laws that, like the U.S., vary according to Mexico's different states.

What we found is that most Mexican border states ban elective abortions, despite a Supreme Court ruling last year that decriminalized the procedure nationwide. Add Arizona's recent ruling on an 1864 law that will ban most abortions in the state, and women on both sides of the border could soon find themselves in a remote and politicized region with little reproductive care. — Isabela Espadas Barros Leal, associate editor\ndug into some of these laws.

            "summary": "RAFAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah overnight killed 18 people, including 14 children, health officials said Sunday, as the United States was on track to approve billions of dollars of additional military aid to its close ally.\nIsrael has carried out near-daily air raids on Rafah, where more than half of Gaza's population of 2.3 million has sought refuge from fighting elsewhere. It has also vowed to expand its ground offensive to the city on the border with Egypt despite international calls for restraint, including from the U.S.\nThe House of Representatives approved a $26 billion aid package on Saturday that includes around $9 billion in humanitarian assistance for Gaza.\nThe first strike killed a man, his wife and their 3-year-old child, according to the nearby Kuwaiti Hospital, which received the bodies. The woman was pregnant, and the doctors managed to save the baby, the hospital said.\nThe second strike killed 13 children and two women, all from the same family, according to hospital records. An airstrike in Rafah the night before killed nine people, including six children.\nThe Israel-Hamas war has killed over 34,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, devastated Gaza's two largest cities and left a swath of destruction across the territory. Around 80% of the population have fled their homes to other parts of the besieged coastal enclave, which experts say is on the brink of famine.\nThe conflict, now in its seventh month, has sparked regional unrest pitting Israel and the U.S. against Iran and allied militant groups across the Middle East. Israel and Iran traded fire directly earlier this month, raising fears of all-out war between the longtime foes.\nTensions have also spiked in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The Israeli military said troops 'neutralized' two Palestinians who attacked a checkpoint with a knife and a gun near the southern West Bank town of Hebron early Sunday. It was not immediately clear if they were killed. No Israeli forces were wounded.\nAt least 469 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers and settlers in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Most have been killed during Israeli military arrest raids, which often trigger gunbattles, or in violent protests.\nThe war in Gaza was sparked by an unprecedented Oct. 7 raid into southern Israel in which Hamas and other militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250 hostages. Israel says militants are still holding around 100 hostages and the remains of more than 30 others.\nThousands of Israelis have taken to the streets to call for new elections to replace Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a deal with Hamas to release the hostages. Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war until Hamas is destroyed and all the hostages are returned.\nThe war has killed at least 34,049 Palestinians and wounded another 76,901, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between combatants and civilians in its count but says at least two-thirds have been children and women. It also says the real toll is likely higher as many bodies are stuck beneath the rubble left by airstrikes or are in areas that are unreachable for medics.\nIsrael blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the militants fight in dense, residential neighborhoods, but the military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The military says it has killed over 13,000 Hamas fighters, without providing evidence.\nThe Associated Press",

            "summary": "Scooter Braun, the high-profile music manager, helped bring the exhibit to the U.S. from Tel Aviv, where it was available to the public late last year as Israel reeled from the killings of more than 1,200 people. In an interview, Braun said he was deeply moved after having traveled to Israel, visited the kibbutzim where civilians were slaughtered and spent time with young Nova festival survivors.\n'I saw these 20-year-old kids singing and crying and laughing together and holding each other,' Braun said. 'I felt this sense of anger. How could we ignore them? … I felt like we were letting them down.' (The proceeds from the exhibition will go to Nova Healing Journey, an initiative that supports mental health treatment for Oct. 7 victims and their families.)\nThe ambitious installation arrives in the U.S. at an especially fraught chapter in the Israel-Hamas war.\nIsrael's military campaign has devastated Gaza, killing more than 33,000 people and fueling a humanitarian crisis. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has become increasingly isolated on the global stage over its military actions. Netanyahu's war Cabinet is weighing how to respond to Iran's retaliatory drone and missile attacks on Israel, an unprecedented incursion that raised fears of a wider regional conflagration.\nBraun, the grandchild of Holocaust survivors who were imprisoned at Nazi concentration camps, said he hopes people who visit the exhibit leave with 'empathy' for everyone whose lives have been violently upended by the Middle East conflict: the Israeli victims of Oct. 7, the families of people kidnapped by Hamas militants, the 'innocent people in Gaza' who have been under siege for more than six months.\nThe exhibit's organizers were nonetheless bracing for possible protests by pro-Palestinian activists, who have rallied in major cities in opposition to Israel's conduct and the Biden administration's support for Netanyahu's government. Braun said he hopes organizers will be able to transport the Nova installation to other cities across the U.S., though for the time being he is focused on the New York installation.\nCamping items taken from the festival re-create the festival layout. Alexi Rosenfeld / Getty Images for The Nova Music Festival Exhibition The version of 'The Moment Music Stood Still' on display in Manhattan re-creates the Nova grounds in haunting detail. The floors of the venue are coated in dirt. Trees are affixed to the ground with sandbags. The festival's main stage and DJ booth are bathed in neon light. In keeping with the exhibit's name, the rooms feel frozen in time, caught between ecstasy and terror.\nIn the corner of one room, visitors can see 'Lost and Found' tables crammed with personal belongings found in the desert, many of them stored in small plastic bags: watches, car keys, glasses, purses. The rows of shoes recall a similar display at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., symbolizing the 6 million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust.\nIn a joint interview with NBC News, three of the festival attack survivors described their harrowing ordeals, recalling the frantic hours as they scrambled to reach their loved ones, flee the hail of bullets and hide from the Hamas attackers. Ofir Amar, 40, said he hopes the exhibit remains in keeping with the spirit of the Nova festival — a celebration of 'life, freedom, peace.'\n'You can feel it no matter where you come from,' Amar said. 'It's when we are on the same ground and listening to the same music, we are all the same. It doesn't matter where you're from, what religion, what color, what country. We are the same.'\nDaniel Arkin Chloe Melas",

'European skies could have received the same level of protection long ago if Ukraine had received similar full support from its partners in intercepting drones and missiles,'\n'We can now see how unity can work,' Zelenskyy added.\nBut the U.S. and its Western partners have made clear their reluctance to go as far in Ukraine as they did in the Middle East.\n'U.S. and NATO have been adamant that they will not get into conflict with Russia,' said Frank Ledwidge, a former British military intelligence officer and senior lecturer in war studies at England's University of Portsmouth.\n'Nobody wants to get involved fighting Russia,\" he said.\nA NATO conflict with Russia would be a 'dangerous escalation,' Britain's foreign secretary David Cameron told radio station LBC on Monday, saying it was vital to prevent a 'wider European war.'\nWhen asked why British forces could not shoot down Russian unmanned drones just as they had to support Israel, he said it was an 'interesting question,' adding that Ukraine must be armed with air defense systems which are more effective than jets.\nPresident Joe Biden has also made it clear that the U.S. will not take on a combat role in Ukraine, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Monday. 'Different conflicts, different airspace, different threat picture,' Kirby said.\nThat will offer little comfort to Ukraine, which increasingly fears it could face defeat this year.\nAn emerging focal point is Kharkiv, where the impact of Western air defenses, or the lack thereof, may be felt the most.",

            "summary": "LOS ANGELES — Following the publicized decision to cancel a commencement speech by a Muslim valedictorian, the University of Southern California said Friday it will have no outside speakers or honorees at the main stage commencement event.\n'Given the highly publicized circumstances surrounding our main-stage commencement program, university leadership has decided it is best to release our outside speakers and honorees from attending this year's ceremony,' USC said in a statement.\nThe decision comes after the Los Angeles university was criticized by some, including valedictorian Asna Tabassum, over its decision to cancel Tabassum's speech due to security concerns.\n'Crazy Rich Asians\" and 'Wicked' film director Jon M. Chu, an alumnus of USC, was to give the keynote commencement address and was to receive an honorary degree, the university had announced. Tennis star Billie Jean King was among those to get an honorary degree.\nTabassum, a major in biomedical engineering and a minor in resistance to genocide, said she was shocked and disappointed.\nShe said that she felt abandoned by USC and that the university was 'caving to fear and rewarding hatred.'\nAt least two pro-Israel and Jewish groups complained to USC about the choice of Tabassum as valedictorian, pointing to her Instagram account, which links to a slideshow encouraging people to 'learn about what's happening in palestine, and how to help.'\nIt calls for 'one palestinian state,' which it says 'would mean palestinian liberation, and the complete abolishment of the state of israel.'\nTabassum has she said added the link on her social media account five years ago and was not the author, according to NBC Los Angeles.\nThe Muslim advocacy group Council on American-Islamic Relations was among those that condemned USC's decision to cancel her speech.\nProtests have been held both on and off college campuses across the United States following the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas against Israel, where more than 1,200 people were killed, and Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza that health authorities there say have killed more than 30,000 people.\nUSC said Friday that those who were to receive honorary degrees will hopefully be awarded them at a future commencement or other academic event.\nTabassum said that she \"was hoping to use my commencement speech to inspire my classmates with a message of hope.\"\nShe said in a statement that she is imploring students at USC \"to work towards a world where cries for equality and human dignity are not manipulated to be expressions of hatred.\"\nThe May 10 commencement event, which will celebrate 19,000-plus graduates, is expected to draw around 65,000 people to the campus in the University Park section of Los Angeles, according to USC.\nGuest speakers and honorees were cut from the university's main-stage commencement, which is for everyone. The schools of USC also have their own commencement events.\nPhil Helsel",

            "excerpt": "Some students questioned the university's reasoning for canceling Asna Tabassum's commencement address.",
            "summary": "LOS ANGELES — Some students at the University of Southern California said their sense of pride was dashed this week when the school canceled Muslim student Asna Tabassum's valedictorian speech out of security concerns.\nThey said the announcement of Tabassum's selection as valedictorian this month made them feel seen and heard.\n'It showed me that our people have a voice on campus,' said USC student Abdullah Khlefat, who is Muslim.\nAnother student, named Layan, who asked that her last name not be used because she was afraid of being harassed for speaking out, said the announcement had brightened her outlook about the future.\n'For a sliver of a moment, I had a sense of hope. I felt like one day I could be like Asna,' said Layan, a first-year student majoring in political science.\nThose dreams were crushed when USC Provost Andrew Guzman rescinded Tabassum's invitation to speak at graduation, citing security concerns over tensions related to 'the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.\"\nHe said in an announcement Monday that 'over the past several days, discussion relating to the selection of our valedictorian has taken on an alarming tenor.'\n'The intensity of feelings, fueled by both social media and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, has grown to include many voices outside of USC and has escalated to the point of creating substantial risks relating to security and disruption at commencement,' the announcement read in part.\nUniversity officials did not respond to a request for details about threats the school may have received since the announcement or whether Tabassum had been made aware of them.\nFirst-year student Danica Gonzalez, who supports Tabassum as valedictorian, said she believes the university is using security as pretext. She pointed to last year's commencement, which former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, attended when their daughter Sasha graduated.\n\"There is no way the university can't protect her,\" Gonzalez said of Tabassum. \"It's just that they're choosing not to.\"\nAfter Tabassum was selected as valedictorian, at least two pro-Israel and Jewish groups complained to USC about the choice. They pointed to her social media activity, including her Instagram account, which links to a slideshow encouraging people to 'learn about what's happening in palestine, and how to help.'\nIt calls for 'one palestinian state,' which it says 'would mean palestinian liberation, and the complete abolishment of the state of israel.'\nBrandon Tavakoli, president of Trojans for Israel, called Tabassum's post 'antisemitic.'\n'The university has to make the decision about whether this valedictorian and her propagation of antisemitic vitriol online is worthy of being the representative of the class of 2024,' he told NBC News. 'Commencement is supposed to be an inclusive and welcoming space for all students, including Jewish graduates and their families.'\nTrojans for Israel said in a statement on Instagram that university officials failed to vet Tabassum's social media posts and condemn what it described as antisemitic content.\n\"We call on the University to speak with more moral clarity and hold our esteemed leaders to the highest standards of University standards,\" the statement read in part.\nThe recent controversy at USC underscores rising tensions across college campuses since the Israel-Hamas war started on Oct. 7.\nLast week, a University of California, Berkeley, professor confronted a Muslim student during a dinner for graduating law students, an incident that was recorded on video and triggered an outpouring of anger and frustration from both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel groups.\nEarlier this month, 20 students at Pomona College in Southern California were arrested after they stormed and occupied the college president's office.\nAt Columbia University in New York, several students were suspended this month after they hosted an unsanctioned event on campus featuring a speaker linked to a terrorist organization.\nTensions at USC reached a boiling point this month after Tabassum was selected as valedictorian, Gonzalez said. Students who disagreed with Tabassum's support for the Palestinian cause berated her on social media, and her supporters used those same platforms to defend her and denounce the school when her speech was canceled.\n\"It's been very jarring,\" Gonzalez said. \"It feels like the university is just trying to protect its image.\"\nTabassum was born in the Southern California community of Chino Hills and majored in biomedical engineering with a minor in resistance to genocide, which included studying how technology, immigration and literacy play roles in the type of medical care people receive, according to a statement USC released when she was named valedictorian.\nLayan, who was born in Syria and moved to the U.S. in the fifth grade, described Tabassum as a mentor and a role model.\n'She wears a hijab, and I wear a hijab and am also Muslim,' Layan said. 'I feel so connected to her.'\nLayan first met Tabassum at the Muslim Student Union this year, she said. Tabassum introduced herself and swapped phone numbers with Layan, promising to keep her updated on events where Layan could meet new people.\n'She is genuinely such a sweet person. I just know from the bottom of my heart she wouldn't wish violence on anyone,' Layan said.\nIn a statement, Tabassum said the university's decision is thinly veiled racism.\n'Although this should have been a time of celebration for my family, friends, professors, and classmates, anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian voices have subjected me to a campaign of racist hatred because of my uncompromising belief in human rights for all,' she said.\nAlicia Victoria Lozano",

She is a major in biomedical engineering and a minor in resistance to genocide.\nTabassum said that in her studies and in her life, she 'learned that ordinary people are capable of unspeakable acts of violence when they are taught hate fueled by fear.'\n'And due to widespread fear, I was hoping to use my commencement speech to inspire my classmates with a message of hope,' she said. 'By canceling my speech, USC is only caving to fear and rewarding hatred.'\nTabassum was selected by a committee out of almost 100 applicants for valedictorian, who applied based on their 'perfect or near-perfect GPAs,' Guzman said.\n'The committee assessed each application based on various criteria — which did not include social media presence — and made a recommendation to me,' the provost continued. 'Based on these faculty recommendations, I made the final decision.'\nTabassum in her statement also claimed that in a meeting Sunday, 'I asked about the alleged safety concerns and was told that the University had the resources to take appropriate safety measures for my valedictory speech, but that they would not be doing so since increased security protections is not what the University wants to ‘present as an image.''\nA university spokesperson said of the claim: 'It's not accurate.'\nThe Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas against Israel, and the war Israel has waged against Hamas in Gaza as a response, have generated strong feelings on college campuses across the country, including allegations of antisemitism and Islamophobia.\nGuzman, in his announcement about the change, did not single out any website or side of the conflict in saying that the valedictorian would not give a speech as originally planned.\nHe wrote that there has been harassment and even violence on other campuses, and he denied the issue had anything to do with freedom of speech.\n'There is no free-speech entitlement to speak at a commencement,' he wrote. 'The issue here is how best to maintain campus security and safety, period.'\nCanceling the speech is 'disappointing,' he said, but 'tradition must give way to safety.'\nThe Los Angeles chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, condemned the cancellation.\n'USC cannot hide its cowardly decision behind a disingenuous concern for ‘security,'' CAIR-LA Executive Director Hussam Ayloush said in a statement.\n'The dishonest and defamatory attacks on Asna are nothing more than thinly-veiled manifestations of Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian racism, which have been weaponized against college students across the country who speak up for human rights — and for Palestinian humanity,' Ayloush said.\nThe commencement event will celebrate 19,000-plus graduates and is expected to draw around 65,000 people to the campus in the University Park section of Los Angeles, according to USC.\nPhil Helsel",

            "excerpt": "Columbia's president said school leaders would be coming together to discuss a way to bring an end to 'this crisis.'",
            "summary": "A growing number of leaders and organizations have called on Columbia University and its president to protect students amid reports of antisemitic and offensive statements and actions on its campus, which has been the site this week of a pro-Palestinian encampment and protest.\nThe protest and encampment on campus has drawn attention to the right of free speech and the rights of students to feel safe from violence, with a campus rabbi recommending Jewish students return home for their own safety.\nEarly Monday, Columbia President Nemat 'Minouche' Shafik said classes would be held virtually Monday, and said school leaders would be coming together to discuss a way to bring an end to 'this crisis.'\nIn a statement to the university community, Shafik said she was 'saddened' by the events on campus, and denounced antisemitic language and harassing behavior.\n'The decibel of our disagreements has only increased in recent days. These tensions have been exploited and amplified by individuals who are not affiliated with Columbia who have come to campus to pursue their own agendas,' she said. 'We need a reset.'\nShafik's announcement followed mounting calls for action.\nIn a letter shared on social media Sunday, Chabad at Columbia said students have had offensive rhetoric hurled at them, including being told to 'go back to Poland' and 'stop killing children.'\nWhite House Press Secretary Andrew Bates said in a statement Sunday that protesters in and around Columbia cross the line if they say violence should befall Jewish students.\n'While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous — they have absolutely no place on any college campus, or anywhere in the United States of America,' he said.\n'Echoing the rhetoric of terrorist organizations, especially in the wake of the worst massacre committed against the Jewish people since the Holocaust, is despicable,\" Bates continued, referring to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, where 1,200 were killed.\nPro-Palestinian activists face police as they protest outside of Columbia University in New York City on Thursday. Spencer Platt / Getty Images Protesters have decried Israel's bombardment of Gaza, which has displaced over 75% of the estimated 2.3 million people in the enclave and killed over 34,000 people there, according to Gaza health officials. They have also called on Columbia to divest from companies connected to Israel.\nSunday night, one of the groups at the center of campus protests, Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine, released a statement on social media platform X seeking to distance its participants from unlawful agitators and imagery that would cast the movement to end attacks on civilians in Gaza as one of violence.\nThe group called some of those getting attention for threats and aggression 'inflammatory individuals who do not represent us,\" and said its members 'have been misidentified by a politically motivated mob.'\n'We firmly reject any form of hate or bigotry,\" the statement said.\nSafety concerns In a letter to Jewish students earlier Sunday, rabbi Elie Buechler of the Columbia/Barnard Hillel and Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, recommended they return home and stay there, saying it was clear the university and city police 'cannot guarantee Jewish students' safety in the face of extreme antisemitism and anarchy.' Buechler declined requests for an interview.\nThe Columbia Jewish Alumni Association on Sunday sent a letter to Shafik noting the rabbi's concerns and claiming that the environment on campus has been hostile for Jewish students, including those it claims have been 'openly threatened and harassed.'\nAlleging lax enforcement, the group urged Columbia to 'enforce the university rules with regard to protests and harassment and restore order and safety on campus.'\nStudent Nicholas Baum, a freshman, said he's weighing the rabbi's invitation to leave.\n'I feel disturbed but I feel it is completely indicative of the horrible disturbances that Jews on campus have been feeling,' he said. 'As a Jew, I no longer feel welcome on campus. I no longer feel safe on campus.'\nAt the same time, he joined a counterargument gaining volume: Staying put is a statement of strength. 'It would only appease campus protesters who call supporters of Israel Zionists who are not welcome at Columbia,' Baum said.\nColumbia senior Sonya Pozansky said protests on campus have been transformed from political statements to 'incitement to violence and Jew hatred.'\nPro-Palestinian supporters protest outside of Columbia University in New York on Saturday. Steve Sanchez / Sipa USA via AP Columbia/Barnard Hillel said in a post on social media platform X that it doesn't believe Jewish students should have to leave, but the university and city should do more to protect students.\nIt said in a letter Sunday night, it said Columbia 'must put an end to the on-campus protests that violate the University's events policies. Off-campus protests need to be moved if the protestors will not end their harassment of students.'\nColumbia on Sunday responded to concerns with a plan to beef-up security. It includes the hiring of 111 additional security personnel, improved ID checks, extra security during Passover, which begins Monday, and heightened security around the perimeter of campus, the university's office of the chief operating officer said in a letter to the campus community.\nColumbia said through a spokesperson earlier Sunday that students have a right to protest 'but they are not allowed to disrupt campus life or harass and intimidate fellow students and members of our community.'\n'We are acting on concerns we are hearing from our Jewish students and are providing additional support and resources to ensure that our community remains safe,' the spokesperson said.\nArrests on campus On Thursday, 113 people were arrested after Shafik sent a letter to New York police requesting its help to break up the encampment that had been set up on campus in support of Gaza.\nShafik said in the letter to police that the group was violating university rules and that the encampment 'and related disruptions pose a clear and present danger to the substantial functioning of the University.\" In a news conference about the arrests, police described those arrested as peaceful, and said they offered no resistance.\nColumbia student Maryam Alwan, who helped organize the pro-Palestinian protest and was suspended and arrested, told MSNBC's Ayman Mohyeldin, 'It feels like it's part of a repressive campaign against pro-Palestine advocacy that has been going on for months now.'\nShe added, 'We are being criminalized on our own campus.'\nAlso arrested was Isra Hirsi, daughter of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who said she was suspended from Barnard College. Hirsi said the encampment has been community-centered, with students taking meals and praying together.\nU.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who grilled Shafik at a congressional hearing last week over antisemitism on campus, said Sunday that Shafik's response to the rhetoric has been ineffective, and called on the university president to resign.\nSen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who has been unwaveringly pro-Israel, slammed the protests on Columbia's campus and said he agreed with the White House, calling the protests 'antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous.' He also called on Shafik to 'do your job or resign.'\nVideo shared on social media captured a protester Saturday holding a sign that said 'Al-Qassam's next targets,' referring to Hamas' military wing. An arrow on the sign pointed up to counter-protesters waving Israeli flags. New York Mayor Eric Adams described the sign in a statement Sunday and said the display, which he characterized as antisemitic, had him 'horrified and disgusted.' He also described chants of 'we don't want no zionists here' as 'hate speech.'\nAdams said police would enforce the law where it could, but in many cases law enforcement is limited because Columbia exists on private property.\n'Hate has no place in our city, and I have instructed the NYPD to investigate any violation of law that is reported,' Adams said in a statement Sunday. 'Rest assured, the NYPD will not hesitate to arrest anyone who is found to be breaking the law.'\nUniversities protest in solidarity Columbia is one of a growing number of American universities to erupt in discord amid the Israel-Hamas war.\nA protest encampment has cropped up at the New School in Manhattan in solidarity with pro-Palestinian voices at Columbia. The institution on Sunday called the encampment 'unauthorized,' but said it was planning on meeting with students to 'resolve the situation.'\nFollowing a week of protests at Yale, some of its students established a 24-tent encampment in New Haven, Connecticut, in solidarity with Columbia's protesters over the weekend.\nThe Yale protesters want the private university to divest from criminal defense contractors as a way of reducing warfare against people in Gaza.\nBoston-area universities Tufts, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Emerson hosted protest encampments over the weekend in solidarity with Columbia protesters, organizers said.\nThe University of Southern California in Los Angeles was criticized last week after it canceled the speech of a valedictorian whose social media account had a link to a document expressing support for Palestinians in Gaza. USC said it made the decision based on concerns over security and possible disruption.\nDennis Romero Yasmeen Persaud, Yasmeen Persaud, Aaron Gilchrist, Jean Lee, George Solis, Jasmine Cui, Julie Tsirkin, Tavleen Tarrant, Colin Sheeley, Madeline Morrison, Marin Scott and Joe Kottke contributed.",

            "summary": "Four months after a contentious congressional hearing led to the resignations of two Ivy League presidents, Columbia University's president is set to appear before the same committee over questions of antisemitism and the school's response to conflicts on campus over the Israel-Hamas war.\nNemat Shafik, Columbia's leader, was originally asked to testify at the House Education and Workforce Committee's hearing in December, but she declined, citing scheduling conflicts.\nThe December hearing instead featured the presidents of Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, whose lawyerly responses drew fierce backlash and fueled weeks of controversy. The presidents of Penn and Harvard have since resigned.\nDuring a heated line of questioning at the December hearing, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., asked the university leaders to answer whether 'calling for the genocide of Jews' would violate each university's code of conduct.\nLiz Magill, the then-president of Penn, and Claudine Gay, then-president of Harvard, both said it would depend on the details of the situation. MIT president Sally Kornbluth said that she had not heard a calling for the genocide of Jews on MIT's campus, and that speech 'targeted at individuals, not making public statements,' would be considered harassment.\nAlmost immediately, the careful responses from the university presidents drew criticism from donors, alumni and politicians. Magill resigned shortly after the hearing. Gay stepped down in January, following an extended campaign that accused her of plagiarism.\nShafik is expected to testify Wednesday along with Columbia University board members. Tensions and accusations of hate and bias have roiled Columbia, like at its sibling colleges, but Shafik has the benefit of hindsight in preparing her remarks. In an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal Tuesday, Shafik emphasized the delicate balance between protecting free speech and fostering a safe environment for students on campus.\n'Calling for the genocide of a people — whether they are Israelis or Palestinians, Jews, Muslims or anyone else — has no place in a university community,' Shafik wrote. 'Such words are outside the bounds of legitimate debate and unimaginably harmful.'\nSince the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, tensions have run high on university campuses. Jewish students have said that their schools are not doing enough to address instances of antisemitism. Meanwhile, students who have organized in support of Palestinian rights say they have been disproportionately targeted and censored by campus administrations.\nColumbia, along with many other colleges and school districts, is the subject of a series of Department of Education investigations into antisemitism and Islamophobia on campuses. It has also been targeted by lawsuits from both sides. The New York Civil Liberties Union sued over whether the university singled out two pro-Palestinian student organizations when it suspended them from campus over protests in the fall. Groups of Jewish students have also filed suit, saying antisemitism on campus violates their civil rights.",

After the first 96 prospective jurors were brought into a New York courtroom, Judge Juan Merchan asked if any of those assembled could not be 'fair and impartial.' More than half raised their hands and were excused from serving on the jury.\nThe jury selection process got off to a slow start because lawyers from both sides spent much of the day arguing over some of the more sensational evidence in the case. Prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office want to use material — including the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, headlines from the National Enquirer from the 2016 GOP presidential primary and the timing of Trump's alleged affair with another woman — to show why Trump was eager to bury negative stories about him during the 2016 presidential election.\nMerchan said prosecutors could use a transcript of the 'Access Hollywood' tape but not the tape itself. He also greenlit the request to show jurors Enquirer headlines and said he would allow testimony about the alleged affair.\nTrump, who spent much of the day seated at the defense table flanked by his attorneys, called the case 'an assault' on the nation and repeatedly attacked the prosecution for waging 'election interference.' Merchan said Trump must be in the courtroom for every day of the trial and warned that the former president risks jail time if he disrupts the proceedings.

Other analysts have warned that if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decides to hit back hard, it could plunge the wider Middle East into war.\nWhile Israel and Iran have been enemies since the late 1970s, the bitter conflict has long been confined to secret assassinations, audacious cyberattacks, nuclear sabotage and war-by-proxy.

NBC News found that at least 150 paid 'Premium' subscriber X accounts and thousands of unpaid accounts have posted or amplified pro-Nazi content on X in recent months, often in apparent violation of X's rules. The paid accounts posting the content all consistently posted antisemitic or pro-Nazi material. Examples included praise of Nazi soldiers, sharing of Nazi symbols and denials of the Holocaust.\nThe findings are the latest evidence of a flourishing Nazi network on X under Musk's ownership, where Nazi sympathizers are brought in from dark corners of the internet to a massive platform where they can pay to amplify their content.

            "excerpt": "The foreign aid package moved forward with the support of an extremely rare bipartisan coalition, with Democrats helping to carry the \"rule\" in committee and on the floor.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The House voted 316-94 to tee up votes on four separate bills that include aid to Ukraine and Israel, a good sign for the prospects of Congress approving U.S. funding for the two countries after months of delay and partisan fighting.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, facing intense opposition from right-wing members, received crucial help from Democrats to move forward with the votes. More Democrats (165) than Republicans (151) voted to pass the 'rule,' a procedural step to set up the votes.\nThe move tees up four House votes that are expected Saturday afternoon: one on Israel aid, another on Ukraine aid, another on Indo-Pacific security and a fourth bill that includes a bill designed to ban TikTok in the U.S. if it does not divest from its China-based owner, as well as various national security priorities. If they pass, the measures would be packaged together and sent to the Democratic-controlled Senate.\nTaken together, the foreign aid measures closely resemble the $95 billion national security package pushed by President Joe Biden. The Senate would have to pass it again, due to some differences with the version that passed the upper chamber in February.\n\"The world is watching what the Congress does. Passing this legislation would send a powerful message about the strength of American leadership at a pivotal moment,\" the White House budget office said in a statement Friday endorsing the House package. \"The Administration urges both chambers of the Congress to quickly send this supplemental funding package to the President's desk.\nThe House's move followed a vote of 9-3 in the Rules Committee late Thursday to send the bills to the floor for a final vote, with Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., breaking with Johnson to vote against it. But all four Democrats voted for the rule and rescued it, an extremely unusual move for the minority party.\n\"We only control one chamber, and I barely have control of that,\" Johnson said Thursday on Newsmax, explaining why he couldn't include GOP immigration measures in the package as some want. \"The Senate won't advance our legislation and the president won't sign it. ... I have a handful of my Republicans, at least, who will not advance a rule to bring that to the floor to combine it with the Ukraine and Israel funding. They won't do it. And so if I don't have Republican votes, that means we have to have Democratic votes.\nJohnson's decision to move forward with the bills comes as two of his members — Massie and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. — threaten to remove him as speaker. They and many other House conservatives oppose additional aid to Ukraine.\n'We'll see what happens. I'm going to do my job. I'm not deterred by threats,' Johnson said Friday. 'We're going to do the right thing and let the chips fall where they may.'\nBut Johnson, who opposed Ukraine aid last year before he became speaker, now says he believes it is \"critically important,\" based on the intelligence and briefings he has since gotten.\n'I think Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed,\" he told reporters earlier this week.\n\"I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,\" Johnson said, adding that his son is entering the Naval Academy this fall. \"This is a live-fire exercise for me as it is so many American families. This is not a game, this is not a joke.'\nThe fourth bill includes a provision to force China-based ByteDance to sell TikTok within nine months, which the president can extend to a year, or face a ban in the U.S. The provision, which has Senate buy-in as well as Biden's support, puts TikTok closer than ever to a prohibition in the country.\nDemocrats praised the move to proceed to House votes, highlighting their party's key role.\n\"It is vital that Congress act to send assistance to support Ukraine and fend off Russian aggression,\" Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., said on X. \"We may be in the minority, but we are not going to let that urgent mission fail. Democrats are doing what it takes to make sure Ukraine gets help.\"\nRep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., said Democrats were effectively in charge: \"We may be in the minority in the House right now, but @RepJeffries is essentially functioning as the real Speaker already. Rs couldn't get their own bills out of the committee they control so Ds had to help them. Work horses not just show horses.\"\nSahil Kapur Rebecca Kaplan Kyle Stewart Lori Rampani and Syedah Asghar contributed.",

            "excerpt": "The quartet of bills will be voted on individually; if they pass, they'll be sent to the Senate in one package. The move has bitterly divided the GOP and fueled threats to the speaker's job.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The House is poised to vote Saturday on a quartet of bills that would authorize new U.S. aid to Israel and Ukraine, alongside security assistance for the Indo-Pacific and a bill that would force TikTok's parent company to sell it or be banned in the U.S.\nThe chamber is scheduled to vote in the afternoon on the four bills in succession, one day after a rare and extraordinary bipartisan coalition teed up the votes, with more Democrats (165) than Republicans (151) voting for the 'rule' to proceed to the measures.\nThe bills are expected to pass and then go to the Senate for approval as soon as in the next few days. Taken together, they include the $95 billion aid package championed by President Joe Biden, with some changes from the version passed by the Senate two months ago.\nHolding the vote represents an act of defiance by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., against an outspoken faction of conservative rebels who oppose Ukraine funding and pushed him not to bring it to a vote. Three of them — Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. — have threatened to oust him as speaker. The passage of the bill may bring Greene one step closer to forcing a vote to remove him.\nAfter months of wavering, Johnson sided with Biden, Democrats and the Republicans who believe that helping Ukraine fend off Russian aggression is essential to U.S. national security interests, citing briefings he has received and warning: 'Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed.'\n'I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,' Johnson told reporters, noting that his son will enter the Naval Academy this year. 'This is a live-fire exercise for me as it is so many American families. This is not a game, this is not a joke.'\nAhead of the vote, former President Donald Trump issued a confusing statement that sympathized with both the pro- and anti-Ukraine aid factions of the GOP without taking a clear position.\nApart from the three aid bills, the fourth measure includes a policy to force the China-based ByteDance to sell TikTok within nine months — which the president could extend to a year — or face a nationwide ban. The policy, which lengthens the time frame for a sale from an earlier House bill, has Senate buy-in along with Biden's support, putting TikTok closer than ever to a ban in the U.S.\nIf they pass, the bills are expected to be packaged together and sent to the Senate, which will have to vote on the whole legislation to send it to Biden's desk to sign into law. It's unclear when that will happen, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are outspoken proponents of the foreign aid provisions in the package.\n'I hope that President Biden will soon have on his desk long-awaited funding to support our friends in Ukraine and Israel and the Indo-Pacific, and aid for innocent civilians in need of humanitarian aid in Gaza and around the world,' Schumer said before the House vote, cautioning that Ukraine's hopes against Russia would diminish without additional U.S. weapons to defend themselves.\nLate Friday, Schumer said the Senate was working to get unanimous agreement to move quickly to vote on the foreign aid legislation. 'We are working on an agreement for consideration of the supplemental,' he said on the Senate floor.\nMcConnell said earlier this week: 'Here's the political reality: If you think the fall of Afghanistan was bad, the fall of a European capital like Kyiv to Russian troops will be unimaginably worse, and if stalled American assistance makes that outcome possible, there's no question when the blame will land, on us.'\nSahil Kapur Rebecca Kaplan and Frank Thorp V contributed.",

            "excerpt": "The decision has raised some concerns on campus, and administrators are set to host a forum about it on Thursday.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Morehouse College is set to announce that President Joe Biden will deliver its commencement address on May 19, but some faculty members have raised concerns about the decision, according to a person familiar with the matter and an email to faculty reviewed by NBC News.\n'This week, I received an inquiry from concerned faculty about rumors they were hearing about President Biden's selection as the 2024 Commencement speaker,' Kendrick Brown, Morehouse College's provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, wrote in the email to faculty members on Friday.\nKendrick said he would convene a virtual meeting on April 25 'to extend an opportunity for faculty with different perspectives on the selection of our Commencement speaker to ask questions and make comments.' He said students would also engage with the president of the college, David Thomas.\nKendrick did not return a request for further comment, and a spokesperson for Morehouse declined to offer more details.\nThe pushback on Morehouse College leadership's decision comes amid increasing protests on college campuses over Biden's support for Israel in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The protests since the war began in October have already forced Biden, and other top administration officials, to dramatically scale back appearances at college campuses.\nCommencement season is typically a time when presidents reach young audiences and offer an opportunity to deliver a keynote address highlighting their accomplishments and future. In an election year, commencement speeches can carry particular significance.\nBut Biden's addresses this year are poised to be fraught, largely due to growing protests over his refusal to call for a permanent, immediate ceasefire in Gaza without conditions. The president is struggling with younger voters, and recent polling also shows many Black voters are not enthusiastic about supporting his candidacy.\nSpeaking at an Historically Black College and University would provide an 'opportunity' for the president, according to the person familiar with the controversy.\nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment.\nPro-Palestinian protesters gather outside of Columbia University in New York City on April 18. Kena Betancur / AFP - Getty Images Brown wrote in his email that Morehouse first extended its invitation to Biden in September, and that the college would announce the president as its speaker early this week.\nAnd, he wrote, 'the College does not plan to rescind its accepted invitation to President Biden.' The meeting on Thursday 'is a forum for discussion and to respond to questions about the invitation that was extended and accepted,' Brown wrote in the email.\nMorehouse, like other colleges, has faced students speaking out about the war in Gaza. In February, the Maroon Tiger — Morehouse's student publication — reported that a student pulled an Israeli flag down from the chapel and was detained by campus police.\n'Students are not in favor of the way in which the United States has handled this situation, and are surely not in favor of the trauma and the pain and the genocide that the Palestinian people are going through — but also that innocent civilians and Israel are going through as well,' Calvin Bell, a Morehouse College student said in February, after the flag incident.\n'It's not been a secret nationwide, if not globally, that there are a lot of concerns…about how the war has been handled and how America and the presidency has been in the war,' a source familiar with the Morehouse commencement planning told NBC News. 'We've heard conversations like that. There's also plenty of people who are excited to have a sitting president as their commencement speaker.'\nCarol E.

Chantal Da Silva More than six months since Hamas militants attacked Israel and seized more than 250 hostages, it remains unclear exactly how many of the captives are still alive in Gaza, according to U.S. and Israeli officials.\nThe uncertainty has caused anguish among the families of those held in Gaza and undermined international efforts to negotiate a cease-fire deal.\nA proposed cease-fire plan calls for Hamas to free 40 hostages who are women, children or sick and elderly men. In return, Israel could release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. But Hamas has been unable to confirm it has identified 40 hostages who meet those criteria, according to U.S., Israeli and Western officials.\nThis is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your morning.

In November, more than 100 hostages were released as part of a four-day pause in the fighting in Gaza. Israel says more than 130 hostages remain, but far fewer hostages may be alive than is publicly known, and it is difficult to say for certain, U.S. officials said. Asked whether there was a firm estimate of how many hostages remained alive, a former senior Israeli official said, 'Not at all.'\nThe unknowns, officials said, are bogging down cease-fire negotiations.

Man on terror watchlist was dropped by migrant monitoring program When an Afghan national on the FBI terrorist watchlist was arrested last week after having spent nearly a year in the U.S., immigration officials said he had been enrolled in a program that tracked his location via ankle monitor, mobile app or telephone. But the man's participation in the monitoring program, known as Alternatives to Detention, lasted only a little over two weeks. Mohammad Kharwin is believed to have then spent 10 months in the U.S. without any kind of monitoring system.\nNow experts say the case raises questions about how migrants who may pose a security threat are vetted and tracked in the U.S. It also raises questions about the Alternatives to Detention, which has seen funding cuts from Republicans in Congress who oppose it, forcing ICE to drop migrants from being monitored.\nHomeland security correspondent Julia Ainsley, who broke the story last week, explains the latest developments .\nexplains the latest developments. Johnson eyes a weekend vote on foreign aid bills House Speaker Mike Johnson rolled out three bills to provide assistance to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan, with the hopes of holding final votes on Saturday. The bills will be a major test for Johnson, as he faces a deeply divided GOP and serious threats to his leadership from two right-wing representatives.\nThe biggest sticking point will be funding for Ukraine. Already, several Republicans have said they will not approve any more aid for Kyiv. In order for that funding to pass, a significant share of Democrats will be required to carry that measure over the finish line.\nAlso expected to come up this weekend through an amendment process is the House-passed bill to ban TikTok in the U.S. unless the company divests from its China-based owner. Meanwhile, House Democrats want Johnson to consider a Senate-passed foreign aid package instead, saying it's the best path to getting a bill on Biden's desk.

            "summary": "LONDON — London's police force has been forced to issue two apologies after officers threatened to arrest an 'openly Jewish' man if he refused to leave the area around a pro-Palestinian march because his presence risked provoking the demonstrators.\nGideon Falter, chief executive of the Campaign Against Antisemitism, was wearing a traditional Jewish skullcap when he was stopped by police while trying to cross a street in central London as demonstrators filed past on April 13.\nOne officer told Falter he was worried that the man's 'quite openly Jewish' appearance could provoke a reaction from the protesters, according to video posted by the campaign group. A second officer then told Falter he would be arrested if he refused to be escorted out of the area because he was 'causing a breach of the peace.'\nLondon's Metropolitan Police Service on Friday afternoon apologized for the language the officer used in describing Falter's appearance, but said counter demonstrators had to be aware 'that their presence is provocative.'\nThe Met later deleted that apology from its social media accounts and issued a second statement.\n'In an effort to make a point about the policing of protest we caused further offense,' the force said. 'This was never our intention. We have removed that statement and we apologize.'\n'Being Jewish is not a provocation. Jewish Londoners must be able to feel safe in the city.'\nThe episode highlights the challenges London police face amid the boiling tensions surrounding the war in Gaza, with some Jewish residents saying they feel threatened by repeated pro-Palestinian marches through the streets of the British capital.\nWhile the marches have been largely peaceful, many demonstrators accuse Israel of genocide and a small number have shown support for Hamas, the group that led the Oct. 7 attack on Israel and which has been banned by the British government as a terrorist organization.\nThe Met has deployed thousands of officers during each of the dozen major marches as it sought to protect the rights of the pro-Palestinian protesters and prevent clashes with counter-demonstrators and Jewish residents.\nFollowing Falter's confrontation with police, the Campaign Against Antisemitism issued a call for Londoners to exercise their right to walk wherever they choose on April 27, when another pro-Palestinian march is scheduled.\nIn response, the Met emailed Falter about what it described as his intention to 'protest' next week and offered to meet with him to discuss ways to 'ensure we can police the event as safely as possible,' according an exchange of correspondence released by the campaign group.\nFalter rejected the idea that he was staging a protest, saying he was planning to go for a walk as a 'private individual' and others might choose to join him.\n'Unfortunately @MetPoliceUK is missing the point,' he said on the social media site X. 'This is not a protest or counterprotest. Anyone who wishes to walk around London on Saturday 27th April … is free to do so. Even if they are ‘quite openly Jewish.''\nThe Associated Press",

'European skies could have received the same level of protection long ago if Ukraine had received full support from its partners in intercepting drones and missiles,' he said. 'We can now see how unity can work.'\nMost galling, perhaps, is that Russia has been deploying the very same drones as Iran in its assault on Ukrainian cities. And this apparent double standard comes at a particularly perilous moment, as Ukrainian officials sound the alarm that it will be unable to hold off Russian forces from advancing without new military support.

They were told to return Monday, signaling that the selection process will be finished by the end of the week.

Mayorkas impeachment trial could be a swift ordeal Republicans are hoping to drag out the impeachment trial of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, but they might not get that what they wish for. This afternoon, an impeachment trial will kick off with all 100 senators getting sworn in as jurors. Then, Senate Democrats, led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, are expected to quickly move to dismiss or table the two impeachment articles against Mayorkas and move on to other business.

Autopsy for ‘Unabomber' Ted Kaczynski details cancer, depression before death John Youngbear / AP file An autopsy report for Ted Kaczynski, the domestic terrorist known as the 'Unabomber,' shows that he was diagnosed with rectal cancer and 'was noted to be depressed' before his death last year at the age of 81. The report, obtained 10 months after his death by suicide, offers new details into Kaczysnki's health and final months and raises questions about whether his death was preventable.\nKaczynski was diagnosed with rectal cancer in March 2021, and he received biweekly chemotherapy until March 2023, medical examiners said. About a month before Kaczynski's death, an oncologist noted that he 'appeared depressed.' On June 10, 2023, Kaczynski attempted suicide, and later died at a hospital.\nWhether Kaczynski's depression resulted in a suicide watch is unclear.

Boeing whistleblower doubles down ahead of Senate hearing A Boeing whistleblower is expected to testify before a U.S. Senate subcommittee today about his concerns with the company's 787 Dreamliner, which he said is unsafe to fly and could 'drop to the ground' midflight unless problems are addressed.

            "excerpt": "House Speaker Mike Johnson told members that they expect to vote on separate aid bills for Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies on \"Saturday evening\" after an amendment process.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Facing a divided party and pressure to act, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced he will roll out four bills Wednesday to provide assistance to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan and advance other national security priorities, with the hope of holding final votes on Saturday.\nThe bills represent a major test of Johnson's ability to navigate a thicket of political and global challenges with a wafer-thin majority. And it comes as Johnson, R-La., faces a serious threat to his gavel from Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky.\nJohnson's biggest challenge is Ukraine funding, an issue that has bitterly divided the GOP. He has been squeezed by conservative security hawks who want to help Ukraine fend off Russia's aggression and by an empowered isolationist wing that is feeding off former President Donald Trump's criticism of NATO and prior Ukraine aid measures.\nMultiple Republicans say they oppose any funding for Ukraine, meaning that a significant share of Democrats will be required to carry that measure over the finish line.\nIn a message to members before releasing the legislation, Johnson said there would be \"three bills that will fund America's national security interests and allies in Israel, the Indo-Pacific, and Ukraine, including a loan structure for aid, and enhanced strategy and accountability.\"\nHe said Republican leadership will come forward with an amendment process \"alongside a fourth bill that includes the REPO Act,\" which is aimed at seizing Russian assets to benefit Ukraine; the House-passed bill to ban TikTok in the U.S. unless it divests from its China-based owner; as well as \"sanctions and other measures to confront Russia, China, and Iran.\"\n'We expect the vote on final passage on these bills to be on Saturday evening,' Johnson said in a text message obtained by NBC News.\nHe said there will also be a \"border security bill that includes the core components of H.R.2\" — a conservative, House-passed immigration bill — moving under a separate process. That measure serves as a sweetener for reticent conservatives who are unhappy that the aid bills don't include domestic immigration provisions.\nSwift conservative pushback Multiple House conservatives pushed back immediately on social media Wednesday after Johnson's message went out, complaining that the border measures weren't directly tied to Ukraine funding.\n\"The Republican Speaker of the House is seeking a rule to pass almost $100 billion in foreign aid — while unquestionably, dangerous criminals, terrorists, & fentanyl pour across our border. The border 'vote' in this package is a watered-down dangerous cover vote. I will oppose,\" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, wrote on X.\nRep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., the most recent chair of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, said: \"Anything less than tying Ukraine aid to real border security fails to live up to @SpeakerJohnson's own words just several weeks ago. Our constituents demand — and deserve — more from us.\"\nRep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, earlier called aid to Ukraine unnecessary, saying: 'I'm not giving them a nickel today, tomorrow or next week.\"\n'Putin is not going into Poland. I don't care what you say. Besides, anyway, it doesn't really matter because ... when Donald Trump wins, Putin's leavin'. Putin's leavin' Ukraine,' Nehls said ahead of the bill's release, without explaining his logic.\nHouse Democrats have repeatedly called on Johnson to bring up a Senate-passed foreign aid package instead, calling it the best — if not only — path to getting a bill on Biden's desk. They have posted a \"discharge petition\" with 195 signatories to end-run Johnson and force a vote on that bill. It needs 218 votes to come up, meaning it will need the backing of some Republicans in addition to Democrats.\nAt a Wednesday meeting with Democrats, House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., told members that they need to use their 'personal relationships' with Republicans to garner support for the discharge petition, according to two people familiar with her comments.\nTreasury Secretary Yellen dials up pressure At a bilateral meeting later Wednesday with Ukraine Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen plans to dial up the pressure on House Republicans to act.\n'The failure of House Republicans to act to support Ukraine in this pivotal moment of the war for so long has been inexcusable—and detrimental to our national security,' Yellen will say, according to a Treasury source. 'Every moment of delay by House Republicans strengthens Putin and emboldens America's adversaries around the world who are closely watching to see if we, the United States, maintains its resolve to support a democratic Ukraine as it fends off an autocratic Russia.'\nMeanwhile, Greene has not said when she might force a vote on her \"motion to vacate\" the speaker's chair, which would take a simple majority to remove Johnson from his job. Her effort gained a cosponsor in Massie on Tuesday, who predicted Johnson would be voted out.\nIt's not clear the votes are there to oust Johnson. Many conservatives, including some who voted to remove former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, have not joined the effort to oust Johnson. Some Democrats have also said they'll vote to protect Johnson from a motion to depose him.\nBut Massie said that would only hurt his standing with the GOP in the long term.\n'Then he goes further in the hole with Republicans. He becomes toxic to the conference. For every Democrat who comes to his aid he'll lose 2 to 3 more Republicans,' Massie said. 'He doesn't have much shelf life after that.'\nJohnson struck a defiant tone Tuesday when asked about the threat to his gavel, calling it 'absurd' while saying he's 'not concerned' about the motion and will continue to do his job.\nSahil Kapur Rebecca Kaplan Julie Tsirkin contributed.",

The country's War Cabinet will convene today after an hourslong meeting last night.\nThe two countries clashed at an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, with Tehran insisting it does not seek further escalation after launching the barrage of 300 drones and missiles, but warning of more 'decisive' strikes in retaliation to any Israeli counterattack.\nU.N.

How Trump has hobbled his legal team before the first witness is even called at his historic trial By Laura Jarrett For the better part of the last year, former President Donald Trump has sought to turn what would ordinarily amount to significant legal trouble into a political asset.\nFour indictments and one mugshot later, he's successfully managed to dodge any dip among his supporters. Yet now that he stepped into a no-frills Manhattan courtroom this week for the start of his first criminal trial, the legal downside of his political strategy has come into sharp view.\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know The rules of criminal procedure don't change, no matter the defendant, even for a former president. And the courtesies and customs recognized between seasoned prosecutors and defense lawyers begin to break down, if not completely collapse.\nIn a telling moment near the end of a long day in court Thursday, Trump's lead attorney, Todd Blanche, asked if he could get the names of the first three witnesses the prosecution intends to call. That's a routine and reasonable request. But the prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, rebuffed him.\nWhy? Because 'Mr. Trump has been tweeting about the witnesses,' Steinglass said. 'We're not telling them who the witnesses are. I'm sorry.'\nJudge Juan Merchan, who has been the subject of his own wave of attacks from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, then said: 'I can't fault the People for that.'\nThe issue came up again late Friday afternoon, and the prosecution agreed to turn over the name of the first witness to the defense on Sunday. But the implication remains: Trump's legal team is facing a distinct strategic disadvantage with less time to plan cross-examinations of the state's witnesses. In other words, instead of being able to focus all weekend on prioritizing the expected testimony of just a few witnesses, all are up for grabs.\nAnd it's all because Trump has been railing against multiple witnesses online, and has only ramped up his vitriol in recent days, notwithstanding a court order directing him not to do so.\nThis is the year the legal and political lives of Trump have been on a collision course. The only difference is, now the side that's feeling the burn is his own team.\nTrump trial latest: Jury selection completed during a tense day inside and outside the courtroom By Adam Reiss, Lisa Rubin and Dareh Gregorian Opening statements are set to begin next week in Trump's criminal trial after the final members of the jury were seated Friday, following a dramatic day in which two prospective jurors broke down in tears, an appeals court judge rejected the former president's request for a stay, and a man set himself on fire in front of the New York City courthouse.\n'We're going to have opening statements on Monday morning. This trial is starting,' Merchan said towards the end of the day, after successfully seating the remaining five alternate jurors that were needed.\nThe case — the first-ever criminal trial of a former president — will be heard by a panel of 12 jurors and a total of six alternates. It's expected to last roughly six weeks.\nThe five alternates ultimately selected Friday include an unemployed married woman who's into art and described herself as not political, an audio professional, a contract specialist, a clothing company executive and a construction company project manager. It took four days of jury selection to find the 18 jurors.\nAround the same time the judge declared 'we have our full panel' inside the courtroom in the early afternoon, a man set himself on fire outside the courthouse. A spokesperson for the NYPD said the man was in critical condition. He appears to have had pamphlets describing a conspiracy involving cryptocurrency that he threw around before setting himself ablaze, police said.\nRead more from the fourth day of the Trump trial here →\nVolodymyr Zelensky and Joe Biden in 2023 in Washington, D.C. Drew Angerer / Getty Images file A pivotal moment for Biden, Ukraine and Congress By Kristen Welker A pivotal moment has arrived for President Joe Biden, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and House Speaker Mike Johnson.\nCan the GOP-led House pass the aid Ukraine says it needs in its two-year-old war against Russia?\nIf it does, is it already too late to help?\nHow much longer does Ukraine need assistance?\nAnd how much is riding on the outcome of the 2024 election, given Trump's past opposition to this aid?\nThese are among the questions that I plan to ask Zelenskyy on Sunday when I interview him on 'Meet the Press.'\nThe congressional fight for Ukraine aid has also underscored an important point about the Biden presidency: It's been largely defined — and unsettled — by events overseas.\nIt began with the botched and deadly U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021.\nThen there was Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.\nAnd then came the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack in Israel, which has led to a six-month war.\nJust in the past week, we saw Iran launch missile strikes and drones at Israel, while Israel responded Thursday night by carrying out what appears to be a limited response inside Iran.\n'We don't want to see this escalate. ... We're not looking for a wider war with Iran. ... I think, you know, the coming hours and days will tell us a lot,' National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told me last Sunday.\nHow foreign affairs has defined Biden's presidency has carried over with Russia's invasion of Ukraine — and with the current congressional drama over whether the U.S. will continue to provide Ukraine with the funding it needs.\nAll of it creates a fraught backdrop as the 2024 race heats up.\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

            "summary": "House Speaker Mike Johnson on Monday unveiled a plan to advance foreign aid to Israel, Ukraine and Tawain in separate bills and move a fourth piece of legislation wrapping other Republican national security priorities together.\nThose GOP priorities would include implementing a loan-lease program for Ukraine aid, which would lend Ukraine money backed by seized Russian assets, and imposing more sanctions on Iran.\nJohnson's outlined the plan in remarks to reporters after what he described as a 'fruitful and productive' GOP conference meeting Monday evening. The speaker did not mention a ban on TikTok, but other lawmakers leaving the meeting appeared to believe that could be included in the package. He indicated funding levels for the national security bills will be about the same as those proposed in the Senate supplemental aid package.\nJohnson said Ukraine aid was the most 'controversial' piece in the GOP conference, but stressed that the majority of the bill would go toward replenishing American munitions — and therefore would be good for American jobs.\n'Every member ultimately will be able to vote their own conscience on all of these matters, and everyone have an opportunity to weigh in and bring the amendments that they think are suitable,' Johnson said.\n'We will follow the germaneness rules of the House of course and the regular rules with regard to amendments,' he added. 'But I think the final product will be something that everybody can take confidence in because they got to vote their district and vote their conscience.'\nJohnson said he intends to allow members to read the text of the legislation for 72 hours before bringing the bills to the floor. If the text is released Tuesday, as Johnson said he hopes, that could mean the House might not vote on the four separate bills until Friday afternoon or evening. The House is currently scheduled to leave Thursday afternoon and be in recess next week, but that could change.\nJohnson said it was the will of the GOP conference to vote on the foreign aid pieces separately and that he would prefer to send each bill individually to the Senate, but no final decision has been made on whether to package them together.\nHouse Republicans had mixed reactions to Johnson's plan, with many moderates expressing their support.\n'We need to get aid, I don't care procedurally how we do it,' Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., said.\nRep. Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y., called Johnson's plan 'thoughtful' and 'an appropriate Democratic process.'\n'It's the right way in which the House should function, and quite frankly, I think America should see this,' Molinaro said.\nRep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said members were 'excited\" to hear they would get to vote this week and hopefully the House would pass the bills.\nMeanwhile, some on the far-right flank of Johnson's caucus expressed opposition to his plan.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who filed a \"motion to vacate' to oust Johnson, said she is 'firmly against the plan' right now and that people would be angry about it.\n'I think it's another wrong direction for Speaker Johnson,' she said. Greene added that she hasn't decided whether to force a vote on her motion to remove Johnson, but said she doesn't believe he will remain in the spot in the next Congress if the GOP maintains the majority.\nJohnson, for his part, said when asked whether he could survive a motion to vacate after bringing the bills to the floor that he doesn't \"spend my time worrying about motions to vacate.'\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., argued that if the House passes the supplemental bills that Johnson proposed, it should wait to transmit them until the Senate takes up bills focused on energy and the border.\n'It doesn't make for a really precise soundbite, but there is a legislative mechanism by which we can take up these votes but then not transmit the bills until the Senate takes some action,' Gaetz said. 'That's a way to leverage the Senate into taking action on our drilling agenda and on our border agenda.'\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good, R-Va., said he supports Johnson's plan for separate aid bills but said GOP leadership will be 'terribly disappointed' if border security isn't tied into the supplemental aid.\n'Republican leadership promised that we would utilize the supplemental process to fight for border security,' Good said. 'So I think they're going to be terribly disappointed if we don't do that.'\nRep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., also warned that he would walk back his support on Johnson's supplemental if it lacks border security provisions.\n'Border security is the No. 1 issue in the country. And for this town to be totally focused on Ukraine while they continue to ignore our southern border is atrocious, and it's a slap in the face of the American people,' Donalds said.\nRebecca Kaplan Kyle Stewart Syedah Asghar Summer Concepcion",

Brazilian artist Manauara Clandestina poses in front of the main pavilion at the Venice Biennale on April 16. Luca Bruno / AP April 22, 2024, 2:31 PM UTC / Source: The Associated Press VENICE, Italy — Outsider, queer and Indigenous artists are getting an overdue platform at the 60th Venice Biennale contemporary art exhibition that opened Saturday, curated for the first time by a Latin American. Brazilian curator Adriano Pedrosa's main show, which accompanies 88 national pavilions for the seven-month run, is strong on figurative painting, with fewer installations than recent editions. A preponderance of artists are from the Global South, long overlooked by the mainstream art world circuits. Many are dead. Frida Kahlo, for example, is making her first appearance at the Venice Biennale. Her 1949 painting 'Diego and I' hangs alongside one by her husband and fellow artist, Diego Rivera. Despite their lower numbers, living artists have 'a much stronger physical presence in the exhibition,' Pedrosa said, with each either showing one large-scale work, or a collection of smaller works. The vast majority are making their Venice Biennale debut. Brazilian curator Adriano Pedrosa at the Biennale. Gabriel Bouys / AFP - Getty Images Visitors to the two main venues, the Giardini and the Arsenale, will be greeted by a neon sign by the conceptual art cooperative Claire Fontaine with the exhibition's title: 'Stranieri Ovunque — Foreigners Everywhere.' A total of 60 in different languages hang throughout the venues. When taken in the context of global conflicts and hardening borders, the title seems a provocation against intransigent governments — at the very least a prod to consider our shared humanity. Through artists with underrepresented perspectives, the exhibition address themes of migration and the nature of diaspora as well as indigeneity and the role of craft. 'Foreigners everywhere, the expression has many meanings,'' Pedrosa said. 'One could say that wherever you go, wherever you are, you are always surrounded by foreigners. … And then in a more personal, perhaps psychoanalytic subjective dimension, wherever you go, you are also a foreigner, deep down inside.' 'Refugee, the foreigner, the queer, the outsider and the Indigenous, these are the ... subjects of interest in the exhibition,'' he said. Some highlights from the Venice Biennale, which runs through Nov. 26: Geopolitics at the Biennale Facing the threat of protests, the Israel Pavilion stayed closed after the artist and curators refused to open until there is a cease-fire in Gaza and the Israeli hostages taken by Hamas -led militants are released. The Israel pavilion at the Venice Biennale. Daniele Venturelli / WireImage Ukraine is making its second Biennale art appearance as a country under invasion; soft diplomacy aimed at keeping the world focused on the war. Russia has not appeared at the Biennale since the Ukraine invasion began, but this time its historic 110-year-old building in the Giardini is on loan to Bolivia. For a short time during this week's previews, a printed sign hung on the Accademia Bridge labeling Iran a 'murderous terrorist regime,' declaring 'the Iranian people want freedom & peace.' The venue for the Iranian pavilion was nearby, but there was no sign of activity. The Biennale said it would open Sunday — two days after the departure from Italy of Group of Seven foreign ministers who warned Iran of sanctions for escalating violence against Israel. Golden Lions The Golden Lion for best national pavilion went to Australia for Archie Moore's installation 'kith and kin,' tracing his own Aboriginal relations over 65,000 years. It's written in chalk on the pavilion's dark walls and ceiling and took months to complete. The Mataaho Collective from New Zealand won the Golden Lion for the best participant in Pedrosa's main show, for their installation inspired by Maori weaving that crisscrosses the gallery space, casting a pattern of shadows and interrogating interconnectedness.

Gabriel Bouys / AFP - Getty Images As a queer artist born in South Korea and working in Los Angeles, Kang Seung Lee said he identified with Pedrosa's 'invitation to look at our lives as foreigners, but also visitors to this world.' His installation, 'Untitled (Constellations),' which considers the artists who died in the AIDS epidemic through a collection of objects, is in dialogue with spare paper-on-canvas works by British artist Romany Eveleigh, who died in 2020. 'The works speak to each other, an intergenerational conversation, of course,'' said Lee, 45, whose works have been shown in international exhibitions, including Documenta 15. This is his first Venice Biennale. Nearby, transsexual Brazilian artist Manauara Clandestina presented her video 'Migranta,' which speaks about her family's story of migration. 'It's so strong, because I can hear my daddy's voice,'' she said. Clandestina, who hails from the Amazon city of Manaus, embraced Pedrosa during a press preview marking her Venice debut. She said she continues to work in Brazil despite discrimination and violence against transgender people. Newer national participants The Giardini hosts 29 national pavilions representing some of the oldest participating nations, like the United States, Germany, France and Britain. More recent additions show either in the nearby Arsenale, or choose a venue farther afield, like Nigeria did this year in Venice's Dorsoduro district. The Nigerian Pavilion, in a long-disused building with raw brick walls that exude potential, houses an exhibition that spans mediums — including figurative art, installation, sculpture, sound art, film art and augmented reality — by artists living in the diaspora and in their homeland. 'These different relationships to the country allow for a very unique and different perspectives of Nigeria,'' said curator Aindrea Emelife. 'I think that it's quite interesting to consider how leaving a space creates a nostalgia for what hasn't been and allows an artist to imagine an alternative continuation to that. The exhibition is about nostalgia, but it's also about criticality.' The eight-artist Biennale exhibition 'Nigeria Imaginary' will travel to the Museum of West African Art in Benin City, Nigeria, where Emelife is curator, which will give it 'a new context and a new sense of relevancy,'' she said. The installation \"Monument to the Restitution of the Mind and Soul\" by artist Yinka Shonibare at the Nigerian pavilion. Luca Bruno / AP Ghana-born British artist John Akomfrah created eight multimedia film- and sound-based works for the British Pavilion that looks at what it is to be 'living as a figure of difference' in the U.K. Images of water are a connecting device, representing memory. 'In the main, I'm trying to tease out something about collective memory, the things that have informed a culture, British culture let's say, over the last 50 years,'' Akomfrah told The Associated Press. 'As you go further in, you realize we're going further back. We end up going to the 16th century. So it's an interrogation of 500 years of British life.' Considering the question of equity in the art world, Akomfrah indicated the adjacent French Pavilion — where French-Caribbean artist Julien Creuzet created an immersive exhibition — and the Canadian Pavilion on the other side, featuring an exhibition examining the historic importance of seed beads by Kapwani Kiwanga, who is in Paris. 'I mean, this feels like a very significant moment for artists of color,'' said Akomfrah, who participated in the Ghana Pavilion in 2019. 'Because I'm in the British Pavilion. Next to me is the French one, with an artist, Julien, who I love a lot, of African origin. And then next to me is a Canadian pavilion that has a biracial artist, again, with African heritage. 'So that's certainly not happened before, that three major pavilions have artists of color inhabiting, occupied, making work in them. And that feels like a breakthrough,'' he said. An installation by artist John Akomfrah at Great Britain's pavilion. Gabriel Bouys / AFP - Getty Images The Ukrainian Pavilion engaged ordinary Ukrainians to collaborate with artists on work that documents how they are experiencing, and in some ways adapting to the Russian invasion. The artistic projects include silent video portraits of European actors styled by Ukrainians displaced by the war to represent an 'ideal' refugee. In another, neurodiverse young adults show their linguistic flexibility in incorporating a new reality where niceties like 'quiet night' have a whole new meaning. And a film installation has become a sort of archive, taken from social media channels that once chronicled pre-invasion pastimes but that turned their attention to documenting the war. Co-curator Max Gorbatskyi said it was important for Ukraine to be present at the Biennale to assert its distinctiveness from Russian culture, but also to use the venue to keep the wider world's attention. 'We wanted to look at stories of real people,'' he said. 'There was no way we were going to show some abstract paintings, maybe beautiful and interesting, but which only pose questions in the art discourse. Instead, we wanted to bring real people together with artists in a non-hierarchical way to tell their stories.' Collateral events Greek American George Petrides' installation 'Hellenic Heads' outside of Venice's Church of Saint George of the Greeks and the Museum of Icons is among the many collateral events that spill over into the city. Petrides' created six oversized busts, each inspired by a significant period of Greek history, using family members as models. His mother, in turquoise blue, is in the classical style and his daughter represents the future in a golden hue. To withstand the weather, Petrides recreated an earlier series but this time from recycled plastic, using a digital sculpting software and a 3D printer, reworking details from hand. 'This space is unique. We have the Museum of Icons here, which is one of the most spectacular collections of icons in the world. We have a church started while Michelangelo was still alive, which any sculptor finds interesting. But further, this particular quarter is the Greek quarter,'' he said, noting an influx after Constantinople fell to the Ottomans in 1453. Across the city, at the base of the Accademia Bridge, the Qatar Museum's installation 'Your Ghosts Are Mine' presents clips of feature films and video art from the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia organized thematically and exploring issues such as migration, conflict and exile. Films will be screened in their entirety four days a week. 'These different thematics tell a story about all the congruences and the parallels that exist among filmmakers that may have never met or are from different parts of the global south,'' said assistant curator and filmmaker Majid Al-Remaihi. 'Some films were the first from their countries to premiere in Cannes or make it to the Oscars, so these are milestones and also part of our journey.'

It begins with provisions to boost the federal minimum wage to $17 per hour by 2028 and pass the PRO Act to strengthen unions, as well as other provisions, such as guaranteeing overtime pay. It includes policies to reduce the cost of living — by capping child care costs at 7% of income for all families; expanding Social Security benefits by closing tax loopholes; adding dental, vision and hearing benefits to Medicare; and enacting a series of policies to protect renters and make housing more affordable.\n2028 and pass the PRO Act to strengthen unions, as well as other provisions, such as guaranteeing overtime pay. It includes policies to reduce the cost of living — by capping child care costs at 7% of income for all families; expanding Social Security benefits by closing tax loopholes; adding dental, vision and hearing benefits to Medicare; and enacting a series of policies to protect renters and make housing more affordable. 'It's really about worker power and raising wages and lowering costs for poor people, middle-class Americans and the working people across this country,' Jayapal said.\nThe five other planks are investments in education, including universal pre-K and kindergarten; aggressive clean energy standards to tackle climate change; 'making our democracy work' with federal voting rights mandates, Washington, D.C., statehood and elimination of the Senate filibuster; taking on corporations and monopolies; and 'advancing justice' though abortion rights, pro-LGBTQ measures, pro-immigrant policies and setting national policing standards.\nThe agenda is also notable for what's not included. 'Medicare for All,' a rallying cry of the left for years, is excluded. Foreign policy issues like Israel and Gaza, which have sparked fiery pro-Palestinian protests across the country, are also kept out. Jayapal said that's partly because the caucus decided to make it a domestic-issue-only blueprint and partly out of pragmatism — to focus more on unifying issues for Democrats and steer clear of the ones that divide them.\n'The way we came to this agenda is to say that we were going to put into this agenda things that were populist and possible ... and affected a huge number of people,' she said. 'We haven't taken a position on particularly Israel and Gaza in the progressive caucus, and so that's not on here.'\nA supermajority of the 103 lawmakers in the caucus weighed in on the agenda, and 98% supported it, a spokesperson said.\nMuch of the agenda will have no realistic chance of passage unless Democrats sweep control of the White House, the House and the Senate this fall. And Jayapal emphasized that, in addition, Democrats would need 50 senators ready to pierce the 60-vote filibuster rule to get around likely GOP opposition. That would be a herculean task, as Democrats face a daunting map in 2024 Senate races, defending a slew of seats in purple and red states.\n'We are assuming that this is an agenda for a Democratic president with a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House,' Jayapal said.\nProgressives have had a rough two years, having been marginalized after Republicans took control of the House and steered the agenda rightward. Biden has broken with the left on issues like tougher asylum laws and crime. Some prominent Democrats, like Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, have eschewed the 'progressive' label as conservatives have found success in associating it with the left's most divisive ideas. Gallego, who is running for the Senate in his purple state, quietly left the progressive caucus. The caucus recently missed an opportunity to elect one of its members to a rare open Senate seat in deep-blue California, with two of them running and losing.\nStill, Jayapal said she believes that if Democrats win the 2024 elections, the progressive caucus will be well-positioned to advance the ideas in its new agenda, as it did with it opening bid that shaped two of Biden's signature laws, the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act. She has sought to institute changes to make the caucus more cohesive. It recently raised its dues for members.\nSome of the provisions in the new agenda represent items in Biden's 'Build Back Better' agenda that were left on the cutting room floor because of the thin majorities. Others could spark intraparty disagreements, including a far-reaching liberalization of the immigration system with a path to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally. Yet other pieces resemble popular causes that progressives want Biden to get behind, like expanding Social Security and legalizing marijuana.\n'We have to excite our base. We have to show them what the path forward is — not just say, ‘This is the most important election of your life, and we expect you to vote.' I don't think that's going to turn people out. And so I think this agenda, really, speaks to the needs of poor people, working people, progressives across the country who want us to make that case to them,' Jayapal said. 'We are not seeing the momentum that we would like to see. We're going to have a tough election. ... We know we're going to have to put together that progressive coalition. And I think this is the thing that allows us to say, ‘Look, here's what we're fighting for.''\nSahil Kapur",

            "excerpt": "Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a member of the speaker's own Rules Committee, says he will co-sponsor a resolution to remove Johnson as speaker months before the election.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — A second House Republican said he will support the effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson from power, pointing to the GOP leader's handling of foreign aid for Ukraine and other U.S. allies.\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who is a member of Johnson's own Rules Committee, said he informed the speaker directly in a closed-door meeting of House Republicans Tuesday that he is co-sponsoring the resolution offered by far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., to remove Johnson, R-La., from the top job.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. Getty Images \"He should pre-announce his resignation (as Boehner did), so we can pick a new Speaker without ever being without a GOP speaker,\" Massie wrote on X, referring to former GOP Speaker John Boehner, who resigned in the middle of his term in 2015 while facing a similar conservative rebellion from Massie and others.\nJohnson told rank-and-file House Republicans in the room that he won't resign, Massie said, a point he reiterated to reporters.\n'I am not resigning. And it is in my view an absurd notion that someone would bring a vacate motion when we are simply here trying to do our jobs,' Johnson said after the private meeting. 'It is not helpful to the country. It does not help the House Republicans advance our agenda which is in the best interest of the American people here: a secure border, sound governance — and it's not helpful to the unity that we have in the body.'\nHe added: 'I am not concerned about this. I am going to do my job.'\nWith the GOP majority hanging by a thread, Johnson can only afford exactly two GOP defections if Greene files her motion as \"privileged,\" forcing a floor vote to vacate the speaker's chair. To successfully remove him in that scenario, at least three Republicans — and all Democrats — would need to vote for the motion to vacate for Johnson to lose his job.\nSome Democrats, however, have said they would vote to save Johnson to prevent the House from spiraling out of control, similar to what happened last fall after conservatives toppled then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, ushering in three weeks of chaos and ultimately paving the way for Johnson's ascent.\nThis week's conservative rebellion comes as Johnson attempts to move stalled foreign aid for U.S. allies including Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan through the House. Far-right members, including Greene, are demanding that Johnson and his leadership team focus their attention and resources on shoring up security of the southern border with Mexico.\nMassie's support for Johnson's ouster is significant in one other regard. The Kentuckian serves on the Rules Committee, known on Capitol Hill as the \"speaker's committee,\" because its members are appointed by the speaker and typically carry out the speaker's wishes. Massie, however, was put on the influential panel by McCarthy last year, and Johnson has had to bypass the Rules Committee on a number of occasions to get critical legislation to the floor.\nScott Wong Rebecca Kaplan Kyle Stewart, Syedah Asghar, Lori Rampani, Ryan Nobles and Sahil Kapur contributed.",

            "summary": "KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian and Western leaders welcomed a desperately needed aid package passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, as the Kremlin claimed the passage of the bill would 'further ruin' Ukraine and cause more deaths.\nThe House swiftly approved $95 billion in foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies in a rare Saturday session as Democrats and Republicans banded together after months of hard-right resistance over renewed American support for repelling Russia's invasion.\nWith an overwhelming vote, the $61 billion in aid for Ukraine passed in a matter of minutes. Many Democrats cheered on the House floor and waved Ukrainian flags.\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who had warned that his country would lose the war without U.S. funding, said that he was grateful for the decision of U.S. lawmakers.\n'We appreciate every sign of support for our country and its independence, people and way of life, which Russia is attempting to bury under the rubble,' he wrote on social media site X.\n'America has demonstrated its leadership since the first days of this war. Exactly this type of leadership is required to maintain a rules-based international order and predictability for all nations,' he said.\nThe Ukrainian president noted that his country's 'warriors on the front lines' would feel the benefit of the aid package.\nOne such 'warrior' is infantry soldier Oleksandr, fighting around Avdiivka, the city in the Donetsk region that Ukraine lost to Russia in February after months of intense combat.\n'For us it's so important to have this support from the U.S. and our partners,' Oleksandr told The Associated Press. He did not give his full name for security reasons.\n'With this we can stop them and reduce our losses. It's the first step to have the possibility to liberate our territory.'\nAmmunition shortages linked to the aid holdup over the past six months have led Ukrainian military commanders to ration shells, a disadvantage that Russia seized on this year — taking the city of Avdiivka and currently inching towards the town of Chasiv Yar, also in the Donetsk region.\n'The Russians come at us in waves — we become exhausted, we have to leave our positions. This is repeated many times,' Oleksandr said. 'Not having enough ammunition means we can't cover the area that is our responsibility to hold when they are assaulting us.'\nOther Western leaders lauded the passing of the aid package.\n'Ukraine is using the weapons provided by NATO Allies to destroy Russian combat capabilities. This makes us all safer, in Europe & North America,' NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg wrote on X.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that 'Ukraine deserves all the support it can get against Russia.'\nIn Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the approval of aid to Ukraine 'expected and predictable.'\nThe decision 'will make the United States of America richer, further ruin Ukraine and result in the deaths of even more Ukrainians, the fault of the Kyiv regime,' Peskov was quoted as saying by Russian news agency Ria Novosti.\n'The new aid package will not save, but, on the contrary, will kill thousands and thousands more people, prolong the conflict, and bring even more grief and devastation,' Leonid Slutsky, head of the Russian State Duma Committee on International Affairs, wrote on Telegram.\nThe whole aid package will go to the U.S. Senate, which could pass it as soon as Tuesday. President Joe Biden has promised to sign it immediately.\nThe Associated Press",

'Israel was brutally attacked by Hamas terrorists and very soon it became clear that these horrific events would ignite fear and anguish across our campus.'\nShafik faced questions on her handling of antisemitism on campus after the Oct. 7 attack alongside two members of Columbia's Board of Trustees and the head of the university's antisemitism task force. She faced particular scrutiny for how the university handled faculty members who made comments about Hamas that were perceived as antisemitic.\nRep. Tim Walberg, R-M.I., grilled Shafik about Joseph Massad, a tenured professor in Columbia's Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies department who published comments in October calling Hamas' attack a 'stunning victory.'\n'I do condemn his statement. I am appalled by what he said,' Shafik responded. 'He has been spoken to.'\nThe hearing became particularly heated when Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., pressed Shafik on why Massad is still listed on Columbia's website as the chair of the academic review committee.\n'Do you have my commitment that he will be removed as chair today?' Stefanik asked Shafik, who said she would get back to Stefanik with the facts.\nStefanik also questioned Shafik about Mohamed Abdou, a visiting professor at the Middle East Institute at Columbia. She referred to an Oct. 11 post on Facebook in which Abdou wrote, 'Yes, I'm with the muqawamah (the resistance) be it Hamas and Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad but up to a point.'\nWhen asked about consequences, Shafik said Abdou 'will never work at Columbia again.'\nMinouche Shafik's testimony came after she declined a December request, citing scheduling conflicts. Tom Williams / CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images Her appearance in Congress came months after declining to testify at a December hearing, citing scheduling conflicts.\nThat hearing saw testimonies from the presidents of the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who all drew intense scrutiny for their responses to questions regarding antisemitism and hate speech on campus. Penn and Harvard's presidents have since resigned.\nWhen Shafik and her colleagues were asked by Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-OR, whether calling for the genocide of Jewish people violates Columbia's rules — the same question posed to Harvard, MIT and Penn's presidents — all answered 'yes.' She also asked Shafik about the chants 'by any means necessary' and 'intifada,' which Shafik said were distressing.\nAhead of her hearing, Shafik published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal about what she planned to speak about in Congress.\n\"Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, I have spent the most of my time addressing its aftershocks,\" Shafik wrote. \"It is hard to describe how difficult this has been, especially on a large, diverse urban campus with students from all over the world and a long tradition of political activism.\"\nThe university is currently being sued by five Jewish students and two student organizations after it suspended the student groups Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace last November. In March, Shafik confirmed that a \"number\" of Columbia students were suspended after allegedly participating in an unauthorized panel called \"Resistance 101\" that featured speakers who supported Hamas.\nEmi Tuyetnhi Tran",

Speaker Mike Johnson opted not to put that bill bundling aid for the three countries on the floor, instead choosing to pass three separate aid bills.\nUkranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on April 18 in Kyiv, Ukraine. Kay Nietfeld / dpa / picture alliance via Getty Images The House bills are expected to pass the Senate this week, something Zelenskyy specifically urged.\n'We really need to get this to the final point. We need to get approved by the Senate,' he said Sunday.\n'Then we want to help get things as fast as possible so that we get some tangible assistance for the soldiers on the frontline as soon as possible — not in another six months — so that they would be able to move ahead,' he added.\nIn a statement after House passage of the bills, President Joe Biden said, 'I urge the Senate to quickly send this package to my desk so that I can sign it into law and we can quickly send weapons and equipment to Ukraine to meet their urgent battlefield needs.'\nZelenskyy spoke about those urgent needs Sunday, telling moderator Kristen Welker, 'We need long-range weapons to not lose people on the frontline because we have, we have casualties because we cannot reach that far. Our weapons are not that long-range.'\n'We need [that] and air defense. Those are our priorities right now,' he added.\nAsked whether this aid will help Ukraine win the war or just prolong it, Zelenskyy told Welker, 'It depends on when we actually get weapons on the ground. As you said it, Kristen, if we get it in half a year — well, we've had the process stalled for half a year and we've had losses in several directions. Losses in men, in equipment.'\n'Now we have the chance to stabilize the situation and to overtake the initiative, and that's why we need to actually have the weapons systems, Zelenskyy added. 'Giving the U.S. a specific timeline of the war, well it depends how soon they get this aid. There are so many variables, so many factors.'\nFor weeks, Zelenskyy has expressed the urgent need for weapons and supplies to continue defending Ukraine from Russian attacks.\nIn the months that U.S. aid to Ukraine lapsed, Ukraine's military supplied grew depleted and the military was forced to withdraw from one key eastern city — Avdiivka — in February.\nEarlier this month, Russia was firing five artillery shells for every one fired by Ukrainian forces, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, commander of the European Command, told NBC News. He warned that the disparity could increase in the near future without more aid.\nOn Sunday, Zelenskyy pushed back on complaints that the U.S. has sunk too much money into the war and will continue to have to do so, telling Welker, '[Americans] first and foremost are protecting freedom and democracy all over Europe.'\n'The U.S. Army now does not have to fight protecting NATO countries. Ukrainians are doing that. And it's only ammo that the civilized world is providing, and I think it's a good decision,' he said.\nAlexandra Marquez",

            "excerpt": "Biden's latest environmental announcements come as he is working to energize young voters for his reelection campaign.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is marking Earth Day by announcing $7 billion in federal grants for residential solar projects serving 900,000-plus households in low- and middle-income communities. He also plans to expand his New Deal-style American Climate Corps green jobs training program.\nThe grants are being awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency, which unveiled the 60 recipients on Monday. The projects are expected to eventually reduce emissions by the equivalent of 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and save households $350 million annually, according to senior administration officials.\nBiden's latest environmental announcements come as he is working to energize young voters for his reelection campaign. Young people were a key part of a broad but potentially fragile coalition that helped him defeat then-President Donald Trump in 2020. Some have joined protests around the country of the administration's handling of Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\nSenior administration officials said young Americans are keenly invested in the Biden climate agenda and want to actually help enact it. The Climate Corps initiative is a way for them to do that, the officials said.\nSolar is gaining traction as a key renewable energy source that could reduce the nation's reliance on fossil fuels, which emit planet-warming greenhouse gases. Not only is it clean, but solar energy can also boost the reliability of the electric grid.\nBut solar energy can have high costs for initial installation, making it inaccessible for many Americans — and potentially meaning a mingling of environmental policy with election-year politics.\nForty-nine of the new grants are state-level awards, six serve Native American tribes and five are multi-state awards. They can be used for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens.\nBiden is making the announcement at northern Virginia's Prince William Forest Park, about 30 miles southwest of Washington. It was established in 1936 as a summer camp for underprivileged youth from Washington, part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps to help create jobs during the Great Depression.\nBiden used executive action last year to create the American Climate Corps modeled on Roosevelt's New Deal. He is announcing Monday that nearly 2,000 corps positions are being offered across 36 states, including jobs offered in partnership with the North American Building Trades Unions.\nBiden has often used Earth Day as a backdrop to further his administration's climate initiatives. Last year, he signed an executive order creating the White House Office of Environmental Justice, meant to help ensure that poverty, race and ethnic status do not lead to worse exposure to pollution and environmental harm.\nHe has tried to draw a contrast with GOP congressional leaders, who have called for less regulation of oil production to lower energy prices. Biden officials counter that GOP policies benefit highly profitable oil companies and could ultimately undermine U.S. efforts to compete with the Chinese in the renewable energy sector.\nBiden will use his Virginia visit to discuss how 'a climate crisis fully manifest to the American people in communities all across the country, is also an opportunity for us to come together,' said White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi.\nHe said the programs can 'unlock economic opportunity to create pathways to middle-class-supporting careers, to save people money and improve their quality of life.'\nThe awards came from the Solar for All program, part of the $27 billion 'green bank' created as part of a sweeping climate law passed in 2022. The bank is intended to reduce climate and air pollution and send money to neighborhoods most in need, especially disadvantaged and low-income communities disproportionately impacted by climate change.\nEPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe said she was 'looking forward to these funds getting out into the community, giving people skills, putting them to work in their local communities, and allowing people to save on their energy bills so that they can put those dollars to other needs.'\nAmong those receiving grants are state projects to provide solar-equipped roofs for homes, college residences and residential-serving community solar projects in West Virginia, a non-profit operating Mississippi solar lease program and solar workforce training initiatives in South Carolina.\nThe taxpayer-funded green bank has faced Republican opposition and concerns over accountability for how the money gets used. EPA previously disbursed the other $20 billion of the bank's funds to nonprofits and community development banks for clean energy projects such as residential heat pumps, additional energy-efficient home improvements and larger-scale projects like electric vehicle charging stations and community cooling centers.\nThe Associated Press",

Mike Johnson faces his most perilous moment yet as House speaker By Sahil Kapur House Speaker Mike Johnson faces the biggest threat to his gavel nearly six months into the job, with the walls closing in from both sides of his divided Republican Party on providing aid to U.S. allies.\nAfter wavering for months and exhausting his timeouts, he's finally calling the play: a trigger for separate votes on four bills — assistance for Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan and a hodgepodge of other national security priorities important to Republicans.\nEach one will have a unique coalition, and that's the point.\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know In theory, Israel aid can pass with mostly Republicans, over progressive opposition. Ukraine aid — structured as a loan — can pass with mostly Democrats, over conservative opposition. The GOP opponents of assisting Ukraine can vote against it, and the GOP proponents of giving the country weapons to fend off Russian aggression finally get off Johnson's back.\nMeanwhile, Johnson's public Republican opposition just doubled: Rep. Thomas Massie announced Tuesday that he would co-sponsor Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to remove him as speaker. Massie said he's 'pretty certain' Johnson has more GOP opponents today than the eight who ousted Kevin McCarthy as speaker in October, though he didn't name names.\n'Mike Johnson is going for the Triple Crown here against our base. He has voted for an omnibus that spends more than Pelosi. He's put his finger on the scales to pass FISA without warrants. And now he's about to do Ukraine without protecting our own border,' Massie said. 'This will get called and he will lose the vote.'\nTwo votes may not seem like much, but after this Friday, Johnson will have a staggering one-vote majority. Two defections and Johnson loses — unless Democrats step in to rescue him and vote against a motion to vacate. That would be extremely unusual, but some centrist Democrats say they'd do it, especially if Johnson brings up Ukraine aid.\n'He's got to manage his politics. And if they try and kick him out as speaker, I'm going to vote to keep him,' said Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y.\nMassie said a Democratic rescue would ultimately do more harm than good to Johnson.\n'Then he goes further in the hole with Republicans,' Massie said. 'He becomes toxic to the conference. For every Democrat who comes to his aid he'll lose 2-3 more Republicans. … There's no sustainable solution where Democrats save him.'\nAnd that sums up Johnson's dilemma: He can't govern with his far-right rebels, but he can't hold on to his job without them. The same dynamic became too much for McCarthy to navigate. Today, Johnson has an even slimmer majority.\nStill, he recognizes that he can't be cowed by such threats or he becomes fully captured by the agitators. And this could be the last major piece of business until the 2024 election, when voters will redetermine the makeup of Congress.\n'I am not resigning. And it is in my view an absurd notion that someone would bring a vacate motion when we are simply here trying to do our jobs,' Johnson told reporters. 'I am not concerned about this. I am going to do my job.'\nFirst jurors are seated in Trump's hush money trial Donald Trump during jury selection on the second day of his trial at Manhattan Criminal Court on Tuesday. Curtis Means / Getty Images pool By Adam Reiss, Dareh Gregorian, Jonathan Allen and Lisa Rubin The first seven jurors were selected Tuesday in Trump's hush money trial amid a battle over prospective jurors' old Facebook posts and calls to 'lock him up' and a warning from the judge that the former president should not try to intimidate the panelists who will be deciding his fate.\n'I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom. I want to make this crystal clear,' Judge Juan Merchan told Trump and his lawyer Todd Blanche. The judge told Blanche that Trump had 'audibly' said something in the direction of a juror while she was '12 feet away from your client.'\nMerchan said he didn't know what Trump said, but that he'd been 'muttering' and 'gesturing' at the juror, and directed Blanche to talk to his client about his behavior. Blanche then whispered something into Trump's ear.\nThe incident underscores Trump's penchant for acting up in court and the problems his lawyers might have keeping him in check.\nThe drama came on the second day of jury selection. The jury is anonymous so their names weren't used in open court, but the panelists include a salesman, an oncology nurse, an IT consultant, a teacher and a software engineer.\nOverall, the quest to find a jury of 12 people and six alternates who could be 'fair and impartial' when it comes to the polarizing New York native and former commander-in-chief moved at a brisker pace compared to Monday.\nThe trial doesn't sit on Wednesdays, so the process will resume on Thursday.\nRead more on the second day of the Trump trial here →\nTrump needs a different type of swing voter in Manhattan Analysis by Steve Kornacki Trump's legal team argues that the former president faces 'real potential prejudice' in his hush money trial because of its venue: Manhattan, the bluest borough in one of the bluest big cities in America.\nWhether this could actually have any bearing on the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's ability to receive a fair trial is a matter of debate. But simply in terms of its political leanings, Manhattan's partisan bent is stark.\nAs a whole, New York City backed Joe Biden over Trump by a 76-23% margin in 2020. But of the five boroughs that comprise the Big Apple, it was Manhattan that produced Biden's most lopsided margins:\nEach of these boroughs features its own particular demographic and political mix. The lone red redoubt of Staten Island, for instance, has by far the smallest population and is more suburban in character, with considerable local support for secession from the rest of the city.\nThe other four boroughs are densely populated Democratic bastions. But even among these four, Manhattan stands out. Why is it a shade or two bluer than the others? A comparison of its demographics to those of the city as a whole reveals an explanation:\nSimply put, compared to New York City overall, Manhattan is whiter and wealthier and contains a much deeper concentration of white residents with college degrees. That's a demographic mix that, especially in the Trump era, has been political gold for Democrats.\nRegistered voters in Manhattan (one of the sources from which potential jurors are drawn) are more than 10 times more likely to be Democrats (72%) than Republicans (7%). Political engagement runs higher in Manhattan as well: While it accounts for 19.2% of the city's population, it represented 22.9% of all New York City votes cast in 2020.\nThe combination of its size, turnout level and partisan tendencies makes Manhattan one of the biggest single sources of Democratic votes anywhere in the country. To put this in perspective, the 603,040 votes Biden received in Manhattan in 2020 was larger than his total in 20 states.\nWhen it comes to his legal fate in Manhattan, Trump is going to need a very different kind of swing voter.\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — A third House Republican has signed onto an effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson from power, giving his opponents the votes they would need to remove the Republican leader unless Democrats step in to save him.\nRep. Paul Gosar, of Arizona, signed onto the \"motion to vacate\" authored by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia, both Republicans said Friday.

The three Republicans and other hard-right members of the conference are furious at the speaker for bringing up votes to provide aid for Ukraine, particularly without U.S. border security provisions attached.\n'We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neo-cons and the military industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away,' Gosar said in a statement Friday.\nIf brought to the floor, those three Republican votes would be enough to remove Johnson as speaker if all Democrats vote against him. Some Democrats have indicated they would step in to save Johnson, but Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Friday that \"the pre-requisite to the conversation\" about saving Johnson is that the foreign aid bills pass \"in totality.\"\nThe addition of a third Republican on the motion to vacate is a huge blow to Johnson, raising the likelihood that he is either ousted from power or that he's saved by Democrats, which could further undermine him within the conference.\n'Johnson is done,\" said one Republican who supports the speaker. \"It's sad.'\nGreene \"has the votes,\" said another Republican.

'Somebody has to pay for reconstruction,' said former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul, a proponent of using the Russian assets to help Ukraine, in an interview Friday. 'And I think it should be Putin, not the American people.'\nThe REPO Act, which would authorize Biden to confiscate the frozen Russian assets in U.S. banks and transfer them to a special fund for Ukraine, is part of the foreign aid package that has been stalled for months in the House. More than $6 billion of the $300 billion in frozen Russian assets are sitting in U.S. banks. Most of the $300 billion are in Germany, France and Belgium.\nOn Wednesday, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson released the package which would include tens of billions of dollars in aid for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan.\n'I'm going to a allow an opportunity for every single member of the House to vote their conscience and their will on this,' Johnson told reporters, defending his decision to allow the vote to go forward Saturday.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and his government invested heavily in the euro and the dollar over the years to keep the ruble stable, planting some $300 billion worth of foreign currency reserves.\nBut in early 2022, following Putin's invasion of Ukraine, all of the Group of Seven (G7) countries including the U.S., U.K., Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan banded together and froze all of the $300 billion dollars of Russian foreign currency reserves held in banks in those countries, most of the money in Europe.\n'The Russians were surprised when, right after the war started, the Europeans took the exact same measures as the United States, freezing all of the reserves that were there and the Japanese did the same, which is why most of Russia's reserves today are frozen in western banks,' said Chris Miller a professor at the Fletcher School at Tufts University.\nThe idea to confiscate the Russian assets emerged last year and has been hotly contested by economists and foreign policy experts.\nIn a recent op-ed in the New York Times, contributing opinion writer Christopher Caldwell argued that it's a 'terrible idea' to confiscate the Russian funds because other countries might stop investing in the U.S. which could negatively affect the economy in the long run.\n'This could weaken the dollar's status as the main global reserve currency. The dollar is probably the most valuable strategic asset the United States has,' Caldwell argued.\nMcFaul, whose been lobbying for the REPO Act for months, clapped back at Caldwell's assertion and said the use of Russian assets for Ukraine would send an important message to autocratic nations around the world.\n'There are those that say, 'Well, this will hurt the dollar. It's bad for our reputation.' I have a pushback to that. I don't want criminals investing in American Treasury bonds,' McFaul said.\nOne of the diplomatic challenges would be to convince the other G7 countries to do the same. While the U.K. is on board with the idea, France and Germany have been reticent.\n'We're making good progress in how to access that funds on an agreed basis that I think we can take forward to the G7,' U.K. foreign minister David Cameron told reporters April 9.\nAmid the diplomatic maneuverings, one group in the background has been persistently applying pressure on members of Congress, the White House and G7 countries to move forward with the idea of confiscating the funds.\nmembers of Congress, the White House and G7 countries to move forward with the idea of confiscating the funds. The Renew Democracy Initiative, a Washington DC-based nonprofit organization promoting democracy and American interest overseas sent a letter Friday urging Majority Leader Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries to work together to get the REPO Act passed.\n'Your leadership through legislative action will increase the likelihood that the administration does what is necessary to confiscate Putin's billions,' wrote RDI Chairman Garry Kasparov and RDI CEO Uriel Epshtein.\nIn an interview Friday, Epshtein said he believes it will take U.S. action to bring about a G7 collaboration to confiscate the funds.\n'Other G7 countries will only act to confiscate Russian assets if the U.S. leads,' said Epshtein.\nAnna Schecter Natasha Lebedeva Matt Bradley",

But the festivities in Paris are shadowed by security fears and geopolitical tumult. Leila Register / NBC News; Getty Images April 17, 2024, 9:00 AM UTC Start the countdown clock. In exactly 100 days, more than 10,000 athletes and tens of thousands of spectators will converge on Paris for the start of the 33rd Summer Olympic Games, a 16-day extravaganza that marks the first time the City of Lights has hosted the world's pre-eminent sports festival in a century. In keeping with the slogan for this year's Olympics, 'Games Wide Open,' the opening ceremony will take place outside a stadium setting for the first time. The plans are ambitious: a 3.5-mile boat parade along the Seine before as many as 325,000 onlookers on the river's banks. The hundreds of athletic events — hosted by dozens of venues across Paris and other cities in metropolitan France — will likewise be open to large crowds.

Florian Hulleu / AFP - Getty Images In many respects, the Paris Games promise to be one of the most elaborate cultural rituals since Covid swept across the world beginning in late 2019. Health restrictions forced the organizers of Tokyo 2020 and Beijing 2022 to sharply limit the scale of the festivities, with events largely closed to the public. Paris 2024, powered in part by pent-up demand for communal experiences, symbolizes an international post-pandemic vibe shift. But with that spirit of openness comes all-too-familiar challenges. The festivities in Europe's most densely populated city are shadowed by security concerns. The International Olympic Committee and French officials have insisted that they are putting strict security measures in place. Yet the recent history of violence in France — including the 2015 terror attack in Paris that left 138 people dead and at least 416 injured — stalks public consciousness there. A bullet hole through the glass door of a cafe near Casa Nostra in Paris on Nov. 14, 2015, after a terrorist attack. Christopher Furlong / Getty Images file The geopolitical backdrop for the Paris Games is no less troubling. The war between Israel and Hamas recently crossed the six-month mark, raising fears of a protracted conflict and wider regional instability. The devastation in the Gaza Strip has provoked international outrage, isolating Israel on the global stage. Meanwhile, Russia continues to gain ground in its military offensive against Ukraine as some Western nations worry about the rise of authoritarianism. These international crises could come into play during the Games in the form of protests and other political demonstrations. 'It is certain that the international context is particularly tense today,' Tony Estanguet, president of the Games' organizing committee, recently told Radio France. 'I believe in this universal event. It's up to us to preserve, to talk about sport and not to politicize the subject too much.' Nevertheless, Olympics organizers are determined to put on a show that stuns the throngs assembled on the boulevards of Paris, not to mention the millions of people expected to watch the Games unfold on their televisions and mobile devices. If the surge of enthusiasm for the Super Bowl, Taylor Swift, March Madness and the solar eclipse is any guide, then audiences are craving spectacle — and the Paris Games could be just the ticket. Going for the gold The scale of the Paris Games is immense: nearly 40 sports and more than 300 events hosted in at least 35 venues in Paris and other cities across metropolitan France. Following two Games that were hampered by Covid protocols and other tight restrictions, Paris could resemble a colossal international party, heralded by five Olympic rings (fashioned from recycled French steel) that will be displayed on the south side of the Eiffel Tower. 'The last two Olympics certainly didn't have the look and feel of what we expect from the Games,' said Jeremy Fuchs, a sports writer and the author of a 2021 book about the history of the Olympics. 'I would expect Paris to go all out. … With fans back in the stands, we should expect one of the more raucous Games in recent memory.' The iconic landmarks will be immediately recognizable to worldwide TV viewers. Beach volleyball players will show off their jump serves at a temporary outdoor arena at the Champ de Mars, a large public park at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. Equestrian and modern pentathlon competitions will take place at the Palace of Versailles, one of the emblems of French royal history. The 124-year-old Grand Palais will host fencing and taekwondo. At least one venue that hosted events during the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris will be put to use again: Stade Yves-du-Manoir, the home of the opening ceremony 100 years ago. (The stadium also hosted some of the races depicted in the Oscar-winning film 'Chariots of Fire.') This time around, the 117-year-old arena will stage field hockey competitions.

Breaking (also known as break dancing) is set to make its Olympics debut, and three recently introduced competitions — sport climbing, skateboarding and surfing — will be integrated into the Paris Games, too. (Karate, softball and baseball won't be part of the lineup.) The vast majority of events are set to unfold across France, though there is one exception. The surfing competition will take place in a village on the southwestern coast of Tahiti. Paris organizers chose to hold the surfing events on the French Polynesian island because it 'offers an opportunity to engage French overseas territories and their communities in the Olympic Games — for the first time in history — while showcasing France's rich and diverse heritage.'

Manea Fabisch / Tahiti Tourisme / Paris 2024 Paris organizers have signaled that they are attempting to reach younger audiences by featuring sports that are 'closely associated with youth and reward creativity and athletic performance.' But given that relatively few people in their teens and 20s watch traditional linear television, the IOC faces a steep climb in convincing viewers in that age bracket to tune in, according to David Goldblatt, the author of 'The Games: A Global History of the Olympics.' This year's Games will be more widely accessible to at-home viewers thanks in part to streaming. Peacock, the streaming platform owned by NBCUniversal, plans to invest heavily in live coverage of the festivities, including a 'multiview' feature that allows subscribers to watch up to four competitions at the same time. Superstar personalities could help make the case for the Games as must-see TV. Simone Biles, the seven-time Olympic medal-winning gymnast, hopes to compete in Paris. The list of U.S. athletes who could make waves also includes swimmer Katie Ledecky as well as track-and-field sprinters Noah Lyles and Sha'Carri Richardson.

Tom Pennington / Getty Images file David Wallechinsky, a former president of the International Society of Olympic Historians and the author of 'The Complete Book of the Olympics,' said he was most excited about the track-and-field competitions because he believes the sport has the most universal appeal — unlike, say, 'swimming the 400-meter medley or participating in equestrian dressage.' In total, more than 200 countries — known in IOC parlance as national olympic committees, or NOCs — plan to send their most elite athletes to Paris, where most will check into the Olympic Village on the banks of the Seine. Russia and Belarus were banned from the Olympics after Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022 — four days after the conclusion of the Winter Olympics in Beijing. The final stretch In recent months, preparations for the Games have arguably been overshadowed by the grinding realities of war and humanitarian disaster. Paris 2024 is just the latest in a long line of Olympic Games that have taken place against a backdrop of geopolitical turmoil, according to Wallechinsky, who pointed to several key examples. The 1936 Summer Olympics were hosted by Berlin and opened by Adolf Hitler three years before the outbreak of World War II. Twenty-nine countries boycotted the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal to protest the fact that New Zealand's rugby team had toured apartheid South Africa. The massacre of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches by Palestinian members of the Black September terrorist organization cast a pall over the 1972 Summer Games in Munich and underscored the violent tensions that are often inseparable from the athletic competitions at the heart of the Olympics. In the Cold War era, the U.S. led a boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow and the former Soviet Union sat out the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. In the lead-up to the Paris Games, France announced it would deploy 45,000 police, military officers and army troops across the country. The country has requested reinforcements from 46 foreign partners — a 'classic approach adopted by host countries when organizing major international events,' the Interior Ministry has said. Everyone involved in the Games — security officials, building workers, volunteers — will be put through background checks, too. Armed police stand guard on Nov. 14, 2015, overlooking the Eiffel Tower, which was kept dark in honor of those who died in the terrorist attacks the day before. Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images file French government officials also decided to cap the number of people allowed to watch the opening ceremony at 325,000. Two years ago, organizers had proposed making the July 26 opening festivities accessible to as many as 600,000 people, a grand gathering that would span 6 kilometers (roughly 3.7 miles), stretching from the east of Paris to the Trocadéro. In response to a request for comment on the security fears, an IOC spokesperson said French authorities had informed the committee that 'they have been working for a couple of years under the assumption that the highest security measures will be required.' The spokesperson said that, per usual practices, 'there is also very close international cooperation.' 'Based on this and the regular reports the IOC receives from them, we have full confidence in the French authorities and their strong collaboration with their international partners,' the spokesperson added. In the run-up to the opening ceremony, organizers are also confronting markedly less existential issues — including high levels of 'pollution of fecal origin' and other bacteria in the Seine, an environmental headache that might force officials to nix the triathlon swimming section. 'We are working hard on it. You know it's one of the bigger challenges,' Estanguet told reporters this month. In the end, though, spectators around the world will likely be focused on the pageantry and competition, savoring the first full-fledged Olympic Games in more than half a decade.

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Legislation that could ban TikTok in the U.S. unless it cuts ties with its Chinese parent company is on a path to quickly get to President Joe Biden's desk and be signed into law.\nThe bill, which has the backing of Biden and key members of Congress, would allow the administration to ban the popular video-sharing app nationwide if it does not divest from China-based ByteDance within one year.\nA similar bill already passed the House in a lopsided, bipartisan 352-65 vote in March. But it's been stalled in the Democratic-controlled Senate, where Commerce Chairwoman Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., had been looking to put her mark on the bill.\nNow, the House is planning to package a slightly revised TikTok bill with billions in foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, all but guaranteeing the potential TikTok ban will become law.\nUnder the strategy used by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., the House plans to pass the combined foreign aid and TikTok package Saturday night and send it to the Senate, setting up a possible vote in the upper chamber as early as next week.\nIn recent weeks, Johnson's team worked closely with the White House on the package and Biden has already said he will swiftly sign into law the broader package, which also includes other GOP national security priorities like the REPO Act and sanctions against Iran. Biden backed the original TikTok ban legislation in the House as well, though his campaign has an account on the app.\nThe fast-track process for the TikTok bill comes as leaders in both parties, as well as national security officials, warn that the popular video-sharing app is a national security threat. There are worries that the Chinese Communist Party is using TikTok to access data and spy on its American users, spread disinformation and use the app's algorithms to manipulate elections, like the one in November.\nTikTok has argued that the bill amounts to a ban that would violate the First Amendment rights of its millions of U.S. users and harm small businesses that reach customers through the app.\n'It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually,' TikTok said in a statement.\nDubbed the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the House TikTok bill creates a process for the president — through the FBI and intelligence agencies — to designate certain social media applications under the control of foreign adversaries, like China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, as national security threats.\nOnce an app is deemed a risk, it would be banned from online app stores and web-hosting services unless it severed ties with entities under control of the foreign adversary. The legislation specifically cites TikTok as a target.\nThe revised TikTok language would lengthen that divestiture period to nine months, up from the original six months, and would also allow the president to grant an additional, one-time 90-day extension.\nThat change satisfied Cantwell, the Senate Commerce chair, who had slow-walked consideration of the House-passed bill. She said the change was her recommendation.\n\"It assures that divestiture will more likely happen, so we think that's an important part,\" Cantwell told reporters Thursday, adding that other tweaks would have to be put off until later.\n\"They didn't put other language and so we could look at things down the road, but for now we support what they're doing,\" she added.\nWhile there is overwhelming bipartisan backing for the TikTok bill in both chambers, a handful of lawmakers have argued that the legislation would stifle free speech. Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., introduced an amendment that would strip the TikTok language out of the package.\n\"Banning TikTok is beating the same drum as other communist countries controlling what content we are able to see,' Mace said last month. 'Let's not give the government any more power to control social media.'\n'Let's not give the government any more power to control social media.' Progressive Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., who has more than 240,000 followers on TikTok, has led the opposition to the ban on Capitol Hill.\n\"A lot of people on the Hill seem to be ignoring that an outright ban of TikTok would hurt the livelihoods of a lot of working class people, many of whom are people of color,\" Bowman told NBC News.\n\"We need to protect people's constitutional rights of free speech and privacy. We need to pass comprehensive social media safety legislation that protects people on all platforms from Big Tech overreach,\" he said. \"Let's get to work on that, right now.\"\nScott Wong Kyle Stewart Rebecca Kaplan, Frank Thorp V, Kate Santaliz and Sahil Kapur contributed.",

            "excerpt": "Analysis: Don't discount voters' interest in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s third-party candidacy, even if he seems to be trying not to be taken seriously.",
            "summary": "What happens when an electorate wants change but there's no obvious change candidate on the ballot?\nThis question popped into my head after I watched one of Rich Thau's fascinating monthly focus groups of Biden-Trump voters, with the latest edition convening Pennsylvania voters who voted once for either President Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton and once for former President Donald Trump.\nThau has been doing these qualitative monthly check-ins with voters across the country ever since the rise of Trump. For the 2020 election cycle, he gathered voters who voted Obama-Trump. Now, he has shifted the voter résumé to the mix of folks above, still focusing on people who have switched their votes election to election. (Thau and his company, Engagious, are also partnering with NBC News on another recurring focus group project gathering key voting groups in battleground states.) You can see some of the archived focus groups at his website. This is one of those projects that become exponentially more impactful with each new monthly addition to the archives, so pay attention!\nThe headline-grabber for this month's Pennsylvania check-in was the surprising level of interest in Robert F. Kennedy Jr. among these swing voters. In some ways, this shouldn't be a surprise. These voters are by definition not hard partisans, and they certainly aren't pleased with either major party, as they've been comfortable voting against both of them over the last two elections.\nAs I wrote months ago, there was always going to be a moment in this campaign cycle when both major parties had finished their nominating processes and selected Biden and Trump — and yet the public wasn't satisfied with that outcome. We are at that moment.\nSix months ago, while we knew his trials were always going to be a disruptive moment for Trump, it wasn't clear how much other issues were going to be disruptive to Biden. But clearly, the Middle East is becoming a hugely disruptive political issue for him.\nIronically, it was this moment in the calendar that the folks at No Labels had once identified as the perfect time to pick their ticket and start selling it publicly. The convergence of a front-loaded primary calendar with ballot deadlines made it inevitable that an April lull would be an ideal opportunity to fill an obvious void. This spring period in 1992, after it became clear that Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush would be their parties' nominees, was when Ross Perot got an opening — and he used it brilliantly. The strongest 90-day period for Perot's campaign was essentially April 1 to mid-July (the start of the Democratic convention).\nUltimately, No Labels failed to find a compelling ticket, so it has since called off its effort. But No Labels didn't fail because the vacuum of people looking for an alternative to Biden and Trump ceased to exist.\nWith no mainstream third-party alternative available for now, that vacuum is being filled by Kennedy. For many voters, one can tell, he's simply a famous name filling a void. You can hear the lack of knowledge many of these Pennsylvania voters had about Kennedy other than his name, and those who knew something about him knew only a few things. Moreover, it was clear that his best asset was the fact that his last name was neither Trump nor Biden.\nWatching the initial interest in Kennedy's candidacy among these voters serves as a reminder that there was a powerful opportunity for a true potential unity ticket — not one that professed 'centrism' per se, but one that promised to take a partisan timeout for four years and attempt to focus on hard choices to solve hard problems, like immigration.\nBut given the stakes of this election, it has also been clear to me that while an opening exists with the true middle-of-the-road or less partisan crowd, the lane is very narrow. And unless partisans from one or both parties also wanted an alternative, there really wasn't a path to victory.\nBut there is a path to relevancy.\nI'm convinced that if Kennedy were merely just anti-Covid vaccine, rather than anti-most vaccines, the voters he needs to persuade wouldn't view him as skeptically, and that would make others take him more seriously. Every one of these new measles outbreaks around the country has the fingerprints of the anti-vax crowd on it, and whether those outbreaks are in South Florida or Northern California or Oklahoma or elsewhere, they all serve as a reminder that anti-vaccine messaging has done real damage to real human beings.\nDespite all of that, the initial interest in Kennedy does tell me that he is going to be a very powerful 'none of the above' candidate on the ballot.\nNationally I think it's pretty clear Kennedy pulls from both Trump and Biden about evenly, reinforcing this notion he's most likely a placeholder for 'none of the above.' Where this will get tricky is in the battleground states, because I'm not as convinced Kennedy will pull evenly from the two major candidates when you start to measure this in Michigan versus North Carolina or Arizona versus Wisconsin.\nNot all anti-Biden and anti-Trump voters around the country act the same. Military veterans in North Carolina who choose to vote for Kennedy, say, may also vote GOP down the ballot, but they don't trust Trump as commander in chief. And while those votes won't hurt the GOP in other ways, they will lower Trump's support and give Biden a lower 'winning' number to carry North Carolina. If Biden can make 47% a winning number in North Carolina, he'll carry the state.\nKennedy could also become a place to park votes for folks uncomfortable with Biden's execution of foreign policy, particularly all things having to do with Israel and Gaza.\nThat same math problem could affect the Democrats if, say, a big chunk of progressive voters in Michigan or Wisconsin decides both Trump and Biden have the same basic policy toward Israel and they vote for Kennedy as a protest vote. Perhaps that wouldn't hurt Democrats down the ballot in either state, but it would lower the winning number Trump needs to carry either. As in North Carolina for Biden, if Trump can make 47% a winning number in Wisconsin or Michigan, he'll carry it.\nI don't foresee Kennedy's getting north of 'none of the above' territory come Election Day, but the likelihood that he continues to poll in double digits until at least October seems high. And if that means he ends up qualifying for the national debates, then we could enter some rarely charted territory.\nIf he's in the debates, it's a potential opportunity for Kennedy. But I'm hesitant to believe he can make the most of that opportunity, because, so far, every time he has had a chance to grab a mainstream spotlight, he has instead either eagerly traveled down rabbit holes marked 'vaccines' and 'Jan. 6' and 'Kennedy conspiracies' or he has gotten so defensive when asked about them that it quickly derails him.\nDespite every effort by voters wanting to take Kennedy seriously as a candidate, he has a hard time presenting himself as a serious candidate.\nI am curious whether, in a moment when both Trump and Biden are proactively going after Kennedy, the combination of being attacked by both major-party nominees has a bizarre boomerang effect that boosts the independent, especially if Trump and Biden are attacking him for different things.\nBottom line: Pay attention to Kennedy and to voters' flirtation with his candidacy. It has nothing to do with Kennedy the person and everything to do with Trump and Biden. The stronger Kennedy looks in the polls, the more it appears to be a direct reflection on the collective weakness of the two parties. And the stronger he looks in the fall, the more variance you should expect in how the battleground states shake out.\nWhen the news became a reality TV show To say I have a lot of thoughts about O.J. Simpson is an understatement. For one: The impact he had on the news industry and the TV consumption habits of all Americans is quite remarkable.\nLooking back, I now realize the entire O.J. experience — from the feeding frenzy coverage the week Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were murdered to the multiple televised trials over the following three years — is probably one of the five most impactful events to happen in my lifetime.\nObviously, 9/11 tops that list, as does the election of the country's first Black president. I was a teenager when the Challenger space shuttle exploded on live television, and I distinctly remember heading to a Cub Scout meeting the day Ronald Reagan was shot. After those four events, 'where were you when O.J. was in the White Bronco?' is probably next. (I was co-hosting a house party that Friday evening, if you must know.)\nBut looking back, the profound impact Simpson had was on how media and its consumers interact.\nI'd argue that pre-O.J., the news business was a healthy mix of delivering information you needed to know balanced with information we knew you wanted to know. And I'd argue what that episode taught news executives was that the 'news' could be profitable if you packaged it in a way that made consumers want to watch! What if you simply gave consumers what they wanted to know or hear and didn't drive them away by giving them information they didn't want to know or hear?\nneeded to know balanced with information we knew you wanted to know. And I'd argue what that episode taught news executives was that the 'news' could be profitable if you packaged it in a way that made consumers want to watch! What if you simply gave consumers what they wanted to know or hear and didn't drive them away by giving them information they didn't want to know or hear? Thirty years later, I think the media-industrial complex has learned how to deliver everyone what they want to hear to the point that people can live in different realities. We don't have a shared set of facts anymore, because the news business is stuck with a revenue model that provides financial incentives for catering to whoever it thinks are their readers or consumers.\nSadly, it's hard to explain to anyone who was born after the Simpson trial that a different media landscape did exist before. While news networks always wanted more eyeballs, there was a line between news and entertainment that wouldn't get crossed. In trying to explain this pre-O.J. world to my 17-year-old and to some college students I've been meeting with weekly this semester, I realized how hard it's going to be to try to go back to some of the old ways we did business.\nUltimately, you go to war with the army you have, not the one you want. But I hope, as we all look back at the O.J. saga of the '90s and all the bad decisions that were made in the attempt to make that coverage more compelling to viewers, that we don't repeat many of them as we gear up for coverage of at least one, and perhaps two, trials of the century this spring and summer — involving another celebrity from the '70s and the '80s.\nCameras in the courts: Hot take alert I've been unofficially polling friends and colleagues with the following question: When have cameras in the courtroom been truly a good thing for the public as a whole?\nI started from a position of 'I've yet to find one example.' But there was one televised trial that made me hesitate for a minute: the trial of the cops involved in the killing of George Floyd. I think a strong argument can be made that more good than bad came from the televised testimony in that trial.\nBut outside that example, I'm struggling. I don't think cameras were a net plus for the public with Simpson. Ditto Johnny Depp. Now, just because I'm a no-camera guy doesn't mean I'm anti-transparency. I think audio-only, which the Supreme Court temporarily gave us during the Covid-19 pandemic, should become the norm, with all trials available live via audio.\nBut the more I see cameras in the courtroom, the less I believe they have been a net positive for understanding the courts or the justice system. It's clear all the televised courts have given us is access to cheap and free reality TV programming. Click.",

            "excerpt": "The move came after a Hyundai ad appeared next to antisemitic posts from a user who has posted pro-Hitler content.",
            "summary": "The automaker Hyundai said it had paused its advertising on Elon Musk's social media app, X, after a sponsored post from the company appeared next to antisemitic and pro-Nazi posts.\nHyundai confirmed the pause in a statement to NBC News late Wednesday and said it was taking its brand safety concerns to Musk's company.\n'We have paused our ads on X and are speaking to X directly about brand safety to ensure this issue is addressed,' Hyundai said in the statement.\nNancy Levine Stearns, a freelance journalist and X user, posted a screenshot Wednesday of a Hyundai ad running on an X account that often posts Holocaust denial and antisemitism. Stearns has written about brand safety on X for Hill Reporter, a progressive news site.\nJoe Benarroch, head of business operations at X, confirmed the Hyundai pause in an email Thursday in response to questions. He said X was working with Hyundai's marketers to put in place further brand safety controls.\nX also suspended the account that made the antisemitic posts. The account's bio included antisemitic tropes that violated X's policy against abusive profiles, Benarroch said. A note on the account Thursday afternoon said it was 'temporarily unavailable' because it violated policy.\nBenarroch also said a Holocaust-denial post that appeared adjacent to a Hyundai ad would get a label as violating X's policy on 'violent event denial.'\nOn Tuesday, an NBC News investigation documented how X has become a hub for pro-Nazi content. X's policies ban glorifying violence and praising violent entities.\nHyundai is the world's third-largest automaker by sales volume, after Toyota and Volkswagen. Its headquarters are in South Korea, and its brands include Kia.\nThe recent Hyundai ad in question ran on the profile of a user who has defended Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and pushed antisemitic conspiracy theories. Before Thursday's suspension, the account said it was based in Australia. It posted under a pseudonym and had more than 55,000 followers.\nThe account for months has had a blue checkmark signaling that it is a paid 'Premium' subscriber. This month, X began giving blue checkmarks to some unpaid users with more than 2,500 verified followers, making it more difficult to determine who is a paid subscriber, but the account in question has had its blue checkmark for longer.\nNBC News reported Tuesday that under Musk's ownership, X has become a thriving spot for explicitly pro-Nazi content, including speeches by Hitler or content praising his genocidal regime. NBC News found that at least 150 paid 'Premium' subscriber accounts and thousands of unpaid accounts had posted or amplified pro-Nazi content in recent months, often in apparent violation of X's rules.\nSome pro-Nazi content has spread widely, including a post last month with 1.9 million views promoting a false and long-debunked conspiracy theory that 6 million Jews did not die in the Holocaust. On Thursday, X added a label to the post, saying: 'Visibility limited: this Post may violate X's rules against Hateful Conduct.'\nNBC News found ads running on 74 of the 150 'Premium' accounts, either on their profile pages or in the replies below their posts.\nAnother X advertiser, IQAir, said it was adjusting its settings on the platform after NBC News found one of its ads running adjacent to Holocaust denial. IQAir, a Swiss company that makes air quality devices and software, said it was already using X's features designed to let advertisers target certain audiences and exclude other audiences.\n'Our advertisements are set up so that ideally, they do not allow X to reach accounts beyond our target audience,' the company said in an email.\n'However, based on the screen shot you provided, it appears that did not occur in this case,' it said. The company said it did not know why its ad would appear next to extremist content.\nX offers advertisers a feature called 'negative targeting' designed to stop ads from being placed near certain keywords. However, the system does not by default include all potentially problematic keywords. IQAir said it was adding a Holocaust denial hashtag to its list of excluded keywords, and X said it was demonetizing searches for the same hashtag.\n'We do not condone our advertisements running in conjunction with this or any other form of extremist content,' IQAir said.\nNBC News does not have a comprehensive list of advertisers that use X. Each account on social media sees different ads at different times, so it is unknown how many advertisers' ads have run next to pro-Nazi content or Holocaust denial posts.\nX has faced a widespread advertiser backlash since November, when Musk embraced the 'great replacement theory,' which says there is a top-down plot to replace the white population with nonwhite people. Musk responded to a post by a conspiracy theorist by saying, 'You have said the actual truth.'\nDozens of major advertisers, including Disney, Apple and Warner Bros., halted their advertising on X, and as of February many had not resumed. According to the research firm Sensor Tower, 75 out of the top 100 U.S. advertisers on X from October 2022 were not buying ads as of February.\nMusk visited Israel later in November and traveled to the former Nazi death camp Auschwitz in January.\nMusk, also the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said after the Auschwitz visit that he did not know much about antisemitism and considered himself 'Jewish by association.'\n'I must admit to being somewhat frankly naive about this. In the circles that I move, I see almost no antisemitism. … Two-thirds of my friends are Jewish,' he said.\nDavid Ingram",

And, history lessons.

Welcome to Sunday, it's Meet the Press.\nANNOUNCER:\nFrom NBC News in Washington, the longest-running show in television history. This is Meet the Press with Kristen Welker.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nGood Sunday morning. We begin with our brand new NBC News poll and the headline President Biden is closing the gap with former President Trump. Trump leads Biden by two points in a head-to-head matchup, 46 to 44%. Biden has narrowed that deficit against Trump from 5 points in January. And when third party candidates, including Robert F. Kennedy, are included, Biden leads by two points, 39 to 37%. The president's job approval has also ticked up to 42%, up five points from January. The last time we've seen a five-point increase for an incumbent president in their re-election year was Bill Clinton in 1996. There are still troubling numbers in the poll for Biden. He trails Trump by 22 points on dealing with inflation and the cost of living. All of it comes amid a major foreign policy development. Six months after the president delivered an Oval Office speech pleading for wartime aid for Ukraine, $61 billion dollars in new funding finally passed on Saturday 311 to 112.\n[START TAPE]\nREP. MARC MOLINARO:\nThe bill is passed.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nA moment of bipartisanship in a Congress primarily defined by its dysfunction. 101 Republicans and 210 Democrats voted in favor. But more Republicans, 112, opposed it. Congress also passed new aid for Israel and Taiwan, along with a measure to force TikTok parent company ByteDance to sell the app. New aid for Ukraine came only after Republican Speaker Mike Johnson, who once opposed it, did an about-face and put his job on the line to get it through, amid threats from three far right Republicans to oust him.\n[START TAPE]\nSPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON:\nIf we turn our backs right now, the consequences could be devastating.\nREPORTER:\nYou're being asked to resign, will you?\nSPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON:\nNo, listen, I – I – as I've said many times I don't walk around this building being worried about a motion to vacate. I have to do my job. We – we did. I've done here what I believe to be the right thing and that is to allow the house to work its will and as I've said you do the right thing and you let the chips fall where they may.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThe Pentagon has said it has a massive infusion of military aid for Ukraine ready to go. It comes as Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said that without this support, we will have no chance of winning. Ukraine's top military commander issued a bleak assessment of the army's positions on the eastern front, saying they have worsened significantly in recent days. And the top American military commander in Europe told members of Congress that Russia will soon be able to fire ten shells for every Ukrainian shell.\n[START TAPE]\nGEN. CHRISTOPHER CAVOLI:\nIf one side can shoot and the other side can't shoot back, the side that can't shoot back loses.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nJoining me now is the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. President Zelenskyy, welcome back to Meet the Press.\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nGood morning, and greetings to you.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, President Zelenskyy, it is an historic morning. I want to get your reaction to this major news, the House approving $61 billion in aid to Ukraine. It's expected to pass through the Senate. But you have been asking for this aid for six months. In that time, you have run out of ammunition. You've suffered setbacks on the battlefield. Will you get this aid in time to make a difference?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nYeah, it's been so important. And we'd like to say thanks to the Congress for the bipartisan support. And we'd like to say thanks to Speaker Johnson and President Biden. Indeed, it is so important, the support from the United States of America. Of course, we need the support of the American people because, of course, the political decisions depend on the public opinion. And this aid will strengthen Ukraine, and send the Kremlin a powerful signal that it will not be the second Afghanistan. The United States will stay with Ukraine, will protect the Ukrainians, and they will protect – they will protect democracy in the world. This is the show of leadership and strength of the United States. And I think, indeed, now we've reached this important moment. For half a year we've been waiting and I would like to say thanks to all the team on my side and on the U.S. side, the team who did everything so that we would get this positive vote. And today, we definitely need this aid. And Kristen, we really need to get this to the final point. We need to get it approved by the Senate. And then we want to get things as fast as possible so that we get some tangible assistance for the soldiers on the front line as soon as possible, not in another six months, so that they will be able to move ahead.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou know, you said this week, President Zelenskyy, that Ukraine would have 'no chance of winning' without more U.S. support. And I guess the question is can Ukraine now win this war? Or is the United States merely giving you enough aid to prolong this war?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nThank you. I think this support will really strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine. And we will have a chance for victory if Ukraine really gets the weapon system which we need so much. We - thousands of soldiers need so much, and this aid should not be just spread into layers all over, but it has to end up in tangible weapon systems. Some really crucial weapon systems which are hard to get. The long-range artillery and I really appreciate that it mentions ATACMs, long-range weapons. And it's important because we need long-range weapons to not lose people on the front line. Because we have – we have casualties because we cannot reach that far. Our weapons are not that long-range. So we need it, and air defense. This is crucial. These are the priorities now.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, as you know, this aid was held up for half a year because there is fierce opposition to sending war aid to Ukraine, particularly amongst some Republicans. How long should Americans be expected to fund the war in Ukraine?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nThe Americans are not funding the war in Ukraine. They foremost protect freedom and democracy all over Europe. And Ukraine is fighting, and Ukraine is sending its best sons and daughters to the front line and this reduces the price for all Europe, for all NATO. It reduces the price for everyone, including the U.S. as the leaders in NATO. U.S. army now does not have to fight protecting NATO countries. Ukrainians are doing that. And it's only the ammo that the civilized world is providing. And I think it's a good decision. That is why we do need to keep supporting. While Ukraine stands, there's no direct war between U.S. or NATO and Russian aggression. So Ukraine is still fighting, and Ukraine is protecting all the others.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nBut President Zelenskyy, can you give Americans a sense of the timeline? Will you still need as much aid this time next year? Or do you think you can turn the corner on Russia? What's the timeline?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nWell, it depends on when we actually get weapons on the ground, as you said it Kristen. If we get it in half a year. Well, we've had the process to hold for half a year. And we had losses in several directions. The losses in men, in equipment. In the east it was very difficult. And we did lose the initiative there. Now we have all the chance to stabilize the situation and to overtake the initiative. And that's why we need to actually have the weapon systems. When we get it, when we have it in our arms, then we do have the chance to take this initiative and to move ahead to protect Ukraine. But giving U.S. specific timeline of the war, well, it depends on how soon we get this aid. There are so many variables, so many factors. And sometimes when we protect the important line, you retreat because you don't have enough forces and equipment. And then retaking the climb would take two or three times more. And I'm not saying that this is how it's going to end up. But things are possible, and I can give you an example with F-16. It's a great example. The decision to supply F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, we've had it a year ago. One year ago, we got the positive response. Ukraine should receive these fighter jets, so that not only air defense could protect the sky, but we also have more than jets. A year has passed. We still don't have the jets in Ukraine. So it's very difficult to do any forecast. I would like us to be open and very, very specific. From the moment we get our hands on these weapon systems, well, from that moment, we can talk about the timeline.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, Ukrainian intelligence suggests that the Kremlin is preparing for a major offensive in the coming months. You have said by your own account that they are prepared to outgun you ten to one in fire power by some estimations. Will you be ready for that offensive?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nWe are preparing. The personnel is preparing. The soldiers are engaged in training. And I don't want to repeat myself, but we are waiting for the weapon systems because we want to have the brigades fully equipped. Some of them are exhausted. We need to replace them. But these new brigades, they have to have the equipment. Russia wants to mobilize 300,000 people by June 1st. We are getting ready for this. By May 9th, Russia expects that in the east of Ukraine they will take Chasiv Yar city. I visited the region recently. I talked to the soldiers. The soldiers say that they lack equipment. They need to fight Russian reconnaissance drones, which essentially guide the artillery and we need artillery shells. I hope we will be able to stay, and the weapons will come on time, and we will repel the enemy and then we'll break the plans of the Russian Federation with regards to this full-scale offensive.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nI want to ask you, President Zelenskyy, about reports of a lack of morale. Some 650,000 men who are eligible to fight, we are told, have fled Ukraine. You have lowered the draft eligible age, but you've resisted a full call-up of all Ukrainian men. What do you say to young men who don't want to fight, who don't want to risk their lives in this war for their country?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nThis war is the war for the sake of all of us. This is our land. We don't have another place to go. And the citizens of Ukraine understand that. Of course, there are people who don't want to, are not ready. But we do have this mobilization campaign. We do have the draft. We do have a strong army. And we can be frank. In Russia, of course they have more people and people are forced there. So, for example, if someone in Russia is deserting the battlefield, they just shoot them on sight. We cannot do that because we have the democratic values, believe in the democratic country. So, to be frank, in Ukraine we have a lot of people who are ready to protect the motherland. But of course the motivation, the morale can go down, especially when they go to the front line and they see that, well, there are no shells. There is no equipment. That's why the aid from the states is so important. And people need to be trained by professional people and they need to have the equipment to be used so that they have this so people, not only on the training field, but also on the actual battlefield. And then, indeed, they can show the performance on the front line. This is very important.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy –\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\n– And then the morale will go high. And then they will indeed defend the motherland.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThe Washington Post is reporting that Donald Trump has said privately he could end Russia's war in Ukraine by pressuring Ukraine to give up some territory like Crimea, like the Donbas region. What is your reaction and realistically speaking do you see this war ending in a negotiation with Russia.\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nLet's just say that, well, I'm a president of a country at war. And rumors and different hearsay, I don't believe that. When Trump comes here and would tell me their formula of peace, then I would be able to provide the response. At the moment, I know that, well, things Putin wants to show, they cannot happen.And I'm sure that people who know him well, they know. But you can never trust Putin. It's impossible. So the strategy of ending the war should be based not on the words which Putin says or some other people from his entourage say, but on something very specific. Something – something very tangible in Ukraine that is independent and democratic. And I'm confident that everyone is interested in that. All the political leaders in the U.S., they are also interested to have Ukraine independent and sovereign and democratic. It's of interest for both the Republicans and the Democrats.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, back in February Donald Trump encouraged Putin to invade NATO countries that he doesn't believe are contributing enough to defense spending. What kind of a message do you think that sends to the world?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nWell, I don't know the details of that speech. I know for sure if Ukraine fails, then Putin – then Putin definitely will invade the Baltic countries. Why? Not because there's some interesting idea, strategy, but because Putin wants to return the influence of the Soviet Union. And he really wants to retake the force to war. He wants to retake all former Soviet republics and now independent states. Whether they are in the NATO or not, he doesn't care. That is why this is his strategy. Of course, after the Baltic states, also Poland and parts of Germany would also –\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, big picture. Germany's top military official has warned that Putin could be ready to attack NATO countries in as soon as five years, following up on what you're saying. How big of a threat do you see Putin to the West?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nI think he does want to go further. As I said, he wants to reinstate Soviet Union and the Soviet – the Soviet bloc. And they do that in terms of information, misinformation. They just drive different political groups and democracies. Not only Europe, in Latin America, in Africa, they have the influence everywhere. And they do this to split the world. So the risk is high. I think this German diplomat said that it's not even about the wish of Putin, but it's that if Putin is not stopped, then Putin is ready to attack NATO. Even look at the sheer size of the army and the weapons that they have. So we have to be ready to stop him now. Because the froze in conflicts, well, we've seen that in Georgia. We've seen that in other countries. So if we give the big pause to Putin, if we freeze the war right where we are, this will enable him because all his industry will start working not for the war in Ukraine, but will start working for the war against NATO.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, you are not just a president. You are also a father. You have survived multiple assassination attempts. Tens of thousands of your fellow citizens have been killed and injured. Millions have left their homes. Have you ever lost hope?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nYou can never lose hope. You can never lose hope. You can never lose freedom. You can never lose independence. Otherwise, you just lose everything. You lose your state. You lose your security for your children, for – all the children in Ukraine are my children. I will then lose everything. And I have to show the example. If I lose hope, well, my children would lose their future independent country. And then we would lose Ukraine as – as the nation. It's not only about the territory. It's about ourselves, our identity. So we cannot lose hope. We've had different moments, some very cruel. There were moments of challenge. And I'm sure in the history of the United States they also had many moments when the people of the U.S. had to fight for their independence. We remember the period of struggling, when many people lost hope. Or some people emigrated to France. But some people raised the banner, the United States, the banner of independence. And some people were skeptical on both sides of the ocean, in Europe too. But people didn't give up. And I think, well, you got the independent country. And the world got this great democracy. So we cannot lose hope either.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, thank you for being here on this monumental morning. We really appreciate your perspective and having a chance to talk to you. When we come back, Steve Kornacki is here with the results of our latest NBC News poll.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. For more on the NBC News poll, I'm joined by National Political Correspondent Steve Kornacki to break down the numbers. A lot of headlines here, Steve.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nAbsolutely, Kristen. I think the biggest headline, this. Let's give you the bottom line. Donald Trump does lead Joe Biden 46% to 44% in our poll. But this is a tightening from our last poll. You could see three months ago Donald Trump had a five-point lead against the current president. That five-point lead, now down to two points, so there is progress here for Biden in the last three months.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nComing after the State of the Union, and he's had a campaign blitz.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nYeah, and the Democratic primaries, such as they were, coming to an end. Perhaps there's Democrats rallying around Biden, too. Also, I think not coincidentally, this slight improvement here for Biden tracks with a slight improvement in his job approval rating. It now sits at 42%. Again, go back to our last poll, look at this. He was in all-time-low-for-him territory last time around. Now up back over 40%, the highest Biden's job approval has been in our poll since last spring. So, again, these are encouraging signs for Joe Biden; although, broader picture here, this 42% approval rating, history says probably by itself not enough. He's probably going to need more because put this in some context here: these are other recent presidents. At this point in their reelection campaigns, where were their approval ratings? Again, you see Biden's 42%. One thing that jumps out: they were all higher than Joe Biden. The other thing, the two presidents on this list who did not win reelection of course: Donald Trump four years ago, he was at 46%; and back in 1992 George H.W. Bush, he was at 43%. Biden below both of those. The last time Biden's been at this level, 46%, you've got to back to the start of 2023. The last time he was higher than that, you've got to go back to the summer of 2021, his first year as president. So Biden has some work to do on that front. And also troubling for the Biden campaign, the erosion of public confidence on a number of critical fronts. We asked voters in this poll about a number of leadership characteristics here. \"Which candidate would be better?\" There are two, only two, where Biden has the edge over Trump. Abortion, we've talked about this one, seen this for a long time here.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThat's a big one.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nIt is. Certainly, that's the biggest Biden advantage in this poll. And then bringing the country together, Biden you see performing better than Trump. But I think the headline here is you add those two numbers together, you're not even close to 100. That means a lot of voters think neither candidate is better on that. And then on every other front here, we talk about the erosion for Biden and now, you start to see it. Look at these numbers. Trump advantages on all of these traits.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd I stop here because competent and effective, that was President Biden's, the crux of his campaign pitch back in 2020.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nAnd we actually polled this question in 2020, and it was basically the exact opposite. It was Biden with about a ten-point advantage over Trump and, again, same with handling of crisis. Biden had the edge over Trump. And how about this? It's the former president, the current president. We don't really see matchups like this. Well, now we can measure it. Who has the strongest record as president? And, again, Trump outpacing Biden on that front. And, again, you've got to mention this one, too. \"Necessary mental and physical health.\" We asked this four years ago, it was a wash. It's now a clear liability for Joe Biden. So these are all troubling numbers for Biden, but it's not to say there aren't warning signs for Donald Trump in this poll either.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, Trump and his campaign are hoping a third-party candidate might give them a little bit of a boost, but our poll shows it's a little bit murkier than that.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nThat's the thing, because, again, we show a 46-44 race here for Donald Trump. Again, all those liabilities for Biden, Trump only ahead two. What the Trump folks have been hoping is RFK, third-party candidates, they gobble up some votes and Trump doesn't need to get to 50%. But look what happens when we add RFK's name to the mix. Suddenly, we have a new leader. Joe Biden, 39%; Donald Trump, 37%. There's Kennedy getting 13%. In other words, we're seeing by a better than 2:1 margin, it's Trump voters who are flipping over to Kennedy in this scenario, not Biden voters. You see it right here. 15% of Trump voters, when we add RFK's name to the mix, they go to RFK. Only 7% of Biden voters. There's a big change right there.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nDefies conventional wisdom. There's no doubt about that.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nAbsolutely. I think we haven't seen this in other polls. And one final note, Kristen, as well, is the question of enthusiasm. And I thought this really jumped out here. The most engaged voters, those who voted in 2020, voted in the midterm elections, those folks are voting for Biden by nine points. Where Trump's strength is, why he leads Biden, it's voters who don't typically turn out in many elections. Didn't vote in '20, didn't vote in '22, they are with Trump by more than 20 points. And the warning sign for Trump in relying on this kind of voter is this: we are seeing the lowest level of –\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWow.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\n– interest since we started asking this question back in 2008. \"Are you very interested in the election?\" Sixty-four percent, that's lower than any other time at this point where we have polled this before. So, again, lower interest. Maybe those voters who in the polls are saying they're for Trump, are we sure they're going to actually vote in November? The Trump campaign better hope so.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWe'll have to see if that ticks up if we get closer to Election Day. Steve Kornacki, thank you so much for being here.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nYou got it.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWe really appreciate it. When we come back, the jury will hear opening statements in Donald Trump's first criminal trial. What impact will it have on voters? The panel is next.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. The panel is here: NBC News chief Washington correspondent Andrea Mitchell; Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher; and Matt Gorman, former senior communications advisor for Tim Scott for America. Andrea, I have to start with you. There's a lot to unpack. Let's start with President Zelenskyy. What were your key takeaways from our conversation?\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nThat he's really worried about the surge – the Russian surge in what we expect to be May, June, July. This six months was critical. They had a really good chance of winning, before the six months of no aid from the U.S., the weapons that only the U.S. can provide. And after six months, they can lose. They can lose, if the weapons don't get there soon enough. So now it's supply chain. He pointed out that the F-16s are still not there, and they were approved a year ago. And talking to Ukrainian officials, and you heard him today, they need the long-range weapons. They still don't have the ATACMS, those long-range missiles. They're supposedly in the package, the administration is deciding. Ukrainian officials say they've got to get them because the Russian launches, the artillery launches, not only do they have the ammo – they don't have the ammo, they don't have the manpower, Ukraine doesn't have any more – but Russia has that huge advantage, 10:1 in artillery, but they can't take that artillery out, because they don't have the long-range missiles. U.S. has been really worried about not letting them fire into Russian territory. The Ukrainians tell me they really want to, but they do have that restriction. They have restrictions that, frankly, are not placed on Israel. And they're watching Israel getting, you know -- despite all the controversy over Gaza, Israel has the support that Ukraine doesn't have. And I also think that it was really interesting that he ducked the two questions you asked about Donald Trump. He knows this is a close election. And the bottom line is he knows that Donald Trump has said that Ukraine can be forced at the negotiating table to give territory up to Russia. By next November, if Donald Trump is elected, I think it's all possible that Ukraine can still lose this war, despite their great spirit.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, I'm so glad that you bring up two points: One, that he did choose his words very carefully on Donald Trump; and the factor of Israel, the fact that Ukraine is so concerned, Matt Gorman, that the world has forgotten about them as attention has turned to the Middle East, to what's happening in Gaza. And of course, House Speaker Mike Johnson really at the center of the battles for more aid for Ukraine and Israel. Both were approved yesterday, but there's so much opposition within his own party, three conservative Republicans threatening to oust him over this. But it seemed like the temperature was turned down a little bit, yesterday. What is your assessment? How in jeopardy is his job?\nMATT GORMAN:\nIn the short term, not as much as I think people think. The real threat to Mike Johnson isn't now; it's November, it's post-election. Republicans are going to choose their leaders for the next Congress. They'll already have to choose a Senate leader. I think, until then, Democrats and Republicans will cobble together a majority on a motion to vacate, if it comes up. And I think Republicans want to hold on until then. Let's face it: also, too, no one really wants to be speaker right now, other than Mike Johnson. I thought it was notable that Steve Scalise and Tom Emmer voted with Johnson; notable who didn't, Elise Stefanik. If a successful move is going to be made, it's not until November.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYeah. Only member of the Republican leadership who did not vote for it. Cornell, let's talk about this poll: President Biden narrowing the gap with former President Trump, not a big surprise. But what stood out to you in the crosstabs?\nCORNELL BELCHER:\nWhat stands out to me is – well, first of all, great interview, by the way, groundbreaking interview. Spot on. What stood out to me is – surprise, surprise – polls are closing. And polls continue to shrink and get tighter and tighter because that's what happens in this country. And if you go back to our polling, go back to our polling back in October of last year, Donald Trump was at 46%. What is he, throughout all our NBC polling? He's at 46%. What is he at right now? At 46%. Donald Trump, what did he get in the last election? He got 46%. His support stays solid. Where I'm worried about or where I see you can see growth here is, I think Donald Trump is at his ceiling, and Biden is close to his floor. Where he's off most? He's off most among young voters. He is – and the other part about this is the enthusiasm, which I think is really the headline, is that if these young voters aren't enthusiastic and they don't show up and break for Biden big, that's how Trump wins.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAndrea, pick up on that point, because this is all going on against the backdrop of Donald Trump in court for his first criminal trial this week.\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nYet, the fact is we don't know how that is going to play. Up until now, these legal cases have only helped him fundraising, made him, you know, tell people he's a victim, energized his base. And so he's risen in the polls with every indictment. Now, we're going to see him really powerless. The judge has been very effective. And how they handle the gag order is yet to be seen, while Joe Biden is campaigning. The problem for Joe Biden and the Democrats is it's is crowding out – the trial is crowding out the trial, is crowding out everything else. So Joe Biden goes out and does major policy things, the steel tariffs in Pennsylvania, everything else that he's doing. Student loans is breaking through, a lit bit. But everything else is crowded out. And it's the Trump story. And that's what happened in 2016 to Hillary Clinton. And that could be replicated this year. I think it's really – I think the enthusiasm issue and the young voter issue is critical. And as long as this war in Gaza goes on, this is going to be a problem with young voters because they have off ramp. That off ramp is RKF Jr. And I know your poll shows that RKF Jr. would hurt Trump more than Biden, hypothetically, and it's very early in polling, you know, to say who, but I know the White House is more afraid of –\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nIs jittery, yeah.\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nThe family certainly is because it was very hard for those siblings to come out and do that. They only did it because they think he really hurts them, Joe Biden, more than Donald Trump.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nMatt Gorman, what about all of that?\nMATT GORMAN:\nYeah. Look, I was encouraged because when I was going into the trial, I was nervous that all the talk was going to be simply coming from Trump, his message was going to be about himself and the trial. I was surprised, going in the bodega, I thought it was smart, it leaned into issues like immigration, the migrant crisis, and crime that are winning issues, as we saw in the poll, for Republicans and Trump. He needs to continue to do that, get a message that's not just about himself, while he's sitting in the courtroom.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nHow does the courtroom optics play, Cornell?\nCORNELL BELCHER:\nAndrea, you're spot on about him – about him dominating the news, but it's negative news, right? This is different –\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nThat's a very good point.\nCORNELL BELCHER:\nAnd he doesn't look strong. He looks - he looks weak there. And so, to a certain extent, I don't –I don't mind if he's in court every day, dominating the news, because it's negative news.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nOkay. All right. Great conversation. We covered a lot of ground, but thank you.\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nCongratulations on a great interview.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThank you, Andrea. Thank you, all. When we come back, as the athletes prepare for the Summer Olympics in Paris, we look back on the U.S. decision to boycott the games after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Our Meet the Press Minute is next.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. We have officially crossed the 100-day mark to the 2024 Olympics, as Paris prepares to host the competition, this summer. But the Olympics are not just about sports; they've also made history. The United States led an international boycott of the 1980 games in Moscow to protest the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. President Jimmy Carter announced his historic decision right here on Meet the Press.\n[START TAPE]\nPRES. JIMMY CARTER:\nNeither I know the American people would support the sending of an American team to Moscow with Soviet invasion troops in Afghanistan. I'll send a message today to the United States Olympic Committee, spelling out my own position, that unless the Soviets withdraw their troops, within a month, from Afghanistan, that the Olympic games be moved from Moscow to an alternate site or multiple sites, or postponed, or canceled. If the Soviets do not withdraw their troops immediately from Afghanistan within a month, I will not support the sending of an American team to the Olympics.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd you can watch the Paris Olympics this summer on NBC and streaming on Peacock. When we come back, presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin joins me for our Meet the Moment conversation with lessons from the past, as America's democracy is being tested once again.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. As she likes to say, Doris Kearns Goodwin has spent most of her career writing about dead presidents, immersing herself in their papers, diaries and letters in an attempt to being them back to life. In a new book, \"An Unfinished Love Story,\" the presidential historian turns that same attention to her marriage. Before his death, she opened more than 300 boxes of documents and memorabilia with her husband Richard Goodwin, who served as a speechwriter for President John F. Kennedy: a time capsule of their life in the 1960's. In her twenties, Doris was chosen to be a White House fellow for President Lyndon Johnson, one of only three women out of the 16 fellows selected, and developed a loyalty and closeness to President Johnson which has lasted her entire life. I sat down with Doris for a Meet the Moment conversation on her new book and the resilience of America, even in turbulent times.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou have typically written presidential biographies. This is a biography to some extent of your husband, and it is also a love story. What was the process like of writing this book as compared to all of your other incredible works?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nWell, I was so used to writing about presidents who had archives, and I would want to talk to them. I knew them so well, because it took me so long to write those books, longer to write the book about World War II than the war to be fought, longer to write about the Civil War than twice the Civil War. And I would always ask them questions, and they never answered me. So this time, I had this guy, my guy, right across the hall from me in the same study, and I was able to talk to him. And he could answer my questions. And he had an archive – a mini archive of what presidents have – memos, diaries, letters. He just had saved everything in 300 boxes and finally decided when he turned 80 to open them. And what it really opened was a door to the 1960s, a decade that I'd lived in but I was able to learn through him starting at the beginning with John Kennedy, ending with Bobby Kennedy's death and the Democratic Convention.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou talk about the fact that after your husband passed, it was a struggle for you to finish this project that was a labor of love. You write, \"I found myself edging toward a commitment to finish the project influenced by headlines announcing divisions between Black and white, old and young, rich and poor, divisions that made it increasingly evident that the momentous issues emanating from the '60s remain the unresolved stuff of our everyday lives.\"\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nYeah, I think that's what really decided me. I knew if I were going to work on it, it was going to take years. My books take so long, so it was a huge commitment, and I was going to be writing as an historian, not simply as somebody writing about my husband. And so, once I realized that the '60s really had a message to the people today, and I believe that's so. Because we look at the '60s in a sad way because it ended with the riots, it ended with anti-war violence, it ended with Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy being killed. But when you start at the beginning, it was a decade in which young people in particular were powered by the conviction they could make a difference. And they joined the Peace Corps. The people who were in the Freedom Rides and the sit-ins, in the marches against segregation, marches for the vote. The beginning of the women's movement is there, the gay rights movement. It's a time when the air is filled with that belief that if you work together, you can change the government.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, when you look across the political spectrum, do you see leaders right now who are meeting this moment where so many people wonder if our democracy will stay intact?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nI mean, I don't know that we're fighting it the same way we need to be. This is one of the most perilous moments, and there are people obviously in local areas. There are people in states. There are some people in Washington. But the overall sense is, sometimes we've become too much of spectators watching what's happening to ourselves. And – and one of the things Dante said is that \"The lowest place in Hell are for those people in a moral crisis who remain neutral or remain silent.\" We are in a moral crisis right now, and that's what history – I always feel so – so positive about what history can teach us, because we've lived through really hard times before. And these are hard times, however, and it won't get better unless we act, unless we take seriously our citizen responsibilities and use the qualities of character that we need to bring into politics.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nHow afraid, how concerned are you that January 6th could happen again?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nWell, because we're not remembering it correctly. That – that – what history – I was so certain as an historian, and I was on television saying, \"This is going to change public sentiment.\" Just as certain things happened in the '50s that made people understand in the '60s that slavery had to be ended, public sentiment finally got changed. I thought it had, but everything is so breaking news today, and one thing tops on another. I thought the summer after January 6th when the hearings took place, that would change public sentiment. But I still think in the end that the majority of the people understood what happened in that election. I think the majority of people are for the basic values that we're talking about right now for democracy. And it's just a matter of them speaking out and recognizing that it is in danger, and it's up to us. It's not up to somebody else, it's up to us to save it.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd the Republican nominee has yet to accept the results of the last election. Within the context of this conversation and your concerns about the nation's democracy, how much of a threat do you think the democracy is facing right now, and do you think the country can survive this threat?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nWell, I think the real threat is when the Republican – former President says that \"if he doesn't win, he won't accept the results of this next election,\" which means that we may have a recurring battle for who's really – who's really elected each time we do this. And that's a real problem. I mean, all the candidates, when you look at the ones who lost, it's really hard to lose, and every single one was able to say, as – as Carter did, \"I promised I'd never tell you a lie. This hurts, it really hurts.\" Or Al Gore working on that concession speech that my husband was honored enough to help him on, where he talked about the fact, \"The law of the land has said that this election is lost. I don't agree with it, but I must do it.\" And Hillary Clinton say, \"We not only believe in the transition of power, we cherish it.\" I looked at all those, and it just makes you so proud of each one of those candidates who had been through an election. They'd lost it, they'd let down their constituents, and they were able to make that transfer of power. And it's an essential part of our democracy that has to happen this next November.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAs we sit here today, how concerned are you that it may not happen?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nI am concerned that it may not happen, but I somehow think if the majority of the people come out who have different values from that and they vote, voting is absolutely essential. It's the premium value. As Lyndon Johnson said, \"It's the – it's the one thing that all the rest of our democracy depends on.\" And what is democracy? You throw a candidate out or you call him in. You either want him to come in, or you want to throw him out. We have to be able to do that. And I think, if the majority comes out to vote, and the majority never comes out in enough numbers to vote, not only young people. They've made a big difference in 2020, 2018, 2022, and they're saying now that they may not vote if they're not happy with either candidate. Again, if they only could know what we felt like in the '60s when we felt we were making a difference, you feel larger. You feel a sense of – of exhilaration, the word you used earlier. And I just hope they feel that this election could turn on them, and the uncommitted people and the undecided people have to come out and vote, and we have to just take the results of the election. That doesn't mean we know how it's going to happen, but if the overwhelming majority vote, then somehow maybe it won't be as close as we think it is going to be. And then we'll have a clear-cut choice.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nI hear so much optimism in your voice still.\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nYes, I think I was born that way, and I think it's the only way we can live. I mean, it sometimes may sound naïve. I remember thinking what I was feeling when I was at the Civil Rights march, that we're going to change America. Maybe we didn't change America completely, but we made huge changes at that time. And if you have optimism, at least you have the confidence that if you act, something will happen. And it may take a long time, as – as Martin Luther King talked about, \"the arc of the universe,\" all that stuff takes a long time, but it moves toward justice. And I do believe that.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThank you, Doris Kearns Goodwin for this incredible conversation.\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nThank you. I'm so glad to have been with you.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell that's all for today, thanks for watching. We'll be back next week, because if it's Sunday it's Meet the Press.",

            "excerpt": "Anderson chronicled his abduction and torturous imprisonment by Islamic militants in his best-selling 1993 memoir 'Den of Lions.' He died Sunday at his home, his daughter said.",
            "summary": "LOS ANGELES — Terry Anderson, the globe-trotting Associated Press correspondent who became one of America's longest-held hostages after he was snatched from a street in war-torn Lebanon in 1985 and held for nearly seven years, has died at 76.\nAnderson, who chronicled his abduction and torturous imprisonment by Islamic militants in his best-selling 1993 memoir 'Den of Lions,' died on Sunday in at his home in Greenwood Lake, New York, said his daughter, Sulome Anderson.\nThe cause of death was unknown, though his daughter said Anderson recently had heart surgery.\nAfter returning to the United States in 1991, Anderson led a peripatetic life, giving public speeches, teaching journalism at several prominent universities and, at various times, operating a blues bar, Cajun restaurant, horse ranch and gourmet restaurant.\nHe also struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder, won millions of dollars in frozen Iranian assets after a federal court concluded that country played a role in his capture, then lost most of it to bad investments. He filed for bankruptcy in 2009.\nUpon retiring from the University of Florida in 2015, Anderson settled on a small horse farm in a quiet, rural section of northern Virginia he had discovered while camping with friends. `\n'I live in the country and it's reasonably good weather and quiet out here and a nice place, so I'm doing all right,' he said with a chuckle during a 2018 interview with The Associated Press.\nIn 1985 he became one of several Westerners abducted by members of the Shia Muslim group Hezbollah during a time of war that had plunged Lebanon into chaos.\nAfter his release, he returned to a hero's welcome at AP's New York headquarters.\nAs the AP's chief Middle East correspondent, Anderson had been reporting for several years on the rising violence gripping Lebanon as the country fought a war with Israel, while Iran funded militant groups trying to topple its government.\nOn March 16, 1985, a day off, he had taken a break to play tennis with former AP photographer Don Mell and was dropping Mell off at his home when gun-toting kidnappers dragged him from his car.\nHe was likely targeted, he said, because he was one of the few Westerners still in Lebanon and because his role as a journalist aroused suspicion among members of Hezbollah.\n'Because in their terms, people who go around asking questions in awkward and dangerous places have to be spies,' he told the Virginia newspaper The Review of Orange County in 2018.\nWhat followed was nearly seven years of brutality during which he was beaten, chained to a wall, threatened with death, often had guns held to his head and often was kept in solitary confinement for long periods of time.\nAnderson was the longest held of several Western hostages Hezbollah abducted over the years, including Terry Waite, the former envoy to the Archbishop of Canterbury, who had arrived to try to negotiate his release.\nBy his and other hostages' accounts, he was also their most hostile prisoner, constantly demanding better food and treatment, arguing religion and politics with his captors, and teaching other hostages sign language and where to hide messages so they could communicate privately.\nHe managed to retain a quick wit and biting sense of humor during his long ordeal. On his last day in Beirut he called the leader of his kidnappers into his room to tell him he'd just heard an erroneous radio report saying he'd been freed and was in Syria.\n'I said, ‘Mahmound, listen to this, I'm not here. I'm gone, babes. I'm on my way to Damascus.' And we both laughed,' he told Giovanna DellÓrto, author of 'AP Foreign Correspondents in Action: World War II to the Present.'\nHe learned later his release was delayed when a third party who his kidnappers planned to turn him over to left for a tryst with his mistress and they had to find someone else.\nAnderson's humor often hid the PTSD he acknowledged suffering for years afterward.\n'The AP got a couple of British experts in hostage decompression, clinical psychiatrists, to counsel my wife and myself and they were very useful,' he said in 2018. 'But one of the problems I had was I did not recognize sufficiently the damage that had been done.\n'So, when people ask me, you know, ‘Are you over it?' Well, I don't know. No, not really. It's there. I don't think about it much these days, it's not central to my life. But it's there.'\nAt the time of his abduction, Anderson was engaged to be married and his future wife was six months pregnant with their daughter, Sulome.\nThe couple married soon after his release but divorced a few years later, and although they remained on friendly terms Anderson and his daughter were estranged for years.\n'I love my dad very much. My dad has always loved me. I just didn't know that because he wasn't able to show it to me.,' Sulome Anderson told the AP in 2017.\nFather and daughter reconciled after the publication of her critically acclaimed 2017 book, 'The Hostage's Daughter,' in which she told of traveling to Lebanon to confront and eventually forgive one of her father's kidnappers.\nTerry Anderson arrives to a festive welcome at Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Va., on Dec. 12, 1991. Barry Thumma / AP 'I think she did some extraordinary things, went on a very difficult personal journey, but also accomplished a pretty important piece of journalism doing it,' Anderson said. 'She's now a better journalist than I ever was.'\nTerry Alan Anderson was born Oct. 27, 1947. He spent his early childhood years in the small Lake Erie town of Vermillion, Ohio, where his father was a police officer.\nAfter graduating from high school, he turned down a scholarship to the University of Michigan in favor of enlisting in the Marines, where he rose to the rank of staff sergeant while seeing combat during the Vietnam War.\nAfter returning home, he enrolled at Iowa State University where he graduated with a double major in journalism and political science and soon after went to work for the AP. He reported from Kentucky, Japan and South Africa before arriving in Lebanon in 1982, just as the country was descending into chaos.\n'Actually, it was the most fascinating job I've ever had in my life,' he told The Review. 'It was intense. War's going on — it was very dangerous in Beirut. Vicious civil war, and I lasted about three years before I got kidnapped.'\nAnderson was married and divorced three times. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by another daughter, Gabrielle Anderson, from his first marriage.",

            "excerpt": "Abortion is at the center of President Joe Biden's re-election campaign — an improbability for a politician who long expressed his personal discomfort with the practice.",
            "summary": "The issue has been particularly fraught for Biden, an 81-year-old steeped in Catholic teachings and reliant on religious faith to cope with unthinkable tragedy: the deaths of two children and his first wife, Neilia.\n'One of the things that carried him through his numerous difficulties is his Catholic approach of giving yourself to the Lord,' said Ted Kaufman, a longtime Biden confidant and his former Senate chief of staff.\nOn a human level, Biden has never fully overcome his misgivings about abortion. That's evident even in the language he occasionally uses. Two years ago, talking to reporters before he boarded Air Force One, Biden referred to the procedure as aborting 'a child' rather than a fetus, a clue about the point at which he believed life began.\nStill, his stance is that he won't impose his personal views on Americans who believe differently. In 1974, the year he said in an interview that Roe. v. Wade went 'too far,' he also voiced opposition to a constitutional amendment to ban abortion, albeit with some ambivalence, a hometown news report at the time shows.\nA column in the Morning News of Wilmington in January 1974 said Biden told a group of anti-abortion activists: \"I am not sure my stand against such a constitutional amendment is right, nor am I sure the anti-abortionist stand is right, but right now I think I am more right than you are.\"\nLauren Hitt, a campaign spokesperson, said in a prepared statement: 'Joe Biden has opposed abortion bans since the 1970s. As a senator, he voted repeatedly to protect Roe, and as President, he has used his full executive authority to fight back on extreme MAGA attacks on reproductive freedom.'\nBiden described the tensions between faith and policy last year at a Maryland fundraising event.\n'I happen to be a practicing Catholic,' he said. 'I'm not big on abortion. But guess what? Roe v. Wade got it right.'\nA look at his record shows that his path has had its share of starts and stops. As a senator in 1982, he voted in a committee meeting in favor of a constitutional amendment that would have given states the power to restrict abortion if they chose, effectively overturning Roe v. Wade.\nAt the time, Biden said his aim was to push the vote to the Senate floor, where it would finally be resolved. The measure never got that far, and when it came up again the next year, he voted against it.\nIn 2019, as the Democratic front-runner for the presidential nomination, he reversed his long-held position in favor of the so-called Hyde Amendment banning federal funding for abortions.\nThat about-face came at head-spinning speed. One day, his campaign said he supported the Hyde Amendment; the next day, amid blowback from fellow Democrats, he dropped that position. He justified the switch by saying he could no longer support the policy because Republicans were restricting access to abortion in poor neighborhoods.\n'Joe Biden is an Irish Catholic kid from Scranton,' said John Carr, founder of the Initiative on Catholic Life and Social Thought at Georgetown University. 'He seems to stay with Catholic orthodoxy until he thinks the political or other costs are too high.'\nBiden recognized early on that his nuanced position — wary of abortion at his core, accepting of abortion rights in the public square — was bound to cause him grief. He told fellow Sen. Abe Ribicoff of Connecticut in 1973 that his stance would most likely please no one, according to his 2007 memoir, 'Promises to Keep.'\nThat proved prescient.\nIn Biden's first year as president, conservative Catholic bishops argued that he shouldn't receive communion given his backing of abortion rights. He met privately with Pope Francis at the Vatican in October of that year, and afterward he said the pope had assured him that communion shouldn't be withheld.\nKathleen Sebelius, who was health and human services secretary in President Barack Obama's administration, said in an interview that she sympathized with Biden's predicament.\n'I'm born and raised Catholic and went to Catholic schools for 17 years of my life,' said Sebelius, a former governor of Kansas. 'I understand this issue. I've been called out by the archbishop. I was ordered not to take communion.\n'I've been on the personal side of this and the political side of this, and I understand the struggle that those of us who are raised in a faith community and then live in a political world deal with,' she added. 'It's not easy. I think Nancy Pelosi [the former House speaker, who is also Catholic] understands that. I think Joe Biden understands it. It's not a simple choice.'\nWhatever Biden's journey, most advocates say they now have full confidence that he is a reliable champion of abortion rights. When Biden left the Senate in 2009, he had a 100% rating from what was then called NARAL Pro-Choice America, a group promoting abortion access.\n'Biden is not the same man as he used to be when it comes to abortion rights,' said Ilyse Hogue, former president of the organization. 'I don't think he's been hiding his agenda just to win a second term and then secretly plans to turn around and become this anti-choice guy. I'm not worried about it at all.'\nSome still don't believe Biden goes far enough to promote reproductive rights.\nRenee Bracey Sherman, founder and a co-executive director of We Testify, an abortion rights advocacy group, said Biden should use his megaphone to remove the stigma tied to abortion instead of airing his personal doubts. She pointed to recent surveys indicating that 6 in 10 Catholics support abortion rights.\n'He's the president of the United States; he's not the pope of the United States,' Bracey Sherman said. 'I'm sorry, he's allowed to have his personal feelings. But at the end of the day, he is the president, and he is supposed to defend the Constitution and people in this country who need abortions.'\nBracey Sherman said her organization reached out to the Biden administration multiple times offering to bring Catholics who have had abortions into the White House to share their stories — but has yet to hear back.\n'He makes it seem as though he's the one who's following the Catholic teachings,' she said. 'But what about the rest of the Catholics in America who do support access to abortion and have abortions?'\nElections are a choice. Even Biden detractors say they're fully aware that the only realistic alternative at this point is Trump, whom they view as an extremist on the issue.\nAbortion looks to be one of Trump's glaring vulnerabilities. He has boasted about his role in overturning Roe v. Wade through his appointment of three conservative Supreme Court justices during his single term.\n'There is a fundamental question and a fundamental difference between the president and Donald Trump and their belief on whether the Constitution affords women a right to choose. Donald Trump does not; Joe Biden does,' said Kate Berner, a former Biden White House official.\nTrump recently said abortion decisions should be left to the states after he was criticized that he has been murky about what he believes. Even so, he sought to dissociate himself from a recent state court ruling in Arizona upholding a 19th century law imposing a near-total abortion ban.\nDisavowing Arizona's strict anti-abortion measure isn't so easy for Trump. The reason it can take effect springs directly from the votes of conservative Supreme Court justices whom Trump worked to install.\n'The fact is that he announced he was going to stack the court with justices who could be counted on to overrule Roe v. Wade,' said Laurence Tribe, a Harvard Law School professor emeritus. 'He succeeded in that. They did it. That led to the revival of laws like Arizona's, even if Trump says: ‘Oops, I'm sorry that's the consequence. It doesn't make me look good politically.''\nBiden was at the White House last Sunday, dealing with the fallout from Iran's attack on Israel. When he's in Washington on the weekends, he'll often attend services at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Georgetown, the church frequented by the nation's first Catholic president, John F. Kennedy. A Black Lives Matter banner hangs from a fence outside.\nBiden wasn't in the pews that day; he was attending a virtual meeting with U.S. allies about the Iranian attack.\nThe Rev. Patrick Earl led the Mass and greeted congregants at the doorway afterward. He said in an interview that Biden is a 'good presence' during services, recalling how he once left his seat to congratulate a boy's family celebrating his First Communion.\nEarl said he understood Biden's position, even if it conflicts with church teaching.\n'As the political leader of a very varied country, you can't just say, ‘You've got to believe as I believe,'\" he said. \"You just can't.\"\nPeter Nicholas Natasha Korecki",

            "excerpt": "NBC News' latest national poll shows Biden's numbers inching up as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., inflation and abortion all scramble the 2024 contest.",
            "summary": "The share of voters who say they have high interest in the 2024 election has hit a nearly 20-year low at this point in a presidential race, according to the latest national NBC News poll, with majorities holding negative views of both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.\nThe poll also shows Biden trimming Trump's previous lead to just 2 points in a head-to-head contest, an improvement within the margin of error compared to the previous survey, as the president bests Trump on the issues of abortion and uniting the country, while the former Republican president is ahead on competency and dealing with inflation.\nAnd it finds inflation and immigration topping the list of most important issues facing the country, as just one-third of voters give Biden credit for an improving economy.\nBut what also stands out in the survey is how the low voter interest and the independent candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. potentially scramble what's been a stable presidential contest with more than six months until Election Day. While Trump holds a 2-point edge over Biden in head to head , Biden leads Trump by 2 points in a five-way ballot test including Kennedy and other third-party candidates.\n'I don't think Biden has done much as a president. And if Trump gets elected, I just feel like it's going to be the same thing as it was before Biden got elected,' said poll respondent Devin Fletcher, 37, of Wayne, Michigan, a Democrat who said he's still voting for Biden.\n'I just don't feel like I have a candidate that I'm excited to vote for,' Fletcher added.\nAnother poll respondent from New Jersey, who declined to provide her name and voted for Biden in 2020, said she wouldn't be voting in November.\n'Our candidates are horrible. I have no interest in voting for Biden. He did nothing. And I absolutely will not vote for Trump,' this voter said.\nDemocratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies, said that 'Americans don't agree on much these days, but nothing unites the country more than voters' desire to tune this election out.'\nThe poll was conducted April 12-16, and it comes during yet another turbulent time in American politics, including the beginning of Trump's criminal trial in New York, as well as new attacks and heightened tensions in the Middle East.\nAccording to the poll, 64% of registered voters say they have a high level of interest in November's election — registering either a '9' or a 10' on a 10-point scale of interest.\nThat's lower than what the NBC News poll showed at this same point time in the 2008 (74%), 2012 (67%), 2016 (69%) and 2020 (77%) presidential contests.\nThe question dates back to the 2008 election cycle. The lowest-ever level of high election interest in the poll during a presidential cycle was in March 2012 — at 59%. But it quickly ticked up in the next survey.\nThis election cycle, high interest has been both low and relatively flat for months, according to the poll.\nMcInturff, the Republican pollster, says the high level of interest in the poll has 'always been a signal for the level of turnout' for a presidential contest.\n'It makes it very hard for us to predict turnout this far in advance of November, but every signal is turnout will be a lower percentage of eligible voters than in 2020,' he said.\nBy party, the current poll shows 70% of self-identified Republicans saying they have high interest in the upcoming election, versus 65% of Democrats who say this.\nIndependents are at 48%, while only 36% of voters ages 18 to 34 rate themselves as highly interested in the election.\n'They just aren't low interest,' McInturff said of young voters. 'They are off-the-charts low.'\nBiden trims Trump's lead The poll also finds Trump narrowly ahead of Biden by 2 points among registered voters in a head-to-head matchup, 46% to 44% — down from Trump's 5-point advantage in January, 47% to 42%.\nThat movement, within the poll's margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, is consistent with what other national polls have showed in the Trump-Biden race.\nTrump's biggest advantages are among men (53% to 37%), white voters (54% to 37%) and white voters without college degrees (65% to 25%).\nBiden's top advantages are among Black voters (71% to 13%), women (50% to 39%) and Latinos (49% to 39%).\nThe poll shows the two candidates are essentially tied among independents (Biden 36%, Trump 34%) and voters ages 18-34 (Biden 44%, Trump 43%). One of the big polling mysteries this cycle is whether young voters have defected from Biden (as the NBC News poll has shown over multiple surveys), or whether Democrats have maintained their advantage among this demographic.\nWhen the ballot is expanded to five named candidates, Biden takes a 2-point lead over Trump: Biden 39%, Trump 37%, independent Robert F. Kennedy 13%, Jill Stein 3% and Cornel West 2%.\nAgain, that result between Biden and Trump is within the poll's margin of error.\nNotably, the poll shows a greater share of Trump voters from the head-to-head matchup supporting Kennedy in the expanded ballot compared with Biden voters, different than the results of some other surveys.\n(Read more here on how Kennedy's candidacy impacts the 2024 race, according to the poll.)\n(Read more here on how Kennedy's candidacy impacts the 2024 race, according to the poll.) The president's approval rating ticks up to 42% Additionally, the poll shows 42% of registered voters approving of Biden's overall job performance — up 5 points since January's NBC News poll, which showed Biden at the lowest point of his presidency.\nFifty-six percent of voters say they disapprove of the job he has done, which is down 4 points from January.\nBiden's gains over the past few months have come from key parts of his 2020 base, especially among Democrats and Black voters. But he continues to hold low ratings among Latinos (40% approval), young voters (37%) and independents (36%).\nbase, especially among Democrats and Black voters. But he continues to hold low ratings among Latinos (40% approval), young voters (37%) and independents (36%). 'The data across this poll show that Joe Biden has begun to gain some ground in rebuilding his coalition from 2020,' said Horwitt, the Democratic pollster. 'The question is whether he can build upon this momentum and make inroads with the groups of voters that still are holding back support.'\nBut McInturff, the GOP pollster, points out that the only recent presidents who lost re-election had approval ratings higher than Biden's at this point in the election cycle: George H.W. Bush (43%) and Donald Trump (46%).\nwho lost re-election had approval ratings higher than Biden's at this point in the election cycle: George H.W. Bush (43%) and Donald Trump (46%). 'President Biden has a precarious hold on the presidency and is in a difficult position as it relates to his re-election,' McInturff said.\nOn the issues, 39% of voters say they approve of Biden's handling of the economy (up from 36% in January); 28% approve of his handling of border security and immigration; and just 27% approve of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war (down from 29% in January).\nVoters gave Biden his highest issue rating on addressing student-loan debt, with 44% approving of his handling of the issue, versus 51% who say they disapprove.\naddressing student-loan debt, with 44% approving of his handling of the issue, versus 51% who say they disapprove. Biden leads on abortion and unity; Trump leads on inflation and competency The NBC News poll asked voters to determine which candidate they thought is better on several different issues and attributes.\nBiden holds a 15-point advantage over Trump on dealing with the issue of abortion, and the president is ahead by 9 points on having the ability to bring the country together — though this is down from Biden's 24-point advantage on this issue in the Sept. 2020 NBC News poll.\nTrump, meanwhile, leads on having the ability to handle a crisis (by 4 points), on having a strong record of accomplishments (by 7 points), on being competent and effective (by 11 points), on having the necessary mental and physical health to be president (by 19 points) and on dealing with inflation and the cost of living (by 22 points).\nInflation, immigration are the top 2024 issues As for inflation and the cost of living, it tops the list of issues in the poll, with 23% of voters saying they're the most important issue facing the country.\nThe other top issue concerning voters is immigration and the situation at the border (22%) — followed by threats to democracy (16%), jobs and the economy (11%), abortion (6%) and health care (6%).\nimmigration and the situation at the border (22%) — followed by threats to democracy (16%), jobs and the economy (11%), abortion (6%) and health care (6%). Additionally, 63% of voters say their family's income is falling behind the cost of living — essentially unchanged from what the poll showed in 2022 and 2023.\nAnd 53% of voters say the country's economy has not improved, versus 33% who say it has improved and Biden deserves some credit for it and another 8% who agree the economy has improved but don't give the president credit for it.\n'If I look back to when I had all three of my children in the house — we only have one child left in the house now, and we're spending more now than what we did when we had a family of five,' said poll respondent Art Fales, 45, of Florida, who says he's likely voting for Trump.\nBut on a separate question — is there an issue so important that you'll vote for or against a candidate solely on that basis? — the top issue responses are protecting democracy and constitutional rights (28%), immigration and border security (20%) and abortion (19%).\nIndeed, 30% of Democrats, 29% of young voters and 27% of women say they are single-issue voters on abortion.\n'I have a right to what I do with my body,' said poll respondent Amanda Willis, 28, from Louisiana, who said she's voting for Biden. 'And I don't believe that other people should have the ability to determine that.'\nOther poll findings With Trump's first criminal trial now underway, 50% of voters say the former president is being held to the same standard as anyone else when it comes to his multiple legal challenges. That compares with 43% who believe he's being unfairly targeted in these trials.\n52% of voters have an unfavorable view of Biden, while 53% share the same view of Trump.\nAnd Democrats and Republicans are essentially tied on congressional preference, with 47% of voters preferring Republicans control Congress and 46% wanting Democrats in charge. Republicans held a 4-point lead on this question in January. The NBC News poll was conducted April 12-16 of 1,000 registered voters nationwide — 891 contacted via cell phone — and the poll has an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\nThe NBC News poll was conducted April 12-16 of 1,000 registered voters nationwide — 891 contacted via cell phone — and the poll has an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\nMark Murray Sarah Dean",

            "excerpt": "An NBC News review identified 150 verified \"Premium\" accounts that have posted or amplified pro-Nazi content.",
            "summary": "Elon Musk's X is a thriving hub for Nazi support and propaganda, with paid subscribers sharing speeches by Adolf Hitler or content praising his genocidal regime.\nNBC News found that at least 150 paid 'Premium' subscriber X accounts and thousands of unpaid accounts have posted or amplified pro-Nazi content on X in recent months, often in apparent violation of X's rules. The paid accounts posting the content all consistently posted antisemitic or pro-Nazi material. Examples included praise of Nazi soldiers, sharing of Nazi symbols and denials of the Holocaust.\nThe pro-Nazi content is not confined to the fringes of the platform. During one seven-day period in March, seven of the most widely shared pro-Nazi posts on X accrued 4.5 million views in total. One post with 1.9 million views promoted a false and long-debunked conspiracy theory that 6 million Jews did not die in the Holocaust. More than 5,300 verified and unverified accounts reshared that post, and other popular posts were reshared hundreds of times apiece.\nX's policies ban glorifying violence — a broad prohibition that X has sometimes used to take down pro-Nazi content and accounts. The rules also ban 'praising violent entities' and say the platform will apply labels to hate imagery like swastikas. But NBC News found that X does not appear to be enforcing those policies consistently.\nThe findings are the latest evidence of a flourishing Nazi network on X under Musk's ownership. Previous investigations by news organizations and anti-hate watchdogs have documented many examples of antisemitism, white supremacy and support for Nazism on X.\nNBC News found the Nazi propaganda posts by browsing the platform: scrolling through replies, clicking on user profiles and looking through the engagements on viral posts. NBC News conducted its review during one week in late March. The number of verified subscribers posting pro-Nazi material may be significantly more than 150. When NBC News conducted its review, Premium subscribers had the option to hide their verification check marks from the public.\nThe verified users sharing the pro-Nazi content have entered into a mutually beneficial relationship with Musk's X, paying $8 a month or more for premium services that are available to all premium subscribers. In exchange, they get 'prioritization' when they reply to posts and the opportunity to monetize their content through ads, according to the subscription terms.\nThe result is that X is bringing Nazi sympathizers in from the dark corners of the internet to a massive platform where they can pay to amplify their content. X had 174 million daily active users worldwide on its mobile app in February, according to the research firm Sensor Tower. X claims to have many more than that.\nNBC News conducted its research in March, before X implemented a change to provide free premium subscriptions to accounts with more than 2,500 verified followers. That move has made it more difficult to determine who is a paid subscriber.\nA welcoming social media environment can make Nazi sympathizers feel validated in their views and recruit others to their cause, said Patrick Riccards, executive director of Life After Hate, a Milwaukee-based organization that helps people disengage from violent extremist groups.\n'For those who are already driven by hate, it is a big warm hug,' he said.\nOnline hatred can also contribute to violence offline, he said, citing the racist massacre at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, where 10 Black people died in 2022. The gunman wrote in a document that he supported neo-Nazism. He later said in court that he 'believed what I read online and acted out the hate.'\n'They're wanting to find individuals to take physical action when the time comes,' Riccards said.\nIn most cases, Nazi material on X is about spreading hate, said Megan Squire, deputy director for data analytics at the Southern Poverty Law Center, an anti-hate group founded in 1971.\n'It's not like historians are on there talking about Hitler's speeches,' she said.\nSquire said that in her research she has found that accounts posting Nazi material are run by 'known white supremacist groups that are attempting to normalize their ideas, gain followers and shuffle those followers into platforms' elsewhere online where their organizing work continues.\nBy failing to act against many pro-Nazi accounts, X continues to earn income from their activity in at least two ways: by collecting monthly subscription fees from those posting pro-Nazi content and by running advertisements on those accounts or adjacent to the pro-Nazi content.\nNBC News found ads running on 74 of the 150 premium accounts, either on their profile pages or in the replies below their posts. The advertisers included SiriusXM, The Hollywood Reporter and Cisco subsidiary Splunk. SiriusXM declined to comment. Penske Media, the owner of The Hollywood Reporter, declined to comment. Splunk did not respond to requests for comment sent by email.\nAds from other companies appeared among the search results for a Holocaust-denial hashtag.\nNBC News does not have a comprehensive list of advertisers that use X. Each account on social media sees different ads at different times, so it is unknown how many advertisers' ads have run next to pro-Nazi content.\nAdvertisers online generally have limited control over where their ads appear. X says on a website for advertisers that it gives them the ability to target certain demographics, accounts, keywords, phrases, interests, events and locations. Advertisers can also use 'negative' targeting, asking X's ads system not to place ads near certain keywords. The system, however, does not guarantee placement next to or away from any specific post. Other platforms, such as Instagram, have targeting systems of their own.\nOn a second website for advertisers, X says its rules are meant to ensure brand safety. It says that the rules 'are enforced for all people who use X' and that they 'set the standard for content and behavior not permitted on the platform.' X specifically notes on the page that its policies include rules that address 'violence,' 'terrorism/violent extremism' and 'hateful conduct.'\nX does not disclose publicly which accounts share in ad revenue, and NBC News could not determine how many of the 150 premium subscribers do so.\nMonetizing Nazi content contradicts one of Musk's early pledges after he bought the app, then known as Twitter, in October 2022.\n'Negative/hate tweets will be max deboosted & demonetized, so no ads or other revenue to Twitter,' he wrote in a post in November 2022.\nMusk also said then that no one has a right to amplification online.\n'New Twitter policy is freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach,' he wrote.\nNBC News sought comment on its findings from X. A representative for X asked for examples, and NBC News provided 13 examples of accounts posting pro-Nazi content. Hours later, X had put labels on some of the examples, all of which remained online. Representatives for X did not answer written questions or agree to an interview, but they sent a link to a blog post from September that says X has a 'zero tolerance approach' to violent speech.\nMany of the 150 premium accounts have put links on their X profiles directing people to their websites, books and other media, where they sometimes push Nazi sympathy and antisemitism. One such account, using the name The Impartial Truth, posts recycled and remixed Nazi propaganda content, and its X profile links out to a donation site. The account did not respond to an emailed request for comment.\nOne of the premium accounts belongs to Stew Peters, a Florida-based host of an internet talk show who has praised Nazi book-burning in 1930s Germany. Last month, a post of his denying the Holocaust went viral on X with 1.9 million views. Peters has more than 574,000 followers on X, where his posts often include antisemitism, and his account links to his website charging $10 a month for videos. In response to a request for comment, Peters said NBC News was using 'ad hominem arguments to create narratives out of whole cloth.'\nSome of the accounts posting Nazi propaganda are unabashed in their praise of the Nazis. At least two verified X subscribers recently praised Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister. One said it used artificial intelligence to generate fake audio of Goebbels reading his writing aloud, bringing in more than 23,000 views.\nX's policies require a 'sensitive media' label for 'hateful imagery,' which includes 'symbols historically associated with hate groups, e.g., the Nazi swastika.' Musk cited a related 'incitement to violence' policy when he suspended the rapper Ye, formerly Kanye West, after Ye praised Hitler in an interview and posted an image resembling a swastika.\nSome viral Nazi content stops short of praise and instead drives engagement to accounts with no clear ideology. Two examples came in March from the account @dom_lucre, a conspiracy theorist. It posted two Hitler speeches that together received more than 15 million views. The speeches were translated with artificial intelligence, Lucre said. He, unlike others, included a warning that the speech was graphic and antisemitic, though he did not express disapproval.\n'I am simply sharing what is news as I always do,' he wrote in a post. Lucre, who also goes by Dominick McGee, according to his Facebook page, did not respond to an emailed request for comment.\nLucre and other similar posters who stopped short of praising Nazis were not included in the NBC News count of the 150 premium subscribers posting pro-Nazi content. Those 150 accounts were more explicit in their pro-Nazi ideologies.\nSquire, of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the proliferation of pro-Nazi content is the result of multiple decisions by Musk since he bought the platform: cutting content moderators, changing the rules about who got verification, reinstating banned accounts and restricting the data stream that outside watchdogs used to research Twitter.\nMany researchers have complained that it is now difficult or impossible to measure the reach of extremism on X because of the new restrictions Musk has imposed.\n'It's safety through obscurity: Make it really hard for people to see the problem, and then you can pretend it doesn't exist,' Squire said.\nBefore Musk bought Twitter, it had been working for about five years to crack down on the presence of Nazis. In 2017, after years of complaints by users and advertisers, Twitter said it was banning Nazi swastikas and other hateful imagery from profile photos and that it would kick off users who associate with violent organizations. Opponents of Nazis celebrated the moves as long overdue.\nSome prominent X users are unhappy with what they have seen. Christopher Rufo, an activist and senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, wrote last month that he had seen a rise in 'Kanye-style antisemitism.' A representative for Rufo said he was not available for an interview.\nSome Nazi supporters have also said they have noticed a rise in sympathetic posts. One account, referring to Hitler as 'the Boss,' wrote recently: 'I'm seeing the Boss' speeches and quotes more and more on social media, from people youd never expect.'\nRather than crack down on antisemitic posts, Musk has used his massive platform to promote antisemitic conspiracy theories. Last year, he embraced the concept of the 'great replacement,' which says there is a top-down plot to replace the white population with nonwhite people. His posts on the subject drew condemnation from the White House and led to an exodus of advertisers. Following the backlash over his statements, Musk visited Israel and traveled to the former Nazi death camp Auschwitz with conservative commentator Ben Shapiro.\nMusk also reinstated the accounts of prominent neo-Nazis Andrew Anglin and Nick Fuentes. Both are now suspended, although videos in which Fuentes questions the Holocaust still spread widely on X.\nLast year, the progressive watchdog Media Matters published a report saying Nazi content was running on X alongside advertisements from major corporations. X sued Media Matters, saying its research was flawed because it used an account that, according to the company, was primed to see Nazi material based on the accounts it followed. It also said Media Matters received flawed results because the activity of its researchers was atypical, for example by refreshing a page many times to see which ads appeared. X's suit is ongoing. In a statement to NBC News at the time, Media Matters President Angelo Carusone called the lawsuit \"frivolous\" and said the organization \"stands behind its reporting and looks forward to winning in court.'\nAmong the ads running near pro-Nazi content seen by NBC News was one from the FBI seeking tips about hate crimes. The FBI ad appeared among the replies to a post from @AshaLogos, a verified account with more than 54,000 followers that frequently posts antisemitism, including a recent accusation that Jews have a 'monopoly' on media.\nThe FBI did not respond to requests for comment on the ad or its placement or about NBC News' findings about pro-Nazi propaganda on X.\nHate crime in the U.S. has been surging, with reports jumping 12% in 2021 and 7% in 2022, according to law enforcement reports to the FBI.\nDavid Ingram Lora Kolodny, CNBC contributed.",
