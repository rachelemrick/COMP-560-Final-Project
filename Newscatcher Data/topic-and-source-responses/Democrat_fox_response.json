            "summary": "Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost's office rejected an effort by state Democrats to circumvent a key election deadline to allow President Biden on state ballots this week, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital.\nThe documents show correspondence from Yost's office and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, as well as attorney Donald McTigue, who is representing Democrats on the matter.\nLaRose, a Republican, had notified state Democrats earlier this month that the Democratic National Convention would not occur until more than a week after Ohio's Aug. 7 deadline for certifying presidential candidates. LaRose warned that either the Ohio assembly would have to vote to change the law, or Democrats would have to move up their plans for certifying Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\nMcTigue responded in an April 9 letter, arguing the Secretary of State had the authority to accept a provisional certification of Biden and Harris' nominations prior to the official certification at the party's convention.\nHe claimed Ohio law allows for a provisional move because Biden and Harris \"have secured the pledged delegates necessary to become the party's nominees.\"\nLaRose then consulted with Yost's office about the proposed solution, but the attorney general shot down the plan in a statement on Monday.\n\"The Democratic Party's notion of providing a ‘provisional certification' by the statutory deadline simply is not provided for by law,\" Yost's office said. \"Instead, the law mandates the Democratic Party to actually certify its president and vice-president candidates on or before August 7, 2024. No alternative process is permitted.\"\n\"Thus, the Secretary of State lacks authority to accept ‘provisional certifications' from the Democratic Party pursuant to [the law]. The Democratic Party must actually certify its presidential candidates on or before August 7, 2024 to be placed on the 2024 General Election ballot,\" the statement continued.\nMcTigue has yet to offer a response to the attorney general's office, and he did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.\nMeanwhile, Biden's campaign continues to insist that he will be on the ballot in \"all 50 states.\"\nRead the full response to McTigue from Yost's office below:\nRead McTigue's proposal for a \"provisional certification below:",

            "excerpt": "Democrats joined their Republican counterparts in condemning anti-semitic protests at Columbia University as the party grapples with a growing divide over support for Israel.",
            "summary": "A number of Democrats in the Senate have joined their Republican colleagues in denouncing discrimination against Jewish students at the prestigious Ivy League Columbia University, where an anti-Israel solidarity encampment persists on campus, prompting the institution to move classes online on Monday.\n\"Every American has a right to protest,\" Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement. \"But when protests shift to antisemitism, verbal abuse, intimidation, or glorification of Oct. 7 violence against Jewish people, that crosses the line.\"\n\"Campuses must remain safe for all students.\"\nSchumer, who represents New York City, where Columbia is located, is the first Jewish majority leader in the Senate and also the highest ranking Jewish elected official in U.S. history.\nLast week, the anti-Israel demonstration sprang up on Columbia's campus, with students camping out in tents and demanding that the university divest from all companies with ties to Israel. Since then, the protest has grown in size and presented a safety threat to Jewish students. This has mushroomed into such a concern that an Orthodox rabbi at the school advised Jewish students to leave campus because \"Columbia University's Public Safety and the NYPD cannot guarantee Jewish students' safety.\"\nNew York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, another Democrat, also denounced the display of antisemitism at the university, saying she was \"appalled.\"\n\"Threats of violence against Jewish students and the Jewish community are horrible, despicable and wholly unacceptable,\" she said. \"Using the rhetoric of terrorists has no place in New York, where we pride ourselves on tolerance and the right of every group to practice their religion in peace.\"\nOthers who joined their party members in addressing the encampment were Sens. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., and John Fetterman, D-Penn.\n\"I'm outraged by the vile displays of antisemitism at Columbia University, including threats of violence,\" read a post on X, formerly Twitter, from Rosen, who faces a tough re-election battle in November in swing state Nevada.\nFetterman, who has emerged as one of Israel's strongest supporters in his party, compared the demonstration to \"Charlottesville for these Jewish students.\" Fetterman referenced the 2017 \"Unite the Right\" rally in Virginia that drew hundreds of white supremacists and ultimately turned violent, resulting in the death of one woman.\n\"President Minouche Shafik: do your job or resign, so Columbia can find someone who will,\" Fetterman added.\nWhile a number of Democrats have chosen to make public statements on the events unfolding at Columbia, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., blamed the party for allowing it to happen in the first place. \"The radical anti-Israel protestors have always been part of the Democratic Party's base,\" he wrote on X. \"Now Joe Biden is using them as an excuse to undermine Israel and appease Iran.\"\nWhite House spokesperson Andrew Bates said the administration condemns \"echoing the rhetoric of terrorist organizations\" in the \"strongest terms.\"\nRepublicans in the Senate were quick to condemn the encampment at Columbia, and Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., even suggested, \"Any student on a visa that is arrested for supporting Hamas needs to be deported immediately.\"\nMany GOP members in the upper chamber have reinforced their support for Israel and the Jewish people frequently throughout the war between Israel and terrorist group Hamas in Gaza. Democrats have been more measured and careful with their commentary on the war and Israel as the party's divide on the issue expands, making the statements from them regarding Columbia particularly significant.\nPresident Biden and Democrats have faced criticism from their Republican counterparts for pulling back from Israel, a major U.S. ally in the Middle East. Biden recently warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that U.S. policy in support of the country could change depending on the actions it takes to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza.And in the wake of Iran's recent direct attack on Israel, Republicans quickly blamed Biden and other Democrats, accusing them of emboldening Israel's adversary to undertake such an audacious attack.",

            "excerpt": "The Democrats' Senate campaign arm is rolling out a slate of multimillion-dollar ad reservations in pivotal swing states as it looks to protect Democrats' majority in the upper chamber.",
            "summary": "Senate Democrats' campaign arm is sparing no expense in its bid to keep the upper chamber's majority in November, announcing a whopping $79 million ad plan across a number of battleground states and desired pick up opportunities.\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) is set to spend the multimillion-dollar sum on television, digital and radio advertising in several close Senate races and a handful of matches they are hoping to make competitive as they look to prevent the GOP from taking over in 2025, a committee aide said. Advertising throughout the new campaign will be done through a mixture of independent expenditures and coordinated campaign buys.\nIn a statement provided to Fox News Digital, Christie Roberts, DSCC executive director said, \"Senate Republicans' roster of unvetted, unpopular candidates bring disqualifying personal flaws and toxic policy positions to their races – when general election voters learn about them, they'll see why they should be nowhere near the U.S. Senate.\"\n\"This advertising campaign will make the choice in each Senate race clear, enables the DSCC to communicate with voters in the most effective way and ensures we protect Democrats' Senate majority,\" she continued.\nInitial ad reservations in the DSCC's new campaign will be made in key electoral battlegrounds, including Arizona, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Reservations will also be made in Texas and Florida as Democrats look to flip the seats of Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rick Scott, R-Fla. Each of the planned buys is expected to be for multimillion-dollar sums.\nIn Michigan, Democrats face concerns in November amid Israel's war in Gaza, which has prompted criticism from the state's significant Muslim and Arab populations. The DSCC had made an initial reservation of more than $11 million in TV ads in the state, as outgoing Sen. Debbie Stabenow's retiring deprives the Democrats of any incumbency advantage.\nA $10 million television reservation was similarly announced for Wisconsin, where Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin is expected to brave a significant challenge in the swing state.\nAn additional $8 million reservation was made for television ads in Pennsylvania, as Republicans work to unseat incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in another key battleground that could decide the presidential election.\nTogether with the Majority Leader Chuck Schumer-aligned Senate Majority PAC's previously announced $239 million in ad reservations to protect vulnerable Senate Democrats, total ad reservations boosting Democratic candidates now tops $300 million.\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director Mike Berg said, \"It's going to be very expensive for Democrats to try to convince voters that they didn't open our border, unleash 40-year high inflation, and cause a crime epidemic in our country.\"\nEach of the Senate races considered competitive in November are for seats that are currently held by lawmakers who caucus with Democrats, putting the party at a significant disadvantage. Additionally, while the DSCC is making moves to threaten Scott and Cruz in November, the races in Florida and Texas are not understood to be viable pick up opportunities for Democrats.",

            "excerpt": "The Media Research Center found ABC, NBC and CBS evening newscasts failed to inform viewers during at least 90% of coverage that Trump prosecutors are Democrats.",
            "summary": "FIRST ON FOX -- Americans who rely on evening newscasts from ABC, CBS or NBC for information are likely unaware that elected officials going after former President Trump are Democrats, according to a new study from the Media Research Center.\n\"The network coverage of the Trump prosecutions routinely and fraudulently implies that they are nonpartisan public officials. It's Trump versus the New York Attorney General, or the Manhattan District Attorney. They're not just Democrats, they're elected Democrats, building a career on taking down Trump. Leaving that out of the story is irresponsible,\" NewsBusters executive editor Tim Graham told Fox News Digital.\nRich Noyes, contributing editor for MRC NewsBusters, led a team of analysts who reviewed \"NBC Nightly News,\" \"CBS Evening News\" and ABC's \"World News Tonight\" from January 1, 2023 through April 10, 2024. They found networks failed to inform viewers during at least 90% of coverage that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney Fani Willis, and New York Attorney General Letitia James are Democrats.\n\"It's as if the networks prefer to disingenuously portray the indictments and civil lawsuits as the work of nonpartisan career prosecutors, rather than as partisan attempts to use the court system to hobble the electoral prospects of the country's top Republican,\" Noyes said.\nBragg, last April, charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to alleged hush-money payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign. Noyes wrote that \"Bragg isn't just a mainstream Democrat\" and that he is \"clearly on the far-left wing of the party,\" especially considering his ties to liberal billionaire George Soros.\n\"ABC's ‘World News Tonight' has aired 56 stories discussing Bragg's ‘hush money' case against Trump, yet sharp-eared viewers only once heard that Bragg was a Democrat — on February 26, 2024, when correspondent Aaron Katersky relayed how ‘a spokesman for Trump... called Bragg another deranged Democrat prosecutor,'\" Noyes wrote.\n\"That's still better than the ‘CBS Evening News,' which aired 48 stories discussing Bragg's case, none of which revealed that the District Attorney is a Democrat,\" he continued. \"'NBC Nightly News' was the most informative on this score, informing viewers that Bragg is a Democrat in 16 out of 59 stories, or about 27% of the time — still barely one-fourth of stories.\"\nBetween ABC, CBS and NBC, Bragg was labeled a Democrat 17 times out of 163 stories, according to the study.\n\"Bragg's partisanship was omitted from nearly 90% of evening news stories about his election-season indictments of the former President,\" Noyes wrote.\nThere has been even less rhetoric about AG James' partisanship, according to the study.\n\"Through April 10, ABC's ‘World News Tonight' has aired 44 stories mentioning James's suit against Trump and his businesses, yet only one — back on November 6 — identified the state Attorney General as a ‘Democrat,' in a fleeting on-screen graphic that was shown for less than two seconds,\" Noyes wrote.\n\"Similarly, the CBS Evening News produced 35 stories that discussed James's civil case, but only once did viewers learn about James's partisanship,\" he continued. \"Compared to its competitors, ‘NBC Nightly News' was again the most informative. The newscast discussed the civil case in 26 stories, seven of which mentioned James's party affiliation.\"\nBetween ABC, CBS and NBC, James was labeled a Democrat only nine times out of 105 stories, according to the study.\nIt was much of the same when evening newscasts covered scandal-plagued DA Willis, who wasn't labeled a Democrat once during 99 segments between ABC's \"World News Tonight\" and \"CBS Evening News,\" according to the study. NBC managed to identify Willis as a Democrat in eight out of 50 segments.\n\"Add it all up, and out of 149 evening news stories about the Georgia election case against Trump, a scant 5% revealed that Willis was a Democrat, vs. 95% that kept viewers in the dark,\" Noyes said.\n\"Clearly, the editorial choices made by these broadcast networks shows they are framing these cases as the actions of nonpartisan law enforcement officials — all of whom just happen to be Democrats,\" he continued. \"But if it were a leading Democrat who had been placed under the legal microscope by a trio of elected Republicans, does anyone think that the media would be so reluctant to even mention the partisanship of the prosecutors? Of course not.\"\nABC, NBC and CBS didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\nGraham feels things were much different back in the Clinton era.\n\"Anchormen like Dan Rather couldn't mention Kenneth Starr investigating the Clintons without saying ‘Republican independent counsel,' so that the first word could cancel the second,\" he said.\n\"The most obvious field for investigating media bias is scandals and scandal investigations. Under Trump, his scandals have always been much more ‘newsworthy' than his policies,\" Graham continued. \"Under Clinton, they would hype up his policies and complain that scandals were a waste of public resources and media air time.\"",

            "excerpt": "Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., voted against holding an impeachment trial for DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, but was once vocal about the importance of trying President Trump.",
            "summary": "Longtime Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey voted to kill the impeachment trial of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas last week, but has a long track record of supporting impeachment proceedings when former President Trump was in the hot seat with Democrats.\nThe Senate voted against two articles of impeachment Mayorkas faced last week, including one that charged Mayorkas with \"willful and systemic refusal to comply\" regarding immigration law, and a second article that charged him with a \"breach of trust\" after saying the border was secure. The Senate voted 51-48 and 51-49 against the articles.\nThe votes were largely along party lines, with Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska serving as the only Republican who voted \"present\" when asked about dismissing the first article, and voted against dismissing the second article.\nRepublicans were pushing for a trial of Mayorkas for \"willfully\" refusing to enforce immigration laws, while millions of illegal immigrants have poured across the border into the U.S. since he was sworn in as the Biden administration's secretary of Homeland Security in 2021.\nCasey was among the Democrats who voted to kill the impeachment trial of Mayorkas, but had largely been tight-lipped ahead of the vote. Fox News Digital reported last week ahead of the Senate vote that Casey had not yet revealed his plans, while Politico reported on April 10 that Casey \"did not directly answer a question on whether or not he'd support a motion to dismiss the trial.\"\nHe did tell the outlet at the time that \"the Senate should be spending time passing the bipartisan border deal\" and that he has \"no doubt at all\" that Republicans would use the impeachment trial against him and other vulnerable Senate Democrats ahead of the election.\nSenate Democrats quashing impeachment proceedings against Mayorkas was historically significant, as he is still serving in his role in public office. It marks a first for an impeachment trial to be dismissed, tabled or effectively tossed without the accused official first exiting their role, Fox Digital previously reported.\n\"The Senate has no constitutional authority to rule that the articles approved by the House do not state impeachable offenses,\" Andrew McCarthy, a former chief assistant United States attorney in the Southern District of New York and a senior fellow at the National Review Institute, said last week.\nMcCarthy added that the House has the sole power to determine impeachable offenses, and the Senate deeming the articles of impeachment unconstitutional and killing the potential trial, \"essentially nullifies the House's important role in the impeachment process.\"\nThe Senate voting against carrying through with the trial of Mayorkas comes after Casey repeatedly publicly supported impeachment proceedings against Trump when he was president.\n\"There can be no justice without accountability for those involved in the insurrection against the federal government. As a Nation, we cannot advance our shared democratic values without consequences for those who have betrayed those values. Those who stormed the Capitol should face charges. President Trump should be impeached and removed from office because he betrayed his oath to the Constitution and incited a mob to violence,\" Casey said in 2021, following protesters breaching the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 of that year.\nIn 2020, when Democrats accused Trump of soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 election, Casey said, \"Americans deserve a fair trial\" when touting articles of impeachment against the 45th president.\n\"Soon the Senate will take a critical vote on whether we should hear from relevant witnesses like John Bolton. Americans deserve a fair trial. Anything less is a cover-up,\" he said on X at the time.\nThat same month, he also called for \"answers, under oath, in full view of the American people,\" as part of Trump's first impeachment.\nHe added in 2019 of the Trump impeachment that failing to pursue proceedings against Trump would be \"an insult to our Constitution and to our values.\"\n\"Our Constitution indicates that impeachment is for ‘treason, bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.' A failure by Congress to pursue impeachment in the face of grave offenses by the President is an insult to our Constitution and to our values.\"\nTrump was ultimately impeached twice, an historical first for a president, and acquitted on all counts by the Senate.\nCasey has served in the Senate since 2007, and is anticipated to have one of the most closely watched elections this year as he gears up for a campaign against anticipated Republican challenger Dave McCormick. Pennsylvania holds its primaries Tuesday, which will solidify the expected race between Casey and McCormick.\nThe Pennsylvania Democrat and fellow vulnerable Senate members have now come under greater focus from the Republican Party following the Mayorkas vote, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) previously telling Fox Digital that their votes against proceeding with the trial will become a focal point of election season.\n\"Joe Biden's wide open border is going to be a top issue for voters headed into November,\" NRSC spokesperson Maggie Abboud told Fox News Digital in a statement last week.\n\"You can bet we are going to highlight Senate Democrats' refusal to hold Joe Biden's DHS Secretary accountable on the campaign trail, in advertising, and in every other way possible,\" she continued.\nFox News Digital reached out to the Casey campaign for comment on the Mayorkas vote and his previous remarks on Trump's impeachment proceedings, but did not immediately receive replies.\n\"Together, Casey, Biden and Mayorkas have enabled drug cartels to flood Pennsylvania communities with deadly drugs like fentanyl,\" Elizabeth Gregory, a spokesperson for McCormick, said last week.\nImmigration has become a top concern for voters ahead of November, alongside other concerns such as inflation, the economy and crime. Nearly 7.3 million migrants entered the U.S. between President Biden taking office and February 2024, a Fox News Digital analysis previously reported. The figure is more than the population of 36 individual states.",

            "summary": "An election this month in Pittsburgh and some of its suburbs is emerging as an early test of whether Israel's war with Hamas poses political threats to progressive Democrats in Congress who have criticized how the conflict has been handled.\nU.S. Rep. Summer Lee, a first-term lawmaker who has aligned herself with \"the squad,\" is facing a primary challenge from Bhavini Patel and the war has become a flashpoint in the race.\nPatel frames Lee's criticism of Israel as part of a broader pattern of left-wing politics that are extreme for the district and potentially damaging to Democratic President Joe Biden in a state crucial to his reelection bid against Republican Donald Trump. Lee counters that she has helped move calls for a cease-fire in Gaza more into the mainstream of the Democratic Party.\nThe war has scrambled Democratic politics across the United States. It's dividing traditionally progressive groups, including Pittsburgh's sizable Jewish community, in ways that don't always fall neatly along ethnic or cultural lines. But it's an especially potent issue in Lee's district, which is home to the synagogue where a gunman in 2018 killed 11 congregants in the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.\nThe April 23 primary could shed light on whether the war alone is enough to turn a critical mass of Democrats against Lee.\n\"It clearly is big enough with a certain group in this district,\" said Sam Hens-Greco, the party chair in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. \"Whether it is big enough for the entire populace, we're going to find out.\"\nIf Lee is defeated, she would be the first Democratic incumbent in Congress to lose a primary this year. Other progressive Democrats, including Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri, Jamaal Bowman of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, face primary challengers this summer.\nLee has raised far more money than Patel and has backing from Pennsylvania's Democratic establishment, including Sen. Bob Casey, and a constellation of progressive groups that include both Jewish and Muslim organizations.\nThe first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania, the 36-year-old Lee is a Howard University law school graduate and community activist who began her political career in 2018 with a successful challenge from the left to an entrenched Pittsburgh-area state lawmaker.\nIn this year's campaign, Lee has promoted herself as a hardworking representative who delivers for constituents and speaks in Congress for marginalized communities on issues from fighting inequality to climate change and bigotry, including antisemitism and Islamophobia.\nOn the Israel-Hamas war, Lee has condemned Hamas' attack, but has also accused Israel of committing \"war crimes\" in Gaza, demanded an end to U.S. military aid to Israel and called for a cease-fire within days of the war starting as the best way to end the cycle of violence and work toward peace.\nThat set her apart from Biden's stance and that of most House Democrats, although now dozens more have joined her in calling for a cease-fire. At Biden's State of the Union speech, Lee donned a kaffiyeh, a checkered scarf that has come to symbolize solidarity with Palestinians.\nPatel, 30, a small-town municipal councilwoman who worked in former Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald's administration, declared her candidacy a few days before Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Patel, who is Hindu and of Indian heritage, has cultivated the Jewish community, opening a campaign office in the Jewish enclave in Squirrel Hill, attended post-Oct. 7 vigils and bussed with community members to a pro-Israel rally in Washington in November.\nMost recently, Patel has hammered Lee for being aligned with backers of the \"uncommitted\" campaign that is encouraging Democrats to protest Biden's handling of the war by voting \"uncommitted\" in primaries.\nThat, Patel suggested, is dangerous.\n\"I would say that every Democrat in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District should take notice that my opponent is equivocating on her support for President Biden and failed to denounce the ‘uncommitted' movement,\" Patel said in an interview. \"I think that is the issue that is a big concern for Democrats in this district.\"\nLee defended the \"uncommitted\" movement, saying it's wrong to discourage people from voting and potentially lose a crucial part of the electorate that Democrats want to persuade to support Biden in November's presidential contest. Biden recognizes that, as well, Lee said.\nLee said she has met with people on all sides of the war, including families of hostages and families of Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza, and that her calls for a cease-fire reflect the district's majority.\nLee also accused Patel of aligning herself more with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than with Biden.\n\"Joe Biden is now coming more into alignment with us, which means that, no, we were not wrong to come out early and to come out strong, because as we're seeing now this was always where we needed to get,\" Lee said in an interview. \"This was always the only pathway to peace.\"\nFor now, the sharpest questions about the war have largely been limited to debate exchanges between Lee and Patel.\nThe issue has barely registered on the airwaves, and pro-Israel groups that spent heavily to try to defeat Lee in the 2022 primary — Democratic Majority for Israel and the American Israel Public Affairs committee, better known as AIPAC — haven't waded into the race.\nIn Pennsylvania, one potential boost for Lee could come from college students who, unlike in 2022's primary, will be on campus this time. At the University of Pittsburgh, the war has had a \"commanding presence\" on campus, with most students for a cease-fire, said Will Allison, president of Pitt's College Democrats.\nThe group endorsed Lee unanimously, despite the war causing some division among members, and the College Democrats are campaigning for Lee.\nIn one possible sign of shifting politics around the war, the 14th Ward Independent Democratic Club, a nonparty organization based around Squirrel Hill, voted to endorse Patel after backing Lee in 2022.\nSue Berman Kress, a Patel supporter who is Jewish, said she knows some Jewish Democrats who won't vote for Lee again. They feel she's abandoned the Jewish community and that her politics could open the door to a Trump victory and a surge in antisemitism.\n\"Those things feel very divisive in a way that's very scary,\" Kress said.",

            "excerpt": "Constitutional scholars are questioning whether the Senate was within its authority to deem the House's articles of impeachment unconstitutional and forego a trial for President Biden's border chief.",
            "summary": "Constitutional law experts are examining the implications of the precedent set by Senate Democrats on Wednesday, when they killed the impeachment trial of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, effectively dismissing it.\nAfter the Senate deemed both articles of impeachment unconstitutional, the upper chamber adjourned, quashing all hope for a trial on Mayorkas' alleged crimes. This was historically significant, as an impeachment trial had never been dismissed, tabled or otherwise discarded without the accused official having first exited their role in one way or another.\n\"The Senate has no constitutional authority to rule that the articles approved by the House do not state impeachable offenses,\" explained Andrew McCarthy, a former chief assistant United States attorney in the Southern District of New York and a senior fellow at the National Review Institute.\nThe sole power to determine impeachable offenses lies with the House, McCarthy noted. This means neither the Senate nor a court of law would be within their rights to undermine the House's ability to make such determinations.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., proposed two points of order during the court of impeachment deeming both articles of impeachment unconstitutional, which were passed by the Democratic majority.\n\"This essentially nullifies the House's important role in the impeachment process,\" McCarthy said.\nAlternatively, the Senate would have been well within its rights to \"hold a trial and ultimately acquit Mayorkas of the charges,\" he added.\nThe brief impeachment trial proceedings revealed \"yet another of our constitutional norms is being undermined,\" said Randy Barnett, a renowned legal scholar and professor of constitutional law at the Georgetown University Law Center.\nHowever, Alan Dershowitz, a prominent constitutional scholar and emeritus professor of law at Harvard Law School, claimed, \"There are no constitutional impeachment criteria charged.\"\nHe explained further that \"dismissal is proper.\"\nMcCarthy warned that \"Democrats will come to regret it.\" He explained that in the case that Democrats take over the House's majority and Republicans the Senate, \"Democrats will be undermined by the precedent they have set — especially if Donald Trump is elected president again.\"\nDemocrats would likely seek to once again impeach former President Trump if he is elected in November, McCarthy said, and \"they have now handed Republicans a precedent authorizing the Senate to ignore the House.\"\nBarnett claimed that impeachment is \"ultimately a political power\" and thus, political use of it is expected. However, he suggested that \"the political nature of impeachment\" is exactly what \"necessitates the House having the opportunity to present its case both to the Senate and to the electorate in a public trial.\" This was prevented from taking place in the Senate.\n\"The only reason Republicans impeached Mayorkas was to get a high-profile hearing that would rivet the public's attention to Biden's border crisis,\" added McCarthy, who noted that the House understood they would never see a conviction or removal.\n\"The Senate Democrats' move does deny that public hearing,\" he said. For this, Democrats will \"take a political hit,\" he continued.\nHowever, McCarthy described that Senate Democrats made a political calculation, ultimately determining that \"it would be better to be criticized for not conducting a trial than to hold a trial,\" placing President Biden's border policies at the forefront and Democratic senators on record acquitting Mayorkas.\nThis, he said, would look like the Democrats \"endorsing Biden's non-enforcement policies.\"",

            "excerpt": "Sen. Fetterman revived criticism of extreme anti-Israel protests as he reaffirmed his staunch position of support behind U.S. ally Israel.",
            "summary": "Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., reiterated his criticisms of activists calling for cease-fire in Gaza, and slammed fellow Democrats for their \"crazy\" response to the attacks Iran has launched against Israel, in an interview with Fox Digital.\n\"It is not appropriate or legal or helpful to advance your argument if you show up in a Starbucks with a bullhorn and start yelling at people,\" he told Fox News Digital in a Friday interview.\nHe also claimed such protests don't \"make you noble.\"\n\"It just makes you an a--hole,\" Fetterman said.\nSince the onset of the war between Israel and terrorist group Hamas, anti-Israel demonstrations have erupted across the U.S. The protesters have gone to extreme lengths at times to telegraph their displeasure with U.S. policy in regard to Israel. Some have trespassed in government buildings, blocked high-traffic bridges and entered private businesses with bullhorns, chanting at employees.\nFetterman clarified that he is supportive of the right to protest and hold different opinions.\n\"It's very American to protest and to do that in the appropriate way,\" he said. \"I absolutely support that.\"\nWhat he takes issue with, he said, is when those demonstrations \"disrupt lives.\"\nHe noted the serious implications of protesters who block traffic with their bodies on high-volume bridges and roads, explaining, \"There could be people that [are in] an emergency, or they're going to be late for work – that they could lose their job, or they have to pick up their kids or drop kids off.\"\nWhile he opposes such forms of protest, he didn't signal interest in legislation to address them, telling Fox News Digital, it's \"not really my priority.\"\n\"My priority is to talk about hostages,\" he said, referring to those still in Hamas' custody in Gaza.\nThe Pennsylvania senator has emerged as one of the most vocally supportive Democrats of Israel, which he reiterated in the interview, emphasizing, \"We can't ever forget Hamas started this, and they have chosen to do the most terrible, awful, unspeakable things.\"\nAnd until the hostages, including the Americans still held in Gaza, are released, Fetterman doesn't believe the Palestinian cause for statehood can go anywhere.\n\"They have the power to decide, today – send everyone home and surrender, and all the trauma, the death, and everything in Gaza can end. And you can get back on the path of peace and a two-state solution,\" he said.\nMany in the Democratic Party were not supportive of Israel's decision to retaliate against Iran, which attacked the country directly last weekend. They feared any counterattacks could stoke a regional war that has the potential to draw in the U.S. But Fetterman said, \"I am not going to be in a position to tell Israel what it should do. That's their choice.\"\n\"I certainly hope none of this escalates and turns into [a] more widespread\" conflict, he added.\nHe was critical of fellow Democrats who did not immediately condemn Iran for directly attacking Israel. \"I was appalled that there were members of our party – Democrats that can't even condemn Iran,\" Fetterman remarked. \"That's crazy.\"\nPrompted on growing division within the Democratic Party over support for Israel, he said he can't speak for other members. However, he reaffirmed his position as \"a very confirmed and consistent voice in standing with Israel throughout all of this.\"",

            "summary": "In the 2024 showdown for the House majority, Pennsylvania will be a key battleground.\nAs Republicans defend their razor-thin majority in the chamber, they'll be playing plenty of defense to try and retain GOP-held seats in the blue bastions of California and New York.\nBut in Pennsylvania, which holds primary elections on Tuesday, Republicans will be on offense, targeting three of the most vulnerable House Democrats in the country.\n\"If Democrats are to take back control of the House this November, they'll need to hold the line in the Keystone State,\" Erin Covey, House races analyst for top non-partisan elections handicapper The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter, said recently.\nAtop that list is three-term Democratic Rep. Susan Wild in the state's 7th Congressional District, which is one of the most evenly divided House districts in the country.\nIn flipping the seat in 2018 and in her 2020 and 2022 re-elections, Wild's races have come down to the wire. But Wild, in anticipation of another bruising re-election bid, has assembled a formidable campaign war chest, far ahead of her GOP challengers.\nThe GOP congressional primary is a three-way race between state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, National Guard veteran Kevin Dellicker and attorney Maria Montero.\n\"Both national parties are almost guaranteed to invest in this race,\" Covey emphasized. \"But the GOP candidates' anemic fundraising has made some national GOP strategists less bullish on flipping this seat, and other Democratic-held swing seats could take priority in November.\"\nRepublicans are also taking aim at Democratic Rep. Matt Carwright in northeastern Pennsylvania's 8th Congressional District. And across the state, in the Pittsburgh-based 17th District, Rep. Chris Deluzio is being targeted by the GOP.\nBut neither district is expected to have competitive Republican primaries on Tuesday.\nWealthy construction company CEO Rob Bresnahan is considered the presumptive nominee in the 8th District, while state Rep. Rob Mercuri doesn't face any major rivals in the primary in the 17th.\nWhile they play plenty of defense in Pennsylvania, Democrats are also eyeing an opportunity to flip a red seat. That opportunity is in the 10th District — anchored by the state capital Harrisburg in the central part of the state — where former Freedom Caucus Chair Scott Perry is up for re-election.\nRepublicans control the House 218-213, with vacant seats in three red districts and one in a blue district. The Cook Report rates 22 races as toss-ups, evenly split between the Democrats and Republicans.\nRepublicans controlled the House majority for eight years before the Democrats won back the chamber in the 2018 midterms. In the 2020 elections, the GOP defied expectations and took a big bite out of the Democrats' majority. The GOP narrowly won back control of the chamber in the 2022 midterms, but hopes of a red wave never materialized.",

            "summary": "House Democrats are signaling that they're open to making a deal to help Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., keep his job if Republican rebels file a motion to oust him from leadership.\nSeveral Democrats who spoke with Fox News Digital said they think their colleagues would insulate the Louisiana Republican if he put legislation on foreign aid on the House floor for a vote – specifically singling out Ukraine and Israel – though they all maintained that they'd follow the lead of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and other Democratic leaders.\nRep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, told reporters, \"I think it's unlikely I would support vacating him. We'll see.\"\n\"The big thing is, I want a vote on Ukraine. More to the point, I want Ukraine to get the aid. We waited months longer than we should have for highly questionable reasons. Now we're down to the last minute, Ukraine's hanging on by their fingernails,\" Smith said.\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., became the second GOP lawmaker after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., to threaten to file a motion to vacate against Johnson, which would trigger a vote on his ouster. Massie told Johnson in a closed-door Tuesday House GOP meeting that Johnson should step aside after a vote happens on his recently announced foreign aid plan or face the threat of losing his gavel.\nDemocrats do not necessarily have to vote against ousting Johnson – any vote on vacating him would likely be preceded by a vote to table the motion, which would effectively kill it. Likewise, simply not showing up to vote on a motion to vacate would make the margins more favorable for Johnson.\nThe Louisiana Republican is leader of a razor-thin House GOP majority of just two seats. While that means that just a small amount of dissent can cost him the job, it also means he would likely only need a few Democrats to help him keep it.\n\"I think Democrats are very open to a deal, but that has to come from Republicans,\" Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., said on Tuesday.\nAsked if Johnson would have to reach out to Democrats to initiate that deal, Moulton said, \"Of course, he's the Speaker of the House. It's his f---ing job.\"\nMoulton, however, said passing aid to Ukraine would not be enough in exchange for the Democrats' help. \"The bar's been pathetically low for the Republican Party for a long time. But no, in my personal opinion, simply doing his job and allowing a democratic vote on legislation is not enough for a deal,\" he said, though he did not elaborate on what a deal should entail.\nRep. Don Beyer, D-Va., told Fox News Digital that Jeffries signaled there is a way forward for Johnson to make a deal with Democrats.\n\"Hakeem Jeffries has made that clear a number of times. You know, I've said same thing – I hate the idea of punishing Mike Johnson for doing the right thing,\" Beyer, a progressive, told Fox News Digital in regard to a foreign aid plan. \"The one I think most of us care the most about is Ukraine aid, and then secondarily, some kind of Israel-Gaza package.\"\nBeyer would not say if Johnson's proposal on foreign aid would be enough for Democrats to help him, given the lack of legislative text, but did not rule it out, either. Meanwhile, Johnson has faced bipartisan pressure to take up the Senate's $95 billion supplemental aid package for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and Gaza.\n\"Hopefully he's found a way to manage his disruptive caucus by breaking it into pieces…without having to put the whole Senate bill on the floor, which is apparently not a winning strategy from his perspective,\" Beyer said.\nRep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., said he would consider voting to table a motion to oust Johnson if he put foreign aid up for a vote – if only not to empower the right wing of the Republican conference.\n\"At the end of the day, if my job is to make sure that we can continue the world order, and that my job is to make sure that we get our allies the aid that they need so that our allies don't look at the U.S. as a non-functioning body anymore, and turn to China and turn to Russia, if the idea is voting for a motion to table or letting [Massie and Greene] take this all down, yeah, I would vote for motion to table,\" Moskowitz said.\nBut Republicans were skeptical about that being a permanent safety net.\n\"I don't think that works,\" Massie told reporters on Tuesday. \"I think for every Democrat that comes to save him he'll lose at least two or three more in our conference, and that makes it toxic.\"\nAnother GOP lawmaker who spoke with Fox News Digital suggested Johnson would lose control of the House GOP conference if Democrats saved him during a vacate vote.\n\"I think it's a different conference then,\" the GOP lawmaker said. \"If I'm the Democrats and I get asked to do that, the quid pro quo on that would make it enormously difficult to lead the conference. I mean, he's really gonna be the leader of the uniparty then.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to Johnson and Jeffries' offices for comment.",

            "excerpt": "Peter Barca, a Democrat with a history of serving Wisconsin, including in Congress in the 1990s, has announced his candidacy for Congress again on Thursday.",
            "summary": "A Democrat who represented southeast Wisconsin in Congress in the 1990s before going on to become a leader in the Assembly and state revenue secretary announced Thursday that he's running for Congress again.\nPeter Barca announced his bid against Republican U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, who is seeking a fourth term. Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District, previously represented by former House Speaker Paul Ryan, leans Republican but was made more competitive under new boundary lines adopted in 2022.\nThe seat is a target for Democrats nationally as they attempt to regain majority control of the House. It is one of only two congressional districts in Wisconsin that are viewed as competitive. The other is western Wisconsin's 3rd Congressional District held by Republican U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden.\nRepublicans hold six of Wisconsin's eight congressional seats.\nBarca, 68, previously held the 1st Congressional District seat from 1993 to 1995. He had previously considered running again for the seat after Ryan stepped down in 2018.\nBarca is the first well-known Democrat to get into the race. National Democrats are expected to back Barca's campaign. The primary is Aug. 13.\nBarca, in a statement announcing his campaign, said his long record of public service showed that he was a fighter for working families and contrasted himself with a \"do-nothing, dysfunctional Congress.\"\n\"We need someone to step up and start going to bat for our families again,\" he said.\nThe Steil campaign said in a statement that Barca has \"put his political career ahead of Wisconsin families\" over the past 40 years. The campaign also faulted Barca for opposing a 2016 bill that would have banned sanctuary cities and for voting in 1993 for a budget bill in Congress that raised the gas tax.\nNational Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Mike Marinella branded Barca as a \"sacrificial lamb\" who has \"put his out of touch policies ahead of Wisconsinites.\"\nSteil was elected in 2018 by 12 percentage points, and won reelection by 19 points in 2020 and 9 points in 2022.\nBarca was elected to serve in the state Assembly from 1985 until 1993 when he resigned after winning a special election to Congress. After he lost in 1995, former President Bill Clinton appointed him to serve as Midwest regional administrator to the U.S. Small Business Administration.\nHe was elected again to the Assembly in 2008 and served as Democratic minority leader from 2011 to 2017.\nBarca was leader of Democrats in 2011 during the fight over collective bargaining rights. While his Democratic colleagues in the Senate fled to Illinois in an attempt to block passage of a bill that effectively ended collective bargaining for public workers, Barca helped organize a filibuster in the Assembly that lasted more than 60 hours.\nBarca stepped down as minority leader, in part over grumbling from fellow Democrats over his support for a $3 billion incentive package for Foxconn, the Taiwanese manufacturing company that had planned to locate a massive facility in his district.\nBarca left the Assembly in 2019 when Gov. Tony Evers tapped him to be secretary of the state Department of Revenue. He resigned last month.",

            "summary": "Republicans are planning to pin Senate Democrats' move to kill the articles of impeachment against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on vulnerable incumbents ahead of the November elections.\nAfter several Democratic senators who face tough re-election battles voted in line with their party on Wednesday in order to deem the House-passed impeachment articles unconstitutional and forego a trial, Republican candidates are already using it to their advantage.\n\"Joe Biden's wide open border is going to be a top issue for voters headed into November,\" National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) spokesperson Maggie Abboud told Fox News Digital in a statement.\n\"You can bet we are going to highlight Senate Democrats' refusal to hold Joe Biden's DHS Secretary accountable on the campaign trail, in advertising, and in every other way possible,\" she added.\nA spokesperson for One Nation, a group aligned with Senate Republican leadership and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., also shared that it would be continuing to hit Democrats hard on immigration in the wake of Senate Democrats' votes to block the impeachment trial of Mayorkas from moving forward.\nRepublican candidates taking on Democrats in competitive races, such as those in Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, were quick to slam their opponents for voting in line with their party and allowing Mayorkas to escape scrutiny.\n\"Everyone should be outraged that Jon Tester does more for illegal immigrants in Washington than he does for legal taxpaying American citizens,\" former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, a Republican Senate candidate in Montana, said in a statement.\nAfter voting with his party, Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., suggested the impeachment was a partisan game, while also urging both Mayorkas and Biden to use their executive branch authorities to help secure the border and pushing his colleagues in Congress to pass a bipartisan border package.\nHis campaign further told Fox News Digital in a statement that while Tester works towards a bipartisan solution on the border, \"Tim Sheehy opposes the bipartisan border security bill endorsed by border patrol agents, and repeatedly called to defund the Department of Homeland Security.\"\nCampaigns for Bernie Moreno, the Republican Senate nominee in Ohio, and David McCormick, Sam Brown and Eric Hovde, expected to be the Republican nominees for Senate in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin, respectively, each made similar criticisms of vulnerable incumbent Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Bob Casey, D-Pa.; Jacky Rosen, D-Nev.; and Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis.\n\"Together, Casey, Biden and Mayorkas have enabled drug cartels to flood Pennsylvania communities with deadly drugs like fentanyl,\" claimed Elizabeth Gregory, a spokesperson for McCormick.\nAs Republicans add the Mayorkas impeachment dismissal to their attacks on Democratic opponents, the incumbent senators are already pushing back.\nIn a statement, Baldwin spokesperson Andrew Mamo said, \"Tammy is focused on solutions, not political games,\" reiterating her support for a \"bipartisan border compromise.\"\n\"Senator Rosen is supporting solutions to increase border security and fix our broken immigration system because she is a bipartisan and independent voice for her state,\" Rosen's campaign said in a statement, criticizing \"the extreme MAGA Republicans running against her\" as \"rubber stamps for Trump.\"\nA Brown campaign spokesperson similarly pointed to the senator's support for the bipartisan package, noting that Moreno vocally opposed it.\nCasey's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesperson Tommy Garcia further claimed, \"Republican Senate candidates lost their message on the border the minute they opposed the border security bill that members of their own party helped write,\" referencing a border package that was negotiated by Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla.; Chris Murphy, D-Conn.; and Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., which quickly lost support following former President Donald Trump's public criticism.\nGarcia remarked that \"the ads write themselves,\" following the Republicans' abandonment of the border package.\nBoth Republicans and Democrats appear to be prepping to wield the border issues against one another, but Republican strategist Doug Heye noted that Democrats \"are massively on defense on the border.\"\nWith this in mind, Heye also said, \"Impeachment of the DHS Secretary was largely a niche issue for the Republican base already well-committed in those races.\"\nUncommitted and swing voters are not likely to have paid attention to it, he said.\nKyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, agreed with Heye's assessment, adding, \"I don't think the specifics of the Mayorkas impeachment matter much if at all — it just seems like too much of an Inside Washington story to matter.\"\nHowever, he pointed out \"[President] Biden has terrible numbers on immigration.\"\n\"Republicans will of course hammer on the issue, so it is something Democrats need to be prepared to counter,\" he continued.\nRepublican strategist David Kochel called the Mayorkas impeachment a \"lose/lose\" situation for Democrats. While vulnerable incumbents are expressing their support for the bipartisan border package, he noted it wasn't accomplished, and thus it is more difficult for them to use in their favor.\n\"The idea was to kill this thing quickly and hope voters forget about it,\" he said of the Mayorkas impeachment proceedings. Going through with a full trial likely would have looked worse for Democrats, he added.\nFox News Digital reached out to DHS for comment.",

            "summary": "Former two-term Republican Gov. Larry Hogan — who's aiming to flip a Democrat-controlled open Senate seat in his heavily blue home state of Maryland — is spotlighting his grassroots fundraising as he works to paint a stark contrast with the multi-millionaire front-runner for the Democratic nomination.\nHogan, considered the overwhelming front-runner for the GOP nomination in next month's primary, is running in the contest to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin in a race that is one of a handful that may determine if the Republicans win back the Senate majority.\nThe former governor, a vocal GOP critic of former President Donald Trump, may face off in November against Rep. David Trone, the polling front-runner in a crowded field of Democrats vying for their party's Senate nomination. The Democratic field also includes Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, who is second in public opinion surveys.\nTrone, the founder and co-owner along with his brother of the alcohol retailer Total Wine and More, is one of the wealthiest members of Congress and is largely self-funding his Senate bid.\nThe congressman has loaned his campaign nearly $42 million since launching his bid in May of last year, according to federal campaign finance records. That makes him the largest self-funder of a Senate primary in American history, according to Federal Election Commission filings.\nHogan's campaign, along with two aligned political action committees, hauled in over $3.1 million in fundraising since the former governor declared his Senate candidacy in mid-February.\nHis campaign, asked about Trone's self-funding, spotlighted an upcoming May 4 fundraising barbecue, where those attending are asked to contribute small-dollar donations.\n\"Following Governor Hogan's bus tour directly reaching voters in every region of the state, we are excited to host a grassroots family BBQ with hundreds of supporters with tickets starting at $50 and kids under 12 for free,\" the campaign told Fox News.\nHis team, pointing to the likelihood of a Hogan-Trone faceoff in November, vowed that their candidate \"may be outspent, but not be outworked in this campaign.\"\nTrone's campaign told Fox News that their candidate \"has been crystal clear that he's prepared to do whatever it takes to beat Larry Hogan in November and protect the Democratic Senate majority.\"\n\"With national Republicans and right-wing donors flooding Maryland with contributions to Hogan, there has never been a more important time to take the fight directly to Mitch McConnell, Larry Hogan and Donald Trump. David Trone is the best candidate to do that,\" they argued in a statement.\nThe latest polls indicate Hogan topping either Trone or Alsobrooks in general election matchups in Maryland, a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a two-to-one margin.\n\"I would not put a lot of stock in polls right now. We've got a lot to do. We have not elected a Republican senator from Maryland since 1980, when Ronald Reagan was elected president,\" Hogan cautioned in a Fox News Digital interview last month.\nHe noted that \"it's a tough state — the bluest state in America. But I think if we work hard, we have the ability to get people to vote their hearts and vote for the person they think can do the job and not just vote straight party line.\"\nA successful business leader before entering politics, Hogan seriously mulled a run for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination and made numerous trips in 2022 to New Hampshire, the state that holds the first primary on the GOP nominating calendar.\nBut in March of last year, Hogan announced he wouldn't seek his party's presidential nomination.\nDuring his last year as governor, Republican leaders in the nation's capital and in Maryland heavily courted Hogan to run for the Senate in the 2022 midterm elections against Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen. But Hogan declined to run.\nLast month, Hogan told Fox News a main reason he's now running for the Senate is to \"bring some sanity back to the divisiveness and dysfunction\" in the nation's capital. He's also touting his ability during his tenure as governor to work with a Democratic-dominated legislature to reach consensus.\nAnd in a new nearly $1 million ad blitz launched on Wednesday, Hogan takes aim at the \"partisan BS\" in Washington. In the spot, Hogan vows \"to be a voice of common sense\" and \"get stuff done\" in the Senate.\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign arm of the Senate GOP which heavily courted Hogan to run, is footing half the bill for running the spot on TV, digital, and streaming services.\nHogan's entry into the Senate race in Maryland is giving Democrats more headaches.\nDemocrats currently control the U.S. Senate with a 51-49 majority, but Republicans are looking at a favorable Senate map this year, with Democrats defending 23 of the 34 seats up for grabs.\nThree of those seats are in red states that Trump carried in 2020 — Ohio, Montana and West Virginia, where Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin is not running for re-election. And five more are in key general election battlegrounds.",

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is hosting a town hall featuring Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., along with Reps.

But Republicans and more moderate Democrats warn that a permanent cease-fire will only help Hamas, and could endanger the lives of dozens of Israeli hostages still being held by anti-Israel terrorists since October.\nThe group said AIPAC is \"targeting some of our most ardent advocates for peace in Congress.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to AIPAC for comment.\nAIPAC is expected to funnel millions of dollars into primary and general election candidates to unseat those progressive lawmakers, including Bowman, who is appearing at the Monday night event.\n\"The candidates Our Revolution is backing have been on the forefront of advocating for a cease-fire in Gaza, as well as voicing their intent to condition U.S. funding of the far-right Netanyahu regime,\" the press release said, referencing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\"They have also been at the forefront of the fight for critical progressive issues that will be crucial to driving voter turnout in the 2024 general election, including climate action, student loan relief, affordable housing, comprehensive immigration reform, and racial justice.\"\nAsked for a response to the Monday event, AIPAC told Fox News Digital, \"We are proud to engage in the democratic process to help elect pro-Israel candidates, and we will not be deterred by an extremist, anti-Israel fringe. We believe that it is entirely consistent with progressive values to stand with the Jewish state as it confronts aggression from Iran and its terrorist proxies.\"\nA spokesperson for the group also told Fox News Digital that AIPAC is \"the largest PAC contributor\" to Democratic candidates.",

            "summary": "Colorado's Democratic-controlled House on Sunday passed a bill that would ban the sale and transfer of semiautomatic firearms, a major step for the legislation after roughly the same bill was swiftly killed by Democrats last year.\nThe bill, which passed on a 35-27 vote, is now on its way to the Democratic-led state Senate. If it passes there, it could bring Colorado in line with 10 other states — including California, New York and Illinois — that have prohibitions on semiautomatic guns.\nBut even in a state plagued by some of the nation's worst mass shootings, such legislation faces headwinds.\nColorado's political history is purple, shifting blue only recently. The bill's chances of success in the state Senate are lower than they were in the House, where Democrats have a 46-19 majority and a bigger far-left flank. Gov. Jared Polis, also a Democrat, has indicated his wariness over such a ban.\nLast year, a similar bill died in committee, with some Democratic lawmakers citing concerns over the sweep of a ban and promises they made to their constituents to avoid government overreach affecting most gun owners' rights.\nDemocrats last year passed and Polis signed into law four less-expansive gun control bills. Those included raising the age for buying any gun from 18 to 21; establishing a three-day waiting period between the purchase and receipt of a gun; strengthening the state's red flag law; and rolling back some legal protections for the firearms industry, exposing it to lawsuits from the victims of gun violence.\nThose laws were signed months after five people were killed at an LGBTQ+ nightclub in Colorado Springs last year. Soon, the state will mark the 25th anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School shooting that killed 13 people. Other mass shootings in Colorado include 12 people killed in 2012 at an Aurora movie theater and 10 people killed in 2021 at a Boulder supermarket.\n\"This is the state where the modern era of the mass shooting began with Columbine,\" Democratic Rep. Javier Mabrey said in urging fellow lawmakers to join other states that ban semiautomatic weapons.\nRepublicans decried the legislation as an onerous encroachment on the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment. They argued that mental illness and people who do not value life — not guns — are the issues that should be addressed. People with ill intent can use other weapons, such as knives, to harm others, they argued.\nDemocrats responded that semiautomatic weapons can cause much more damage in a short period of time.\n\"In Aurora, when the shooter walked in that theater and opened fire,\" Mabrey said, \"and in less than 90 seconds shot up a room full of people. That cannot be done with a knife, that can't be done with a knife.\"",

Kennedy Jr. at 13%, Green Party candidate Jill Stein at 3% and independent progressive Cornell West at 2%.\nAmong likely voters, it's Trump 42%, Biden 41%, Kennedy 12%, Stein 3% and West 1%.\nWisconsin — which Democrats carried in presidential elections from 1988 through 2012 — was part of the party's so-called ‘blue wall.'\nBut eight years ago, Trump topped Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by a razor-thin margin to win the state. But four years later, Wisconsin was one of six battleground states that Biden narrowly carried over Trump to win the White House.\nThe poll indicates Biden topping Trump 97%-3% among Democrats, with Trump holding a 91%-9% lead among Republicans.\n\"Independents lean substantially to Trump in this month's survey, with 59% for Trump and 41% voting for Biden,\" a release from the Marquette Law School Poll highlights.\nThe poll also notes, \"In the five-way ballot test, Kennedy takes more votes from Republicans than from Democrats and an especially large share from independents. Stein and West take more votes from Democrats than from Republicans.\"\nAccording to the survey, Trump enjoys the advantage when it comes to enthusiasm. Respondents who said they were very enthusiastic about voting supported Trump over Biden 59%-41%.\nThe president campaigned in Wisconsin last month, with Trump stopping in the state earlier this month.\nWisconsin is also one of a handful of states that will determine if Republicans can win back the Senate majority.\nThe poll indicates Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin leads Republican challenger Eric Hovde 52%-47% among registered voters. But the survey suggests the race is deadlocked at 50% among likely voters.\nThe Marquette Law School poll questioned 814 registered voters, with an overall sampling error of plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.",

            "summary": "Alabama lawmakers advanced legislation Wednesday to ensure President Joe Biden will appear on the state's November ballot, mirroring accommodations made four years ago for then-President Donald Trump.\nLegislative committees in the Alabama House of Representatives and Senate approved identical bills that would push back the state's certification deadline from 82 days to 74 days before the general election in order to accommodate the date of Democrats' nominating convention.\nThe bills now move to to the full chambers. Alabama has one of the earliest candidate certification deadlines in the country which has caused difficulties for whichever political party has the later convention date that year.\n\"We want to make sure every citizen in the state of Alabama has the opportunity to vote for the candidate of his or her choice,\" Democratic Sen. Merika Coleman, the sponsor of the Senate bill, told the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nThe issue of Biden's ballot access has arisen in Alabama and Ohio as Republican secretaries of state warned that certification deadlines fall before the Democratic National Convention is set to begin on Aug. 19. The Biden campaign has asked the two states to accept provisional certification, arguing that has been done in past elections. The Republican election chiefs have refused, arguing they don't have authority, and will enforce the deadlines.\nDemocrats proposed the two Alabama bills, but the legislation moved out of committee with support from Republicans who hold a lopsided majority in the Alabama Legislature. The bills were approved with little discussion. However, two Republicans who spoke in favor of the bill called it an issue of fairness.\nRepublican Rep. Bob Fincher, chairman of the committee that heard the House bill, said this is \"not the first time we've run into this problem\" and the state made allowances.\n\"I'd like to think that if the shoe was on the other foot, that this would be taken care of. And I think that Alabamians have a deep sense of fairness when it comes to politics and elections,\" Republican Sen. Sam Givhan said during the committee meeting.\nTrump faced the same issue in Alabama in 2020. The Republican-controlled Alabama Legislature in 2020 passed legislation to change the certification deadline for the 2020 election. The bill stated that the change was made \"to accommodate the dates of the 2020 Republican National Convention.\" However, an attorney representing the Biden campaign and DNC, wrote in a letter to Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen that it was provisional certification that allowed Trump on the ballot in 2020, because there were still problems with the GOP date even with the new 2020 deadline.\nAllen has maintained he does not have the authority to accept provisional certification.\nSimilarly, in Ohio, Attorney General Dave Yost and Secretary of State Frank LaRose, both Republicans, rejected a request from Democrats to waive the state's ballot deadline administratively by accepting a \"provisional certification\" for Biden.\nIn a letter Monday, Yost's office told LaRose that Ohio law does not allow the procedure. LaRose's office conveyed that information, in turn, in a letter to Democratic lawyer Don McTigue. LaRose's chief legal counsel, Paul Disantis, noted it was a Democrats who championed the state's ballot deadline, one of the earliest in the nation, 15 years ago. It falls 90 days before the general election, which this year is Aug. 7.\nOhio Senate Democratic Leader Nickie Antonio said she is waiting to hear from the Democratic National Committee on how to proceed. One of her members, state Sen. Bill DiMora, said he has legislation for either a short- or long-term fix ready to go when the time comes.",

            "summary": "Former President Trump's plan for Ukraine aid to be granted as a loan could be the determining factor that pushes a supplemental aid package across the finish line in Congress.\nSeveral congressional aides on both sides of the aisle noted potential support for Trump's idea for assistance to the country – which is in an ongoing war with Russia – in the form of a zero interest loan with an unlimited lifespan. The likelihood of support for such a measure is especially high if it is determined to be the only way to pass an aid package to Ukraine and Israel.\nIn the wake of an Iranian drone attack on Israel over the weekend, a renewed sense of urgency was placed on lobbying attempts for aid in Congress, which were already underway.\nThe Senate passed a $95.3 billion foreign aid package that included Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan in February. Despite passing the upper chamber, it managed to split the Republican conference, several of whom had been critical of continued aid to Ukraine. A number of Republican senators were also unhappy that the package didn't address the southern border.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has yet to bring the supplemental package to the House floor for a vote, despite many House Republicans having urged him to do so. The package would likely pass, but with significant Republican opposition.\nWith a path forward on foreign aid still unclear, House Republican leaders are set to meet Monday evening to discuss potential ways to address both Israel and Ukraine.\nAccording to several Democratic congressional aides, the attack on Iran isn't likely to make Senate Democrats more amenable to a stand-alone bill for Israel. This is partially because Ukraine aid would have more difficulty passing without being tied to Israel. One Democratic aide even suggested stand-alone Israel aid would face trouble passing without the alottment for Ukraine.\nWhat the attack on Israel at the hands of Iran is more likely to prompt from Democrats is an even harder push for the House to take up the Senate-passed supplemental bill, per one Congressional aide.\nWhile Senate Democrats still prefer the supplemental bill and believe it is the fastest way to get aid to Israel, they aren't completely opposed to other ways of obtaining it.\nTwo aides told Fox News Digital that numerous Senate Democrats are open to advancing a package that combines aid for Ukraine and Israel, with the provision that assistance to Ukraine is extended as a loan, aligning with Trump's proposal.\nThis is especially true if it presents a faster opportunity to get aid to both countries.\nRepublicans are similarly interested in the idea of the aid as a loan, per two GOP aides.\nA Senate Republican aide indicated that the appetite for the supplemental package, which was passed but severely divided Republicans, likely remains the same. Instead, the recent attack on Israel renewed desires to pass Israel aid apart from Ukraine and Taiwan, which Democrats have largely rejected.",

            "summary": "Minnesota Democrats have disavowed a local party chapter's endorsement of a state House candidate who has a violent criminal history and is accused of stalking and harassing the Republican lawmaker he is challenging.\nJudd Hoff was endorsed this month by Democrats in District 12 to run for a central Minnesota seat that has been represented by Republican Rep. Mary Franson of Alexandria since 2011. Republicans were quick Monday to demand that Democrats rescind their backing of Hoff.\n\"Democrats must withdraw their endorsement of this repeat criminal,\" GOP Rep. Josh Heintzeman, of Nisswa, said in a statement. \"For years he has harassed and stalked Rep. Franson by digging through her trash, publishing her address and contact information, filming her at her private residence, and relentlessly sending rude and threatening messages online.\"\nFranson's district is heavily Republican and is not considered competitive. She won reelection in 2022 with nearly 70% of the vote. She tweeted that she considered Hoff to be dangerous and asked, \"Why is this the guy they want as a candidate?\"\nKen Martin, chairman of Minnesota's Democratic Party, said in statement later Monday that the party \"strongly disavows this endorsement,\" and he asked the local party unit to withdraw its endorsement immediately. He said the state party won't spend any of its resources to support Hoff.\n\"We all have a responsibility, regardless of party or ideology, to reject violence in our politics — we can and should expect better from candidates for elected office,\" the Democratic leader said.\nHoff's criminal history includes a felony second-degree assault conviction for wielding a 23-inch machete during an argument in 2020. He was sentenced to 13 months and spent about eight months in jail. Court records show the judge gave him a break over the prosecution's objections because the victim was the initial aggressor.\nIn a video posted to YouTube, first surfaced by former GOP operative Michael Brodkorb, Hoff admitted to digging through Franson's garbage and acknowledged moving into a home across the street from Franson.\nThe chair of the district and county party committee, Bonnie Bina, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that Hoff was the only candidate who came forward to run for the seat. She acknowledged that it's hard to recruit Democratic candidates to take on incumbents in such a heavily Republican area.\nBina also acknowledged that delegates knew that Hoff had a criminal record and had spent time in prison. But she said he told them he was past that and had become active in the community. She declined to comment on whether they were aware of the allegations that he harassed Franson.\nThe local party committee will decide its next steps after getting more information from the state party office and reviewing party rules, she said, adding that she didn't know how long that would take.\nHoff did not immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.",

            "summary": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Pennsylvania House Democrats on Thursday proposed a process to determine if state representatives are \"incapacitated\" and to sanction or expel them, moving in the wake of intense criticism after one of their members voted remotely this week while being sought on charges he violated a restraining order.\nThe resolution introduced by Majority Leader Matt Bradford of Montgomery County would establish a new group consisting of five House leaders to determine if a representative is impaired physically or mentally so that they are not able to perform their duties.\nHis proposed rules change is a response to voting during this week's legislative session by state Rep. Kevin Boyle, a Philadelphia Democrat who faces an arrest warrant on allegations he violated a restraining order. Details about the warrant have not been released, and Boyle has not responded to phone messages seeking comment left Thursday and earlier this week.\nA Philadelphia Police spokeswoman, Officer Tanya Little, said Thursday afternoon Boyle is not in custody.\nBoyle lost his committee chairmanship and Capitol access privileges in February after a videotaped episode at a Montgomery County bar where he was aggressively rude to the staff and appeared intoxicated.\nBoyle's status carries significant implications for the power balance in the 203-member House, currently with a 102—100 Democratic majority and a special election next week for the vacancy, a Republican-leaning district in the Pocono Mountains.\nRepublican leaders have decried Boyle's ability to vote remotely, telling reporters Wednesday that House Democrats should have simply put Boyle on leave and accusing their Democratic counterparts of allowing Boyle to vote remotely to preserve their thin majority.\nMinority Leader Bryan Cutler, a Lancaster County Republican, called Bradford's proposal a complicated answer to a simple problem. He asked Democrats to stop Boyle from voting \"until this issue is finally resolved.\"\n\"Pennsylvania House Democrats continue to use this tragedy to further the tyranny of their majority and that is shameful,\" Cutler said in a statement. The House returns to session April 29.\nA Republican from Fayette County, Rep. Charity Grimm Krupa, announced on Wednesday she was working on a proposal to change House rules to prevent anyone from voting remotely if they are incarcerated or facing an active arrest warrant. And the only Republican in the House from Philadelphia, Rep. Martina White, said her office has been fielding calls from Boyle's constituents because his nearby district office hasn't been responding.\nBoyle, 44, is currently facing a primary opponent as he seeks an eighth term in the House. His brother is U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle, a Democrat from a Philadelphia district.\nKevin Boyle was charged three years ago with harassment and violation of a protection from abuse order after showing up at his wife's house, charges that were subsequently dropped. His attorney at the time described it as a \"domestic issue\" that did not involve allegations of violence. Kevin Boyle later said he was treated at a mental health facility.\nBradford's proposal would allow targeted lawmakers to participate, with a lawyer, in the inquiry that would be done by the speaker, minority and majority leaders, and minority and majority caucus chairpersons. The group would meet in secret and could direct that the lawmaker whose status is in question be examined by doctors or psychologists. It would have subpoena power.\nIf the group would deem a House member to be incapacitated and unable to perform their duties, it would be up to a vote of the full House to decide whether to limit their powers and privileges, suspend them without pay or expel them. If the lawmaker hasn't been expelled and has completed treatment, they could ask to get their powers or status back.",

            "excerpt": "Liberal New York City rabbi warns Biden, Democrats not to count carte blanche on Jewish voters amid the party's increasing tolerance for antisemitism.",
            "summary": "A left-wing New York rabbi from the reform movement, a major Jewish denomination that breaks from traditional orthodoxy, is speaking out against what he views as the Democratic Party's perceived increasing tolerance of antisemitism.\nSending a warning to Democrats, Rabbi Ammi Hirsch spoke about the 2024 elections and how liberal Jewish voters are planning to cast their ballots at the pulpit of The Free Synagogue on the west side of New York City on Friday.\n\"Neither I nor our synagogue engage in partisan politics. So allow me to express a nonpartisan word to all of our friends in elected office from the Democratic Party, from someone who is finely attuned to American Jewish sentiment,\" he said.\n\"Do not take American Jews for granted,\" Hirsch warned. \"I have spoken with so many American Jews in the past few months who have surprised me with their anxiety about developments in the Democratic Party and their perception that it is becoming increasingly hostile to Israel and increasingly tolerant of anti-Zionism and antisemitism in its own ranks. Be careful. The results of the upcoming election do not only depend on Michigan.\"\nMichigan has been a flashpoint for anti-Israel activism.\nA group of Democrats called \"Listen to Michigan\" started a movement in opposition to President Biden amid his support for Israel's response to the Oct. 7 attacks in dismantling Hamas in Gaza. The movement poses a potential headache for the Biden campaign in a battleground state that has seen close margins in the last two presidential elections.\nFormer President Trump leads President Biden in Michigan in the Real Clear Politics average of polls by 2 points. Pollsters found among registered voters, Trump maintains 50% support compared to Biden's 42% in Michigan.\nThe Biden campaign has worked to ease the tension with voters in Dearborn, a city with the highest per capita Muslim population in the country. Campaign officials met with Arab American and Muslim leaders in the area in January, though that outreach was derided as \"dehumanizing\" by Democratic Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud.\nHowever, following \"Death to America\" chants in Dearborn, the administration and campaign drew a proverbial line in the sand.\n\"The White House condemns these abhorrent and antisemitic remarks in the strongest terms,\" deputy press secretary Andrew Bates told Fox News Digital.\n\"If we do not prevail, the assault on liberty and decency will not end in the Middle East. It will come to the Midwest. It will not stop at Kibbutz Beiri. It will invade Brussels, Barcelona, Berlin, Baltimore. And even if I am the last liberal in America, I will stand alone and warn of the pending disaster,\" the rabbi said at the pulpit. \"We must all share the responsibility for restoring our country's moral sanity.\"\n\"Dear friends, we have some difficult days ahead. Days of anxiety, concern, uncertainty and loss. But do not despair. Jews are not a despairing people. Better days are ahead. I promise you,\" the rabbi said.",

            "summary": "Republicans warned that vulnerable Senate Democrats would be punished in the upcoming November general election for their votes to kill the impeachment trial of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\"Every Democrat will pay a heavy price in November for willfully refusing to end this border crisis,\" said Republican conference Chairman John Barrasso, R-Wyo., in a statement following the impeachment trial proceedings.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., proposed points of order after senators were sworn in as jurors to deem both of the House-passed articles of impeachment unconstitutional. Votes on the points of order were along party lines, with all Democrats agreeing that both articles were in fact unconstitutional.\nThis included all five of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents, Sens. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., Jon Tester, D-Mont., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, Bob Casey, D-Penn., and Jacky Rosen, D-Nev.\n\"The American people will hold Senate Democrats accountable for this shameful display,\" warned House Republican leaders in a joint statement from Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., and Republican conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y.\n\"History will not be forgiving of Democrats' decision to table this hearing,\" echoed Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., in a statement. \"The American people will hold Mayorkas accountable at the ballot box this November.\"\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, additionally slammed his Democratic counterparts for disregarding \"their duty to the American people.\"\nIn his own statement following the decision to vote in line with his party, Tester said, \"Montanans want real solutions that secure the border, not partisan games from D.C. politicians.\"\nHe urged \"President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas to use their remaining executive authorities to help secure our border,\" and asked his colleagues in the Senate to revisit the bipartisan border package that was abandoned following former President Trump's public disapproval.\nTester's race is considered one of the most competitive races in the country heading into November.\n\"Senate Democrats just showed voters they will do nothing to hold Joe Biden and DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas accountable for the disastrous border policies that caused this crisis,\" National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesman Tate Mitchell said in a statement.\nRepublicans further lamented the precedent set by Wednesday's impeachment trial proceedings. \"This means that the Senate can ignore, in effect, the House's impeachment,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., remarked on the chamber floor following the Senate adjourning.\n\"This is a day that's not a proud day in the history of the Senate,\" he added.\nThroughout the Senate's history, charges and trials have only ever been dismissed when the impeached individual had resigned or was otherwise no longer in office.\nCornyn noted the precedent set is \"unfortunate\" and part of the Democrats' larger effort \"to sweep the Biden administration's failing border policies under the rug.\"\n\"In 2020, Dems voted to impeach Trump without even charging a crime. Today they voted that a *felony* CANNOT be an impeachable crime. It's beyond absurd,\" claimed Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., comparing the impeachment trial proceedings to those of Trump during his presidency.\nWhile Republicans denounced the proceedings that unfolded on the Senate floor, President Biden's administration rejoiced over the result.\n\"Today's decision by the Senate to reject House Republicans' baseless attacks on Secretary Mayorkas proves definitively that there was no evidence or Constitutional grounds to justify impeachment,\" said Mia Ehrenberg, DHS spokesperson, in a statement.\nIan Sams, White House spokesperson for Oversight and Investigations, added in his own statement, \"Once and for all, the Senate has rightly voted down this baseless impeachment that even conservative legal scholars said was unconstitutional.\"\nHe also noted that Biden and Mayorkas would \"continue doing their jobs to keep America safe and pursue actual solutions at the border.\"",

            "excerpt": "The House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a measure to condemn Iran's airstrikes on Israel, but 13 Democrats and one Republican voted against it.",
            "summary": "More than a dozen House Democrats voted against a resolution condemning Iran's airstrikes on Israel Thursday.\nThe resolution, which also affirms U.S. support for Israel responding to the attack however it deems necessary, overwhelmingly passed 404 to 14. Just one House Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., voted against the bill. Fox News Digital reached out to Massie for comment.\nHe was joined by 13 Democrats, including \"Squad\" member Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.; Cori Bush, D-Mo.; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y.; and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was also among those opposing the bill.\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., the No. 3 House GOP leader, tore into the Democrats who voted against condemning Iran in a statement to Fox News Digital after the vote.\n\"House Democrats' hatred for Israel runs so deep they would rather defend terrorists than support our strongest ally in the Middle East. Vote after vote, the Democrat Party continues to cement their position as the pro-terrorist party,\" Emmer said.\nIran fired a barrage of rockets at Israel over the weekend, 99% of which were intercepted, in retaliation for an Israeli attack on an Iranian diplomatic facility in Syria. It's a marked escalation of tensions in the region as the first attack on Israel directly from Iranian soil.\nThe 13 progressives who voted against the measure are among a growing faction of the Democratic Party who are critical of the U.S.'s strong ties to Israel, particularly in the wake of Israel's invasion of Gaza.\nIsrael's war on Hamas began after militants from the pro-Palestinian terror group invaded southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 and killed more than 1,000 people. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians, has said over 30,000 Palestinians have died in the months since.\nHouse Republicans have seized on the Democratic divides over Israel, distancing themselves from that fight by standing firm with the longstanding relationship. In response to the Iran attack, House GOP leadership lined up 17 bills for a vote this week affirming U.S. support for Israel and against Iran.\nOcasio-Cortez criticized that effort earlier this week in a statement, \"Following last weekend's unprecedented response by Iran to Israel's attack on its consulate, the Republican Majority is explicitly leveraging a series of bills to further escalate tensions in the Middle East.\"\n\"This is a blatant attempt to distract from their own incompetence. The country and the world need real leadership from the House of Representatives in this moment, not resolutions designed purposefully to increase the likelihood of a deadly regional war or worse. I will oppose any cynical effort to further inflame tensions, destroy a path to peace in the region, and further divide the American people,\" she said.",

            "excerpt": "A political organization with ties to Dem. Rep. Eric Swalwell is sending mailers boosting a GOP challenger to a Trump supporting incumbent in a key Pennsylvania primary.",
            "summary": "A California-based group linked to Democrats is getting involved in a Pennsylvania congressional primary by boosting a Republican against a Republican incumbent in the latest example of liberal funds being directed toward a GOP primary.\nTrue Patriots PA, a liberal group linked to California Democrat Rep. Eric Swalwell, sent out mailers to Pennsylvania voters to slam GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick and say he is not conservative enough, in essence boosting his primary opponent, Mark Houck, Politico first reported this week.\nFox News Digital obtained some of those mailers that framed Fitzpatrick as a \"RINO\" (\"Republican in name only\") and implied he wasn't conservative enough for the base that supports former President Trump.\n\"MAGA is ready to bag the biggest RINO in Congress,\" reads one of the mailers along with a photo of Fitzpatrick photoshopped onto a rhinoceros body. \"We sent Brian Fitzpatrick to D.C. to represent our values, instead, he became best friends with Kamala Harris and the Democrats,\" another mailer said.\nFEC records show True Patriots PA spent roughly $26,000 on the mailer.\nMeagan Olson is listed as treasurer for both True Patriots PA and the Swalwell campaign.\n\"I consider Brian a friend and someone who has bravely defied his party to help secure Ukraine aid,\" Rep. Swalwell told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"I have never heard of his primary opponent and am not involved or support any effort to defeat Brian in the primary. My office uses a professional compliance firm that serves as treasurer for dozens of campaigns.\"\nWhen reached for comment, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) directed Fox News Digital to a Washington Post article in January 2024 in which DCCC Chair Rep. Suzan DelBene said her group no longer supports the strategy of propping up \"far-right\" candidates in swing districts.\n\"It should come as no surprise that a group connected to Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat who is so dumb that he was tricked into sleeping with a Chinese spy, would be propping up self-described chronic masturbator Mark Houck in the Republican Primary against Brian Fitzpatrick,\" Defending America PAC's Chris Pack told Fox News Digital.\n\"Even Democrats as intellectually challenged as Eric Swalwell know that their best chance at flipping the one seat needed to take back Democrat control of the House of Representatives is if Mark Houck beats Brian Fitzpatrick in the primary next Tuesday.\"\nHouck, a pro-life activist, has made previous acknowledgments that he \"had a pornography problem\" as a young man and spoke openly at a church conference about talking to his son about masturbation and erections.\n\"I struggled with pornography, and of course that leads to sexual sin, masturbation and stuff. That was a chronic habit,\" Houck said in a 2010 interview, which Defending America PAC included in an ad titled \"Beat it.\"\nIn a recent statement, Houck said he \"fell victim to the dehumanizing effects of the pornography industry\" over \"two decades ago.\" He also defended the conversation about his son, saying the clips circulating online \"seizes on de-contextualized comments I made with my son present in public pursuit of this transformative ministry\" meant to steer people away from pornography.\nThe Democrat group boosting Houck is the latest example of a recent trend in which liberal funds have been used to back Republican challengers in an effort to sink candidates who support or are supported by former President Trump.\nPACs linked to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have spent millions meddling in GOP primaries this cycle, including in swing state Senate races in Ohio and Montana.\nDuty and Country PAC, affiliated with Schumer, ran ads during the Ohio GOP Senate primary that accused Trump-backed businessman Bernie Moreno of being \"too conservative for Ohio.\" That effort proved unsuccessful in the primary as Moreno won every county in the Buckeye State, beating his nearest challenger by almost 20 points.\nIn 2022, Democrats spent more than $40 million to boost six pro-Trump candidates in Republican primaries, and all six of those Republicans lost their general election races to Democrats.\nFitzpatrick, who has so far declined to say if he will endorse Trump, voted against impeaching Trump twice and won re-election in 2022 by almost 10 points, despite Biden carrying the 1st Congressional district.\n\"After years of brutal losses, the far-left has finally figured out they have no chance of beating Congressman Fitzpatrick, so they've now tagged California left-wing extremists to meddle in his primary using the same violent political rhetoric they claim to stand against,\" Fitzpatrick campaign spokesperson Ben Trundy told Fox News Digital in statement.\n\"This lame attempt to prop up Mark Houck, an admitted porn addict and serial grifter who believes in complete abortion bans with no exceptions, shows just how desperate they are to force their extreme policies on Bucks and Montgomery County voters.\"",

            "summary": "The Senate is preparing to receive articles of impeachment from the House of Representatives for Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. The looming question remains over what Democrats – who are in the majority in the upper chamber – will look to do after being sworn in as jurors on Wednesday.\nSenate Republicans are turning up the pressure on their Democrat counterparts as they warn that Democrats will look to use a procedural maneuver to quickly table a trial against Mayorkas, effectively killing it.\nImpeachment managers for the House are going to physically walk the House-passed articles over to the Senate and deliver them to Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday, Speaker Mike Johnson's office told Fox News Digital.\nFollowing the article delivery, several Republicans, including Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, will hold a press conference with some of the selected House impeachment managers.\nThe process was initially planned to begin with delivery on Wednesday last week, but GOP senators convinced Johnson to hold off on sending the articles in order to set a trial in motion earlier in the week and not ahead of a weekend when lawmakers would be eager to fly home.\nThe articles passed through the House in February, and as Republican senators waited for their arrival in the upper chamber, it's given them time to pressure their Democrat colleagues, particularly those up for reelection who face competitive races in November. With the border becoming a top issue in states across the country, several vulnerable Democrats find themselves in a difficult position when it comes to entertaining a full impeachment trial against Mayorkas.\nAll eyes are on Sens. Bob Casey, D-Pa., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and Jon Tester, D-Mont., ahead of any potential motions to table or otherwise dismiss the impeachment trial after senators are sworn in on Wednesday. Aside from Rosen, who said she would like to see the articles dismissed, the other Democrats didn't say what they would do if such a motion was under consideration.\nIt's also unclear whether Sens. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, will go along with the largely united GOP's quest to see a full trial through. Most recently, Romney questioned whether there were any high crimes or misdemeanors committed, suggesting a policy difference didn't warrant impeachment.\nThese few senators will ultimately decide what happens upon swearing in, as the Senate's party split is narrow at 49-51.\nIn an effort to force senators to allow a full trial, a number of Senate Republicans are planning to potentially halt all legislative business in the upper chamber by objecting to regular proceedings. With many noting that unanimous consent is necessary to keep the Senate moving, Republicans are preparing to object to traditionally uncontested actions that are taken to expedite Senate action and avoid wasting time.\nIn a floor speech on Monday, Senate Democrat Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., urged dismissal of the impeachment articles.\n\"Instead of doing their job and working to find legislative solutions to complex, challenging problems, too many Republicans have decided that impeachment of a Cabinet official for actually doing his job is a better exercise of time,\" he said.\nHe pleaded with his fellow senators to \"quickly dispose of these unjustifiable articles of impeachment.\"",

That's to allow adequate time for the preparation and proofreading of the ballot and to get the machines loaded. That takes time. You don't do it overnight. It's the same rule for everybody. The Democrats scheduled their convention to nominate Joe Biden after that deadline, and that creates a problem.\"\nCommonly considered a bellwether state until the 2020 election cycle, when former President Donald Trump soundly defeated President Biden in the state by eight percentage points, Ohio could further displace the Democrats with the potential challenge in question.\nYost says the party has plenty of time to get the issue resolved, however.\n\"Right now, it doesn't look like they're compliant, but, if there's anything that party has, it's a surplus of lawyers,\" he told co-host Carley Shimkus.\n\"They've got several months to figure this out. I fully expect them to figure out a way to get their candidate on the ballot. After all, he's one of the two major candidates. He's an incumbent president. But, on my watch, they're going to do it by the law.\"\nThough Ohio has been put in the spotlight in most recent election cycles, this time around, eyes linger more heavily on states like Pennsylvania, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia, among others that may determine the victor.\nPresident Biden narrowly defeated former President Trump in a majority of swing states in 2020, but polls now indicate positive news for Trump.",

Janet Mills, a Democrat.\nThe bicameral Legislature is made up of the Senate, with 22 Democrats and 13 Republicans, and the House, which has 80 Democratic members and 68 Republicans.\nDespite Democrats holding majorities, their effort is not immune to resistance as the state has a strong hunting tradition and vocal advocates for gun owner rights.\nOne bill that failed was a proposal to let gun violence victims sue weapon manufacturers.\nSo far, neither chamber has voted on a proposal for a red flag law.\nAnd, a separate measure sponsored by House Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross to fund a range of mental health and violence prevention initiatives does not yet have money in the final budget.\nThe Oct. 25, 2023 shooting that killed 18 people and injured 13 others in Lewiston prompted lawmakers to act. They specifically argued that constituents were demanding they do something that could prevent future attacks.\nOne initiative, the red flag proposal, would allow family members to petition a judge to remove guns from someone's home. The proposal differs from the state's current yellow flag law that puts law enforcement officers — not the individual's parents, siblings or children — in the lead of the process.\nThe initiative was proposed as police were warned by family members of the shooter, an Army reservist who took his own life after the deadly rampage.\nFamily members warned the eventual shooter was becoming paranoid and losing his grip on reality before the attack. He was hospitalized last summer while training with his Army Reserve unit.\nOn Sept. 15, his best friend, a fellow reservist, warned that the man was going \"to snap and do a mass shooting.\"\nSix weeks later, he carried out the deadliest shooting in Maine history.",

            "excerpt": "After House impeachment managers delivered articles of impeachment to Schumer on Tuesday, all senators are set to be sworn in as jurors to consider the impeachment of DHS Secretary Mayorkas.",
            "summary": "Senators are set to be sworn in as jurors at 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday to begin consideration of the House-passed articles of impeachment against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, a process that Republicans have warned that their Democratic colleagues will try to quickly end.\nHouse impeachment managers officially delivered the articles of impeachment, which passed the lower chamber in February, to Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Tuesday on the Senate floor.\nThe long-awaited delivery set into motion a procedure in the Senate, requiring that lawmakers be sworn in as jurors the following day to address the articles.\nHowever, Republicans have spent the last few weeks speculating that their Democratic counterparts will look to off-ramp the impeachment trial before arguments begin. This was confirmed by Schumer on the Senate floor on Wednesday morning, with the majority leader saying in remarks, \"For the sake of the Senate's integrity, and to protect impeachment for those rare cases we truly need it, senators should dismiss today's charges.\"\nSeveral Democratic senators have voiced support for dismissing the articles in the lead up to the trial's consideration, including Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., in a recent speech on the chamber floor.\nSchumer had previously stated his plans to \"expeditiously\" deal with the impeachment trial proceedings, without indicating the specific route the caucus was planning to take.\nRepublicans have expressed outrage at the likely refusal of their colleagues to allow a full impeachment trial against Mayorkas to play out. They have even threatened to shut down the Senate by making constant objections to requests for unanimous consent on regular business if a trial isn't seen all the way through.\nAt a press conference following the article delivery on Tuesday, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, previewed that \"we're going to see Chuck Schumer throw out 200 years of history [and] ignore the Constitution,\" referencing the fact that an impeachment trial has never been tabled by the Senate.\n\"He does not want these [House impeachment] managers to present the evidence of the people dying because of their policies,\" he added.\nSeveral vulnerable Democratic senators were expected to be the deciding factors on whether a trial was allowed to play out. But in recent days, multiple Democrats in highly competitive races in battleground states have revealed they want to see the trial dismissed.\nCasey expressed his opinion for the first time on Tuesday, telling CNN, \"I think we should move on and get to work on a bipartisan border security deal.\"\nThere have also been multiple Republicans whose planned votes were considered a mystery. Sens. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, are concerns on the right, despite the conference being largely united. This unity was evidenced by 43 Republicans signing onto a letter last week calling on Schumer to allow the trial to be seen all the way through.\nWith a narrow split in the upper chamber, agreement among the parties can be easily disrupted by just a few senators. Democrats hold the majority with just 51-49 over Republicans.",

            "summary": "A nonprofit founded and funded by liberal billionaire George Soros funneled a massive eight-figure sum into a prominent liberal super PAC that bankrolls several left-wing groups, according to records reviewed by Fox News Digital.\nSoros' Fund for Policy Reform poured $60 million into the Democracy PAC in the first quarter of this year, which then funneled millions of dollars into top Democratic committees benefiting House and Senate races, along with other liberal groups, FEC records posted on Monday show.\nOf the $21 million that Democracy PAC sent to a dozen left-wing groups, $8 million was evenly divided between a pair of top outside groups benefitting House and Senate Democrats, $2.5 million to Planned Parenthood, $2.5 million to BlackPAC and $1.8 million to American Bridge, a Democratic opposition research firm.\nDemocracy PAC also sent $500,000 to Americans for Contraception Victory and $1 million to the ColorOfChange PAC.\nColor of Change has been among the most active groups advocating to defund the police. In 2021, they were at the forefront of the unsuccessful push to \"dismantle\" and replace the Minneapolis Police Department, an effort that was fueled by $500,000 from George Soros' Open Society Policy Center.\n\"We know that policing doesn't keep us safe, communities do,\" reads a Color of Change petition calling on supporters to demand their local officials start the defunding process. \"Policing doesn't lead to thriving communities, investment does.\"\nThe $60 million figure was the second largest in the 2024 election cycle so far, eclipsed only by the $82.5 million a state-level super PAC gave to Never Back Down, the super PAC backing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' ill-fated presidential campaign, Bloomberg reported.\nFox News Digital reached out to Soros' Open Society Foundations for comment, but did not receive a response.\nSoros recently handed control of his political empire last year to his son, Alex, and his various organizations have continued to exert significant financial influence, including millions of dollars aimed at flipping Texas to Democrats.\nFox News Digital reported last fall that a Soros-funded group pushed more than $15 million to a nonprofit tied to President Biden's main outside super PAC for the 2024 elections to evaluate crucial policy matters.\nThe Soros network appears to be closely involved in doing what it can to help ensure President Biden is re-elected, as evidenced by Alex Soros huddling with high-ranking Democrats shortly after taking over the Open Society Foundations.Alex's social media profiles have dozens of pictures of him and leading House and Senate Democrats since 2018. The two who appear the most are Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. Alex had at least nine meetings with Schumer, whom he referred to as his \"good friend.\"\nAlex had at least eight visits with Pelosi, calling her the \"greatest Speaker of the House in American History!\"",

            "excerpt": "Democrats hold a massive cash advantage just over six months from Election Day in the race for which party will control the House of Representatives.",
            "summary": "Democrats continue to hold a major cash advantage in the race for control of the House of Representatives as the narrow Republican majority leading the chamber faces further chaos with intraparty division.\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the organization tasked with winning a majority for Democrats, announced Thursday it had raised $45.4 million in the first three months of 2024, with $21.4 million of that coming in March alone. Both amounts marked new cycle records for the group.\nThose numbers bested the DCCC's GOP counterpart, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), which announced last week it had raised $33.4 million for the first quarter and $16.2 million in March, also a cycle record.\nIn the 2024 election cycle to date, the DCCC has raised $166.7 million to the NRCC's $124.7 million, a vast $42 million difference. That advantage is also reflected in the cash on hand held by both groups just over six months from Election Day. The DCCC holds $71.1 million to the NRCC's $55.9 million.\n\"The public knows that House Republicans have nothing to show from their time in the majority except chaos and dysfunction,\" DCCC chair Suzan DelBene said in a statement. \"That is why supporters from across the country are ensuring the DCCC has the resources and momentum we need to take back the House, make Hakeem Jeffries speaker and get back to work delivering for working families.\"\nA bright spot for Republicans, however, is that the NRCC's current cash-on-hand deficit is smaller than it was at the same point in the 2022 and 2020 election cycles. In March 2022, the DCCC had $18.5 million more cash on hand than the NRCC, but Republicans gained nine seats that November. That difference was a massive $31.9 million in 2020, but Republicans still went on to gain 13 seats.\nAdditionally, the DCCC appears to be burning cash at a higher rate than the NRCC, considering it only holds a $15 million cash-on-hand advantage but has raised $42 million more than the NRCC so far this election cycle.\n\"House Republicans remain in a strong position to grow the majority. Meanwhile, extreme House Democrats continue to support dangerous open borders, pro-crime and pro-inflationary policies that doomed their majority in the first place,\" NRCC spokesman Will Reinert told Fox News Digital when asked about the fundraising gap.\nThe snapshot of Democrats' financial advantage comes as House Republicans continue to battle themselves over controversial foreign aid packages for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, which passed Saturday — a fight that has led to some GOP members jostling to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson.\nA third Republican lawmaker jumped on board that effort to oust Johnson Friday after the speaker's foreign aid plan — four bills amounting to $95 billion in spending – survived a key procedural vote on the House floor with more Democratic support than Republican.\n\"[R]ather than spending the resources to secure our southern border and combating the invasion of 11 million illegals and despite repeated promises there would be no additional money going to Ukraine without first securing our border, the United States House of Representatives, under the direction of the Speaker, is on the verge of sending another $61 billion to further draw America into an endless and purposeless war in Ukraine,\" Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., said in a statement.\nIt's unclear how the tension among House Republicans might be affecting the party's fundraising in the middle of the election year, but what is certain is that the absence of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a fundraising juggernaut who was removed from his post last fall, is already taking a toll on the party's re-election finances.",

            "summary": "A handful of vulnerable House Democrats, all of whom dismissed concern about the southern border crisis and voted against measures to enhance border security in the past, have attempted to show their attention to the issue as they campaign for re-election.\nThree Democrats in competitive House races this election cycle — Reps. Yadira Caraveo, D-Colo., Gabe Vasquez, D-N.M., and Eric Sorenson, D-Ill. — have introduced bills, resolutions and amendments over the last year that would do little to limit the flow of migrants entering the country illegally, but they acknowledge the crisis.\nCaraveo, who represents Colorado's 8th Congressional District, introduced a package of legislation earlier this year pertaining to some of the immigration struggles facing the United States.\nThe first-term lawmaker introduced two bills — the HELP for Interior Cities ACT and the ANTI-Drugs Act — in February and insisted both pieces of legislation address \"the needs of Colorado communities in the wake of a recent increase in migrant arrivals.\"\n\"This comprehensive plan would deliver funding to interior cities like Denver that are in need of support, reduce the financial burden placed on local governments, and stem the flow of illegal drugs into the U.S. It would also deliver much-needed funding to law enforcement both at the border and here in Colorado,\" she said of the measures at the time.\nThe HELP for Interior Cities ACT does little to address the flow of migrants entering the country and provides additional funding for migrant shelters located in cities not found along the border. The ANTI-Drugs Act, however, would make an already-existing Department of Homeland program titled \"Operation Stonegarden\" permanent and give law enforcement agencies grants for equipment and \"personnel, including overtime and backfill, in support of enhanced border law enforcement activities.\"\nPrior to introducing the measures, Caraveo was one of 211 Democrats who voted against the Secure the Border Act of 2023. That measure, which passed in the House, would have expanded the type of crimes that make someone ineligible for asylum, limited the eligibility to those who arrive at ports of entry, mandated a system similar to the E-Verify employment eligibility verification system and created additional penalties for visa overstay.\nCaraveo was also one of 210 House Democrats who voted against a GOP-led effort in the House to impeach Homeland Security Sec. Alejandro Mayorkas.\nDuring her previous tenure in the Colorado state House of Representatives, Caraveo joined other Democrats from across the nation to send a letter urging the Biden administration to relax immigration rules and \"divest from immigration enforcement agencies like ICE and CBP.\"\nAnother Democrat who has brought attention to the issue in recent months is Vasquez, who represents New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District.\nEarlier this month, Vasquez introduced a resolution that \"condemns Republican inaction on common-sense solutions to our Nation's broken immigration system and the challenges our Nation faces at the border.\"\nLike Caraveo, Vasquez voted against the Secure the Border Act of 2023. Last October, however, he introduced a package of immigration bills amid a skyrocketing number of illegal immigrants arriving at the U.S. border. Those measures aimed to increase penalties for smugglers and cartels who engage in violent crimes, provide pathways for certain migrants to lawfully work in the U.S. and fund additional personnel at ports of entry.\nPrior to joining Congress, Vasquez lashed out at then-President Trump amid immigration woes in 2018 and insisted the idea of \"sending the military to quell a non-existent threat\" is \"beyond stupid.\"\nIn a November 2020 post to Twitter, now known as X, Vasquez responded to one social media user who called for the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection by writing, \"the only ICE we need to be melting.\"\nVasquez was also one of many Democrats who applauded President Biden's decision to terminate construction of a border wall along the southern border. In a January 2021 post on social media, he said, \"As of today, all construction on this racist, environmentally destructive, massive waste of money comes to a grinding halt. This vanity project was little more than a glorification of xenophobia and an insult to border communities. Lets tear it down.\"\nLike Caraveo and Vasquez, Sorensen, who represents Illinois' 17th Congressional District, voted against the Secure the Border Act of 2023, which would have largely increased the total number of CBP agents.\nSorensen introduced two amendments to the Secure the Border Act — one that would require the hiring, training and assigning of \"not fewer than 500 additional CBP officers\" at points of entry and another that would have appropriated $25 million to \"improve coordination\" and \"expand\" a fentanyl task force.\nBoth amendments were not considered prior to a vote on the bill in the House, and Sorensen cited a lack of bipartisan cooperation in voting against the legislation.\nAfter introducing the amendments, Sorensen went on to vote \"nay\" on impeachment efforts against Mayorkas earlier this year.\nSorensen, like most of his colleagues on his side of the aisle, has expressed opposition to the Trump-proposed idea of a southern border wall. In a November 2019 post promoting an Illinois restaurant, he wrote, \"We don't need border walls, we need more pancakes and burritos!\"\nLast July, Sorensen joined 201 other Democrats, including Vasquez and Caraveo, in voting against a measure that would have prevented the use of facilities of certain schools that receive federal financial assistance to provide shelter or housing to illegal immigrants. Additionally, the trio of Democrat lawmakers rejected a measure that aimed to prohibit the federal government from using certain federally administered lands to provide housing for illegal immigrants.\nCaraveo and Vasquez are both seeking re-election to their seats that have been labeled \"Democrat Toss Up\" by the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan election analyst. Sorensen's seat has been labeled as \"Lean Democrat.\"\nCBP records show the first six months of fiscal year 2024 had 1,340,801 total encounters, exceeding the first six months of fiscal year 2023, which set a record of 1,226,254 total encounters.\nCaraveo, Vasquez and Sorenson did not respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.",

            "summary": "Republicans in the Senate are accusing the Democratic Party, including President Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., of emboldening Iran prior to the country's recent attack on U.S. ally Israel.\n\"Instead of standing with our ally, Israel, Democrats are focused on appealing to their radical left base, which hates Israel and is actively supporting Hamas and Iran,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Fox News Digital.\n\"To appease his base, Joe Biden allowed over $100 billion to flow to Iran. Iran then used that money to make drones and cruise missiles to attack Israel,\" Cruz said. \"In a very real sense, Joe Biden funded Iran's attack on Israel. The Democrat position on Israel and Iran is as illogical as it is indefensible.\"\nIran attacked Israel directly over the weekend, launching hundreds of drone strikes as well as a barrage of ballistic and cruise missiles. With the help of the U.S. military, Israel managed to intercept almost all the incoming drone and missile attacks.\nIran's previous involvement in attacks against Israel has been through proxies in countries such as Syria and Yemen. Launching an assault from within its own country marks a major escalation from a proxy fight to a direct attack.\n\"Since October 7, Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer have tried to undermine Israel at every turn,\" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Whether it's on the battlefield, at the UN, or in Congress, they are more interested in pleasing the pro-Hamas wing of their party than they are in helping our greatest ally in the Middle East.\"\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., pointed to the Democratic Party's shift on Israel, saying in a statement Saturday, \"Tehran and its proxies are emboldened when they see divisions between the US and Israel.\"\nPrior to the attack, Biden hardened his posture toward Israel as it fights Hamas in Gaza. Biden warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a call this month \"that U.S. policy with respect to Gaza will be determined by our assessment of Israel's immediate action on these steps\" to address civilian casualties and ensure safety for humanitarian aid workers, according to the White House. The call followed an Israeli strike that led to the deaths of seven aid workers from World Central Kitchen.\nLast month, Schumer sparked outrage from Republicans after calling on Israel in a floor speech to hold elections to replace Netanyahu, who he said \"has put himself in coalition with far-right extremists\" and \"has been too willing to tolerate the civilian toll in Gaza.\"\n\"If Prime Minister Netanyahu's current coalition remains in power after the war begins to wind down and continues to pursue dangerous and inflammatory policies that test existing U.S. standards for assistance, then the United States will have no choice but to play a more active role in shaping Israeli policy by using our leverage to change the present course,\" Schumer said.\nPrior to his floor speech, Schumer requested a classified intelligence briefing, which he routinely receives, on the status of hostage negotiations between Israel and Hamas. The briefing revealed that there would be no disruptions to ongoing hostage negotiations if Schumer gave his speech, according to a source familiar.\nHowever, the source was unable to say whether any implications regarding Iran were relayed during the briefing.\nSchumer's office also hit back at the claims, with spokesperson Allison Biasotti saying in a statement, \"Leader Schumer has been clear that the United States' commitment to Israel's security is ironclad, and that the best way to deter enemies of Israel, like Iran, is for the House to promptly pass the bipartisan supplemental bill, with over $17 billion urgently needed for Israel's defense and U.S. operations against Iranian-backed aggression in the Red Sea, which Schumer already passed in the Senate.\"\nThe majority leader's office said the attack on Israel was a response to the recent Israeli strike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, Syria, adding that Iran and Israel have been engaged in a lengthy conflict for years.\nBut according to one Democrat aide, there are senators in the party who are concerned about a growing number of Democrats' posture on Israel potentially giving Iran the sense that American support is wavering for its ally.\nSen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., accused Biden of trying to \"walk a tightrope of appeasing an increasingly radical base of his party while upholding the mainstream American position of support for Israel.\"\n\"The problem is the president isn't walking a tightrope. He's trying to straddle the Grand Canyon,\" he said in a statement.\nWhite House spokesperson Andrew Bates pushed back on criticism of Biden's posture toward Israel, and he rejected claims he emboldened Iran to attack, in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\"Former Trump Administration officials and Fox News' own reporting have debunked those lies,\" he said.\n\"President Biden is the only American President to have directly defended Israel, as he ordered the American military to do last weekend,\" Bates said. \"He is also the only American President to have set foot in Israel during wartime, in support of our ironclad commitment to their security. Unlike others, he did not rail against Israel in the days after October 7th, nor has he ever praised Hezbollah.\"\nMeanwhile, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., pointed to a recent effort to force votes on a stand-alone Israel aid bill in the Senate as she criticized her Democrat counterparts.\n\"This week, Senate Democrats again blocked immediate aid to Israel after Senator [Roger] Marshall and I demanded a vote to support our ally. The Left would rather play politics to appease their socialist base,\" she told Fox News Digital in a statement.\n\"It's clear that the Biden administration and Leader Chuck Schumer refuse to back our most important ally in the Middle East,\" Blackburn continued.\nTwo Democrat congressional aides told Fox News Digital that the attack by Iran was expected. They said intelligence suggested it was in response to the consulate strike on April 1 that killed Iranian commanders.\nNevertheless, the scale of the Iranian attack and its direct targeting of Israel shocked many observers.\nDemocrats in the upper chamber objected to two requests for unanimous consent to vote on different versions of stand-alone Israel aid. However, most Democrats maintained support for a foreign aid package that ties Israel aid to Ukraine aid.\nMcConnell said last month that Schumer's call for new Israeli elections was both hypocritical and grotesque as well as \"unprecedented.\"\n\"Make no mistake, the Democratic Party doesn't have an anti-[Netanyahu] problem. It has an anti-Israel problem,\" the Republican leader said in floor remarks at the time.",

            "summary": "President Biden didn't make TIME Magazine's \"100 Most Influential People\" list for 2024 after receiving the annual honor for the past three years of his presidency.\nFormer President Trump did not make the list either this election year. Both presidential candidates previously appeared on the 2020 edition of the annual list, however.\nVice President Kamala Harris was similarly absent from this year's list, which was published on Wednesday and included leaders, artists, entrepreneurs, athletes, activists and politicians. Both Biden and Harris did pen tributes to honor other figures on the list.\nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment from Fox News Digital on Biden not being included in the magazine's most influential list this year.\nWhile the two leading presidential candidates were absent, two prominent governors, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, and California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, were named.\nBoth governors have risen to national prominence in the past few years. Trump has praised Abbott for his leadership in enforcing the southern border, telling Fox News' Sean Hannity in February that he was \"absolutely\" considering him for his vice president pick.\nIn the TIME profile, Senior Correspondent Philip Elliott praised Abbott as a \"talented room reader\" who, \"[d]espite some glaring missteps … remains one of his party's most persuasive pitchmen.\"\nRumors of ambitions for higher office have also swirled around Newsom, who similarly made TIME's top leaders list for 2024.\nMedia commentators on the right and left have suggested Newsom could be the Democratic Party's choice to replace Biden if he were to step down at this summer's Democratic National Convention amid concerns about his age, mental acuity and unpopularity. However, Newsom has swatted down rumors he's considering a 2024 run.\n\"Amid pressure for Democrats to trade in Joe Biden, Newsom has instead adopted the role of full-throated attack dog for the 81-year-old President. That's helped put Newsom, 56, on a short list of Democratic contenders for the White House in 2028,\" TIME's senior White House correspondent Brian Bennett wrote in his 2024 tribute.\nOther notable figures on the list included former columnist E. Jean Carroll and Special Counsel Jack Smith.",

            "summary": "Gov. J.B. Pritzker, D-Ill., suggested Sunday that there were only two real choices for president in the upcoming election, and argued Democratic voters were throwing away their votes by supporting anyone other than President Biden.\nCNN's Dana Bash pressed Pritzker, who was recently campaigning for the president in Michigan, on RFK Jr.'s standing in the presidential race, as he will be on the ballot in both Michigan and Hawaii.\n\"Does Kennedy being on the ballot there pose a real threat to Joe Biden's re-election?\" Bash asked.\nPritzker touted \"very high\" enthusiasm among Democrats in the state. RFK Jr. gained ballot access in the battleground state of Michigan on Thursday.\n\"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. being on the ballot in Michigan, I think, is going to have little effect on the ultimate result. People understand that there are really only two candidates that have a path to victory in this country and in Michigan. And of course, that's Joe Biden and Donald Trump,\" Pritzker said, noting that the two had \"very different sets of values.\"\nBash pushed back and said the governor was talking about the election as if it was a \"binary choice.\"\n\"It's not a binary choice, and RFK Jr. does provide a third-way for people who just don't like what Joe Biden, or even Donald Trump for that matter, but in this particular case, it's Joe Biden I'm asking about, don't like what he's selling,\" Bash said.\nPritzker said he wasn't denying there were other names on the ballot, but argued Biden was the only real choice.\n\"I'm suggesting simply that when people go to the ballot box in November, they're going to see that there are really only two choices, because it's throwing away your vote if you're a Democrat and you vote for someone else on that ballot other than Joe Biden,\" he said.\n\"And I believe that people will see that contrast of values that I'm talking about and understand that they've got to vote for Joe Biden if they want to make sure that the United States does not fall into the hands of someone who is frankly a sociopath, has been indicted 91 times, and is someone who would take this country backward,\" he continued.\nMichigan, a crucial battleground state, also saw a group of progressive voters protest the Democratic primary in the state, as many voted \"uncommitted\" instead of supporting the president. Biden is facing mounting backlash from the left over his handling of Israel.\nCNN reporter Harry Enten warned in March that Kennedy was \"polling north of 15% nationally.\"\nProviding historical context, Enten compared the strength of Kennedy's support to famed independent candidate Ross Perot, who earned nearly 20% of the vote in the 1992 presidential election and nearly 10% in the 1996 election.\nPolls have shown Kennedy and other third-party candidates hurting both Trump and Biden, but a poll published in March showed Trump ahead of Biden among registered voters in Michigan at 41%. Biden stood at 36%, Democrat-turned-independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at 10%, Green Party candidate Jill Stein at 4%, and progressive independent Cornel West came in at 3%.",

            "excerpt": "California Democrats \"mutilated\" part of a bipartisan anti-sex trafficking bill this week that makes it a felony for people to purchase sex with minors.",
            "summary": "California Democrats \"mutilated\" part of a bipartisan anti-sex trafficking bill this week that makes it a felony for people to purchase sex with minors and requires those convicted to register as sex offenders, according to the lead author of the bill.\nDemocrats added several amendments that only made proposed charges applicable if the child is younger than 15.\nThe changes \"mutilated this bill,\" Republican state Sen. Shannon Grove, lead author of SB 1414, said in an interview with Fox News Digital.\nGrove's original bill would have toughened the punishment for child trafficking and increased it from a misdemeanor charge to a felony, carrying a maximum penalty of four years in prison and a $25,000 fine. Unlike current law, the penalties would apply regardless of whether the adult was aware of the child's age.\nIt would also require the perpetrator to register as a sex offender, but Democrats opposed that provision.\nPublic safety committee Democrats worried the bill was \"overly broad\" and would criminalize young adults who are in consensual relationships with minors. Under current sex offender laws that have been on the books in California for decades, judges decide whether an adult, no more than 10 years older than a minor between the ages of 14 and 17, should be placed on the sex offender registry if they are engaging in sexual intercourse.\n\"This is not consensual, this is commercial sex,\" Grove told Fox News Digital Wednesday. \"And, again, the Democratic committee consultant was conflating those issues, and I kept trying to explain to them this is not consensual sex. This is commercial sex purchase.\n\"My bill goes after the buyer for engaging in that process.\"\nThe current law for soliciting a child for sex carries a $10,000 fine and two days to a year in a county jail.\nDemocrats on the public safety committee, senators Scott Wiener, Nancy Skinner and Aisha Wahab, pushed the amendments through in a 4-0 vote, skipping a procedural vote to take up the amendments first. During the hearing, Grove said \"on record\" she opposed the amendments and called it \"completely unacceptable.\"\n\"My goal is to continue to work on the bill and amend it. Their goal was to make it so bad I would pull it and not address this issue this year,\" Grove said. \"But I couldn't do that because there are minors out there who would be subjected to this horrific crime for one more year. So, we're going to continue to move forward and see if we can get amendments back in this bill and give it some teeth to address this issue.\"\nDuring the hearing, Wiener told Grove they could've \"easily just said no to this bill, because this bill is incredibly overbroad in my opinion.\"\n\"This bill will sweep in a lot of people who are not trafficking,\" Wiener said. \"This bill will send people to state prison, put people in the sex offender registry, which is basically, effectively in many ways, the end of their life.\"\nWhile Grove did not accept the amendment to make the law applicable only when dealing with children below 15, she did offer to amend the bill to remove the requirement for first-time offenders to be placed on the sex offender registry.\nEarlier this month, Democrats on the committee blocked a similar bill that would have recriminalized street loitering for the purpose of prostitution. SB 1219 would have reinstituted a provision previously taken out of California's penal code that prohibited loitering in a public place.",

It is the latest effort to insulate a group of progressive lawmakers who have faced bipartisan backlash over their harsh rhetoric toward Israel after Hamas' Oct. 7 surprise attack.\n\"Every member of the Squad is up for re-election this year, and five of these young, working-class, Black and brown progressives are facing serious threats to their U.S. House seats: Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush, Summer Lee, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib,\" the website stated.\n\"With right-wing megadonor-funded groups like AIPAC and Moderate PAC threatening to drop upwards of $100 million on attack ads and hand-picked challengers to unseat these Squad members, we need to come together to combat their attacks with the power of our grassroots movement.\"\nOf the \"Squad\" members listed – which notably excludes Rep.

            "excerpt": "Speaker Mike Johnson is holding a rare Saturday vote for the House to try to advance a foreign aid and national security plan.",
            "summary": "The House of Representatives is holding a rare Saturday vote to consider Speaker Mike Johnson's foreign aid plan, which has spurred calls for his ouster by a small group of GOP rebels.\nThree of the four bills fund Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific, totaling roughly $95 billion. A fourth bill includes national security priorities like the House's recently passed crackdown on TikTok's ownership, as well as the REPO Act, which would liquidate seized Russian assets and give that funding to Ukraine.\nEach is expected to receive a final vote sometime later this afternoon after lawmakers weigh amendments to all but the Israel bill, which House leaders decided must stay as is.\nAmong the amendments up for consideration is one by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., one of the House GOP's fiercest foreign aid skeptics, to strip all funds from the $60 billion Ukraine aid bill. It's not likely to pass, but it could get a significant amount of Republican support with a growing number of right-wing lawmakers opposed to the U.S.' involvement in Kyiv's war with Moscow.\nJohnson's handling of foreign aid and government spending spurred Greene to file a resolution calling for a vote to oust him from power, known as a motion to vacate the chair. Since revealing the details of his plan earlier this week, two more Republicans — Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. — have formally backed her effort.\nForeign aid has proven to be one of the most politically fraught fights Johnson has faced in his short tenure as speaker. As has been the case for most complicated issues, he's caught in a two-front battle between the Democrat-controlled Senate and White House, as well as outspoken conservatives in his own conference — namely the House Freedom Caucus and their allies.\nThe former group had been pressuring Johnson to take up the Senate's $95 billion supplemental aid package as one item, while the latter objected to foreign aid without spending offsets or border security measures.\nTo assuage GOP border concerns, Johnson is also holding a vote on a border security and immigration bill on Saturday — though it's unlikely to pass. Republican rebels blasted that move as a meaningless display, arguing that Johnson knows it has no chance in the Senate if not paired with foreign aid.\nThe foreign aid proposal passed a key procedural hurdle on Friday morning known as a rule vote, which now allows for debate and passage of the final bills.\nRule votes have traditionally fallen across party lines, with lawmakers on both sides following their leadership to allow for a vote on legislation even if they don't agree with its contents.\nHowever, members of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus have deliberately sunk GOP rule votes several times this Congress in protest of House Republican leadership's decisions.\nIn a stunning turn of events not often seen in modern U.S. politics, Democrats leaped to the foreign aid proposal's rescue and provided more than enough support to counter the 55 Republican defections — something that further irked Johnson's right-wing critics.\nNot only did Democrats vote for the rule, they outnumbered Republicans in support. It got 165 Democratic \"yes\" votes compared to 151 Republicans, for a total 316 to 94 margin.\n\"We agreed with the objective,\" Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., the former House majority leader, told reporters when asked about the overwhelming Democratic support. \"I think Democrats are going to continue to save the country. And when the speaker proposes something that we think is good for the country, we're not going to arbitrarily oppose it because it happens to be a Republican proposal.\"\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good, R-Va., accused Johnson of dividing the Republican Party but distanced himself from calls for his ouster.\n\"Funding Ukraine divides the country. It divides Republicans tremendously, divides the Republican conference, as evidenced by the vote today, just a moment ago. And so that should not be our starting point, to do what the Democrats want to do,\" Good said.\nRep. Jake Ellzey, R-Texas, one of the House's GOP national security hawks, said he was \"absolutely\" relieved that the bills advanced on Friday but that he was \"confident\" they would.\nUnlike his colleagues who were criticizing the show of bipartisanship, Ellzey said he was glad to see Democrats buck norms to support the rule.\n\"I think that, this is a good thing for us now, for our national security, and the assurance of our friends and allies across the world, that we are a steady partner, and it's bipartisan. Americans come together in times like this,\" he said.",

As elected officials, my colleagues and I have a unique opportunity to give young Americans a voice in their future,\" Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Matt Cartwright said of the endorsement, according to an X post from the Voters of Tomorrow.\nA left-wing advocacy group that promotes voting among Gen Z voters, Voters of Tomorrow has a particular focus on \"justice\" issues such as decriminalizing prostitution, dismantling \"racist\" institutions — including those that carry out \"racial profiling in education and policing\" and ending \"racist voting laws\" — as well as calling for stricter gun control, and ending \"the abusive practices of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection.\"\nVoters of Tomorrow announced last year that 36 members of Congress joined a \"Youth Vote Champion\" pledge in an effort to engage young Gen Z voters, a generation typically considered to include anyone born between 1997 and 2013.\n\"We have to engage young voters not only in the two weeks before the election, but in the two years before the election,\" Jack Lobel, 18, the national press secretary of Voters of Tomorrow, told Axios at the time.\nAs the election season heats up this year, Fox News Digital found that a handful of the House members who took the Voters of Tomorrow pledge are located in swing-districts, including Cartwright, Rep. Greg Landsman of Ohio, Rep. Mary Peltola of Alaska, and Rep. Susan Wild of Pennsylvania.\nThe four members of Congress were identified last year by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as vulnerable in the 2024 elections, assigning them as members of the Frontline Program for vulnerable incumbents. Each member celebrated joining forces with the Voters of Tomorrow in comments shared by the advocacy group on social media.\n\"I wholeheartedly agree with Voters of Tomorrow's view that empowering Gen Z in our political process is a requirement for building a better future,\" Landsman said in a message of his support of Voters of Tomorrow.\n\"I ran for Congress to be an advocate for all Alaskans — from every region, background, and generation. Encouraging young people to get involved in our political process benefits everyone — and is a responsibility I take very seriously,\" Peltola said in another message posted by Voters of Tomorrow last year.\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) told Fox News Digital that the four Democrats aligning with Voters of Tomorrow ahead of 2024 shows they are not \"moderate\" Democrats, but instead \"complete frauds that should never be re-elected.\"\n\"Self-proclaimed moderate House Democrats are once again showing the American people where their true priorities lie: abolishing cash bail, defunding the police, ending ICE & CBP, and decriminalizing sex work and drugs. It's dangerous, and exposes how Cartwright, Landsman, Peltola, or Wild are complete frauds that should never be reelected,\" the NRCC's rapid response director Macy Gardner told Fox News Digital.\nFox News Digital reached out to the campaigns for comment, but did not receive replies.\nImmigration and the economy are two of the biggest issues weighing on voters this election cycle, while crime still ranks high for voters following 2020's historically bloody year, which was followed by other ongoing crime trends, such smash-and-grab robberies and carjackings.\nProstitution has spiraled in certain areas of the country in recent months, which has been compounded by the immigration crisis and local state laws. Residents in California have particularly voiced their outrage over rampant and brazen prostitution on city streets, which many pin blame on a law that repealed a previous law that banned loitering with the intent of engaging in prostitution. New York City has also seen \"third world\" conditions, including prostitutes and pimps walking the streets of Queens in broad daylight.\nVoters of Tomorrow argues prostitution should be decriminalized, saying that \"Sex work is work.\"\n\"Criminalizing consensual sex, including the exchange of these services, is taking away from the human right to autonomy and privacy. The government should not be telling consenting adults who they can have sexual relationships with and on what terms,\" the group says on its website.\nThe group also advocates for the end of cash bail, which would abolish the requirement that suspects charged with crimes post bail in order to leave jail while they await court proceedings.\n\"If the ‘justice' system has policies or laws in place that have a monetary value tied to them, then those policies only apply to low-income people. No one should have to remain in prison for the duration of their case just because they do not have the financial means to pay their bail. Cash bail only applies to low-income people and we need equal justice,\" the group states.\nVoters of Tomorrow was founded in 2019 by a ​​17-year-old immigrant from Mexico, Santiago Mayer, after he \"noticed a lack of political engagement at his high school,\" according to the group's website. The group has since gone on to advocate that Gen Z vote, including in both the 2020 election and the 2022 midterms.\nThe Republican Party had a lackluster 2022 in the midterms, which some have attributed to lack of outreach to America's youngest voting generation.\n\"Another reason that the polling was so inaccurate and that so many critical races swung to Democrats is the growing importance of Gen Z voters, which appears to have been completely ignored by the GOP,\" Fox News contributor Liz Peek wrote in an op-ed in 2022, arguing Gen Z \"stopped the Republicans' expected red wave.\"\n\"Not only did Gen Z show up in force, they overwhelmingly picked Democrats, by a 28-point margin. That preference was close to their vote in 2020, which went 62% Democrat and only 32% GOP.\"",

            "excerpt": "Republicans are negotiating a structure with Democrats for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas' impeachment trial that allows them to get as many votes on the record as possible ahead of…",
            "summary": "Senate Republicans are looking to hold as many votes as possible during the initial proceedings of the impeachment trial into Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas before Democrats in the chamber are expected to succeed in dismissing the trial.\nMajority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., explicitly stated his intent to seek a dismissal of the House-passed articles of impeachment during a speech on the Senate floor on Wednesday morning. While he had previously indicated that he wanted to quickly get past the proceedings, he had yet to confirm the Democratic plan to dismiss the trial.\nAccording to five Senate Republican sources familiar with the discussions, the structure of the proceedings is being negotiated with the Democrats.\nThe two parties are looking into a potential agreement for unanimous consent, in which Republicans are allowed to propose eight total points of order against the motions to dismiss. Each point of order, or fact that senators determine whether there is agreement on, will require its own vote. Lengthening the process and requiring Democrats to go on record on several components of the impeachment articles against Mayorkas.\nSchumer noted in his chamber floor speech on Wednesday that he would look to appease Republicans by allowing both points of order and debate time. \"When we convene in trial today to accommodate the wishes of our Republican Senate colleagues, I will seek an agreement for a period of debate time that would allow Republicans to offer a vote on trial resolutions, allow for Republicans to offer points of order and then move to dismiss,\" he said.\nThis agreement will require that no senator objects, and Schumer urged them not to.\nThe unanimous consent agreement which is being sought between the parties would allow 90 minutes of open debate after the senators are sworn in as jurors at 1:00 p.m. Then, two resolutions would receive votes, one from Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, calling for a full Senate trial, and another from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that would refer the matter to a Senate Impeachment Trial committee first.\nRepresentatives for Lee and Cruz did not confirm the unanimous consent agreement discussions before the time of publication.\nOne source noted the GOP was making an effort to use every option possible to require more votes within the impeachment trial process, putting their Democratic colleagues on record as much as possible.\nFollowing the proposal of each point of order and prior to voting, the deal being discussed for unanimous consent would require four minutes of debate ahead of each vote. This time would be equally divided between the parties. One source explained that some Republican senators see this debate time as an opportunity to have the case for Mayorkas's impeachment heard on the floor, even if it is not in the context of a full trial.\nSeveral Senate Republican sources also indicated that the dismissal route, which Schumer revealed he planned to take, was preferable to a motion to table. Tabling the trial has never happened with an impeachment, as GOP senators have noted, and it also does not provide the ability for any arguments from impeachment managers or defense counsel or debate between senators.\nIf agreed to, the Mayorkas impeachment trial is likely to ultimately see dismissal, but Republicans will have several opportunities to put Democrats, particularly vulnerable ones who are up for re-election in pivotal states, on the record on multiple immigration and border related topics.",

Ruben Gallego, who has received thousands of dollars from Soros this cycle.\n\"Kicking off campaign season with my co-host [Lin Manuel] for congressman Ruben Gallego's Senate run in Arizona,\" he wrote on Instagram. \"Ruben has an impressive life story and the stakes of this year's election couldn't be higher, they're existential.\"\nDays after the Open Society Foundations announced he would take over his father's network in June 2023, he hosted a New York event featuring House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other top Empire State Democrats, including Reps. Jerry Nadler and Gregory Meeks, according to an Instagram post.\nSoros' social media profiles have dozens of pictures of him and leading House and Senate Democrats since 2018. The two who appear the most are Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California.\nSince the 2018 elections, Alex Soros has poured more than $5 million into federal political coffers. Records show that his largest contribution was $2 million to the Senate Majority PAC, aligned with Chuck Schumer.",

            "excerpt": "Republican candidate Curtis Bashaw of New Jersey is optimistic the GOP in 2024 can break a nearly half century long losing streak in Senate elections in the Garden State",
            "summary": "EXCLUSIVE - It's been over a half century since a Republican won a Senate election in blue state New Jersey.\nBut real estate developer and hotelier Curtis Bashaw is optimistic about his party's prospects in November's elections to end the decades-long losing streak.\nBashaw, one of the two leading contenders in a multi-candidate field in June's GOP Senate primary in New Jersey, emphasized \"I believe this is a once in a generation opportunity.\"\n\"I can't wait to see how we prove to the rest of the country that New Jersey is a lot more purple than people realize,\" he added in a national digital exclusive interview with Fox News.\nA major reason for Bashaw's optimism is the prospect of a three-way race in New Jersey. Longtime Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who was indicted last year on federal corruption charges, is not running for re-election as a Democrat and instead is mulling an independent bid, which polls indicate would potentially take votes away from likely Democratic Senate nominee Rep. Andy Kim.\nBashaw, an entrepreneur and historic preservationist who is recognized in the Garden State for leading the restorations of the historic Congress Hall and the Virginia Hotel in Cape May, at the southern tip of the Jersey shore, is a first time politician.\n\"I'm a political outsider,\" Bashaw emphasized. \"I'm a business guy. I built a business over 35 years restoring landmark abandoned hotels.\"\nAnd he highlighted that he grew his business from 25 to 1,000 employees.\n\"I'm in it because I want to unshackle small business from over regulation,\" he said.\nBashaw's chief rival for the GOP nomination is Christine Serrano Glassner, who's served for four years as mayor of Mendham Borough, in the northern part of the state.\nBashaw holds a formidable fundraising advantage in the Republican race - thanks in part to a large self-investment in his campaign.\nHe also enjoys an advantage on the primary ballot, as he has the county line in two-thirds of the state's 21 counties.\nNew Jersey has long allowed counties to print ballots that include a prominent party line, which are widely viewed as helping candidates with establishment backing. Kim sued in federal court to overturn the county lines in the Democratic Primary. But the GOP county lines were upheld.\n\"New Jersey is made up of thousands and thousands and thousands of small businesspeople. We are going to get to them really quickly and our name ID will go up really fast,\" Bashaw said.\nAnd pointing to a busy schedule on the campaign trail ahead of the primary, Bashaw showcased that \"I go to six coffees a day. I go talk to every single county in our state. I put a lot of miles on the car.\"\nAsked about former President Donald Trump, who is the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee, Bashaw told Fox News \"I'm supporting this ticket top to bottom.\"\nIt's been 36 years since a Republican carried New Jersey in a White House race, but Trump is planning a campaign stop in the state next month.\n\"Donald Trump thinks New Jersey's in play. I agree with him. Trump believes he can flip the country from blue to red. I believe we can flip this Senate seat from blue to red,\" Bashaw said.\nHe argued that \"there's a massive opportunity to pull\" New Jersey's large pool of unaffiliated voters \"to the Republican tent…. We are going to pull those unaffiliated voters our way this fall.\"\nNational Republicans to date have not made any investments in the Senate race in the Garden State.\nBut National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director Mike Berg said \"we're keeping a close eye on New Jersey.\"\nA national Democratic Senate campaign aide, asked about the contest, told Fox News that \"Democrats have won every New Jersey Senate race since 1978 and 2024 will be no different.\"\nBashaw, in his interview, spotlighted a couple of key issues, including crime.\n\"New Jerseyans are not feeling safe and secure in their homes,\" he argued.\nOn immigration and border security, another key issue Republicans are spotlighting, he charged that New Jersey \"is now a border state. There are illegals coming into all of our counties.\"\n\"The woke ideology has permeated through our culture and we now have in our state, schools keeping secrets from parents about very, very, personal decisions,\" he claimed, as he defended parental rights in public education.\nOn the issue of abortion, which Democrats are spotlighting, Bashaw pointed to the two-year-old blockbuster decision by the Supreme Court's conservative majority that overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which for a half century had legalized abortion nationwide.\n\"I believe that the Dobbs decision was the correct decision,\" Bashaw said.\nBut he added that \"I don't support a federal ban,\" which some in his party are backing.\nThe Dobbs decision moved the fight over abortion back to the states, and in New Jersey abortion is legal in all stages of pregnancy.\n\"New Jersey's decided it,\" Bashaw said, before charging that \"the Democrats are the extremists on this issue, passing legislation allowing abortions up until the day of birth.\"",

            "excerpt": "Speaker Mike Johnson is facing opposition to his foreign aid plan from Republicans calling for border security measures.",
            "summary": "The foreign aid plan Speaker Johnson, R-La., unveiled on Monday night is already facing a growing red wave of opposition from his own colleagues as of Tuesday morning, making it likely he will have to seek House Democratic support to get the proposal passed.\nUnder Johnson's tentative plan, aid for Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel would all be considered as separate bills. A fourth bill would combine miscellaneous national security priorities, including the House's recently passed bill that could pave the way to a TikTok ban and the REPO Act, a bipartisan measure to liquefy seized Russian assets and send that money to Ukraine.\nA lack of any border security measures, however, has prompted even reliable leadership allies to be wary of letting the bills move forward.\n\"I'm thinking of voting against the rule,\" Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital. \"Unless we vote to send something to the Senate the same day that addresses the border, requires the president to take action on his executive orders. Or we can put something with the underlying legislation that would actually do a couple of things – we can stop money from going to NGOs that are transporting individuals, we can stop Homeland Security from releasing criminals into the interior.\"\nWhile the four bills are designed to get separate House floor votes, they will first have to pass a procedural hurdle known as a rule vote, a House-wide measure that if passed will allow for debate and eventual votes on the four individual pieces.\nRule votes traditionally fall along party lines, and with Johnson's razor-thin majority, he can only afford to lose two Republicans on any party-line vote – and it's becoming increasingly likely that he might, meaning Democrats will need to break precedent to help get the bills over the line.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., whose disagreements with Johnson have led her to threaten his leadership role, said on Tuesday morning that she would vote against the rule unless the Democrat-controlled Senate took up the House GOP's comprehensive border security bill known as H.R.2 – which Democrats have panned as a nonstarter.\n\"NO, I am NOT voting for the rule on Johnson's bundle of funding bills for billions more to Ukraine and other foreign wars. When Joe Biden signs HR2 into law and Schumer holds the Mayorkas impeachment trial in the Senate, I will agree to vote for the rule only,\" Greene said on X. \"Speaker Johnson is not holding Democrats accountable nor leading our Republican majority, he's actually giving in to Democrats every demand. And he's using dirty swamp tactics to push through the America Last agenda.\"\nRep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, a member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, would not say how he would vote on the rule but told reporters, \"The rule that was proposed last night at conference will fail.\"\nOther critics of foreign aid similarly declined to say how they would vote but signaled they were opposed to Johnson's proposal itself.\n\"I think it leaves much to be desired. It doesn't have border control in it, it doesn't have any pay-fors in it,\" Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., told Fox News Digital. \"I think those are two problems.\"\nOther Republicans, however, argued it's a better plan than the Senate-passed $95 trillion supplemental aid package that its leaders are now pressuring Johnson to take up.\n\"No one wants to swallow the senate supplemental as a whole, and if we wait any longer without taking any action, that's exactly what's going to happen,\" Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital.\nRep. Anthony D'Esposito, R-N.Y., urged his colleagues to remember that they had already passed H.R.2 and have furiously been pushing for Democrats to take it up. He also told Fox News Digital that there were \"conversations\" about including border provisions before the text is released.\n\"I think we're in a critical time that, obviously, our allies need our support more than ever, and I hope that there's a way that we could include more border security into these packages,\" D'Esposito said. \"But I think we need to remind ourselves that we've as House Republicans done our job. We sent a comprehensive border bill over to the Senate. They have failed to act.\"",

            "excerpt": "Sens. Marshall and Blackburn will each try to force a vote on a version of stand-alone Israel aid on the Senate floor on Monday, which Democrats are opposed to and expected to object to.",
            "summary": "FIRST ON FOX: Republican Sens. Roger Marshall of Kansas and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee will look to force votes on two different versions of a stand-alone Israel aid measure in the Senate on Monday night.\nFollowing Iran's drone attack on Israel over the weekend, the two Republicans are planning to ask for unanimous consent to force votes on both Israel aid bills – one that is for $14.3 billion and includes cuts to Biden's $80 billion expansion of the Internal Revenue Service under the Inflation Reduction Act – and another for $17.6 billion that does not include a mechanism to pay for it. The former will be led by Marshall while Blackburn tries to force a vote on the latter.\nIn prepared remarks, Marshall is expected to tell his fellow senators: \"Time and time again, I see members, even the Democrat Majority Leader this weekend, say he stands with Israel.\"\nWith his unanimous consent to vote on the stand-alone Israel bill, Marshall said in a prepared statement: \"My message today to my colleagues is that actions speak louder than words. We are tired of hearing the pro-Israel lip service while you simultaneously block every effort to help Israel in its time of need. History will not forget this; let's do the right thing.\"\n\"Democrats say they support Israel, but their actions since October 7 to repeatedly block urgent standalone aid have told a different story,\" Blackburn told Fox News Digital in a statement.\n\"Senator Marshall and I will once again request the Senate swiftly and unanimously give Israel the resources they need to continue their fight against terrorism. In light of Iran's historic attack this weekend, I hope our Democratic colleagues will put politics aside and join us in support of our Jewish friends.\"\nA Democratic senator is likely to object to the request, as the caucus has maintained its desire to tie Israel aid to Ukraine aid.\nMarshall previously tried to force a vote on the same measure late last year, but his request for unanimous consent was objected to by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who argued on the chamber floor, \"Ukraine can no more afford a delay than our allies in Israel.\"\nThe bill for aid to Israel only, and not Ukraine or Taiwan, passed the House earlier last year, by a largely party-line vote of 226 to 196. Two Republicans defected from their conference, while 12 Democrats voted with Republicans. The measure's IRS funding cut was a particularly controversial point of the bill, as it took funds allocated within Biden's much-touted IRA law. While Republicans claimed the additional money for the IRS would mean auditing more Americans, Democrats claimed it would instead prevent wealthy individuals from getting away with not paying taxes.\nThe White House renewed its threat on Monday to veto aid to Israel that was not tied to other foreign aid. At a White House press briefing, Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre claimed, \"We will not accept a stand alone.\"\n\"Stand-alone would actually not help Israel and Ukraine,\" she said.\nNational security communications spokesperson John Kirby reiterated the White House's opposition at the same briefing, telling reporters, \"We are opposed to a standalone bill that would just work on Israel.\"\nMarshall and Blackburn each voted against the $95.3 billion supplemental foreign aid package that included Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan in February. Arguing against the aid, Marshall told his colleagues that voting against the measure was putting U.S. \"national security first by securing the border first.\"\n\"Up here in DC, my friends across the aisle, the White House, they continue to put Ukraine funding as their priority,\" he said.",

            "excerpt": "Wisconsin voters split their preference between President Biden and former President Trump in a hypothetical 2-way presidential race",
            "summary": "Wisconsin voters split their preference between President Biden and former President Trump in a hypothetical 2-way presidential race — and between backing the Democratic and the Republican congressional candidates in their House district, according to a new Fox News survey of Wisconsin registered voters.\nIn the head-to-head presidential matchup, Biden and Trump tie with 48% support each.\nBiden gets significant backing from urban voters (+29 points), Whites with a college degree (+26), suburban voters (+10), and union households (+8).\nFor Trump, some of his highest support is from White evangelical Christians (+46 points), White men without a college degree (+29), and rural voters (+15).\nVoters under age 45 back Biden by a single point, while those ages 65 and over go for Biden by 10 points.\nThere's a 17-point gender gap, as men go for Trump by 8 points and women for Biden by 9.\nBiden receives a touch more support among Democrats (95%) than Trump gets among Republicans (93%), but Trump is the choice of the small subgroup of independents (by 8 points).\nWhen potential third-party candidates are included, Biden tops Trump by 2 points (43-41%), with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. getting 9%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 2% each. In January, it was Trump who was up by 3 points over Biden, with Kennedy at 7%.\nKennedy receives a bit more of his backing from those who favor Trump (9%) in the 2-way ballot than from Biden (5%).\nBiden won Wisconsin in 2020 by 20,682 votes, less than one percentage point. Trump's 2016 victory was also by less than a point (22,748 votes).\nMore voters trust Trump to do a better job handling immigration (by 13 points) and the economy (+9). Biden is preferred over Trump on abortion (+9), health care (+7), and election integrity (+7). They are rated more evenly on foreign policy (Trump +2) and energy policy (even).\nOn the Middle East, equal numbers think the Biden administration is too supportive of the Israelis (25%) and the Palestinians (24%). Yet the largest share says Biden's support of each is about right (38%) — and they favor him over Trump by 38 points.\nOverall, Wisconsinites feel somewhat positive about their personal finances, as 6 in 10 say their situation is either holding steady (45%) or improving (14%). Both of those groups largely favor Biden, while the 4 in 10 who are falling behind financially go for Trump by a wide margin.\nIn the Congressional ballot test, 46% go for the Democratic candidate in their district and 45% for the Republican. Neither Biden nor Trump is a drain on his party, as 94% of those backing the Congressional Democrat favor Biden and 93% of those supporting the Republican go for Trump.\n\"Data from the 2022 election suggests MAGA candidates ran three to four points worse than non-MAGA Republicans,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts Fox News polls with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"But we're not seeing that ‘Trump tax' so far in the 2024 numbers. Neither are we seeing Biden underperforming other Democrats. It looks like partisans are behaving like partisans.\"\nBy a 5-point margin, more voters think Trump (48%) has the mental soundness to serve effectively as president than Biden (43%). Most Republicans (89%) say Trump has it and most Democrats say Biden does (85%), but independents are 17 points more likely to say Trump is mentally fit.\nThe survey finds 44% approve of Biden's job performance and 55% disapprove — unchanged since January (44-56%). His 48% support in the 2-way race is higher than his approval because 10% of those disapproving of the job he's doing still pick him over Trump.\nNearly two-thirds think Biden was legitimately elected in 2020, and they back him over Trump by 53 points and are twice as likely to approve of the job he's doing (67% approve, 32% disapprove). Among the one-third who say Biden was not legitimately elected, 98% favor Trump in the 2-way race and 98% disapprove of Biden's job performance.\nWisconsin voters are unified when it comes to having a negative opinion of both Biden and Trump. Views of each are net negative by a 10-point margin, as they both receive the same rating: 44% favorable vs 54% unfavorable.\nKennedy's ratings are negative by 13 points, 35% favorable vs. 48% unfavorable. He's viewed much more positively by Republicans (49%) and independents (44%) than Democrats (19%).\nAmong the small segment of so-called double haters (those viewing both Biden and Trump unfavorably), the vote preference splits: Biden 38% vs. Trump 39% % in the two-way ballot test. When third-party candidates are included, they back Kennedy (34%), followed by Biden (21%), Trump (13%), West (10%), and Stein (9%).\nConducted April 11-16, 2024 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,198 Wisconsin registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (174) and cellphones (669) or completed the survey online after receiving a text message (355). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics are representative of the registered voter population.",

            "summary": "More than a dozen Democrat attorneys general are weighing in on a legal dispute in Georgia over its congressional map, alleging it discriminates against minority voters.\nA challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), WilmerHale on behalf of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc., the Sixth District of the African Methodist Episcopal Church and several individual Georgia voters is currently on appeal before the 11th Circuit.\nThe suit alleges that Georgia lawmakers after the 2020 census enacted a new congressional map that drew district lines, diluting the power of Black voters by not adding new Black-majority districts to reflect growth in the Black population in the metro areas of the state.\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta and 18 of his colleagues filed an amicus brief on Tuesday, arguing that Georgia's maps are \"diluting minority voting strength.\"\nBut election watchdog groups say the blue states interjecting in the Peach State's legal battle to keep a GOP-drawn map is \"transparently political.\"\n\"This is the left's playbook for redistricting,\" Honest Elections Project Vice President Chad Ennis told Fox News Digital. \"They claim every map not tilted towards Democrats is racist.\"\nIn December, an Obama-appointed federal judge ruled that, after an earlier order for Georgia to include one additional majority or near-majority Black district to comply with the Voting Rights Act (VRA), the assembly had \"fully complied\" with the court.\nBut the ACLU and others contended the state was still violating the VRA because the new map for creating a majority-Black district in Atlanta simultaneously dismantled a nearby district of mostly minority voters currently represented by a Democrat.\nThe ACLU contends that the map still violates Section 2 of the VRA, which says, \"No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\"\nBonta's office said the purpose of the blue state amicus brief was for \"highlighting the importance of civic engagement from all voters regardless of race, color, or membership in minority-language group, and ensuring that every citizen has the right to vote.\"\n\"The Fifteenth Amendment guarantees all U.S. citizens the right to vote, regardless of race, color, or background,\" Bonta said. \"Unfortunately, there are those who believe the only way they can win is by denying access and suppressing voters.\"\nBut the Honest Elections Project said the top Democrat state prosecutors \"are quick to ignore minority districts when they benefit the Left politically,\" naming a recent court battle in Michigan as a prime example.\nIn December, Michigan's state House and Senate maps were tossed as racial gerrymanders, a first-of-its-kind loss for a state redistricting commission and a major blow to Democrats' chances to maintain control of the state legislature, Bloomberg Law reported.\nA three-judge federal panel ruled that Michigan's Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission illegally drew 13 districts' lines and violated the U.S. Constitution by predominantly focusing on race, minimizing Black voting age population in various Detroit-area districts in a way that denied Black voters the ability to select minority candidates in primaries, the outlet reported.\n\"The institutional left was silent because the maps benefited them,\" Ennis told Fox News Digital.\n\"None of these attorneys general felt the need to weigh in on that litigation. Their Georgia brief is transparently political and has nothing to do with helping minority voters,\" he said.\nKen Cuccinelli, former Virginia attorney general and head of the Election Transparency Initiative, told Fox News Digital, \"There is no question at all that the Democrat AGs' amicus brief is political.\"\n\"It is extremely rare to see states engage in election litigation related to a sister state like this,\" he said.\nBonta's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.",

He's down now to a one vote majority. That majority goes all over the place on everything. And so he's a good man who is trying mightily. But at least so far, Republicans have not been willing or able to use the leverage we have to force real border security.\nI'll tell you, Maria, this week was a bad week for the United States Constitution. This week we had the Alejandro Mayorkas trial that was supposed to happen this week, and Senate Democrats, every Democrat, refused to hold a trial and essentially nuked the impeachment provisions of the Constitution.

U.S. officials said 99% of those were intercepted.\nThe move, in retaliation for Israel's attack on its consulate in Damascus, signified a major escalation of tensions amid Israel's ongoing war with Hamas. Despite decades of hostilities, Iran has never directly attacked Israel, instead relying on proxy forces in Iraq, Lebanon, and elsewhere.\nThursday's resolution condemning Iran overwhelmingly passed 404 to 14. Thirteen Democrats voted against the resolution including \"Squad\" member Reps.

The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians, has said over 30,000 Palestinians have died in the months since.\nSince Oct. 7, Fetterman has repeatedly irked his Democratic colleagues with his fervent support for Israel.\nEarlier this week, Fetterman said he would never \"capitulate to the fringe\" of his party. On Tuesday, he ripped anti-Israel agitators who blocked bridges or major roadways.\n\"I don't know who needs to hear this, but blocking a bridge or berating folks in Starbucks isn't righteous, it just makes you an a---hole,\" Fetterman wrote on X. \"Demand Hamas to send every hostage back home and surrender.\"",

Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y., who presided over the vote and told those waving the flags that the display was \"inappropriate.\"\nMolinaro's comments elicited jeers from Democrats in the chamber, but was backed up by Rep.

Mike Lee, R-Utah quipped on X while sharing a video of the flag waving.\nThe display was also derided by Nicole Shanahan, the running mate of independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\n\"I remember as a 12 year old waking up in downtown Oakland and realizing our car had been broken into and the $1.50 I was relying on to buy a McDonald's breakfast sandwich had been stolen,\" Shanahan said on X. \"Watching our leadership today send $60B to Ukraine while waving another nation's flag is gut-wrenching.

            "summary": "Alabama voters decided primary runoffs on Tuesday for the state's newly redrawn 2nd Congressional District, setting up a potentially historic November race that could play a part in the battle for control of the U.S. House of Representatives.\nShomari Figures, a former top aide to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, defeated state House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels to win the Democratic nomination. Attorney and political newcomer Caroleene Dobson defeated former state Sen. Dick Brewbaker to win the Republican nomination. Dobson and Figures will face off in November in the closely watched general election.\nDemocrats are aiming to flip the seat after the district was redrawn by a federal court to boost the voting power of Black residents. If Figures is elected, it will be the first time in history that Alabama, which is about 27% Black, has two Black members in its congressional delegation.\n\"I'm enormously grateful for the confidence and the trust and the faith that the voters of this newly drawn district have placed in me to represent the Democratic Party in November,\" Figures said as he addressed supporters Tuesday night. \"That is something that I do not take lightly.\"\nFigures, an attorney, also served as an aide to former President Barack Obama, serving as domestic director of the Presidential Personnel Office. He is the son of two prominent Alabama legislators: longtime state Sen. Vivian Davis Figures and the late Senate President Pro Tem Michael Figures. He moved home to Mobile from Washington D.C. to run for the congressional seat.\nThe non-partisan Cook Political Report rated the district as \"likely Democrat,\" meaning that it favors the Democratic candidate in November but isn't considered a sure thing. Republicans believe they will be competitive in November and have a chance to keep the seat under GOP control.\nDobson, a real estate attorney and member of the Alabama Forestry Commission, harnessed support in rural areas to defeat Brewbaker, who had led in the March 5 primary. Dobson was raised in Monroe County and lived and practiced law in Texas before returning to Alabama and joining the Maynard Nexsen law firm in 2019.\n\"Thank you to each and every Republican voter in the Second District of Alabama. I am humbled by your outpouring of support and eagerness to join us in fighting for Alabama families,\" Dobson said in a written statement. \"Because you believed in me and in my vision for our district, we are one step closer to saving our country.\"\nThe new district came after a lengthy court battle in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Black Alabamians who had challenged the state's existing congressional districts.\nFederal judges approved new district lines in October after ruling that Alabama's previous map — which had only one majority-Black district out of seven — was racially gerrymandered to limit the influence of the state's Black voters. The three-judge panel said Alabama should have a second district where Black voters make up a substantial portion of the voting age population and have a reasonable opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice.\n\"Following tonight's runoff election, Alabama voters now stand on the cusp of making history in November, when Black Alabamians could — for the first time — elect two members of Congress who truly reflect their political desires,\" former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, chairman of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said.\nThe new district spans the width of the state and includes Montgomery, parts of Mobile and rural counties in the state's Black Belt.",

            "excerpt": "A California bill would require schools to notify parents if the child is changing genders and requires transgender athletes to use facilities marked with their birth gender.",
            "summary": "That is the court fight some parents in California are waging against Democratic lawmakers and the Newsom Administration, who are trying to stop voters from a proposed ballot measure that would require schools to notify parents if a child is changing their gender. The initiative would also protect female sports from transgender athletes (born males) and mandate that students use school facilities consistent with their birth gender.\nPolls show a majority of Californian voters support the measures. However, the state legislature, where Democrats enjoy a super majority, refused to hear the bill, and Democrat State Attorney General Rob Bonta changed the initiative's title from \"Protect Kids of California Act\" to the \"Restrict Rights of Transgender Youth\" initiative.\nSupporters also say Bonta changed the required 100-word summary of the initiative in a negative, misleading and pejorative way that they claim makes it nearly impossible to gather signatures or raise money.\n\"His bias on these issues is clear, and he's allowed to have his opinion,\" says Dean McGee of the Liberty Justice Center, which brought the lawsuit against Bonta. \"What he's not allowed to do is mess with the democratic process in California. Rebrand this initiative in a way that makes it likely to fail, instead of giving it a fair shot at the ballot.\"\nAccording to state statute, the Attorney General is required to \"give a true and impartial statement of the purpose of the measure\" so that it \"shall neither be an argument, nor be likely to create prejudice, for or against the proposed measure.\"\nOn Thursday night, a judge tentatively denied the parents' lawsuit, saying statutes also give the Attorney General \"considerable latitude in preparing a title and summary\" and \"only upon clear and convincing proof\" that the title and summary is \"false, misleading, or inconsistent with the requirements\" of the (elections code), can a judge step in.\nSacramento County Superior Court Judge Stephen Acquisto previously served as the chief deputy legal affairs lawyer for then Governor Jerry Brown.\nThe parent activist group cited research showing that most voters only read an initiative's title and summary. It claims changing words such as \"protect,\" \"ensure,\" and \"fairness\" to \"require, restrict and prohibit\" typically doom measures to fail at the ballot box.\n\"He's attempting to bypass California's abilities to evaluate this issue neutrally by writing a biased summary that people will be unlikely to support,\" claims McGee. Leaders of Protect Kids California also say Bonta, a potential gubernatorial candidate, should be \"conflicted out\" because he's already suing to stop the Chino Valley School District from adopting a similar policy.\nBonta's office issued this statement.\n\"Under California law, the Attorney General's Office is responsible for issuing official titles and summaries describing the chief purpose and points of every proposed initiative... and stand by our title and summary for this measure.\"\nJudge Acquisto heard arguments Friday afternoon challenging his ruling. The parents' group says it will likely appeal and hope to get on the 2026 ballot.",

            "excerpt": "Debate rages over whether LA's new congressional district map is racially or politically motivated after a judge ruled the previous map violated the Voting Rights Act.",
            "summary": "Politics and race are both factors in a pending court challenge of Louisiana's new congressional maps. How much weight each carries is a major question before three federal judges whose ruling could affect the balance of power in the next Congress.\nAt issue is a congressional map that was approved this year with the backing of the state's new governor, Jeff Landry — to the consternation of at least some of his fellow Republicans.\nThe map creates a new mostly Black congressional district in Louisiana, at the expense of a white Republican incumbent, Rep. Garret Graves, who backed another Republican in the governor's election last fall. Given voting patterns in Louisiana, a mostly Black district would be more likely to send a Democrat to Congress.\nTwelve self-described non-African American voters argued in a lawsuit that the new mostly Black district constitutes illegal \"textbook racial gerrymandering.\"\nNot so, argue the new map's backers. Politics, they argue, was the major influence in drawing the new district boundary lines. They say the new map protects most incumbents and draws together Black populations in a way that will comply with the federal Voting Rights Act, giving Louisiana, which is roughly one-third Black, a second majority Black district among six.\nThey also pointed to Republican backers of the plan, who said during legislative debates in January that they wanted to safeguard four GOP-held House districts, including those of House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise.\nThat the new map put Graves in political peril by placing him in the new mostly Black district is further evidence race wasn't the sole motivating factor, the map's backers said in briefs and in testimony last week at a hearing in Shreveport.\n\"We all know that one of the main reasons it was drawn the way it was, was because Gov. Jeff Landry wants to get rid of Congressman Graves,\" state Rep. Mandie Landry, a New Orleans Democrat who testified at the hearing, said in a social media post. Landry is no relation to the governor.\nState Sen. Cleo Fields, a Black Democrat from the Baton Rouge area who served in Congress in the 1990s, has already declared his candidacy in the newly configured district.\nWhatever the three judges decide will likely be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. It's unclear when the judges will rule, but time is growing short. State election officials say they need to know the configuration of the districts by May 15 to prepare for the fall elections.\nThe controversy in Louisiana, as in other states, arose because new government district boundary lines are redrawn by legislatures every 10 years to account for population shifts reflected in census data. Louisiana's Republican-dominated Legislature drew a new map in 2022 that, despite some boundary shifts, was favorable to all six current incumbents: five white Republicans and a Black Democrat. Then-Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, vetoed the map but the majority-Republican Legislature overrode the veto, leading to a court challenge filed in Baton Rouge.\nIn June 2022, Baton Rouge-based U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick issued an injunction against the map, saying challengers would likely win their suit claiming it violated the Voting Rights Act. As the case was appealed, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an unexpected ruling in June that favored Black voters in a congressional redistricting case in Alabama.\nDick sided with challengers who said the 2022 map packed a significant number of voters in one district — District 2 which stretches from New Orleans to the Baton Rouge area — while \"cracking\" the remaining Black population by apportioning it to other mostly white districts.\nIn November, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals gave the state a January deadline for drawing a new congressional district. Landry, who was the state's attorney general when he was elected to succeed the term-limited Edwards, called a special session to redraw the map, saying the Legislature should do it rather than a federal judge.\nThe new map does not resemble the sample maps that supporters of a new majority Black district had suggested earlier, which would have created a new district largely covering the northeastern part of the state.\nThe new mostly Black district crosses the state diagonally, linking Shreveport in the northwest to parts of the Baton Rouge area in the southeast. And while its backers hail the creation of a new majority Black district, the plaintiffs say it results in \"explicit, racial segregation of voters.\"\nThe judges hearing the case are U.S. District Judges David Joseph and Robert Summerhays, both nominated to the court by former President Donald Trump; and Judge Carl Stewart of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, nominated by former Democratic President Bill Clinton.\nThe judges have given no indication when they will rule. \"We're going to have to know soon,\" Mandie Landry said, citing the upcoming elections.",

            "excerpt": "Rebekah Koffler: The assault on religious freedoms is transforming America from a nation steeped in the Judeo-Christian tradition to one more kin to my birthplace, Soviet Russia.",
            "summary": "Former President Trump recently declared that he would not sign a national abortion ban if reelected and such a bill passed Congress, stressing in an interaction with reporters that abortion policy should be determined by individual states.\nTrump, who was raised as a Presbyterian but didn't exactly lead the life of a devout man, appears to focus his policies firmly on defending the Judeo-Christian principles that have served as the foundation of American culture since its inception. This is in stark contrast to President Biden, ostensibly a cradle Catholic but whose views on abortion prompted some of his fellow Catholics to call for Biden's disqualification from communion. Indeed, the policies of the 46th president and his fellow Democrats appear to contribute to, if not drive, the transformation of our country into a Godless nation.\nA massive change is underway in the spiritual landscape of the nation that has in its very Constitution guaranteed complete religious freedom. Modern America is steadily moving away from its religious heritage. Not only is religiosity steadily disappearing from American culture and society, people of faith increasingly have their rights undermined by the state.\nAs an immigrant from Soviet Russia, where religion was outlawed and believers were persecuted, I'm gravely concerned about our society's drift toward secularism and the government's efforts to suppress our constitutionally guaranteed freedom to pursue an authentic devout way of life.\nThe latest and the most direct and egregious affront to people of faith was President Biden's proclamation of March 31, 2024, which fell on Easter Sunday, as Transgender Day of Visibility.\nEaster is the most sacred holiday of the year for Christians, who comprise approximately 63% (or 210 million) of the U.S. population. It's been celebrated here since the Civil War. Transgender Day of Visibility, on the other hand, was created in 2009 to raise awareness about and draw attention to transgender people.\nTransgender persons comprise 1.64 million Americans, according to a 2022 study conducted by a UCLA Law School think tank, which used data from surveys done by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Adding insult to injury, the White House prohibited religious-themed designs from the art contest held for children of the National Guard during the Easter Egg Roll on the White House lawn.\nThis is not the first time the state wields its power to promote secularization of our society. Last December, some government apparatchiks across the country sought to take Christ out of Christmas. Some jurisdictions introduced guidelines for \"inclusive decorating practices\" and \"neutral language\" to mark the holiday season.\nLocal government officials instructed their staff to replace the red and green colors with neutral tones, avoid religious ornaments, and use gender-neutral nouns such as \"snow people\" instead of \"snowmen\" in order not to offend some members of the community. Are religious Americans no longer part of the so-called community? Evidently, it's OK to offend those Americans, trample on their constitutional right to properly celebrate Christmas, a religious holiday, using religious symbols.\nSome in the Democratic Party have been promoting anti-God sentiment, offending devout Americans, for several election cycles as it is courting religiously unaffiliated voters. In 2019, the Democratic National Committee passed a resolution praising the party's religious \"nones.\" The document called on Democratic leaders to listen to the concerns of \"religiously unaffiliated Americans,\" characterizing them as a group that \"advocates for rational public policy based on sound science and universal humanistic values.\"\nIn contrast, the narratives coming out of the Democratic Party messaging machine portray churchgoing Americans as stupid, old-fashioned, nationalistic and radical in their views. Christian nationalism is a new term that's frequently attached by the Democrats and leftist media to the Christian faith. Such commonsense concepts as two genders, marriage between a man and a woman, pro-life, mother and father, parental rights are portrayed as radical ideas.\nUnder Biden's presidency, attacks on religious liberty and Americans of faith have reached unprecedented levels. Biden's 2021 Build Back Better legislation reportedly blocked religious facilities, such as churches, synagogues and schools, from using infrastructure funds for improvements. In November 2021, Biden reversed a Trump-era rule that protects the religious liberty of faith-based organizations that contract with the federal government, allowing them to hire people who specifically hold their faith beliefs.\nIn March 2021, Biden's then-press secretary, Jen Psaki, refused to say if Biden would force doctors with religious objections to perform abortions. In his 2022 budget, Biden called for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which protects American taxpayers from being forced to fund abortion.\nIt is little wonder that America appears to be on the trajectory of becoming more and more secular. Church membership has been on the decline for the past two decades, but in 2020, it fell below the majority for the first time. According to a March 2021 Gallup poll, 47% of Americans said they belonged to a church, synagogue or mosque, down from 50% in 2018 and 70% in 1999.\nIndeed, last month's Gallup research showed attendance at religious services had declined in most U.S. religious groups. Only three in 10 Americans say they attend religious services every week (21%). The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the most observant, with two-thirds attending church weekly or nearly weekly. Protestants rank second, with 44% attending services regularly, followed by Muslims (38%) and Catholics (33%), according to Gallup.\nContributions to religious organizations remain at a historical low of 44%, and volunteering is down.\nAs Biden is gearing up for the 2024 election this November, there are no signs that, if re-elected, America's chief executive and the Democratic Party would halt their assault on Christians and religious freedom.",

            "excerpt": "Several elected Democrats called for ICE to be abolished, broken up or 'terminated\" during former President Donald Trump's tenure in the White House, but are now silent.",
            "summary": "A handful of high-profile Democrats in the Senate and House previously supported the notion of abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — the agency tasked with enforcing immigration law in communities and at the border.\nDespite their previous calls for ICE to be scrapped, there has been little resistance or pushback from Democrats about ICE enforcement under President Biden as the border crisis continues to wreak havoc on U.S. citizens, cities and communities.\nSens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — two Democrats who sought their party's nomination for president in 2020 — are prominent leaders who previously led calls for ICE to be abolished outright, or broken up during former President Donald Trump's tenure in the White House.\nIn 2018, during an appearance on CNN, Gillibrand said: \"I don't think ICE today is working as intended. . . . I believe that it has become a deportation force, and I think you should separate the criminal justice from the immigration issues.\"\n\"I think you should reimagine ICE under a new agency with a very different mission and take those two missions out,\" she added at the time. \"We believe that we should protect families who need our help and that is not what ICE is doing today, and that's why I believe you should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works.\"\nWarren also took issue with the agency in 2018, writing in a Facebook post in June 2018: \"[Trump's] deeply immoral actions have made it obvious that we need to rebuild our immigration system from top to bottom, starting by replacing ICE with something that reflects our values.\"\nThough he didn't directly call for ICE to be abolished, a 2019 plan released by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and sought the party's nomination for president in 2016 and 2020, included breaking up ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).\nDeportation and enforcement would return to the Department of Justice, customs matters to the Treasury, and naturalization and citizenship to the State Department under Sanders' proposal.\nSeveral House Democrats also called to \"terminate\" ICE under Trump and expressed their support for the agency to be \"abolished.\"\nHouse Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wisc., introduced legislation in 2018 that would have led to ICE being \"terminated\" and called for the establishment of a commission \"tasked with establishing a humane immigration enforcement system.\" It never received a vote in the House.\nPocan's bill was co-sponsored by seven other Democrats who remain in Congress, including Reps. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Adriano Espaillat of New York, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, Adam Smith of Washington, Nydia Velázquez of New York and Yvette Clarke of New York.\n\"From conducting raids at garden centers and meatpacking plants, to breaking up families at churches and schools, ICE is tearing apart families and ripping at the moral fabric of our nation. . . . The agency can no longer accomplish its goals effectively,\" Pocan said at the time.\n\"I'm introducing legislation that would abolish ICE and crack down on the agency's blanket directive to target and round up individuals and families,\" he added.\nSpeaking about the effort in July 2018, Jayapal said in a statement: \"There was enforcement of our immigration laws before ICE was created, and there will be after ICE, as an agency, is gone. As it stands, ICE is out of control.\"\nThe effort was also favored heavily by Espaillat, who said then that the lawmakers were \"pushing to bring an end to ICE as the agency has strayed too far from its original mission, intent and purpose.\"\n\"We are witnessing a human rights crisis, and our bill would bring forward a new model and dismantle ICE once and for all,\" he added.\nJoining her colleagues, Velázquez also said then that \"the time has come to abolish ICE.\"\nBlumenauer also called for an end to the agency in 2018, insisting the Trump administration had \"made the agency so toxic that it's time to abolish ICE, and start over.\"\nThe Oregon lawmaker's office noted in a press release at the time that he had been \"one of the first members of Congress to call for ICE to be abolished\" and voted against the formation of ICE.\nLike Blumenauer, McGovern also voted against the formation of ICE. In a 2018 comment, the Massachusetts congressman said, \"It's time to abolish ICE.\"\n\"We need to start a fresh conversation,\" he added at the time.\nThough she wasn't sworn in as a member of Congress until January 2019, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has also made calls to abolish ICE and even suggested that she would like to eliminate the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the agency.\nThe congresswoman's remarks came in a July 2019 discussion with The New Yorker Radio Hour's David Remnick about the possibility of reforming or abolishing ICE.\n\"Would you get rid of Homeland Security, too?\" Remnick asked.\n\"I think so, I think so. I think we need to undo a lot of the egregious, a lot of the egregious mistakes that the Bush administration did. I feel like we are at a very, it's a very qualified and supported position, at least in terms of evidence, and in terms of being able to make the argument, that we never should've created DHS in the early 2000s,\" Ocasio-Cortez responded at the time.\nOcasio-Cortez renewed her call for ICE to be abolished in January 2021, writing in a post on social media, \"Abolish ICE.\"\nIn 2022, the New York lawmaker sold \"Abolish ICE\" t-shirts, posters, and magnets on her official team shop that featured an ice cooler with the word \"abolish\" spray-painted in red above the word \"ice.\" Today, however, it appears the only available item in her online store with the words \"abolish ICE\" written on it is a hat.\nIn an effort to understand where they stand on the issue now, Fox News Digital reached out to every Democrat mentioned in this article who called for ICE to be abolished, broken up, or terminated. None of them responded.\nICE was established in 2003 as a component agency of DHS, following the 9/11 terror attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.\nICE was formed with the passage of the 2002 Homeland Security Act to absorb the responsibilities of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service, as well as the U.S. Customs Service, which was formerly under the control of the Treasury Department.\nThe agency is currently led by Acting Director Patrick J. Lechleitner, an American law enforcement officer who has served in the role since July 2023.\nCBP records show that the first six months of fiscal year 2024 had 1,340,801 total encounters, exceeding the first six months of fiscal year 2023, which set a record of 1,226,254 total encounters.",

            "excerpt": "New York Democratic congressional candidate Nate McMurray has come under fire for a post saying \"Die MAGA die\" after the House approved a bill to fund Ukraine.",
            "summary": "A New York Democratic congressional candidate celebrated the House passing a $60 billion bill to fund Ukraine while hoping for the death of the MAGA movement, a message posted to X shows.\n\"Slava Ukraine,\" New York congressional candidate Nate McMurray posted to X Saturday afternoon.\n\"Die MAGA die. You lose,\" he added of former President Trump's supporters and those who agree with the \"Make America Great Again\" platform.\nMcMurray's tweet followed the U.S. House passing a bill Saturday that provides $60 billion to Ukraine amid the nation's ongoing war against Russia. The aid package passed 311 to 112, with more Republicans voting against the bill, at 112, than Republicans who voted for it, at 101.\nMcMurray is running to represent New York's 26th Congressional District, which includes parts of Erie and Niagara counties in the western area of the state, after previously serving as the town supervisor of the Town of Grand Island and as an attorney.\nSome conservatives have railed against continuing to fund Ukraine while the U.S. is coping with a border crisis, and some voted against the bill for its failure to include funding to secure the U.S. border.\n\"Today, I voted no... These bills were brought forward under a contrived process to achieve a pre-determined outcome – a $100 billion, unpaid-for foreign aid package while failing to secure the border,\" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said.\n\"For months, House Republicans – specifically, Speaker Mike Johnson – have been unequivocal that we would not send billions in additional aid to Ukraine without securing our own border first. This package represents a complete reversal of a position that previously unified the Republican conference, despite the clear & present danger the southern border represents to U.S. national security.\"\n\"States and cities across our nation are grappling with the consequences of Biden's border crisis, inflation continues to squeeze the budgets of every American household and our country is over $34 trillion in debt,\" Rep. Ben Cline, R-Va, said Saturday. \"As I continue fighting for the people of Virginia's 6th District, I urge my colleagues in Congress and the Biden administration to listen to the American people and put their concerns first.\"\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a Trump supporter, has railed against Speaker Johnson, R-La., for championing the bill's passage, calling him a \"traitor to our country.\" Greene is also leading an effort to oust Johnson as speaker.\n\"Zelensky thanks Speaker Mike Johnson (D-Ukraine) for sending $61 BILLION of your hard-earned tax dollars to fuel a foreign war. Johnson once again passed a bill with the help of Democrats while the majority of the Republican majority voted against it. Not only is Mike Johnson a traitor to our conference, he's a traitor to our country,\" Greene tweeted Saturday.\nMcMurray came under fire on social media for his comment \"Die MAGA die,\" including from those who said it appears he's hoping for the deaths of MAGA movement voters. Others said they reported McMurray to X for inciting violence.\nMcMurray posted a follow-up message Saturday directed at Trump supporters, saying the MAGA movement should \"expire,\" \"fade\" or \"disintegrate.\"\n\"Dear MAGA: Send your regards to MAGA Mike, not me. He loves freedom and Ukraine too. You see, not even your leaders REALLY like your sick, twisted anti-freedom, anti-American MAGA movement. It should… let me see, what word should I use? Expire? Fade? Or maybe something stronger that starts with a ‘d' Disintegrate?\" McMurray continued in another post Saturday.\nFox News Digital reached out to McMurray's campaign Sunday morning, and also sent a message to the congressional candidate on social media, but did not immediately receive additional comment on the posts and their subsequent criticisms.\nMcMurray is currently facing a lawsuit from a Democratic competitor in the House race, state Sen. Tim Kennedy, who asked a state court last week to remove McMurray's name from the Democratic primary ballot. The state senator's suit claims more than 1,000 signatures collected for McMurray's electoral petition are invalid, either due to circumstances \"constituting fraud\" or were collected by an ineligible canvasser, WBFO reported.\nMcMurray has denied the claims.\nThe 26th District was previously represented by Democrat Brian Higgins, who officially stepped down from the position in February. A special election will be held on April 30 to replace Higgins for the remaining months of his term. McMurray is only running in the Democratic primary ahead of the general election in November, not the special election.",

            "excerpt": "A California bill would require schools to notify parents if the child is changing genders and requires transgender athletes to use facilities marked with their birth gender.",
            "summary": "That is the court fight some parents in California are waging against Democratic lawmakers and the Newsom Administration, who are trying to stop voters from a proposed ballot measure that would require schools to notify parents if a child is changing their gender. The initiative would also protect female sports from transgender athletes (born males) and mandate that students use school facilities consistent with their birth gender.\nPolls show a majority of Californian voters support the measures. However, the state legislature, where Democrats enjoy a super majority, refused to hear the bill, and Democrat State Attorney General Rob Bonta changed the initiative's title from \"Protect Kids of California Act\" to the \"Restrict Rights of Transgender Youth\" initiative.\nSupporters also say Bonta changed the required 100-word summary of the initiative in a negative, misleading and pejorative way that they claim makes it nearly impossible to gather signatures or raise money.\n\"His bias on these issues is clear, and he's allowed to have his opinion,\" says Dean McGee of the Liberty Justice Center, which brought the lawsuit against Bonta. \"What he's not allowed to do is mess with the democratic process in California. Rebrand this initiative in a way that makes it likely to fail, instead of giving it a fair shot at the ballot.\"\nAccording to state statute, the Attorney General is required to \"give a true and impartial statement of the purpose of the measure\" so that it \"shall neither be an argument, nor be likely to create prejudice, for or against the proposed measure.\"\nOn Thursday night, a judge tentatively denied the parents' lawsuit, saying statutes also give the Attorney General \"considerable latitude in preparing a title and summary\" and \"only upon clear and convincing proof\" that the title and summary is \"false, misleading, or inconsistent with the requirements\" of the (elections code), can a judge step in.\nSacramento County Superior Court Judge Stephen Acquisto previously served as the chief deputy legal affairs lawyer for then Governor Jerry Brown.\nThe parent activist group cited research showing that most voters only read an initiative's title and summary. It claims changing words such as \"protect,\" \"ensure,\" and \"fairness\" to \"require, restrict and prohibit\" typically doom measures to fail at the ballot box.\n\"He's attempting to bypass California's abilities to evaluate this issue neutrally by writing a biased summary that people will be unlikely to support,\" claims McGee. Leaders of Protect Kids California also say Bonta, a potential gubernatorial candidate, should be \"conflicted out\" because he's already suing to stop the Chino Valley School District from adopting a similar policy.\nBonta's office issued this statement.\n\"Under California law, the Attorney General's Office is responsible for issuing official titles and summaries describing the chief purpose and points of every proposed initiative... and stand by our title and summary for this measure.\"\nJudge Acquisto heard arguments Friday afternoon challenging his ruling. The parents' group says it will likely appeal and hope to get on the 2026 ballot.",

            "excerpt": "House Republicans are blaming each other after their latest bid to pass border security measures failed over the weekend.",
            "summary": "Frustrated House Republicans are trading barbs with their own colleagues after the passage of a $95 billion foreign aid bill with funding for Ukraine and Israel.\nDifferent factions of the House Republican Conference feuded over the weekend after the House passed four foreign aid bills via a simple majority vote, while a separate border security bill that needed two-thirds supermajority of the chamber failed to reach that threshold.\n\"[T]he only reason the supermajority procedure was required was that a handful of self-destroying Republicans joined with all Democrats to oppose the Rule which would have allowed it to pass with a simple majority,\" Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., wrote on X. \"Those so called Republicans killed border security before Schumer could!\"\nHouse Freedom Caucus member Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, shot back, \"Those who wanted to force a Senate vote on border security were betrayed by the surrender of leverage, not by opposition to the rule.\"\n\"If the speaker wanted to keep his own promises on border security, he would have attached border security to the rule. Those opposed would have been forced to accept it, or oppose the rule,\" Davidson responded.\nA rule vote is a procedural hurdle that sets terms for debate and a final vote on one or several pieces of legislation. It's decided by a majority in the House Rules Committee, which is the last test for bills before they reach the House floor.\nConservative foreign aid skeptics were outraged at the decision by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., last week to advance his four foreign aid bills under one rule vote and a fifth border security bill under a separate rule, arguing that it left Republicans with no leverage to force the Senate to take it up.\nIn protest, three of those skeptics joined all Democrats in killing the bill in the Rules Committee, which forced Johnson to bring the bill up for a vote by forgoing the procedural hurdle in exchange for raising the threshold for passage to two-thirds instead of a simple majority.\nPredictably, the bill failed with no Democrats backing the measure.\nRep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., took a veiled shot at GOP rebels after the Saturday vote, accusing them of throwing up roadblocks for media attention, \"Sadly we have some egos outpacing intellects. Could they survive a day [without] a microphone or camera in front of them? We are here TO GOVERN not play to the press.\"\nOn the other side of the argument, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, one of the three Rules Committee Republicans who blocked the border bill from getting a simple majority vote on the House floor, accused GOP leaders of putting it up for \"cover.\"\n\"Ukraine issues aside, our take down of the SEPARATE border… rule – they needed desperately to pass as cover – has enraged them [because] they now can't easily lie that border was attached in a package,\" Roy wrote on X in an unrelated post.\nMeanwhile, Rep. Dan Bishop, R-N.C., piled on Barr's earlier post, \"After each sellout, once the fury of Republican voters sets in, the self-serving lies begin. Leadership NEVER proposed to attach ANY border security measure to this Ukraine package. They set up a separate, cosmetic vote to give cover that the Senate would have been free to ignore. The Rules Committee conservatives killed that separate rule.\"\nBut even Johnson himself dismissed arguments that he was in a position to force border security measures through the Democrat-controlled Senate and White House, telling FOX Business' Larry Kudlow days before the vote, \"Some of my colleagues want the speaker of the House to have a magic wand. If we could close the border ourselves, we would have done it a long time ago.\"\nThe infighting is not a new phenomenon in the House, but it illustrates the exceptional divides in Johnson's GOP Conference.\nHouse lawmakers are back in their home districts this week, but when they return, GOP leaders will be grappling with just a one-seat majority after the early departure of Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis.",

            "excerpt": "Fox News poll shows registered voters show Trump ahead of Biden by three points in Michigan, a shift from Biden's strong lead ahead of the 2020 election",
            "summary": "Four years ago this month — in the early lockdown stages of the coronavirus pandemic — Joe Biden led Donald Trump by 8 points among Michigan voters in a head-to-head presidential matchup. Today, they prefer Trump by 3 points.\nA new Fox News survey of Michigan registered voters finds President Biden receives 46% support to former President Trump's 49%. That's within the margin of sampling error. In February, it was 45% Biden — 47% Trump. In April 2020, Biden was at 49% to Trump's 41%.\nTrump's advantage is mainly due to a 19-point lead among men. He is also the favorite among White men without a college degree (by 33 points), rural voters (+23), voters under age 35 (+16), and White voters (+13). Plus, he is helped by a 4-point edge among independents as well as garnering a bit more support among Republicans (94%) than Biden gets among Democrats (92%).\nBiden's best groups include Black voters (+56), urban voters (+27), suburban women (+21), and voters ages 65 and over (+14).\nSince February, Trump is up 5 points among men, and while Biden has made similar gains among Black voters (+7), his 75% support among Blacks is about 20 points below where it was when he won Michigan in 2020.\nVoters living in union households go for Biden by 12 points, while the much larger non-union segment backs Trump by 7.\nTrump retains more of his 2020 voters, with 95% still supporting him compared to 90% of Biden's 2020 voters backing him.\nIn a potential 5-way race, Trump is ahead of Biden by 42%-40%, with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. receiving 9%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 2% each. It was announced Thursday that Kennedy will appear on the ballot in Michigan in November.\nBiden won Michigan by less than three percentage points in 2020. Ninety-six percent of Democrats voted for him, but fewer of them today, 83%, approve of the job he is doing.\nThe president's overall job rating stands at 43% approve and 56% disapprove. Some 11% of those disapproving of Biden's job performance still prefer him over Trump in the matchup.\nMichiganders have mixed views of Biden's approach to the Israel and Hamas war in Gaza, with 24% saying he is too supportive of the Israelis, 21% too supportive of the Palestinians, and 40% about right. Democrats (33%) and independents (22%) are more likely than Republicans (15%) to think Biden is too supportive of the Israelis -- and that shows up in the presidential vote preference. More than one-third of those saying Biden is too close to Israel back Trump (35%), the highest of the four battleground states where Fox News conducted surveys this week (Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin).\nJust over half of Michigan voters are either getting ahead financially or holding steady and those voters choose Biden, while just under half are falling behind and they go big for Trump.\nMore voters trust Trump by wide margins on some of the major issues of the campaign — immigration (+15 points), the economy (+11 points), and foreign policy (+8), while Biden is more narrowly preferred on election integrity (+6), health care (+6), and abortion (+5). The two are trusted about evenly on energy policy (Trump +2).\nBy a 9-point margin, more think Trump (49%) has the mental fitness to serve effectively as president than Biden (40%). Some 22% of Democrats think Biden lacks the metal soundness to serve. That's more than twice the number of Republicans who say the same about Trump (10%).\nMajorities of voters under age 35 disapprove of Biden (63%), think he lacks the mental fitness to serve (68%), trust Trump to handle the economy (61%), and favor Trump in the head-to-head ballot (+16 points).\nOverall, more voters view Biden negatively than positively by 16 points (41% favorable, 57% unfavorable). Trump's personal rating is also in negative territory but by a narrower 8 points (45-53%). Kennedy is underwater by 3 (39-42%), with one in five unable to rate him (19%).\nForty-six percent of voters say they would back the Republican candidate for Congress in their district, while 43% prefer the Democrat. Almost all of those backing the Democratic candidate go for Biden (92%) and most of those favoring the Republican candidate back Trump (93%).\nConducted April 11-16, 2024 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,126 Michigan registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (186) and cellphones (653) or completed the survey online after receiving a text message (287). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sample error of ±3 percentage points. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics of respondents are representative of the registered voter population.",

            "summary": "Multiple voter focus groups in Arizona have weighed in on Vice President Harris ahead of the November election, and their responses reinforced the notion that she's an unpopular candidate, according to a report in The Los Angeles Times.\nDays after Harris spoke in Arizona on April 12, the political group \"Republican Voters Against Trump\" invited the outlet to view videos of interviews with three different voter focus groups: one of former Trump 2016 voters who voted for Biden in 2020, one of Black voters who are disappointed with Biden, and another of \"California Democrats.\"\nThe Times reported the crossover voters' views, stating, \"Their assessments were brutal. If she is helping Biden, you don't see it. She rubs me the wrong way. She was picked because she is a demographic. The big things she had, she failed.\"\nGunner Ramer, the political director of Republican Voters Against Trump, summed up the views to the Times, saying, \"Swing voters don't like her.\"\nThe other two groups, while less antagonistic towards Harris, were not complimentary of her. \"In a focus group of Black voters who were disappointed with Biden, none raised their hand in support of Harris, with one participant calling her ‘the bad news bear,'\" the report noted.\nIt added, \"A focus group of California Democrats, while they liked Harris, had to be prompted to discuss her and said she needed more influence and exposure.\"\nThese views of Harris are not surprising considering she is even less popular than even President Biden and former President Trump, two historically unpopular presidents.\nUSA Today and Suffolk University polling from last month recorded that around 52% of registered voters disapprove of her performance as vice president. Additionally, only 36% of those surveyed say she is handling the job well, with 10% undecided.\nSuffolk University Political Research Center Director David Paleologos claimed in USA Today's report that Harris' unpopularity will be a big talking point during this election.\n\"Usually, it's a secondary and muted discussion about vice presidents. This time, it's going to be almost a parallel and loud discussion in comparison,\" he said.\nThe L.A. Times described how \"Harris has heard the criticism since she entered the White House\" and \"stepped up her appearances with core Democratic groups\" in response.\nThis campaign cycle, the vice president has leaned into championing abortion rights. Late last year, she kicked off her Fight for Our Reproductive Freedoms Tour, touring the nation to galvanize Biden voters over the issue of reproductive freedom.\nThe L.A. Times noted that Harris' allies \"believe her role as the administration's leading voice on abortion rights will boost her and the Democratic ticket on an issue that helped carry the party to unexpected success in the 2022 midterm elections.\"\nHowever, the outlet noted that even though she spoke out in Tucson earlier this month in response to the state Supreme Court upholding an 1864 abortion ban, focus group voters didn't notice.\n\"Several voters said in interviews in Phoenix on Monday that they were not aware Harris was in their state just a few days ago, underscoring the challenge of getting attention as a vice president in an era of information overload.\"\nDuring one of the focus group interviews, Black Democratic voter Tracey Sayles said, \"If she is coming for us, she doesn't show it.\"\nOther voters ripped Harris as well. Retired military member Jeff Garland, who voted Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020, declared, \"But from what I have seen of her, she doesn't look like someone I want running my country.\"\nThe Biden/Harris campaign views it differently. Campaign communications director Brian Fallon told the outlet that the vice president \"has proven to be a highly effective messenger on issues from reproductive freedom to gun violence prevention,\" and that she is \"uniquely positioned to mobilize critical groups across the Biden-Harris coalition, including both progressives and independents.\"\nThe Biden campaign did not immediately reply to Fox News Digital's request for comment.",

            "summary": "TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Two-term Republican U.S. Rep. Jake LaTurner is not running for reelection this year in his GOP-leaning eastern Kansas district so that he can spend more time with his four young children, he announced Thursday.\nLaTurner is among nearly two dozen Republicans in the U.S. House who are not running again or seeking another office.\n\"The unrepeatable season of life we are in, where our kids are still young and at home, is something I want to be more present for,\" LaTurner said.\nLaTurner's announcement leaves Republicans with no declared candidates in a district he likely would have had little trouble winning again. While the district includes Democratic strongholds in the state capital of Topeka and northern Kansas City, they're offset by rural areas that heavily favored former President Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020.\nLaTurner, 36, has put on hold what seemed a promising long-term political career, saying also that he wouldn't seek any office in 2026. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly is term-limited and Republicans had mentioned LaTurner as a possible candidate for the job that year.\nHe worked for U.S. Rep. Lynn Jenkins when he won a state Senate seat in 2012 at age 24, and he became Kansas' youngest-ever state treasurer at 29 when then-GOP Gov. Sam Brownback appointed him to fill a vacancy.\nLaTurner's statement mentioned \"the current dysfunction on Capitol Hill,\" with the narrow Republican majority in the House and a threat from the hard-right to topple Speaker Mike Johnson, but he also said he's optimistic about the nation's future. Instead, he said, serving in Congress has taken a toll on him, his wife, Suzanne, and their children.\n\"I am hopeful that in another season of life, with new experiences and perspectives, I can contribute in some small way and advocate for the issues I care most about,\" his statement Thursday said.\nWhile Republicans have represented the 2nd District in 27 of the past 30 years, Democrats have waged aggressive campaigns since Jenkins decided not to seek reelection in 2018. One Democrat, former teacher Eli Woody IV, has filed to run in November.\nIn the 2020 primary, LaTurner handily defeated Republican Steve Watkins and won the November election by almost 15 percentage points. In 2022, LaTurner won his general election race by a slightly wider margin.\nIn June 2022, the congressman beefed up security at his home and Topeka office out of concern for his family's safety after a man left a threatening voicemail after hours that said, \"I will kill you.\"\nThe man, Chase Neill, is now serving a sentence of nearly four years in prison after being convicted in federal court of one count of threating a U.S. official. LaTurner testified at the trial, and Neill, representing himself, cross-examined him personally.",

            "summary": "Fox News contributor Joey Jones discusses 'vicious antisemitism' demonstrated across universities and among the Democratic Party alongside 'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts.\n\"This party has turned hard anti-Israel because they're terrified of their rabid core,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on Sunday. \"This, tragically, is cultural Marxism that our universities are indoctrinating young people [with]. Cultural Marxism breaks the world into oppressors and victims, and they have defined Jews as oppressors [and] they have defined Palestinians as victims.\"\n\"This isn't just something that's happening in Columbia. USC had to take a valedictorian off the stage for their upcoming commencement because I guess she's pro-Palestinian, and they were afraid she was going to incite a reaction with her remarks. And then at Yale today, a student was stabbed in the eye,\" Jones said.\nEditor-in-chief of the Yale Free Press' Sahar Tartak was covering an anti-Israel protest on campus when she was attacked by a protester.\n\"There [were] hundreds of people taunting me and waving the middle finger at me, and then this person waves a Palestinian flag in my face and jabs it in my eye. When I tried to yell and go after him, the protesters got on a line and stopped me,\" Tartak told ‘The New York Post.'\n\"The lack of humanity for the people who stood between her and the cops, that the people who got in line and didn't even go to help her. There was a significant lack of humanity that I think has happened, and also since October 7th, we've seen these protests around the country on different college campuses,\" Fox News' Alicia Acuna said.\n\"As a reporter, I only hear those words from state leaders when they're telling people to get out of the way of a hurricane or a tornado or a rising water, because there's going to be a flood, and they could lose their life almost immediately,\" Acuna continued.\n\"But this is being told to students who made it into the Ivy League, their parents, their families [are] so proud, they worked so hard. The biggest challenge for them should be academic, not whether or not they're going to survive getting across campus. Something has changed in the last 48 hours. I think the White House needs to acknowledge that,\" she said.\n\"It's not just ‘The Squad' that's pro-Palestinian, it's the idea that, I'll take oppressor and add colonizer. That's something the Democrat liberal left has really indoctrinated into universities and told people that's all we are [in] the West,\" Jones said.\n\"I started looking at the groups that are there with these protesters. You've got the Party for Socialism and Liberation, they're there on site,\" Fox News contributor David Webb added.\n\"You've got RevCom, [the] revolutionary communists, another group… you know, this is RCA, [the] Revolutionary Communist America [group], these are the groups that are using this… in this case, the target is the Jews, but it's really this cultural Marxism mixed with a common hatred of Jews,\" Webb said.",

            "excerpt": "Democrats are almost certainly expected to be needed for Speaker Johnson's foreign aid proposal to clear a House-wide test vote on Friday.",
            "summary": "The House of Representatives is voting on whether to proceed with Speaker Mike Johnson's $95 billion foreign aid proposal on Friday after it cleared its first key procedural hurdle with Democratic help.\nThe Friday morning vote is a test vote of sorts for the four foreign aid bills, known as a \"rule vote.\" If successful it will allow lawmakers to debate each of the individual four bills and vote on their final passage on Saturday.\nThree of the four bills fund Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific. A fourth bill includes national security priorities like the House's recently passed crackdown on TikTok's ownership as well as the REPO Act, which would liquidate seized Russian assets and give that funding to Ukraine.\nDemocrats had to help bail the GOP-led proposals on Thursday night in the face of conservative opposition. The Rules Committee, the final barrier before legislation traditionally gets a House-wide vote, spent all day considering the bills before advancing their \"rules\" package in a 9-3 vote.\nIt's highly unusual for Democrats, or any opposition party, to cross the aisle on a Rules Committee vote as well as a House-wide rule vote. But it underscores the urgency that lawmakers on both sides feel about sending aid to foreign allies.\nThe three conservatives on the panel — Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. — all voted against the measure; an equally unusual move that's become common in the 118th Congress, where members of the House Freedom Caucus and their allies have wielded outsized influence in Republicans' thin majority by blocking procedural hurdles such as this.Democrats' support will be critical for the rule vote and potentially even final passage of the bills.\nJohnson has faced furious pushback from the right flank of his conference over most of his plan, particularly loaning $60 billion to Ukraine, which has become a politically fraught topic for much of the GOP.\nThose same foreign aid hawks have objected to some of the Israel funding being aimed at humanitarian aid in Gaza, though its inclusion was critical to winning Democratic support. In a victory for Republicans, however, it prevents any of the Israel-Gaza funding from going toward the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), a Palestinian refugee agency alleged to have ties to Hamas.\nConservative rebels also decried House GOP leaders' decision to combine the four bills into one before sending it to the Senate, arguing it amounted to the same $95 billion foreign aid package the Democrat-majority chamber passed earlier this year and which House Republicans oppose. Johnson has argued that packaging them together for the Senate would prevent them from neglecting the Israel bill at a time when the issue has divided the Democratic Party.\nEarlier this week Massie threatened he'd move to oust Johnson from the speakership if he did not step aside after having the House vote on his foreign aid plans. One GOP lawmaker who was present at the closed-door meeting where it happened told Fox News Digital on Tuesday that Johnson challenged him to do so.\nMassie is now signed onto Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to vacate resolution, which if deemed \"privileged\" by Greene would force the House to begin voting on Johnson's potential ouster within two legislative days.\nSome discussion over whether to raise the threshold needed to call a motion to vacate — currently just one member can call for it — ended with Johnson backing off of the controversial move after it enraged GOP rebels and spurred new ouster threats.\nMajority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., suggested to reporters earlier that a wide swath of rank-and-file Republicans supported the idea; but Johnson denied having such conversations earlier on Thursday when asked by Fox News Digital.\n\"Recently, many members have encouraged me to endorse a new rule to raise this threshold. While I understand the importance of that idea, any rule change requires a majority of the full House, which we do not have. We will continue to govern under the existing rules,\" Johnson said on Thursday evening.",

            "summary": "Texas Democratic Senate candidate Colin Allred has surrounded himself with campaign staffers who have shared what appear to be deeply progressive takes on current political issues — from the war in Israel and a ban on \"assault weapons\" to the abolition of federal immigration authorities.\nThe social media history of Allred's current campaign staff sheds light on whom the Texas Senate candidate has hired to help him flip the high-profile seat from red to blue in November.\nAllred, who currently represents Texas' 32nd Congressional District in the House, announced in May 2023 that he would make a run for the Senate in an attempt to unseat GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, who has represented the Lone Star State in the upper chamber since 2013.\nWhile it is unclear whether the views of campaign staff could endanger what The Austin Chronicle described as Allred's \"moderate-Dem case\" against Cruz, the Texas congressman has made clear his support for \"stand[ing] with our ally Israel.\"\nMichelle Cedeño, the digital mobilization manager for the Texas Democrat's campaign, has shown her support for Palestine and disdain for Israel in social media comments.\nShe shared another X user's post on October 11, less than a week after Hamas carried out its assault on Israel, that stated, \"You can't celebrate Indigenous Peoples' Day and say Palestinians don't have a right to their homeland.\" She also retweeted a post that urged individuals not to \"talk to cops\" and a post from Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., that claimed Israel was led by \"apartheid-in-chief [Benjamin] Netanyahu.\"\nIn February 2024, Cedeño amplified remarks made by one X user who accused Israel of committing \"genocide.\"\nCedeño, who has been tasked with reaching millions of Texas voters and has sent multiple emails to the Allred campaign's email list, shared numerous posts on social media in recent years that are seemingly anti-police and anti-ICE. Additionally, Cedeño previously made disparaging remarks about President Biden and an individual who now serves in his cabinet.\nIn a January 2021 post to her Facebook page, Cedeño celebrated a news report that stated members of the Austin City Council could use some funds diverted from its police budget to purchase two hotels to use as \"permanent supportive housing for people experiencing chronic homelessness.\"\n\"YES,\" she wrote, sharing the article with her friends.\nCedeño also shared a July 2019 then-Twitter post from United We Dream Texas that claimed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents \"are cruel\" and called for the agency to be abolished. She also shared a Sept. 2020 then-Twitter post that claimed ICE was performing \"genocide\" through acts that \"inspired the Nazi regime.\"\nAside from her remarks about political issues, Cedeño has directly targeted Biden and Pete Buttigieg, who previously ran for president and now serves as the secretary of transportation, during the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries.\nIn an Oct. 2019 post, Cedeño claimed that Biden has \"abusive habits\" and an \"over-botoxed five-head.\"\nRegarding Buttigieg, Cedeño wrote, \"F--- this dude\" in a Nov. 2019 post to social media and later expressed frustration when Biden appointed him to a cabinet position.\n\"Bro can't even take control of his police department as mayor when they murder a black man now you're going to trust him with a WHOLE CABINET POSITION,\" she wrote in a Dec. 2020 post to Facebook.\nJames Burnett — another staffer who serves as the political coordinator for Allred's Senate campaign, according to his LinkedIn profile — has made questionable remarks about Trump supporters and has expressed support for an \"assault weapons ban.\"\nIn a Sept. 2019 post to then-Twitter, Burnett suggested that Trump supporters are \"Angry White People With Guns.\" In a separate post in Aug. 2020, Burnett claimed that the same Trump supporters are \"racist.\"\n\"We said they were racist, we didn't say they weren't intelligent,\" he wrote at the time.\nBurnett has also suggested the U.S. should \"abolish the Electoral College\" and took aim at officials, including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, over immigration-related topics.\n\"Not gonna sugarcoat it, F--- you and your Wall,\" Burnett wrote in Oct. 2020 in response to a post from then-acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan. Last November, Burnett also accused Abbott of being a \"Human Trafficker\" due to his efforts to bus migrants to other parts of the U.S.\nBurnett also disagrees with Allred over the issue of whether Texas should be considered a \"non-voting state,\" writing in a November 2020 post to social media that Americans \"can no longer make the argument that Texas is a non-voting state anymore because Texas voted and we got our asses trounced.\"\nThat comment, however, stands in contrast to a comment made by Allred in a May 2023 post to social media claiming \"the truth is Texas is a non-voting state.\"\nHannah Fishman, who serves as the digital director for Allred's campaign, is another staffer who has shared hot takes online that are contrary to what millions of voters in Texas agree with.\nAmid the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue in Richmond, Virginia, Fishman wrote in a July 2020 post to then-Twitter that taxpayer dollars \"still fund groups like the sons/daughters of confederate veterans and fund salaries of abusive and racist police officers,\" adding that the \"fight is only beginning.\"\nAdditionally, Fishman has offered support for a group that contributed to bailing out alleged violent criminals by sharing a link to the Baltimore Action Legal Team (BALT) in a June 2020 post amid nationwide Black Lives Matter protests. BALT is part of the National Bail Fund Network (NBFN), whose affiliates are \"regularly paying bail/bond within the criminal legal or immigration detention systems for community members as their central action.\" NBFN is also partners with Palestine Legal, an advocacy group with some members that have reportedly defended certain terror groups.\nSimilar to the position held by Cedeño, Jaycee Weber, who serves as the digital content manager for Allred's campaign, previously shared June 2018 remarks from New York Democrat Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand calling for ICE to be abolished. Weber previously expressed her \"love\" for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., in a June 2018 tweet, just months before the self-proclaimed democratic socialist was elected to Congress.\nThe Texas district currently represented by Allred, a former NFL linebacker who later worked in President Obama's administration, includes the northeastern corner of Dallas and many of its suburbs, including Garland, Richardson, Sachse, Wylie, the Park Cities and Rowlett.\nAllred won the Democratic primary election for the Senate in the state last month, beating five other Democratic hopefuls who had hoped to clinch their party's nomination.\nAllred's campaign did not provide comment to Fox News Digital for this story.",

            "summary": "The House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning a pro-Palestinian activist chant as antisemitic on Tuesday – but 43 Democrats and one Republican voted against it.\nA House GOP-led resolution introduced by Rep. Anthony D'Esposito, R-N.Y., to formally criticize the use of the phrase \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\" passed in a 377 to 44 vote.\nAs has been the case with most issues surrounding Israel, the measure split the Democratic Party, with progressives bucking their more traditional colleagues in their criticism of the longstanding U.S. ally.\nProgressive \"Squad\" Democrats were among those to vote against it, including Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y.; Cori Bush, D-Mo., as well as House Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash.\nOne Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., voted against the measure as well. Fox News Digital reached out to his office for comment.\nThe bill is part of a list of 17 measures House Republican leaders are putting up for a vote this week aimed at affirming support for Israel and condemning Iran after the latter launched a barrage of airstrikes over the weekend.\nIt marked a dramatic escalation in Middle East tensions as the first time Tehran launched an attack on Israel from its own soil, though Israel said 99% of the rockets were intercepted.\nThe phrase \"From the river to the sea\" is a pro-Palestinian liberation phrase that has been used by Hamas and other anti-Israel actors as a call to arms against the Jewish nation.\nTlaib, the only Palestinian-American in Congress, was censured last November for her harsh rhetoric toward Israel, including her use of the phrase.\nShe got bipartisan blowback over invoking it in a social media video posted to X, but the progressive lawmaker was unrepentant.\n\"From the river to the sea is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate. My work and advocacy is always centered in justice and dignity for all people no matter faith or ethnicity,\" Tlaib said at the time.",

            "summary": "Actor John Leguizamo attacked a piñata in a fit of rage after learning Donald Trump was gaining support among Latino voters.\nAfter he mocked an ad from the Trump campaign targeting Latino voters, \"The Daily Show\" guest host expressed dismay over polls showing he was gaining ground with Latinos.\n\"I mean, clearly, Trump isn't making any effort to get Latino voters or make them a priority,\" Leguizamo scoffed. \"But the thing that hurts the most is that his lazy a-- strategy is actually working.\"\nThe comedy show played a news clip reading the results of a poll earlier this year which put Trump ahead of Biden by six points with Latino voters. Leguizamo reacted by grabbing a piñata from under his desk and punching it.\nThe comedian let out a string of curse words in Spanish aimed at Trump while attacking the piñata. After regaining his composure, Leguizamo warned Democrats were in trouble because Latino voters trusted Trump over Biden to handle their number one concern: inflation.\n\"It looks like the Democrats are in trouble. And you might be thinking, how is this possible? Donald Trump is winning Latinos? ‘Build the wall' Donald Trump? ‘Mass deportations' Donald Trump? Guy who thinks Daddy Yankee is a baseball player, Donald Trump? But the truth is, in 2024, Latino voters have something else on their minds,\" he said.\n\"That's right. For Latinos, this election is all about inflation! And that makes sense! Inflation is bad right now,\" he said before claiming that Trump had no solutions to solve the crisis.\nAnother recent poll from Axios/Ipsos shows Latinos overwhelmingly support Trump over Biden on key issues like the economy.\nThe poll found only 20% of Latinos think Biden is \"good for the U.S. economy,\" while 42% of respondents said the same about Trump. Latinos also favor Trump on immigration, crime and public safety.\nBiden received 50% support among Latino voters in a recent NY Times/Siena College survey, which is historically low for a Democrat, according to a report from The Hill. At the same time, Trump had 41% support among Latinos, which is on the higher end for a GOP candidate in recent elections.",

            "summary": "Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy blamed the House of Representatives' \"disarray\" in an appearance on \"MediaBuzz,\" Sunday, after they passed a foreign aid bill with Democrats' unique support.\nWhile referring to the current GOP infighting taking the form of attempting to oust Speaker Mike Johnson mere months following McCarthy's own ousting, the former speaker warned that what Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., started has broken the Republican majority.\nKEVIN MCCARTHY: I think they're in disarray, but it stems from those eight [Republicans] working with all the Democrats. If there's no consequence... The Gaetz eight. But they work with all the Democrats to decide who could be speaker; and since then, what has transpired? So the conference is broken because they never dealt with those eight, and until they do, it would stay broken. But to Marjorie [Taylor Greene's] point is, Marjorie didn't do what Matt Gaetz did. She didn't make this privilege. She's making it an issue for a debate. Now, I think they should keep it internal. They should have their discussion. Look, being speaker is not easy. Otherwise, maybe I'd still be there.\n…\nWhat Matt Gaetz did has broken the Republican majority. He's now created \"Lord of the Flies.\" Ask anybody inside our conference; they actually know it.\nTensions flared in the House of Representatives on Thursday when a group of conservatives confronted Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., over his foreign aid plan, leading to another Republican trading barbs with the group of rebels.\nA group of lawmakers that included Reps. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.; Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.; Tim Burchett, R-Tenn.; and others could be seen huddled with Johnson on the House floor after morning votes.\nThe discussion appeared to be interrupted a short while later when Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., confronted the group, and wound up in a particularly heated back-and-forth with Gaetz. Van Orden later told Fox News Digital that he called Gaetz \"tubby\" and dared the GOP rebels to trigger a vote for Johnson's ouster — a threat he's facing from Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who were not in the group.",

            "excerpt": "Missouri legislators voted Thursday in favor of a bill to expand private school scholarships. If enacted, it would allow up to $6,375 in spending per child.",
            "summary": "Missouri lawmakers on Thursday passed a bill to expand private school scholarships statewide, an effort made possible by extensive compromises including a commitment to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more on public schools.\nThe GOP-led House voted with a bare-minimum margin of 82-69 to send the measure to Republican Gov. Mike Parson. If signed, it would offer up to $6,375 per child for expenses including tuition, textbooks, tutoring, transportation, extracurriculars and summer school.\nThe bill's passage is a victory for advocates who have struggled for years to expand access to charter schools, virtual schools and private schools in Missouri. Worries about taking away resources from traditional kindergarten-12th grade public schools have been bipartisan.\nThe heart of the legislation is the expansion of Missouri Empowerment Scholarships Accounts, which low-income families can draw from. The money will come from private donors, who in return get tax credits.\n\"This is a victory for parents who want more control over their children's education and for students who will now have more avenues to achieve their full potential,\" Republican Rep. Phil Christofanelli said in a statement.\nThe current scholarship program limits recipients to residents of the state's largest cities and to families who make less than 200% of the federal poverty level, which works out to $62,400 a year for a family of four.\nThe bill passed Thursday would raise the cap to 300%, or $93,600 for a family of four. Public school students who need extra help through individualized education plans would get some additional scholarship money under the new law.\nThe legislation increases the cap on tax credits for the private donations from $50 million to $75 million per year, to help pay for a possible influx of students.\nTo gain support from lawmakers focused on helping traditional public schools, senators included money to raise minimum teacher salaries to $40,000 a year and adjusted the state's formula for funding public schools, a change expected to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars more to public education over time.\nSeveral House Democrats cautioned that the state might not have enough revenue in future years to provide the massive influx in funding to public schools that the bill commits to.\n\"While the voucher expansion is essentially guaranteed, the promises to public schools depend on additional funding the state isn't expected to have and future lawmakers aren't required to provide,\" House Democratic Minority Leader Crystal Quade said in a statement.\nAnother provision would allow charter schools in Boone County, where Senate President Pro Tem Caleb Rowden lives. The bill also would require public votes to approve a school district's switch to four-day school weeks and incentivize schools that maintain five-day weeks.\nThis issue supporters call \"school choice\" has divided lawmakers beyond typical Republican-Democrat lines in Missouri.\nGOP legislators from rural districts have opposed allowing charter schools in their areas for years, fearing they could draw students away from traditional public schools seen as the backbone of their communities. Some Democrats, meanwhile, want students in underperforming urban schools to have more options.\nAnd some conservatives lobbied against more regulations for homeschoolers and private schools. One activist handed out \"dog poop\" brownies before the vote, suggesting that unwanted provisions could ruin what might otherwise be a nice treat.",

            "summary": "The House of Representatives has approved sending $60 billion to Ukraine for its defense against Russia's invasion, an issue that has roiled Speaker Mike Johnson's already perilously slim majority.\nMore Democrats voted in favor of the aid bill than Republicans.\nMany House Democrats waved small Ukrainian flags on the floor during the aid vote, until the speaker told them they were out of decorum. The House erupted in cheers as the gavel came down.\nHouse lawmakers are in session on a rare Saturday working to pass Johnson's foreign aid plan, which also includes aid bills for Israel and the Indo-Pacific, as well as a bill with other national security measures.\nThe close margins within the GOP alone show what a divisive topic Ukraine funding has become for the right.\nA growing number of fiscal conservatives have been skeptical about the U.S.'s continued financial involvement with Ukraine, while others have raised questions about corruption within Kyiv's government.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's proposal to strip all funding related to Ukraine from the Ukraine funding bill predictably failed Saturday in a 71 to 351 vote.\nMore traditional Republicans and national security hawks warn that Ukraine's victory is critical to preventing a wider conflict between NATO and Russia, warning that its President Vladimir Putin is rapidly forming a second \"axis of evil\" with Iran and China.\nJohnson, who like his conservative colleagues was skeptical of Ukraine aid before becoming speaker, gave a sober warning earlier this week. \"I really do believe the intel and the briefings that we've gotten that I believe [Chinese President Xi Jinpimg] and Vladimir Putin and Iran really are an axis of evil. And I think they're in coordination on this. I think that Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed. I think he might go to the Balkans next. I think he might have a showdown with Poland or one of our NATO allies,\" he told reporters. \"To put it bluntly, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,\" he said.\nBut his support for foreign aid, particularly Ukraine, is also threatening to cut short his tenure as House speaker. Greene filed a resolution for a House-wide vote to oust Johnson, known as a motion to vacate, last month in protest of his work with Democrats on government spending and foreign aid.\nTwo more House Republicans — Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., formally backed her resolution this week.\n\"[R]ather than spending the resources to secure our southern border and combating the invasion of 11 million illegals and despite repeated promises there would be no additional money going to Ukraine without first securing our border, the United States House of Representatives, under the direction of the Speaker, is on the verge of sending another $61 billion to further draw America into an endless and purposeless war in Ukraine,\" Gosar said in a statement on Friday. \"I have added my name in support of the motion to vacate the Speaker. Our border cannot be an afterthought.\"\nHouse leaders do not have to put Greene's resolution up for a vote unless she files it as \"privileged,\" at which point it's required that lawmakers act on it within two legislative days.\nSeveral Democrats, however, have indicated that they were open to helping save Johnson's job if he put the Ukraine aid bill on the House floor.\nThe bill with roughly $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific overwhelmingly passed 385 to 34 earlier on Saturday.",

            "summary": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The Swedish parliament passed a law Wednesday lowering the age required for people to legally change their gender from 18 to 16. Those under 18 still need approval from a guardian, a doctor and the National Board of Health and Welfare.\nNo longer required is a gender dysphoria diagnosis, defined by medical professionals as psychological distress experienced by those whose gender expression does not match their gender identity.\nSweden joins a number of countries with similar laws including Denmark, Norway, Finland and Spain.\nThe vote in Sweden passed 234-94 with 21 lawmakers absent, following a debate that lasted for nearly six hours.\nSweden Democrats, the populist party with far-right roots that supports the government in parliament but is not part of the government, opposed the law.\nJimmie Akesson, leader of the Sweden Democrats, told reporters it was \"deplorable that a proposal that clearly lacks the support of the population is so lightly voted through.\"\nBut Johan Hultberg with the Moderates of Sweden's conservative prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, called the outcome \"gratifying.\" Hultberg called it \"a cautious but important reform for a vulnerable group. I'm glad we're done with it.\"\nKristersson's center-right coalition had been split on the issue, with the Moderates and the Liberals largely supporting the law while the small Christian Democrats were against it.\nPeter Sidlund Ponkala, chairman of the Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Intersex Rights, known by its Swedish acronym RFSL, called the law's passage \"a step in the right direction\" and \"a recognition for everyone who has been waiting for decades for a new law.\"\nElias Fjellander, chairman of the organization's youth branch, said it would make life better for its members. \"Going forward, we are pushing to strengthen gender-affirming care, to introduce a third legal gender and to ban conversion attempts,\" Fjellander said in a statement.\nLast Friday, German lawmakers approved similar legislation, making it easier for transgender, intersex and nonbinary people to change their name and gender in official records directly at registry offices.\nIn the U.K., the Scottish parliament in 2022 passed a bill allowing people aged 16 or older to change their gender designation on identity documents by self-declaration. It was vetoed by the British government, a decision that Scotland's highest civil court upheld in December. The legislation set Scotland apart from the rest of the U.K., where the minimum age is 18 and a medical diagnosis is required.",

            "summary": "DEARBORN, Mich. — President Biden is in danger of becoming a one-term \"example\" for other Democrats, according to a leader of the movement to desert the incumbent president at the polls due to his handling of the conflict in the Middle East.\n\"Biden is the example,\" Lexis Zeidan, one of the lead organizers and the spokesperson for Listen to Michigan, told Fox News Digital. \"Telling the Democratic Party, putting them on notice that even for down ballot elections, for those congresspeople that are not pro-Palestinian and calling for ceasefires, their positions are at stake.\"\nThe comments come as Dearborn, a suburb of Detroit, has become a key center of resistance to Biden's bid for re-election. During last month's Michigan primary, more than 100,000 voters marked \"uncommitted\" on their ballots instead of supporting Biden as the Democratic nominee, a number Zeidan said far exceeded her organization's expectations.\n\"We went into the primaries expecting or aiming to get 10,000 uncommitted votes, which was Trump's margin of victory in 2016,\" Zeidan said. \"And we ended up with over 101,000 uncommitted votes, where we also landed two delegates in district 12, in district six who will be headed to the national convention.\"\nThe Biden campaign did not reply to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.\nThe resistance to Biden's re-election stems mainly from the president's handling of Israel's war in Gaza, a response to the Oct. 7 attack on the Jewish State by Hamas, a terrorist group that enjoys financial and material support from Iran.\nHowever, many activists in Dearborn, a city with the highest per capita Muslim population in the country, have been vocal opponents of Israeli tactics since the beginning of the war.\nZeidan, who is now serving as the spokesperson for the national \"Uncommitted Movement,\" also pins a lot of the blame for those tactics on Biden, arguing that the president has been allowed to \"take our tax dollars to fund a genocide.\"\n\"For too long you've had people being presented with the option of the lesser of two evils. I think what you're seeing is a wave of young voters and diverse groups of voters and anti-war voters that are saying 'we're no longer settling for this option[.]'\"\nThe Michigan-based activist argued that Biden had the \"power to pick up the phone at the very onset\" of Israel's campaign to \"ensure that there was a permanent ceasefire to save lives on both sides.\"\n\"Instead, he continued to provide munitions and aid to a very right-wing fascist government that was literally committing war crimes,\" Zeidan said.\nZeidan said that the movement is spreading from Dearborn to other key swing states such as Wisconsin, battlegrounds that promise to have an outsized role in determining the fate of this year's election.\nThose involved in the movement know that success could ultimately lead to a victory for former President Trump, an outcome Zeidan said will not stop her activism.\n\"For too long you've had people being presented with the option of the lesser of two evils,\" Zeidan said. \"I think what you're seeing is a wave of young voters and diverse groups of voters and anti-war voters that are saying ‘we're no longer settling for this option, the lesser of two evils, and that we are going to be courageous, and we're going to be brave, and we're going to tell you that you cannot weaponize fear against our belief that we deserve to live in a world where every single person gets to experience self-determination and freedom.'\"\nZeidan said that message is especially aimed at the Democratic Party, which she said she believes will not be able to win elections simply by claiming to be better than the alternative.\n\"We no longer are going to spend time, money, effort, organizing behind elected officials or presidents who don't believe in this anti-war, pro-peace, pro-Palestinian view,\" Zeidan said.",

            "excerpt": "In a two-way ballot test in Georgia, former President Trump maintains a slim majority while President Biden sees a 2-point improvement since January",
            "summary": "In a two-way ballot test in the Peach State, former President Trump maintains a slim majority, while President Biden sees a 2-point improvement since January, according to the latest Fox News Poll of Georgia registered voters released Thursday.\nTrump holds steady with 51% support in the rematch (same as in January), while 45% of voters back Biden (up from 43%). That 6-point difference is just inside the poll's margin of error.\nBiden's movement can be attributed to modest gains among Black voters (76% now vs. 71% in January) and voters under age 35 (49% vs. 43%), as well as a notable shift among the small subgroup of independents. In January, Trump had the advantage by 20 points (51% to 31% Biden), while the two presumptive candidates are tied today (42% each).\nTrump's coalition has held relatively steady, with some of his best groups being White evangelical Christians (83%), White men without a degree (75%), rural voters (67%), and voters ages 65 and over (58%).\n\"Trump stalled at 49% in 2020 and GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker was at 48-49% in 2022,\" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican Daron Shaw. \"If Georgia voters have soured on Democrats even a little bit, the state is a major pickup opportunity for Trump.\"\nIn a hypothetical five-way race, Trump has a 7-point lead over Biden (46% to 39%), with third-party candidates Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (7%), Cornel West (2%), and Jill Stein (1%) in single digits. This is about where the race stood in January.\n\"Georgia may be the weakest state from Biden's 2020 coalition,\" says Shaw. \"On the plus side, if he can rally African Americans and younger voters, he might be able to recreate his 2020 victory. On the minus side, he might have maxed out that vote in 2020 and it's unclear how compelling his message is to these voters in 2024. I'm in the minority on this point, but it seems North Carolina might be a more promising target this time around.\"\nOn specific issues, Georgia continues to favor Trump, as he is seen as better able to handle — mostly by double-digits — five out of seven issues.\nNotably, Trump has the advantage on the two issues that have been dominating the campaign: immigration (Trump preferred by 23 points) and the economy (+22). He is also favored on foreign policy (+15) and energy policy (+8).\nOn other issues, neither candidate has a significant advantage: Trump has the edge on abortion (+2), whereas Biden is narrowly ahead on health care (+2) and election integrity (+3).\nForty-four percent of voters feel they are falling behind financially vs. 41% who are holding steady and 15% who are getting ahead. Voters saying they are falling behind go for Trump by 54 points, while those getting ahead/holding steady go for Biden by 31 points.\nVoters view Trump more favorably than Biden and see the former president as more mentally fit for the job than the incumbent.\nBy a 2-point margin, Georgians view Trump favorably (50% favorable vs. 48% unfavorable), a reversal from July 2022 when he was viewed negatively by 11 points (43% vs. 54%). They also see Trump as having the mental soundness to serve effectively as president (54% has mental soundness vs. 44% does not).\nBiden's favorable rating is underwater by 15 points (42% favorable vs. 57% unfavorable), and more say he lacks the mental soundness to serve by 22 points (38% mentally sound vs. 60% not).\nBiden's job approval rating is also upside down: 42% approve vs. 58% disapprove, which is about where it was in January.\nA few more things…\n— Views on Kennedy are split, with 39% rating him favorably, 39% unfavorably, and 22% unable to rate him. Democrats are more likely to view him negatively (31% favorable, 46% unfavorable), while Republicans are the opposite (45% favorable, 36% unfavorable). Independents are somewhat split (38% favorable, 33% unfavorable).\n— By a 6-point margin, Georgia voters think the Biden administration is too supportive of the Palestinians (27%) rather than too supportive of the Israelis (21%) in the war in the Middle East. Still, 4 in 10 think Biden's support of each is about right (39%). Democrats are almost 7 times more likely than Republicans to think there's too much support for the Israelis, while Republicans are 4 times more likely to think there's too much support for the Palestinians.\n— In a hypothetical U.S. House race, Georgians prefer the Republican candidate by 8 points (50% to 42% for the Democrat).\nConducted April 11-16 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,128 Georgia registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (150) and cellphones (699) or completed the survey online after receiving a text message (279). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of ± 3 percentage points. When necessary, weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics are representative of the registered voter population.",

Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, vetoed bills on Tuesday that would have codified biological sex definitions and permitted teachers in public schools to read or have a copy of the Ten Commandments in their classrooms.\nThe move drew criticism from the state Senate Republican caucus, who said Hobbs is \"abandoning God\" and that laws \"should be based in objective reality and uniform for all Arizonans.\"\n\"Instead of helping these confused boys and men, Democrats are only fueling the disfunction by pretending biological sex doesn't matter,\" Republican Senate president Warren Petersen said in a statement. \"Our daughters, granddaughters, nieces, and neighbors are growing up in a dangerous time where they are living with an increased risk of being victimized in public bathrooms, showers, and locker rooms because Democrats are now welcoming biological males into what used to be traditionally safe, single-sex spaces.\"\nSB 1628, called the \"Arizona Women's Bill of Rights,\" would have made the definition of biological sexes, either male or female only, \"objective and fixed.\" It would exclude gender identity \"or any other term that is intended to convey a person's subjective sense of self and may not be used as a synonym or substitute for the term sex.\"\nIt would also have maintained single-sex spaces \"to ensure girls' and women's protection and privacy in those spaces, while not changing current law or creating new restrictions on anyone's legal rights,\" according to the Republican Caucus.\n\"As I have said time and again, I will not sign legislation that attacks Arizonans,\" Hobbs said in a letter explaining her veto.\nAnother bill in the Arizona state senate, SB 1151, would have amended the state law to permit educators or administrators in any school to read or post in any school building copies or excerpts of the Ten Commandments.\nHobbs wrote in her veto letter that she had \"serious concerns\" about the constitutionality of the bill and called it \"unnecessary.\"\n\"I'm appalled the state's top elected official is abandoning God and the very foundation our country was built upon by not allowing teachers to expose their students to the morals and ethics outlined in the Ten Commandments,\" Sen. Anthony Kern, one of the bill's sponsors, said in a statement. \"When children are exposed to good, noble, honest, and righteous ideas, they are more prone to being better human beings with sound character, able to navigate life's problems with grace, and have a greater chance of treating each other with respect and dignity throughout life.\"\nDuring Hobbs' term as governor so far, she has reaffirmed her support for LGBTQ+ issues.

Weber, challenges Huntington Beach's voter ID law, Measure A, which amends the city's charter to allow voter ID requirements by 2026.\nIn their lawsuit, Bonta and Weber argued that the city's voter ID law \"unlawfully conflicts and is preempted by state law.\"\n\"The right to freely cast your vote is the foundation of our democracy and Huntington Beach's voter ID policy flies in the face of this principle,\" Bonta said in a statement.\nHe argued that state elections already contain \"robust voter ID requirements with strong protections to prevent voter fraud.\" He said the new requirements would disproportionately burden \"low-income voters, voters of color, young or elderly voters, and people with disabilities.\"\nThe City Council placed the voter ID measure on the March ballot after taking a series of hotly contested decisions on topics ranging from flag flying to the removal of books from the public library's children's section over concerns about the appropriateness of materials. The moves were initiated by a politically conservative council majority, which took office in 2022, and have drawn scores of residents on all sides of issues to city meetings.\nThe measure — which would let the city require voter identification, increase in-person voting sites and monitor ballot drop boxes in local elections — won at the polls in March with 53%, county election data shows.\nCity Attorney Michael Gates said the amendment approved by voters last month is \"not only permissible\" but backed by the state constitution.\n\"The people of Huntington Beach have made their voices clear on this issue and the people's decision on the March 5th ballot measures for election integrity is final,\" Gates said in a statement \"To that end, the City will vigorously uphold and defend the will of the people.\"\nBonta, a Democrat, said it was not immediately clear how the measure would be implemented. In California, voters can cast ballots in person and also by returning ballots to drop boxes or by mail.\nFox News Digital has reached out to Bonta's office and the Orange County Registrar of Voters for additional comment.\nHuntington Beach, dubbed \"Surf City USA\" and known for its scenic shoreline, has a history of sparring with state officials over the measures it can take under its city charter on topics ranging from immigration to housing.\nWhile Democrats outnumber Republicans in Orange County, the GOP is dominant in Huntington Beach with nearly 54,000 registered voters versus 41,000 Democrats, county data shows.",

The Senator, who is seeking a third term, received donations from individuals in all 56 counties in Montana.\n\"This record-breaking grassroots support shows that Montanans are fired up to send the seven-fingered dirt farmer back to the U.S. Senate,\" Shelbi Dantic, Montanans for Tester campaign manager, said in a press release shared with Fox News Digital. \"Every day, Montanans learn more about Tim Sheehy: that he's a multimillionaire transplant from out-of-state, that he wants to transfer our public lands and shutter our rural hospitals, and that he has repeatedly lied to them about his story and who he is. Montanans know they can't trust Sheehy, and we're so grateful for the enormous enthusiasm we're seeing from our neighbors who are excited to vote for Jon Tester in November.\"\nDemocrats have put an emphasis on the Montana Senate race as they attempt to hold onto their Senate majority in 2024, with a group launched by Sen. Chuck Schumer's Senate Majority PAC recently spending millions in ads across the Big Sky State targeting Sheehy.\nAdditionally, an article was recently published by the Washington Post that heavily quoted Democrat-tied experts and casted doubt on whether the Navy SEAL actually received a bullet wound in Afghanistan.\nSheehy recently revealed that a bullet in his arm, which in 2015 he said was a result of an accidental self-inflicted gun shot, was actually received while serving in Afghanistan in 2012. The Senate candidate told the Washington Post that he never reported it to his superiors due to fear of an investigation, prompting the outlet to interview several individuals and question the validity of his story.\nThe Washington Post used Air Force attorney Rachel VanLandingham, who called Sheehy a \"deeply flawed hero whose fitness for office is highly questionable\" in an April 6 post on X, as a reference to question the Republican candidate's story.\nThe outlet also reported that trauma surgeon Joseph V. Sakran, a vocal anti-Trump activist and former Democrat staffer who donated over $21,000 to Democrats, said \"it is not possible to tell what type of weapon it came from nor the age of the wound.\"\nSheehy described the report as a \"smear piece,\" but his team said they \"aren't shocked\" as he ramps up his Senate campaign.\n\"We aren't shocked the Washington Post chose to cite known Democrats for their smear piece against decorated combat veteran Tim Sheehy,\" a Sheehy for Montana spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement.",

            "summary": "Harvard University is a mess and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, is the man who can save the once-prestigious institution and help it \"recalibrate from far-left orthodoxy,\" according to Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa.\nDaniel Rosen, who graduated Harvard in 1996, penned a Washington Post opinion piece last week which details recent issues at the school and called for the Utah senator – and former Massachusetts governor – to clean it up. Fetterman, a Harvard alumnus who has repeatedly irked his Democratic colleagues with his strong support for Israel, co-signed the suggestion.\n\"Harvard University remains in an almighty mess after months of turmoil over hate speech. There is a way to fix this: appoint former Massachusetts governor and retiring U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) university president,\" Rosen wrote.\nFetterman posted the piece on X and wrote, \"As an alumnus of Harvard, and after this mad season of antisemitism at Columbia, I co-sign. This former Governor of Massachusetts doesn't need a paycheck, but Harvard and its academic peers need to recalibrate from far-left orthodoxy.\"\nRosen said he was a lifelong Democrat who didn't vote for Romney when he ran for president, but made the suggestion \"in the sincere and robust hope that he is someone who can navigate the university through painful but necessary reform and drive back the antisemitism that is tarnishing the institution's credibility.\n\"As the grandson of Holocaust survivors and president of the American Jewish Congress, I find it devastating that Harvard has failed to vigorously address the unchecked antisemitism on campus,\" he wrote.\nRosen wrote that anyone who studied at Harvard can attest it is \"not an antisemitic institution\" despite recent events that indicate otherwise.\n\"I never for a moment felt oppressed or marginalized as a student on the Harvard campus. But to my dismay, recent years have seen an unconscionable spike in — and even worse, an administrative tolerance of — hate speech directed at Jews, including targeting Jewish students. The university's response has thus far been ramshackle and unproductive, to put it mildly,\" Rosen wrote.\nRosen reminded readers of \"the disastrous congressional testimony of then-President Claudine Gay,\" in which she famously failed to say that calls for intifada or the genocide of Jews on campus violated Harvard's code of conduct or policy against bullying and harassment.\nAfter her congressional testimony, Gay issued an apology and the university's board initially decided to stick by her despite widespread calls from donors and members of Congress for her ouster. However, she stepped down shortly afterward after being hit with significant plagiarism allegations.\n\"The university president must be the flag-bearer of our values. There is no doubt that there are other Americans of similar standing and stature, but Romney's unique bridge-building character is precisely what Harvard needs in an age of toxic polarization,\" Rosen wrote, praising him for working with Democrats on issues like \"gun safety reform\" and voting to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.\nRomney, who has stood out among Senate Republicans with his opposition to former President Trump, has said he will not seek re-election in the Senate in 2024. He voted to convict Trump in both his impeachment trials, the only Republican to do so, and has not supported him in any of his White House bids.\nBuoyed in part by his successful overseeing of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Romney served one term as Massachusetts governor from 2003 to 2007. He later made a failed bid for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination. He won the Republican nomination in 2012 – the last candidate other than Trump to do so – and lost the general election to President Obama.",

            "summary": "The oft-repeated claim by Republican politicians, \"Every state is a border state,\" appears to be resonating with voters across the country and notably in states that are thousands of miles away from the U.S. southern border.\n\"Every state became a border state when President Biden took office and immediately reversed commonsense policies that protected our borders,\" Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, told Fox News Digital in a statement.\nImmigration surpassed all other issues in a poll by Gallup in February, as more Americans agreed it was \"the most important problem facing this country today.\" The number of respondents to say so jumped eight points from January, to 28%. The previous issue cited as most important by Americans was \"government,\" followed by immigration, inflation and the economy in general. While immigration concerns managed to climb, government, inflation and economic worries remained relatively steady.\nThe issue ranked as the most important for the first time since 2019, prior to President Biden taking office and during former President Trump's administration. This was the year Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border following congressional refusal to grant him requested funds for border wall construction.\n\"The federal government's inaction at our nation's borders has led to a crisis with direct impacts upon all fifty states,\" New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu told Fox News Digital in a statement.\nIn the state, which is more than 2,000 miles from the U.S. southern border, 83% of residents said they consider illegal immigration a serious issue for the country. Among those residents, 58% said it is \"very serious,\" according to a March University of New Hampshire Survey Center (UNHSC) poll.\nAndrew Smith, director of the UNHSC, noted that the percentage of those who agree that illegal immigration is a \"very serious\" issue nationally has remained steady for more than a decade.\nJulie Kirchner, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), told Fox News Digital in a statement, \"Americans are not only seeing total chaos at the borders, where foreign nationals are literally tearing down barriers and assaulting border agents, they are witnessing first-hand how the crisis impacts every aspect of society.\"\nAt the same time, the March polling revealed that support for the construction of a border wall has surged since 2017, when opposition among New Hampshire residents was at more than half. Now, 52% in the state are in favor of the border wall, while 39% are against it.\n\"Every state, including New Hampshire, has experienced firsthand the economic and emotional toll associated with the federal government's failed response,\" said Sununu.\nReynolds claimed, \"It's clear to Iowans, and the American people, that the only way this chaos and crisis at the border can be fixed is at the ballot box,\" crediting Biden with the widespread effects of illegal immigration.\nDemocratic strategist Eric Koch pushed back on the idea the surging concern over immigration is Biden's fault, however. He noted that Republicans and Democrats in the Senate had been negotiating a border package \"that President Biden said he would have signed.\" The deal was ultimately sunk after former President Trump came out against it and Republican lawmakers followed suit.\n\"Trump and Republicans don't actually want to solve problems and walking away from the bipartisan border deal only confirms that,\" Koch added.\nA White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement, \"The Administration spent months negotiating in good faith to deliver the toughest and fairest bipartisan border security bill in decades because we need Congress to make significant policy reforms and to provide additional funding to secure our border and fix our broken immigration system.\"\nThe statement accused Republicans of placing \"partisan politics ahead of our national security\" in rejecting the border deal.\n\"Even without significant action from Congress, DHS is maximizing its enforcement operations,\" the spokesperson said.\nIn South Carolina's recent Republican presidential primary, 37% of voters pointed to immigration as the issue that was of the most significance to them ahead of casting their vote, according to a Reuters exit poll.\nThe economy came in second at 33% in the state, which is similarly more than 1,000 miles from the southern border.\n\"Every state is a border state because the Biden administration policies are to allow hundreds of thousands of aliens to illegally enter the United States and then be transported by federally funded NGO's to wherever they choose,\" said James Massa, CEO of NumbersUSA.\n\"A reason those non-border state voters are so focused on this is because of the right-wing media obsession with the issue,\" claimed Democratic strategist Kaivan Shroff, who chalked some of the concern up to a tactic to rally the Republican base.\n\"The irony here is Biden and Democrats have put forth a bipartisan border deal that would address many of the cited concerns Republicans have been focused on, and the deal was killed because of Trump,\" he added, echoing both the White House and fellow strategist Koch.\nAs Massa pointed out, non-governmental organizations are involved in the transportation of illegal immigrants to various locations within the U.S., and many of these NGOs also receive federal reimbursement and advance payments from the Department of Homeland Security for providing shelter or other eligible services to migrants released by DHS.\n\"The border crisis is funded with taxpayer dollars, regardless of state,\" he claimed.\nHe further said that illegal immigrants are choosing to travel further into the U.S. once being paroled by DHS, opting to settle in states \"that have sanctuary policies and/or benefit programs.\"\nIllegal immigrants have also been transported by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's administration to locations that have touted \"sanctuary\" policies for illegal immigrants, which some have pointed to as a trigger for concerns about the border across the country.\n\"Since launching the border transportation mission in April 2022, Texas has transported over 112,000 migrants to self-declared sanctuary cities to provide much-needed relief to our overrun and overwhelmed border communities as the Biden administration leaves thousands of migrants in Texas border towns,\" said Renae Eze, Abbott spokesperson.\nRepublican strategist Doug Heye noted that \"complaints from Democratic politicians that they can't handle this crisis on their own\" lend some credence to the claim that every state is now effectively a border state.\nLeaders of cities such as Chicago and New York, among others, have been overwhelmed by the illegal immigrants pouring in, prompting them to request assistance from Biden and the White House and plead with Abbott to halt his busing program.\n\"The sheer hypocrisy of these Democrat mayors knows no bounds, going to extreme lengths to avoid fulfilling their self-declared sanctuary city promises, yet they remain silent as President Biden transports migrants all around the country and oftentimes in the cover of night,\" added Eze.\nIowa GOP strategist David Kochel suggested the \"squealing of [Democratic] mayors … is definitely related to the busing.\"",

            "summary": "DEARBORN, Mich. — The movement to deny President Biden a second term that gained traction in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn has plans to continue a national campaign to target swing states in the general election.\n\"We've mobilized our infrastructure that we've been able to build as a grassroots movement in Michigan to support other key states,\" Lexis Zeidan, one of the lead organizers and the spokesperson for Listen to Michigan, told Fox News Digital.\nSome of those states, according to Zeidan, are key battlegrounds such as Wisconsin and Minnesota, which, along with Michigan figure to play a critical role in this year's election.\nThe anti-Biden movement stems from the president's support of Israel during its war in Gaza, a monthslong campaign in response to the Oct. 7 attack on the Jewish State by Iran-backed Hamas.\nBut critics in Dearborn, which has the highest per capita Muslim population in the U.S., have accused Biden of supporting what they call a \"genocide\" in Gaza, leading to a campaign to punish the president at the polls in 2024.\nThat campaign gained traction and national attention in Michigan, where during the state's Democratic primary, groups such as Listen to Michigan led over 100,000 voters to mark \"uncommitted\" on their ballots as a protest against Biden's re-election bid.\n\"We went into the primaries expecting or aiming to get 10,000 uncommitted votes, which was Trump's margin of victory in 2016,\" Zeidan said. \"And we ended up with over 101,000 uncommitted votes, where we also landed two delegates in District 12, in District 6, who will be headed to the national convention.\"\nThat success carried over into Wisconsin, Zeidan argued, where more than 48,000 voters marked \"Uninstructed\" in the Democratic primary instead of supporting the incumbent presumptive nominee.\nSamraa Luqman, who worked as the Abandon Biden co-chair in Michigan, told Fox News Digital that their organization has always had designs on a national campaign targeting \"all swing states.\"\n\"Those people below 30 are abandoning Biden, they're so heavily against this war. It's a generational thing, and I am talking nationally now, that's a national pattern.\"\nWhile the Abandon Biden movement garnered the most attention in Dearborn ahead of Michigan's primary, Luqman explained that the organization was actually formed in Minnesota. From there, organizers set their sights on targeting a \"swing state strategy for the general election to ensure Biden's loss.\"\nRonald Stockton, a professor emeritus at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, told Fox News Digital that the movement gaining traction out of Michigan has the potential to be a major problem for Biden's re-election bid, arguing that the president has a \"real chance\" to lose states such as Michigan.\nStockton noted that while much attention has been given to the concerns of Muslim voters in Dearborn, the movement has the potential to spread \"nationally,\" thanks to the support campaigns such as Abandon Biden and Listen to Michigan enjoy among younger voters across the demographic spectrum.\n\"Those people below 30 are abandoning Biden, they're so heavily against this war,\" Stockton said. \"It's a generational thing, and I am talking nationally now, that's a national pattern.\"\nThat trend could even extend to states outside of what are traditionally thought of as swing states, Zeidman said, pointing out that the Listen to Michigan campaign has also spread to blue havens such as Washington. Meanwhile, a Listen to Maryland spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the campaign there is now mobilizing voters to select \"uncommitted\" in that state's Democratic primary.\nBoth Luqman and Zeidan argued that their respective movements should also be seen as a message to Democrats across the country, warning them to change their stance on support of Israel's war or face the consequences at the ballot box.\n\"The grassroots movement we've built in the way that people have felt inspired and re-engaged in being politically active, we felt it was incumbent upon us as an organization to keep that growing,\" Zeidan said. \"And so now you've seen is we have exceeded goals across the state … and our next stage of the game is to get all our delegates together to continue to take our anti-war, pro peace, pro-Palestinian narrative to the convention in August.\"\n\"The President is working tirelessly to end the violence and bring about a just, lasting peace in the Middle East,\" a Biden campaign spokesperson responded to Fox News Digital's request for comment on the Abandon Biden and Vote Uncommitted campaigns.",

Trump also weighed in last month that Merchan's daughter had represented Democratic politicians such as Vice President Kamala Harris and Rep. Adam Schiff.\n\"Judge Juan Merchan, who is suffering from an acute case of Trump Derangement Syndrome (whose daughter represents Crooked Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Adam ‘Shifty' Schiff, and other Radical Liberals, has just posted a picture of me behind bars, her obvious goal, and makes it completely impossible for me to get a fair trial) has now issued another illegal, un-American, unConstitutional ‘order,' as he continues to try and take away my Rights,\" Trump posted on Truth Social last month after he was given a gag order limiting what he could publicly say about the case.\nTrump's legal team had also called on Merchan last year to recuse himself, pointing to his daughter's work and previous small donations Merchan made to Democrat causes for the 2020 election. The judge also denied that request for recusal, citing that a judicial ethics advisory committee had determined his daughter's interests would not impact his ability to fairly oversee the case.\nTrump's hush money trial kicked off Monday morning, with the former president seen leaving Trump Tower before heading to the Manhattan Criminal Court, where he slammed the case as \"political persecution.\"\n\"Nothing like this has ever happened before,\" he said in Lower Manhattan. \"This is political persecution. ... It's a case that should have never been brought.\"\n\"This is an assault on America and that's why I'm very proud to be here,\" Trump added. \"This is really an attack on a political opponent.\"\nTrump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The trial focuses on payments made by Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to former pornographic actor Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. The $130,000 payment was to allegedly quiet her claims of an alleged extramarital affair she had with Trump in 2006.\nTrump has denied the affair and pleaded not guilty to the 34 charges against him.\nProsecutors say that the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen and falsely recorded the payments as legal expenses. Falsifying business records is a misdemeanor, and prosecutors are working to prove that Trump falsified records with an intent to commit or conceal a second crime, which is a felony.\nThe case is anticipated to last at least six weeks, with jury selection alone anticipated to last at least a week.",

            "excerpt": "HBO's Bill Maher took aim at anti-Israel protesters, predicting they'll have a major presence at the upcoming DNC convention in Chicago, mirroring the infamous 1968 riots.",
            "summary": "\"Real Time\" host Bill Maher erupted on anti-Israel protesters, calling them \"huge a--holes\" as their rhetoric and demonstrations continue escalating.\n\"We started out with this with 'Okay, we're for Hamas.' That was the beginning of it and a lot of people were unapologetic about that,\" Maher said during a panel discussion Friday night. \"Then it went to, you know, the kids, they dug up some of Bin Laden's old books. And they were like, 'Oh, this dude. He's got some good things to say. He hates America too. Because you know… everybody knows we're the worst country ever.' I mean, okay. Now we're at the place where they're chanting some places ‘Death to America.' And now, we're for the Houthis. Now with the Iran attack, they're for Hezbollah! Do they know what goes on in Iran?\"\nHe then turned to his panelist, liberal historian Jon Meacham.\n\"Jon, you're a historian. Could you please tell these kids they're being huge a--holes?\" Maher asked Meacham.\nMeacham argued that there's a \"false equivalency\" between the \"extreme of the right\" and the left-wing protesters against Israel.\n\"But it's not winning any votes!\" Maher exclaimed. \"Or it's not convincing anybody, it's not engaging-\"\n\"What do you want them to do?\" Meacham countered.\n\"I want to win an election,\" Maher fired back, later saying \"I think you have to address the part that they're not getting, they're not seeing. And that doesn't happen by, you know, academically, saying, ‘Well, you know, according to the Constitution.' They want you to address this kind of stuff. And I think it begins with admitting yes, some of it is crazy. Some of it just strikes me as crazy too. And it is counterproductive. And I don't like it when I see college kids who don't understand anything about history and somehow now the Jews or the Nazis?!? I know kids love to switch things up.\"\nPBS NewsHour correspondent Jane Ferguson chimed in by defending the \"peaceful\" anti-Israel protesters at Columbia University, many of whom were arrested.\n\"We have to have a conversation about free speech, you know, being something that should be a bipartisan issue,\" Ferguson told Maher, later adding \"it can't be freedom of speech when I agree with what people are saying. Hate speech? Totally a different thing.\"\nMaher went on to draw a grim parallel between the ongoing unrest among the anti-Israel wing of the Democratic base to the infamous riots that occurred at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, predicting it will happen again at the 2024 convention in August, which is also in Chicago.\n\"It's going to happen again because the kids are out - they're gonna be out there in force chanting about ‘Genocide Joe' because this is their new cause now,\" Maher said. \"This they think is the cause of their lifetime, Hamas, to be on their side.\"\n\"So I'm just wondering how the Democrats are gonna come out of that convention. Because I remember the last time that happened in Chicago, they got bloodied by it and Nixon won the White House,\" Maher added.",

            "summary": "Rep. David Trone, D-Md., who was recently blasted for using a disparaging term for Black people during a House hearing, is officially the largest self-funded candidate of a Senate primary race in U.S. history.\nTrone contributed $18.5 million of his own money to his Maryland Senate campaign, Fox News confirmed. And he brought in a total of over $40 million, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). No candidate running in a Senate primary has contributed this amount in recorded Senate primary history.\n\"David Trone has been crystal clear that he's prepared to do whatever it takes to beat Larry Hogan in November and protect the Democratic Senate majority,\" the Trone campaign said in a statement. \"With national Republicans and right-wing donors flooding Maryland with contributions to Hogan, there has never been a more important time to take the fight directly to Mitch McConnell, Larry Hogan and Donald Trump. David Trone is the best candidate to do that.\"\nTrone recently uttered a racial slur while speaking on tax policy during a House Budget Committee hearing in March, later admitting to the remark, but saying he intended to use a different term.\n\"So this Republican jigaboo that — it's the tax rate that's stopping business investment, it's just completely faulty by people who have never run a business,\" Trone said during the hearing. \"They've never been there. They don't have a clue what they're talking about.\"\nTrone apologized for the comment, telling Fox News Digital, \"I recognize that, as a White man, I have privilege. And as an elected official, I have a responsibility for the words I use — especially in the heat of the moment. Regardless of what I meant to say, I shouldn't have used that language.\"\nFollowing the controversial comment, Reps., Barbara Lee, D-Calif.; Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y.; Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y.; Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio; and Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, announced they would be endorsing Trone's Democratic primary opponent in the Maryland race.\nA spokesperson for Gov. Larry Hogan, R-Md., the candidate leading the Maryland GOP Senate primary, told Fox News Digital \"Hogan will continue to meet Marylanders where they are and may be outspent, but not be outworked in this campaign.\"\n\"Following Gov. Hogan's bus tour directly reaching voters in every region of the state, we are excited to host a grassroots family BBQ with hundreds of supporters with tickets starting at $50 and kids under 12 for free,\" Blake Kernan, press secretary for Hogan's Senate campaign, told Fox in a statement.\n\"Gov. Hogan will continue to meet Marylanders where they are and may be outspent, but not be outworked in this campaign.\"\nWhile Trone leads the Democratic primary race, he is likely to face Republican candidate Hogan on the general election ballot. Hogan, according to a recent Washington Post/University of Maryland poll released in March, is leading the race against Trone by double digits.",

            "summary": "A new well publicized poll from Harvard University is the latest to indicate rising support for former President Trump among the nation's youngest voters, who traditionally are a key part of the Democratic Party's base.\nPresident Biden leads his Republican challenger 45%-37% among people ages 18 to 29 in a Harvard Youth Poll released early Thursday by the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics. Sixteen percent of those questioned were undecided.\nHowever, Biden's 8-point advantage over the former president is much smaller than his 23-point lead over Trump at the same point four years ago in the 2020 election cycle.\nThe president's lead over Trump widens to 50%-37% among registered voters under age 30, and to 56%-37% among those likely to cast a ballot in the November election.\nHowever, even Biden's 19-point margin among likely voters under age 30 is much smaller than his 30-point lead over Trump four years ago.\nAdditionally, the poll indicates that the president's 19-point lead over Trump among likely voters shrinks to 13-points when third party and independent candidates are added to the mix.\nAccording to the survey, Biden stands at 43%, Trump 30%, Democrat turned independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at 8%, Green Party candidate Jill Stein at 4% and independent Cornel West at 2%.\nThe poll suggests Trump's made major gains among young male voters.\n\"Democrats have lost significant ground with young men,\" the poll's release highlighted.\nThe president leads among women by 33 points in the poll, but his advantage among men is just six points. While Biden's lead among women is nearly identical to four years ago, his advantage among men has plummeted 20 points from this point in the 2020 election cycle.\n\"The gap between young men's and young women's political preferences is pronounced,\" polling director for the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics John Della Volpe emphasized.\nHe also cautioned to \"make no mistake, this is a different youth electorate than we saw in 2020 and 2022.\"\nThe poll also indicated that younger voters supporting Trump are much more enthusiastic about the former president than Biden voters are about the current president. More than three-quarters of those backing Trump said they were enthusiastic about their support, compared to just 44% of Biden backers who said the same thing.\nThe poll is the latest to indicate an erosion in support for Biden among younger voters. Also alarming for the president is his approval rating among those under 30, standing at just 31% in the new survey.\nThe Harvard Youth poll of 2,010 Americans ages 18-29 was conducted March 14-21, with an overall sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.",

            "excerpt": "The Maine Legislature has approved several gun safety bills following the deadliest shooting in state history, which killed 18 people and injured 13 last October.",
            "summary": "The Maine Legislature approved sweeping gun safety legislation including background checks on private gun sales, waiting periods for gun purchases and criminalizing gun sales to prohibited people before adjourning Thursday morning, nearly six months after the deadliest shooting in state history.\nDemocratic Gov. Janet Mills and the Democratic-led Legislature pressed for a number of gun and mental health proposals after the shooting that claimed 18 lives and injured another 13 people, despite the state's strong hunting tradition and support for gun owners.\n\"Maine has taken significant steps forward in preventing gun violence and protecting Maine lives,\" said Nacole Palmer, executive director of the Maine Gun Safety Coalition, who praised lawmakers for listening to their constituents.\nThe governor's bill, approved early Thursday, would strengthen the state's yellow flag law, boost background checks for private sales of guns and make it a crime to recklessly sell a gun to someone who is prohibited from having guns. The bill also funds violence prevention initiatives and opens a mental health crisis receiving center in Lewiston.\nThe Maine Senate also narrowly gave final approval Wednesday to a 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases and a ban on bump stocks that can transform a weapon into a machine gun.\nHowever, there was no action on a proposal to institute a \"red flag\" law. The bill sponsored by House Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross would have allowed family members to petition a judge to remove guns from someone who is in a psychiatric crisis. The state's current \"yellow flag\" law differs by putting police in the lead of the process, which critics say is too complicated.\nLawmakers pushed through the night and into the morning as they ran up against their adjournment date, which was Wednesday. But it didn't come without some 11th-hour drama. Lawmakers had to approve a contentious supplemental budget before casting their final votes and didn't wrap up the session until after daybreak.\nThe Oct. 25 shooting by an Army reservist in Lewiston, Maine's second-largest city, served as tragic backdrop for the legislative session.\nPolice were warned by family members that the shooter was becoming delusional and had access to weapons. He was hospitalized for two weeks while training with his unit last summer. And his best friend, a fellow reservist, warned that the man was going \"to snap and do a mass shooting.\" The shooter killed himself after the attack.\nRepublicans accused Democrats of using the tragedy to play on people's emotions to pass contentious bills.\n\"My big concern here is that we're moving forward with gun legislation that has always been on the agenda. Now we're using the tragedy in Lewiston to force it through when there's nothing new here,\" said Republican Sen. Lisa Keim. \"It's the same old ideas that were rejected year after year. Using the tragedy to advance legislation is wrong.\"\nBut Democrats said constituents implored them to do something to prevent future attacks. They said it would've been an abdication of their responsibility to ignore their pleas.\n\"For the sake of the communities, individuals and families now suffering immeasurable pain, for the sake of our state, doing nothing is not an option,\" the governor said in late January when she outlined her proposals in her State of the State address. Those in attendance responded with a standing ovation.",

In Milidantri's circles, the choice is clear, however.\n\"I can't use that language on the air,\" he replied when asked what his friends have said about Biden.\n\"It really is pathetic to watch a man that they can't impeach because he's not capable of it, but yet he's capable of running our country. There's something wrong here. There's definitely something wrong,\" he continued.\nMilidantri said his fellow retired veterans are tired of witnessing the country taking a downward turn, adding that he believes \"we are turning into a third-world country.\"\nOther Pennsylvanians are none too happy with the country's direction, according to interviews Fox News Digital conducted in Schnecksville on the heels of former President Trump's visit to the area on Saturday.\n\"Our costs are through the roof just to stay in business. From A-to-Z we didn't have this four years ago,\" said Al Anderson, a local business owner, adding, \"\"Of course, Bidenomics is nothing but printing money and creating inflation.\"\nEd Frack, another Schnecksville native who opened this first gym in the area just before Trump left office, a time he described as one of \"growth.\"\n\"Things were just a little easier for businessowners,\" he said. \"The younger generation is noticeably spending more money than my generation ever did.\"\nBiden and Trump are currently engaged in a fight to win over voters in other swing states like Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, Nevada, Michigan and Virginia in addition to Pennsylvania.\nPennsylvania State Sen. Jarrett Coleman, a Republican from the area, said voters in the area lack enthusiasm under Biden's watch compared to Trump's.\n\"President Biden was recently in Lehigh County touting Bidenomics -- the funny thing about Bidenomics is if it was working, the president wouldn't have to travel around the country convincing people it's working,\" he said.",

            "summary": "The Maine Legislature moved in fits and starts toward adjournment on Wednesday, with unfinished business including final votes on a series of gun safety bills that were introduced after the deadliest shooting in state history last fall.\nThe Senate was awaiting an enactment vote on the governor's gun safety proposals that would strengthen the state's yellow flag law, boost background checks for private sales of guns and make it a crime to recklessly sell a gun to a prohibited person.\nThe Senate narrowly gave final approval to a 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases and a ban on bump stocks that can transform a weapon into a machine gun.\nLooming in the background: Lawmakers had yet to vote on a red flag proposal sponsored by House Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross to allow family members to petition a judge to remove guns from someone who is in a psychiatric crisis. The state's yellow flag law puts police in the lead of the process, which critics say is too complicated.\nLegislators faced a Wednesday deadline for completing work before adjournment. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills indicated she had no interest in extending the session.\nA dustup between the governor and lawmakers over the amount of money to help communities recover from storm damage created an 11th-hour wrinkle. Lawmakers also had to approve a budget revision that could prove contentious.\nThe Oct. 25 shooting by an Army reservist that claimed 18 lives and injured 13 others served as a backdrop for the legislative session.\nRepublicans accused Democrats of using the tragedy to play on people's emotions to pass contentious bills, some of which were previously defeated. Supporters of the legislation said constituents implored them to do something to prevent future attacks.",

Though President Biden remains steadfast in his loyalty to Israel, he continues to dissuade Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from committing any acts that could dangerously escalate tensions in the Middle East. Meanwhile, here at home, former President Donald Trump's historic criminal trial begins in New York City and new aid bills pass on Capitol Hill that have Congress further divided.
