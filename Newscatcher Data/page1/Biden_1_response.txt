The president's salary is set by Congress and has been constant since 2001.\nThe jump in income last year was largely attributable to the $129,876 in taxable interest, pensions, annuities, IRA distributions and Social Security benefits that the couple claimed, up significantly from the $92,087 reported last year.\nDr. Biden also earned $4,115 in royalties from books she has written, while the president reported no royalties.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump in 2020, is crucial to his re-election strategy.","summary":"As President Biden tours Pennsylvania, his campaign will run a new ad promoting his commitment to organized labor and attacking the economic policies of former President Donald J. Trump.\nThe ad features JoJo Burgess, who is a steelworker and the mayor of Washington, Pa., a small town southwest of Pittsburgh. Mr. Biden is scheduled to speak on Wednesday at the headquarters of the United Steelworkers union in Pittsburgh, where he is expected to call on his trade representative to increase some tariffs on steel and aluminum products from China.\n'Donald Trump has shown through his history that workers mean nothing to him,' Mr. Burgess says in the ad, a minute-long spot. 'Right now, we have the most pro-American worker president in office that we've ever had in our history.'\nThe Biden campaign said it was spending in the 'mid-six figures' to push the message across television and digital platforms in Pennsylvania, separate from a $30 million ad campaign across the major battleground states. It hopes the ad will complement news media coverage of Mr. Biden's three-day Pennsylvania visit, which is set to conclude on Thursday in Philadelphia. Winning the state, where he narrowly defeated Mr. Trump in 2020, is crucial to his re-election strategy.\nThe new ad amplifies the argument that Mr. Biden is pursuing against Mr. Trump on the economy, accusing the former president of siding with billionaires over workers. In a speech laying out his tax policy on Tuesday in Scranton, his hometown, Mr. Biden laid into Mr. Trump.\n'He learned the best way to get rich is to inherit it,' Mr. Biden said of his rival.\nMr. Burgess, a Democrat, was a guest of Mr. Biden's at the president's State of the Union address in 2022. He became the first Black mayor of Washington, Pa., last year. The Biden campaign said the ad featuring Mr. Burgess would run during news programs, as well as on regional sports networks.\nThe campaign also released a shorter ad with Mr. Burgess for digital platforms. In that ad, Mr. Burgess defends Mr. Biden against attacks from Mr. Trump and other Republicans on his age and mental fitness.\n'When you meet him, this guy is as sharp as a knife,' Mr. Burgess says of the president.

Trump goes on trial on Monday in Manhattan, President Biden and his allies are not likely to say much.\nFor Democrats, a former president facing criminal charges over covering up a sex scandal surrounding the 2016 campaign speaks for itself. The media coverage will be constant, especially if Mr. Trump takes the stand, which he has floated as a possibility. And while Mr. Trump faces up to eight weeks in court, Mr. Biden will be on the campaign trail and employing a 'Rose Garden strategy' as he governs from the White House, a contrast that the president's aides hope voters will view favorably.\nThe approach could be bolstered by the fact that Mr. Trump will be appearing in a court case involving salacious details and questionable financial maneuverings while Mr. Biden is addressing a conflict in the Middle East.\nMr. Biden and his campaign have said nothing publicly about the criminal indictments against Mr. Trump, worried about improperly influencing the cases or stoking Mr. Trump's repeated allegations \u2014 made without evidence \u2014 that Mr. Biden has engineered the charges.\nMany of the deep-pocketed outside Democratic groups supporting the Biden campaign are charting a similar path. Part of their calculation, they say, is that ads promoting Mr. Biden's record or arguing that Mr. Trump is a threat to democracy are testing better with voters than highlighting Mr. Trump's legal troubles. Another consideration is that the Manhattan case, which is being brought by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, is not easily explained in a sound bite or a 30-second ad.\n'I just don't think in the end it's the strongest argument for voters,' said Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist running a pro-Biden super PAC called Unite the Country. 'Campaigns have limited resources and you spend those resources in a way that moves the most votes.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Former President Donald J. Trump, his Republican opponent, will get a short reprieve from his felony criminal trial in New York with a scheduled break.\nMr. Biden has hammered Mr. Trump during his appearances in Pennsylvania so far. Visiting his hometown, Scranton, on Tuesday, Mr. Biden portrayed Mr. Trump as cozy with billionaires and plutocrats, while emphasizing that his own proposals would raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy and use the revenue to help working families. Mr. Biden also needled Mr. Trump about his financial troubles, as well as the plummeting price of shares in his social media company.\n'If Trump's stock in Truth Social \u2014 his company \u2014 drops any lower, he might do better under my tax plan than his,' Mr. Biden quipped.\nBut in Mr. Trump's view, the greater insult is that he has been in a New York courtroom while Mr. Biden campaigns. The former president and his campaign continued to express outrage that the trial was keeping Mr. Trump from the campaign trail.\n'Election interference!' Mr. Trump wrote on Tuesday morning on Truth Social, and added, in all caps: 'Rigged, unconstitutional trial!'\nWhile stuck in the deep-blue state of New York, Mr. Trump made a campaign stop at a bodega in Harlem after his trial adjourned on Tuesday. Surrounded by supporters, detractors and curious onlookers, the former president took the optimistic perspective that the Empire State was competitive in this year's election, vowing that he would 'make a big play for New York' \u2014 adding that his court schedule would allow him to campaign nearby.\nMr. Biden defeated Mr. Trump in New York in the 2020 election by a margin of nearly two million votes.\nNicholas Nehamas contributed reporting from Scranton, Pa. and Michael Gold contributed reporting.","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Chris Cameron","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/16/multimedia/16pol-swiper-02-fmpv/16pol-swiper-02-fmpv-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":7.3106904,"_id":"b8deb0299e932dfa759cbfcb5cb8cb33"},{"title":"Biden Heads to Pennsylvania to Talk Taxes and Hit Trump","author":"Nicholas Nehamas","published_date":"2024-04-16 09:03:20","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/16/us/politics/biden-pennsylvania-trump.html","clean_url":"nytimes.com","excerpt":"In Scranton, his hometown, the president is expected to discuss the tax code in terms of economic fairness, arguing that Donald Trump's tax cuts benefited billionaires.","summary":"President Biden will kick off a three-day tour of Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state, with a speech on Tuesday that focuses on taxes and aims to contrast his policies with those of former President Donald J. Trump.\nIn Scranton, his hometown, Mr. Biden is expected to talk about the tax code in the frame of economic fairness, arguing that Mr. Trump's tax cuts benefited billionaires while his own agenda has helped working- and middle-class families.\nThe president 'will outline how Trump's tax plan is a handout to the rich and leaves the middle class holding the bag,' Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign's communications director, said during a call with reporters. 'The address will drive home a simple question: Do you think the tax code should work for rich people and for corporations or for the middle class?'\nAll of that is standard election-year fare. But the backdrop to Mr. Biden's campaign swing could not be more unusual. In an unprecedented trial, Mr. Trump is spending most of this week, and much of the coming month or two, in a Manhattan courtroom facing criminal charges. Democrats hope that the contrast of Mr. Biden campaigning and carrying out the duties of a president while Mr. Trump's lawyers plead his innocence will highlight the choice voters face in November.\nAnd Mr. Biden must also contend with the fallout from Iran's weekend attack on Israel, which raised new fears of a wider regional war in the Middle East.\nOn Tuesday, the day after Tax Day, Mr. Biden is likely to promote his plans for changes to the tax code, including expanding the child tax credit, instituting a tax credit for first-time home buyers and making permanent tax credits for those who buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Kennedy Jr.'s independent bid, and its desire to discredit him.","summary":"The elaborate rollout of a Kennedy family endorsement of President Biden on Thursday \u2014 talk-show interviews, a campaign event with the president, door-knocking by Kennedys across Philadelphia \u2014 was the most powerful sign yet of rising concern in the Biden camp that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s independent White House bid presents a serious threat to the president's re-election prospects.\nMembers of this prominent Democratic family, including most of Mr. Kennedy's siblings, had already signaled their support for Mr. Biden's re-election. Mr. Kennedy's estrangement from much of his family had grown increasingly apparent over the years, as he became a leading spokesman against Covid vaccines and promoted conspiratorial theories about the 1968 assassination of his father, Robert F. Kennedy.\nBut this was the first time Mr. Biden's campaign had been so aggressively involved in promoting the Kennedys' strong support for the president, making an open push to discredit any enduring Democratic credentials Robert F. Kennedy Jr. carries because of his family name.\nAfter leaving the work to outside liberal groups, the Biden campaign has now joined the effort to define Mr. Kennedy beyond the gauzy memory of his father and two uncles, who for many members of Mr. Biden's fraying coalition, including Black voters, Latinos and blue-collar workers, continue to symbolize Democratic politics in America.\nDemocratic worries about Mr. Kennedy have grown as he has turned up his attacks on the preisdent and worked to win ballot lines in critical battleground states. Michigan election officials announced on Thursday that he had secured a spot as a member of a little-known third party.\n'I can only imagine how Donald Trump's outrageous lies and behavior would horrify my father, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who proudly served as attorney general of the United States, and honored his pledge to uphold the law and protect the country,' Kerry Kennedy, one of the independent presidential candidate's siblings, said as she stood next to Mr. Biden, addressing about 150 people at a recreation center gym in Philadelphia. 'Daddy stood for equal justice, for human rights and freedom from want and fear. Just as President Biden does today.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

And he will announce new initiatives to work with Mexican officials to block China from evading American steel tariffs by routing its exports through Mexico.\nThe moves represent an escalating effort by Mr. Biden and his aides to stop a flood of low-cost Chinese exports from undermining made-in-America products \u2014 and jeopardizing a central focus of Mr. Biden's economic agenda.\nThose exports, which often enjoy heavy subsidies from Beijing and low-cost labor, propelled the Chinese economy to higher-than-expected growth in the opening months of the year. But they have raised alarms in the United States and other nations that trade heavily with China, with leaders of those countries accusing Chinese officials of flouting international trade law and disrupting their own domestic manufacturing.\n'China is simply too big to play by its own rules,' Lael Brainard, who heads Mr. Biden's National Economic Council, told reporters.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Mr. Marape has twice visited the White House. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.\nMr. Biden's description of his uncle's death does not match military records.

Both of the plane's engines failed at low altitude. There is no indication the aircraft was shot down.\nMr. Finnegan and two other men 'failed to emerge from the sinking wreck and were lost in the crash,' the Pentagon records state.

Kennedy Jr., the independent candidate who many Democrats believe poses a significant threat to Mr. Biden's re-election chances.\nAmong the relatives of Mr. Kennedy expected to back Mr. Biden are his siblings Joseph, Kerry, Rory, Kathleen, Maxwell and Christopher. The Biden campaign released a list of 15 Kennedys set to appear at the rally, but it said other family members would endorse the president as well. Kerry Kennedy will introduce Mr. Biden at the rally, the campaign said, and Joe Kennedy III, Mr. Kennedy's nephew and a former Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, will do so at a second event.\nThe show of force will send the clearest signal yet that America's most storied Democratic family is deeply fearful that one of its own could tip the 2024 election to former President Donald J. Trump, and hopes to use its influence to try to stop him.\nMany family members have previously expressed strong disapproval of Mr. Kennedy's candidacy, voicing anguish about his promotion of conspiracy theories and confusion about why he is challenging a Democratic president they admire. Like many Democrats, they worry that he could help Mr. Trump win if he draws even a small number of votes away from Mr. Biden in the battleground states \u2014 contests that were decided by tens of thousands of votes in 2020.\nMr. Trump is likely to remain the main target of attacks at the Philadelphia event, but the symbolic repudiation of Mr. Kennedy will not be subtle.\n'We can say today, with no less urgency, that our rights and freedoms are once again in peril,' Kerry Kennedy is expected to say, according to excerpts from her speech shared by the Biden campaign.

Soon, President Biden is expected to protect federal land in the Alaskan wilderness.\nAs his re-election campaign heats up, Mr. Biden is leaning heavily on the powers of the presidency to try to shore up his support among key constituencies \u2014 young people, union workers and environmentalists \u2014 many of whom have expressed disappointment in his handling of the issues they care about.\nIt is a tactic often employed by previous sitting presidents, but one that is made more urgent for Mr. Biden by polls that show lagging support among several of the groups that helped him win the White House four years ago. Campaign aides say the rapid-fire string of announcements, which will continue, demonstrate that the president hears their concerns.\nIt is also part of the campaign's broader strategy of trying to boil down the choice for voters to a simple one of governing versus chaos. The announcements by Mr. Biden are meant to draw a contrast with former President Donald J. Trump, who has spent most of this week sitting at the defendant's table during the first of his four criminal trials.\n'You've got a president who's bringing people together to get things done, like relieve student loan debt, protect American manufacturing, lead on the world stage, while Donald Trump screams into an echo chamber of MAGA extremism on Truth Social,' said Michael Tyler, the communications director for Mr. Biden's re-election campaign.\nMr. Biden and his aides have been traveling to highlight his administration's accomplishments.

There are lessons to be learned here.","summary":"Joe Biden is a dapper guy. He always has been. When he turned up decades ago for a first date with the woman who would become his wife and the country's first lady, her gut reaction was, 'This is never going to work, not in a million years.'\nDressed in a sports coat and loafers, Joe Biden was too dapper for someone who had previously gone out with men in T-shirts and clogs.\nThey worked it out. And the future president stuck to his style. It was one that sometimes skewed Gatsby, for which in 1974 Washingtonian magazine noted his penchant for pinstripe suits and tasseled loafers when citing him as one of the best dressed men in the Senate. It was one that was sometimes too high-toned for its setting. In 1979, Mr. Biden, then a second-term senator, exuded confidence in a 'tailored suit and expensive tie' for a campus speech at the University of Alabama, The New Yorker later reported.\nIt was one that, on occasion, even threatened to upstage the boss. Yes, it must have been flattering to be praised by The Chicago Tribune as the 'best-dressed guy' at Bill Clinton's 2000 State of the Union address. Politically, however, it was not the best look.\nStill, dapper cred has stood President Biden in good stead. When Donald J. Trump, now 77, derides his 81-year-old opponent as doddering Uncle Joe, he is missing a point any tailor would be happy to clarify. There is getting old, and there is looking old. To avoid having your clothes add unnecessary years, make style your friend.\n'Joe Biden's style is timeless and doesn't have any expiration date,' the designer Todd Snyder said recently.

During Michigan's primary in February, a protest movement over Mr. Biden's support for Israel's war in Gaza drew significant support.\nMr. Kennedy, a lifelong Democrat and the scion of perhaps the nation's most famous Democratic family, is running as an independent in 2024 and polling higher in early surveys than any third-party candidate since Ross Perot, the self-funding billionaire who ran in the 1990s.\nHis independent candidacy has earned him the estrangement of his own family \u2014 who campaigned this week with Mr. Biden in Pennsylvania \u2014 and many of his previous colleagues from the environmental movement, who denounced his candidacy publicly on Friday.\nMr. Kennedy has emerged as a leading voice of vaccine skepticism, both before and after Covid-19 vaccine, and dabbled in conspiratorial theories, including about the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, his father. He had initially declared his 2024 campaign as a Democratic challenger to Mr. Biden \u2014 and was heavily featured in conservative media \u2014 until he switched last fall to run as an independent.\nBoth parties are already rushing to define Mr. Kennedy as he races to get on the ballot nationwide.\nBrian Hughes, an adviser to Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, called Mr. Kennedy 'a leftist and liberal with a history of supporting an extreme environmental agenda that rivals Joe Biden for its ability to kill American jobs.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Mr. Biden, writing on X on Tuesday, said that for all their accomplishments in sports, women athletes were undervalued.\n'Right now we're seeing that even if you're the best, women are not paid their fair share,' he said. 'It's time that we give our daughters the same opportunities as our sons and ensure women are paid what they deserve.'\nMr. Biden was nodding to a banner moment for women's basketball, one powered by stars like Ms. Clark, who was chosen by the W.N.B.A.'s Indiana Fever, and Paige Bueckers of the University of Connecticut and Angel Reese of L.S.U.\nBut Ms. Clark's salary will amount to $338,056 over the next four years, under the W.N.B.A.'s collective bargaining agreement. The total is a fraction of the contract of Victor Wembanyama, whom the San Antonio Spurs chose with the top pick in last year's N.B.A. Draft. His contract was for $55 million, according to Spotrac, a website that tracks salaries in sports.\nThe disparity has drawn intense scrutiny during a pivotal moment for sports, particularly in college athletics. Students have gained the opportunity to monetize their athletic success through name, image and likeness, or N.I.L. deals, that can earn top stars like Ms. Clark millions of dollars. But the overall compensation of women in sports is far outpaced by how much money male athletes make.\nThe women's national championship game, in which Ms. Clark's Iowa lost to South Carolina, earned higher ratings for the first time than the men's championship contest between UConn and Purdue.\nThe president's comments touched off a flurry of responses online, some echoing Mr. Biden's perspective about inequity and others taking a more cynical point of view. Critics used the occasion to criticize Democrats over the participation of transgender athletes in women's sports.\nMartina Navratilova, the women's tennis legend, praised Mr. Biden.\n'Exactly,' she responded on X, and she called for protecting a policy that ensures equal access for women in education. 'Which means do not mess with Title IX, thank you Mr President!'\nLast year, Jill Biden, the first lady, created a stir after L.S.U. defeated the University of Iowa, another squad led by Ms. Clark, when she suggested that both teams should be invited to the White House, which would have broken from the tradition of the president hosting just the title winners.\nMs. Reese, the L.S.U. star who was also a top selection in the W.N.B.A. Draft, panned the idea at the time.\n'If we were to lose, we would not be getting invited to the White House,' she said on a podcast.","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Neil Vigdor","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/17/multimedia/17pol-swiper-wnba-zwjq/17pol-swiper-wnba-zwjq-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":7.047046,"_id":"a7634b068e02780df7c033823bb306eb"},{"title":"Robert F.

At the same time, Democratic allies of Mr. Biden are working to challenge his access to the ballot.\nIn a statement released by Mr. Kennedy's campaign, Doug Dern, the chairman of the Natural Law Party, called him 'the most qualified candidate in the modern-day history of America.'\nMr. Kennedy, an environmental lawyer known for his antivaccine activism, has spread misinformation about the risks of vaccinations and about other subjects. He also drew attention recently for suggesting that Mr. Biden might pose a greater threat to democracy than former President Donald J. Trump, who tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election, a claim that democracy experts called absurd.\nWhile Mr. Kennedy is generally polling in single digits nationally, Mr. Biden's campaign is worried that he could draw enough support in battleground states like Michigan to tip a close election to Mr. Trump.\nMr. Kennedy's relatives are worried about that, too \u2014 as evidenced by their show of force for Mr. Biden on Thursday, when a group of them appeared alongside him at a campaign event in Pennsylvania.","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Maggie Astor","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/18/multimedia/18pol-swiper-rfk-michigan-vwjm/18pol-swiper-rfk-michigan-vwjm-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":7.001505,"_id":"118197ec92914d698b0acf8d4125bc4a"},{"title":"The Ex-Bernie Sanders Pollster Raising Alarms About R.F.K.

He recently presented those findings to a consortium of Democratic groups and super PACs.\n'I'm raising the alarm,' Tulchin said in an interview.\nTulchin's concern is basically this: Latinos and younger voters, who flocked to Sanders, an independent, in the 2020 Democratic primary, were never that into Biden in the first place. Sure, they sided strongly with Biden in the general election. But, as Tulchin put it, 'they weren't enthused.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, told CBS that President Biden needed to ensure 'that young people feel included in the conversation, not just as a vote but as part of the governing coalition.' He added, 'I think part of the frustration by young people is that they oftentimes don't feel heard. They feel like their voices and their votes are taken advantage of come election time.' He said he thought Biden had taken steps toward including them. April 21, 2024, 12:15 p.m. ET April 21, 2024, 12:15 p.m. ET Representative Tony Gonzales, a Republican of Texas whose district encompasses a vast swath of the U.S.-Mexico border, delivered a harsh criticism of his hard-right G.O.P. colleagues who voted against the military aid package to U.S. allies, comparing some members with the Ku Klux Klan. 'The way to take out the bully is to bloody their nose,' he said after saying that the days where rank-and-file members were 'kind of easygoing' and 'put their head down' were over. 'The fight is here,' he added. April 21, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET April 21, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a Republican vice-presidential contender who supported federal abortion bans when she was in Congress, told CNN that she didn't anymore because the overturning of Roe v. Wade 'returned the power back to the states.' She then sought to distance herself from her own state's law, which bans abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest, saying it was passed before she became governor. April 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET April 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET Asked on CNN if Biden should debate Trump, Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Democrat of Illinois, said Biden was 'a terrific debater' but Trump 'lies and lies and lies, and it's so hard to respond to that in the middle of a debate.' He added, 'Do you talk about what you want to do for the future, or do you respond to the lies that have come out of Donald Trump's mouth every minute? So I'm concerned about that, just to be honest with you.' April 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET April 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a potential vice-presidential pick for Donald Trump, refused to say on CNN whether she would have certified the 2020 election as Mike Pence did on Jan. 6. 'That was the day we hope we never see again,' she said. 'We did not do justice by our country by showing and fighting over that day. We should focus on our freedoms and continue to uphold our Constitution. So talking in hypotheticals is not something that I do.' President Trump's campaign committee ended March with $45 million on hand, up from $33.5 million at the end of February, an improvement as he seeks to close the formidable fund-raising gap with President Biden, whose campaign had $85.5 million. It's not just about donors, though: The Trump campaign's spending has slowed \u2013 in March, it spent just $3.7 million, compared with $29.2 million spent by the Biden campaign. Credit... Jonathan Ernst/Reuters Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a potential vice-presidential pick for former President Donald J. Trump, refused to say on Sunday whether she would have certified the 2020 election if she had been in Vice President Mike Pence's position. She also dodged questions about whether she supported exceptions to abortion bans for rape and incest. 'You can go back and keep talking about Jan. 6, but the fact of the matter is that was a day we hope we never see again here in this country,' Ms. Noem said on CNN. 'We did not do justice by our country by showing and fighting over that day. We should focus on our freedoms and continue to uphold our Constitution. So talking in hypotheticals is not something that I do.' When the interviewer, Dana Bash, pressed her on whether Mr. Pence had been wrong to certify the election results, Ms. Noem again avoided a direct answer, instead criticizing Mr. Pence for denouncing Mr. Trump after Jan. 6. 'I wasn't in Mike Pence's shoes, and the information that he had at that time \u2014 I don't know how he based his decisions,' she said. 'I think he's a nice man. I think that he's failed Donald Trump since that day, because he certainly does not recognize that we need someone in the White House who needs him out on the trail advocating for him, instead of constantly criticizing and going back and ripping him apart.' On abortion, Ms. Noem, who supported a federal ban when she was a member of Congress, said she now believed restrictions should be left to individual states. That is the position Mr. Trump took this month, though his allies have developed plans that could functionally ban abortion nationwide without formally doing so. Mr. Trump has also expressed support for rape and incest exceptions, which South Dakota's near-total abortion ban does not include. When asked about that, Ms. Noem tried to distance herself from her own state's law, noting that it was a 'trigger ban' enacted years ago to take effect if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. 'The law in my state was passed decades before I ever became governor,' she said, adding: 'That may be a topic that will continue to be discussed in South Dakota. Our law today allows an exception to save the life of the mother, but the people in South Dakota will decide what their laws look like.' She did not give a clear answer when Ms. Bash asked what she believed South Dakota's laws should look like. 'I can have an opinion, and I can weigh forward and I can look at the science and what we've learned about babies in the womb and believe that we should protect life, but I think that our law today is what South Dakota wants,' she said. 'And they'll continue to have that debate, and I'll continue to follow through on my role, which is to make sure the will of the people is enforced.' Ms. Bash repeated her question, and Ms. Noem implied \u2014 but did not say outright \u2014 that she might oppose a rape and incest exception. 'We have a law that says that there is an exception for the life of the mother, and I just don't believe a tragedy should perpetuate another tragedy,' she said. Versions of that statement are common among people who believe abortion should be illegal even in cases of rape and incest. 'I believe in taking care of mothers that are in a crisis situation and that we should be locking alongside them, giving them all the information and the best information they can make before they have to be put in a situation where an abortion is the only option that they have,' she added. Ms. Noem also echoed Mr. Trump's claims that the criminal charges against him in New York \u2014 where his trial began last week \u2014 were political, and affirmed that she would support him even if he were convicted of felonies. 'When he was in the White House, every single day as governor, I got to be on offense, I got to solve problems,' she said. 'And since Joe Biden has been in the White House, I just have to defend the freedoms of my people in South Dakota. I'm every day trying to push back on what this federal government is trying to do by increasing costs for the everyday families that get up every day and go to work. So yes, Donald Trump should be back in that White House. I'm going to do all I can to help him win.' Credit... Chris Seward/Associated Press Former President Donald J. Trump's presidential campaign committee ended March with $45 million on hand, federal filings showed Saturday, as he tries to close the fund-raising gap with President Biden. But Mr. Trump's campaign is spending much less than it was at the start of the year, which has helped it inch closer. In March, it spent just $3.7 million, the new filings show, compared with $11.4 million in January \u2014 and much less than the $29.2 million spent by Mr. Biden's campaign in March. In other words, Mr. Trump's campaign is guarding resources as it seeks to build a campaign war chest for the general election. This cycle began with the announcement of former President Donald J. Trump's campaign in November 2022 and President Biden's in April 2023. Raised $43.8 $158.5 $15.3 $114.7 Spent $29.2 $74.3 $4 $70.1 Net cash $85.5 \u2014 $44.6 \u2014 Mr. Biden's campaign had $85.5 million on hand at the end of March, according to its monthly filing with the Federal Election Commission, a significant increase from the month before: He ended February with $71 million in his campaign account while Mr. Trump ended February with less than half that. As Mr. Trump and Republicans chase the Democrats' financial edge, Mr. Biden has also started to narrow the polling gap between himself and Mr. Trump. Since late February, the president has cut a deficit of five percentage points to a single point, a virtual tie, according to a recent survey by The New York Times and Siena College. The rivals each capitalized on splashy fund-raisers in the past month that brought in tens of millions of dollars for their respective campaigns. But Mr. Trump's haul from an April 6 event in Palm Beach, Fla., will be reflected on a future filing. His campaign reported that it and the Republican National Committee raked in more than $50.5 million from the dinner, which was held at the home of the billionaire John Paulson. The total nearly doubled the $26 million that Mr. Biden's campaign said it raised on March 28 at Radio City Music Hall in New York, a star-studded event headlined by the president and two former presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Those funds were included in Mr. Biden's March fund-raising numbers. Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump are primarily raising money though joint fund-raising agreements with their respective parties, arrangements that legally allow them to pull in hundreds of thousands of dollars from individual donors, some of which flows into their campaigns. Joint fund-raising committees for both candidates filed reports with the Federal Election Commission this week, providing the first details of 2024 of major donors to both candidates, and the total scale of their fund-raising haul. But the F.E.C. reports for presidential campaigns, which are filed monthly in election years, offer different insights about candidates' activities and how the committees backing them are spending money. By the end of the 2020 cycle Biden had raised and spent more than $1 billion and Trump more than $700 million dollars. For example, federal law guarantees political campaigns bottom-dollar rates for broadcast advertising, so campaign committees are often used to pay for television time. In the first three months of 2024, Mr. Biden's campaign has spent $45.2 million on media buys and production, filings show \u2014 more than half of its total of $74.1 million in spending. The Biden campaign has spent $6.9 million on payroll and related expenses, and an additional $6.9 million on 'text message outreach.' His campaign's spending shot up in March, after two relatively steady months. In contrast, Mr. Trump's campaign spending has slowed sharply since the beginning of the year, when he was still fending off Republican primary challengers. Since Jan. 1, Mr. Trump's campaign has spent $23 million \u2014 but just $3.7 million of that was in March. His campaign has paid $6 million for placed media this year, all of it before Super Tuesday. One of Mr. Trump's committees \u2014 a leadership PAC called Save America, which he has used to pay his legal bills \u2014 reported on Saturday that it had almost $4.1 million on hand at the end of March, roughly the same amount as it had at the end of February. The group spent $5 million in March, including $3.7 million in bills to the legal teams defending him. Mr. Trump's campaign itself also paid about $473,000 in legal expenses. A super PAC backing Mr. Trump, MAGA Inc., reported raising $14.4 million in March, including a $5 million contribution from the former Trump cabinet official Linda McMahon and $4.2 million from Robert T. Bigelow, an aerospace and real estate mogul. The group also transferred $5 million to Save America \u2014 part of a huge refund of money from the super PAC to the committee over the past year. With national polls consistently suggesting that the rematch between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden could hinge on a few states or a single one, that has magnified the candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running as an independent. It has also drawn attention to how the liberal scion is paying for his campaign and what he is spending money on, including for ballot access and security. His selection of Nicole Shanahan, a wealthy Silicon Valley lawyer and investor, as his running mate already appears to have become a boon for his campaign. Of the $5.4 million that Mr. Kennedy raised in March, $2 million came from Ms. Shanahan, who until last year was married to the Google co-founder Sergey Brin. A correction was made on : An earlier version of this story misstated the total amount MAGA Inc. raised in March. It was $14.4 million, not $9.4 million. The lower figure inaccurately took into account a $5 million transfer from the group to another Trump committee. How we handle corrections Credit... Travis Dove for The New York Times After former President Donald J. Trump sat in a courtroom in New York for much of the last week, Saturday night was supposed to herald a return to the campaign trail and the large rallies where he often gives long, freewheeling speeches. With thousands gathered on the tarmac at an airport in Wilmington, N.C., Mr. Trump's campaign was building anticipation. Two hours before he was set to speak, the campaign sent a fund-raising blast with a message from Mr. Trump: 'They can't keep me off stage! Did they think I would run and hide?' Ninety minutes later, the skies darkened to charcoal and lightning flashed. As thunderstorms swept toward the area and the National Weather Service issued watches and warnings concerning dangerous winds and hail, the rally was canceled over safety concerns. 'We'll make up for this very quickly at another time,' Mr. Trump said on a call he made into the rally that was broadcast over the speakers. 'We'll do it as quick as possible. I'm devastated that this could happen.' But the cancellation, which Mr. Trump indicated was out of his hands, highlights the challenges that he may face as he tries to balance his presidential campaign with a criminal trial that will keep him busy through May. For much of the last week, Mr. Trump's public comments had been limited to social media posts and remarks to reporters outside the courtroom. His only campaign stop was at a bodega in New York City, in a state he overwhelmingly lost in the last two elections and that is not expected to be in play in November. Saturday's rally was expected to serve as a preview of the upcoming weeks, with Mr. Trump traveling on weekends to campaign in battleground states that are more central to his efforts to return to the White House. He has repeatedly claimed that the trial is preventing him from campaigning in places like North Carolina, which he won in 2016 and 2020, but where Democrats are making a big push in November. Opening arguments are slated to start on Monday, and the trial is set to last six to eight weeks. As is often the case with Mr. Trump's rallies, the crowds began lining up hours ahead of his expected remarks. Among those gathered outside was a group wearing shirts with the logo of the Proud Boys, a prominent far-right extremist group. One person held a sign that read 'Free All of the J6 Prisoners,' a reference to those serving sentences in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. Mr. Trump, who faces four criminal indictments that include charges tied to his efforts to overturn his election loss, has recently embraced dozens of Jan. 6 defendants. He has called them 'hostages' and has said he would consider pardoning them. In a statement, Ammar Moussa, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, criticized the group's presence, pointing to remarks Mr. Trump made in a debate in 2020, in which he told the Proud Boys to 'stand back and stand by.' 'This is Donald Trump's America: where white nationalists and violent far-right extremists are empowered and working families are left behind,' Mr. Moussa wrote. Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, responded in a statement, 'We don't comment on stupid.' Mr. Trump's remarks were expected to face particular scrutiny given that he is under a gag order in his criminal trial that bans him from attacking witnesses, prosecutors, jurors and court staff, as well as their relatives and relatives of the judge. Prosecutors have said Mr. Trump has violated the gag order seven times, and there is a hearing about the issue on Tuesday. Mr. Trump did travel to North Carolina earlier in the day, attending a fund-raiser in Charlotte in the afternoon. When he called into the rally, he told the attendees that he was minutes away from 'flying in' to Wilmington but that the authorities 'would prefer that we not come in' over safety concerns. 'I'm so sorry,' Mr. Trump said. 'But we'll do it again, and we'll do it bigger and better. You have my promise.' As the crowd left to seek shelter in their cars, vendors outside were still selling an array of merchandise, some of which had been created specifically for the occasion. One T-shirt promoted what it called the Wilmington stop on Mr. Trump's 'Save America' tour. 'I was there!' The shirt read. 'Where were you???'

Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, told CBS that President Biden needed to ensure 'that young people feel included in the conversation, not just as a vote but as part of the governing coalition.' He added, 'I think part of the frustration by young people is that they oftentimes don't feel heard. They feel like their voices and their votes are taken advantage of come election time.' He said he thought Biden had taken steps toward including them.\nApril 21, 2024, 12:15 p.m. ET April 21, 2024, 12:15 p.m. ET Representative Tony Gonzales, a Republican of Texas whose district encompasses a vast swath of the U.S.-Mexico border, delivered a harsh criticism of his hard-right G.O.P. colleagues who voted against the military aid package to U.S. allies, comparing some members with the Ku Klux Klan. 'The way to take out the bully is to bloody their nose,' he said after saying that the days where rank-and-file members were 'kind of easygoing' and 'put their head down' were over. 'The fight is here,' he added.\nApril 21, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET April 21, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a Republican vice-presidential contender who supported federal abortion bans when she was in Congress, told CNN that she didn't anymore because the overturning of Roe v. Wade 'returned the power back to the states.' She then sought to distance herself from her own state's law, which bans abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest, saying it was passed before she became governor.\nApril 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET April 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET Asked on CNN if Biden should debate Trump, Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Democrat of Illinois, said Biden was 'a terrific debater' but Trump 'lies and lies and lies, and it's so hard to respond to that in the middle of a debate.' He added, 'Do you talk about what you want to do for the future, or do you respond to the lies that have come out of Donald Trump's mouth every minute? So I'm concerned about that, just to be honest with you.'\nApril 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET April 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a potential vice-presidential pick for Donald Trump, refused to say on CNN whether she would have certified the 2020 election as Mike Pence did on Jan. 6. 'That was the day we hope we never see again,' she said. 'We did not do justice by our country by showing and fighting over that day. We should focus on our freedoms and continue to uphold our Constitution. So talking in hypotheticals is not something that I do.'\nPresident Trump's campaign committee ended March with $45 million on hand, up from $33.5 million at the end of February, an improvement as he seeks to close the formidable fund-raising gap with President Biden, whose campaign had $85.5 million. It's not just about donors, though: The Trump campaign's spending has slowed \u2013 in March, it spent just $3.7 million, compared with $29.2 million spent by the Biden campaign.\nCredit... Jonathan Ernst/Reuters Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a potential vice-presidential pick for former President Donald J. Trump, refused to say on Sunday whether she would have certified the 2020 election if she had been in Vice President Mike Pence's position. She also dodged questions about whether she supported exceptions to abortion bans for rape and incest.\n'You can go back and keep talking about Jan. 6, but the fact of the matter is that was a day we hope we never see again here in this country,' Ms. Noem said on CNN. 'We did not do justice by our country by showing and fighting over that day. We should focus on our freedoms and continue to uphold our Constitution. So talking in hypotheticals is not something that I do.'\nWhen the interviewer, Dana Bash, pressed her on whether Mr. Pence had been wrong to certify the election results, Ms. Noem again avoided a direct answer, instead criticizing Mr. Pence for denouncing Mr. Trump after Jan. 6.\n'I wasn't in Mike Pence's shoes, and the information that he had at that time \u2014 I don't know how he based his decisions,' she said. 'I think he's a nice man. I think that he's failed Donald Trump since that day, because he certainly does not recognize that we need someone in the White House who needs him out on the trail advocating for him, instead of constantly criticizing and going back and ripping him apart.'\nOn abortion, Ms. Noem, who supported a federal ban when she was a member of Congress, said she now believed restrictions should be left to individual states. That is the position Mr. Trump took this month, though his allies have developed plans that could functionally ban abortion nationwide without formally doing so.\nMr. Trump has also expressed support for rape and incest exceptions, which South Dakota's near-total abortion ban does not include. When asked about that, Ms. Noem tried to distance herself from her own state's law, noting that it was a 'trigger ban' enacted years ago to take effect if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n'The law in my state was passed decades before I ever became governor,' she said, adding: 'That may be a topic that will continue to be discussed in South Dakota. Our law today allows an exception to save the life of the mother, but the people in South Dakota will decide what their laws look like.'\nShe did not give a clear answer when Ms. Bash asked what she believed South Dakota's laws should look like.\n'I can have an opinion, and I can weigh forward and I can look at the science and what we've learned about babies in the womb and believe that we should protect life, but I think that our law today is what South Dakota wants,' she said. 'And they'll continue to have that debate, and I'll continue to follow through on my role, which is to make sure the will of the people is enforced.'\nMs. Bash repeated her question, and Ms. Noem implied \u2014 but did not say outright \u2014 that she might oppose a rape and incest exception.\n'We have a law that says that there is an exception for the life of the mother, and I just don't believe a tragedy should perpetuate another tragedy,' she said. Versions of that statement are common among people who believe abortion should be illegal even in cases of rape and incest.\n'I believe in taking care of mothers that are in a crisis situation and that we should be locking alongside them, giving them all the information and the best information they can make before they have to be put in a situation where an abortion is the only option that they have,' she added.\nMs. Noem also echoed Mr. Trump's claims that the criminal charges against him in New York \u2014 where his trial began last week \u2014 were political, and affirmed that she would support him even if he were convicted of felonies.\n'When he was in the White House, every single day as governor, I got to be on offense, I got to solve problems,' she said. 'And since Joe Biden has been in the White House, I just have to defend the freedoms of my people in South Dakota. I'm every day trying to push back on what this federal government is trying to do by increasing costs for the everyday families that get up every day and go to work. So yes, Donald Trump should be back in that White House. I'm going to do all I can to help him win.'\nCredit... Chris Seward/Associated Press Former President Donald J. Trump's presidential campaign committee ended March with $45 million on hand, federal filings showed Saturday, as he tries to close the fund-raising gap with President Biden.\nBut Mr. Trump's campaign is spending much less than it was at the start of the year, which has helped it inch closer. In March, it spent just $3.7 million, the new filings show, compared with $11.4 million in January \u2014 and much less than the $29.2 million spent by Mr. Biden's campaign in March. In other words, Mr. Trump's campaign is guarding resources as it seeks to build a campaign war chest for the general election.\nThis cycle began with the announcement of former President Donald J. Trump's campaign in November 2022 and President Biden's in April 2023.\nRaised $43.8 $158.5 $15.3 $114.7 Spent $29.2 $74.3 $4 $70.1 Net cash $85.5 \u2014 $44.6 \u2014 Mr. Biden's campaign had $85.5 million on hand at the end of March, according to its monthly filing with the Federal Election Commission, a significant increase from the month before: He ended February with $71 million in his campaign account while Mr. Trump ended February with less than half that.\nAs Mr. Trump and Republicans chase the Democrats' financial edge, Mr. Biden has also started to narrow the polling gap between himself and Mr. Trump. Since late February, the president has cut a deficit of five percentage points to a single point, a virtual tie, according to a recent survey by The New York Times and Siena College.\nThe rivals each capitalized on splashy fund-raisers in the past month that brought in tens of millions of dollars for their respective campaigns. But Mr. Trump's haul from an April 6 event in Palm Beach, Fla., will be reflected on a future filing. His campaign reported that it and the Republican National Committee raked in more than $50.5 million from the dinner, which was held at the home of the billionaire John Paulson.\nThe total nearly doubled the $26 million that Mr. Biden's campaign said it raised on March 28 at Radio City Music Hall in New York, a star-studded event headlined by the president and two former presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Those funds were included in Mr. Biden's March fund-raising numbers.\nMr. Biden and Mr. Trump are primarily raising money though joint fund-raising agreements with their respective parties, arrangements that legally allow them to pull in hundreds of thousands of dollars from individual donors, some of which flows into their campaigns.\nJoint fund-raising committees for both candidates filed reports with the Federal Election Commission this week, providing the first details of 2024 of major donors to both candidates, and the total scale of their fund-raising haul.\nBut the F.E.C. reports for presidential campaigns, which are filed monthly in election years, offer different insights about candidates' activities and how the committees backing them are spending money.\nBy the end of the 2020 cycle Biden had raised and spent more than $1 billion and Trump more than $700 million dollars.\nFor example, federal law guarantees political campaigns bottom-dollar rates for broadcast advertising, so campaign committees are often used to pay for television time.

A formal denial of the project would come later this year, they said.\nThe road was essential to reach what is estimated to be a $7.5 billion copper deposit buried under ecologically sensitive land. There are currently no mines in the area and no requests for permits have been filed with the government; the road was a first step.\nBlocking the industrial road would be an enormous victory for opponents who have argued for years that it would threaten wildlife as well as Alaska Native tribes that rely on hunting and fishing.\nEnvironmentalists, including many young climate activists, were infuriated last year by President Biden's decision to approve Willow, an $8 billion oil drilling project on pristine federal land in Alaska. The proposed road would be several hundred miles south of the Willow project.\nThe move comes as the Biden administration tries to find a balance between two different and sometimes opposing goals.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The agency, Fars News, said the cause of the explosions was not immediately clear. The agency said the explosions were heard in Qahjavarestan, a small city in west-central Iran close to Isfahan airport. Flight tracking websites showed that civilian planes had diverted their routes away from the area. The explosions came five days after Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel, its first direct attack on the country, in response to an Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria that killed seven Iranian officials on April 1. For days, Israeli leaders have threatened to respond to Iran's strikes, which turned the two countries' yearslong shadow war into a direct confrontation. The Israeli military declined to comment about the explosions on Friday in Iran. Iran's army chief, Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi, said on Wednesday that Iran would respond to any Israeli aggression, according to remarks carried by the IRNA state news agency. President Biden has advised Israel against responding, amid fears that an Israeli counterattack would escalate into an all-out war. For more than six months, Israel has been fighting on two other fronts \u2014 against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Both are allies of Iran.

Mohammed Salem/Reuters President Biden's team sought again on Thursday to put the brakes on Israeli plans for a major military assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, prompting the Israelis to agree to rethink their approach and come back for further consultations, the White House said in a statement. During a virtual meeting led by Jake Sullivan, the president's national security adviser, the American side evaluated options for the attack presented by Israel but was not convinced that those plans met Mr. Biden's insistence that any operation be calibrated to minimize civilian casualties, according to the White House statement. The two sides agreed to 'meet again soon,' the statement said. The meeting was convened just days after the United States came to Israel's defense against a barrage of more than 300 missiles and drones fired by Iran; Israeli, U.S. and other allied forces knocked down nearly all of the incoming Iranian weapons, resulting in little damage and no fatalities. Despite that close collaboration, though, the discussion on Thursday underscored that the two sides remained at odds over Israel's conduct of the war against Hamas in Gaza more than six months after the Oct. 7 terrorist attack. 'U.S. participants expressed concerns with various courses of action in Rafah, and Israeli participants agreed to take these concerns into account and to have further follow up discussions between experts,' the White House statement said. The statement did not elaborate on the specific concerns. The Israeli side was led by Ron Dermer, a close adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and member of the Israeli war cabinet, and Tzachi Hanegbi, the prime minister's national security adviser. The group discussed the Iran attack and efforts to defend Israel against future threats. The White House statement emphasized that the United States shared Israel's goal 'to see Hamas defeated in Rafah,' but the president has resisted a ground operation out of fear of the consequences for more than 1 million Palestinians who have taken refuge there.

Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times Negotiations for a cease-fire and the release of Israeli hostages have stalled because Hamas rejected the latest proposal put forth by Israel, Qatar and Egypt, the C.I.A. director said Thursday, putting the blame for a lack of progress in talks squarely on the group that led the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Earlier this month, William J. Burns, C.I.A. director and lead American negotiator, traveled to Cairo and pushed what he called 'a far-reaching proposal' that Egyptian and Qatari negotiators took to Hamas. The proposal contained an offer to allow some Gazans to return to the northern part of the enclave, a key Hamas demand. While Mr. Burns did not describe the details of that proposal, he said that so far Hamas has not accepted it. 'It was a deep disappointment to get a negative reaction from Hamas,' said Mr. Burns, speaking at the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas. 'Right now, it's that negative reaction that really is standing in the way of innocent civilians in Gaza getting humanitarian relief that they so desperately need.' Last Sunday, Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, expressed regret that Hamas had rejected the proposal and argued it proved that the group was not interested in reaching a deal. Other American officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations, have said Hamas has signaled that it does not have enough women and civilian hostages in its control to consummate the first part of the deal, which would release 40 hostages over six weeks in return for a large number of Palestinian prisoners. A senior Hamas official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said there were not enough living civilian hostages left who met Israel's criteria to reach their proposed figure of 40 hostages over six weeks. He accused Israel of seeking to free captive soldiers for a lower price than that demanded by the group. Hamas has said most soldiers would be released in a later phase of a cease-fire deal. In its latest proposal to negotiators, Hamas called for releasing fewer than 20 living hostages as part of an initial, six-week phase cease-fire deal, according to two Israeli officials familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Israel had hoped to see wounded and ill hostages freed, but Hamas was insisting on a far more narrow definition limited to the elderly and women, one of the officials said. Last year, Mr. Burns helped guide talks that led to the release of roughly 100 hostages in return for a temporary halt in fighting and the release of Palestinian prisoners. Mr. Burns said he could not guarantee that the current talks would succeed. 'And it breaks your heart because you can see in very human terms what's at stake here as well,' he said. Mr. Burns also reiterated the Biden administration's desire that Israel not escalate its conflict with Iran, after what he called a failed Iranian attack last weekend. Instead, he said President Biden and other policymakers hope that 'we'll all find a way to de-escalate the situation.' 'I know the Israeli government, as we sit here this afternoon, is considering a response to what happened last Saturday night,' Mr. Burns said. 'And you know, that's their choice to make that response.' But Mr. Burns said the Israelis had 'clearly demonstrated their superiority' with shooting down Iranian drones and missiles. He said of 330 drones and missiles launched by Iran, only four or five hit the ground in Israel. 'And none of them did any significant damage,' he said. 'It's a reminder of the quality of the Israeli military. It's a reminder of the fact that the Israelis have friends, starting with the United States.' Palestinians rallied in Hebron, West Bank, to support the bid for statehood in 2011. Credit... Rina Castelnuovo for The New York Times A draft resolution that the United States vetoed at the U.N. Security Council on Thursday afternoon was the latest frustrated effort in a long-running campaign to secure recognition for Palestinian statehood. Still, that the matter made it to a Security Council vote at all reflects how the debate over Palestinian statehood has been reinvigorated by the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The United Nations voted in 1947 to create an independent Arab state alongside a Jewish one, but the plan was rejected by neighboring Arab governments and Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel was founded amid a war the following year. In the years since, plans for a two-state solution have been repeatedly proposed and stymied. Here's a look at some of the Palestinian efforts to gain recognition. Palestine became a member of UNESCO in 2011 but a bid for full U.N. membership failed. The next year, Palestine was granted the lesser status of observer at the United Nations, a level shared by the Holy See. Observers can participate in U.N. General Assembly sessions but are not allowed to vote. They also can join the International Court of Justice, which is currently hearing a case on the legality of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories. Palestine is also party to a number of treaties, and became a member of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2018.

Clary/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images With the war raging in Gaza, the Palestinian Authority asked the United Nations to take up its bid a second time. Last Monday, as the war entered its seventh month, the Security Council agreed to reopen the application. The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, called it 'a historic moment again' and said that it was high time for the world body to recognize Palestinian statehood. That, he said, would 'open the door slightly in the direction of peace.' About 140 countries have gone on record in support of the Palestinian bid that reached the Security Council on Thursday. To succeed, the application needed the votes of at least nine of the 15 member countries, and no veto by any of its five permanent members. It received 12 votes, but the United States \u2014 which has a longstanding policy that Palestinian statehood must come as part of a negotiated agreement with Israel \u2014 used its veto power as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. Already, 138 of the 193 sovereign states that belong to the United Nations recognize Palestinian statehood, according to the World Population Review, including Russia and China \u2014 both permanent members of the Security Council. While the European Union itself does not recognize the state of Palestine, nearly a third of the bloc's 28 members do. The Vatican has also recognized Palestinian statehood.

Lynsey Addario for The New York Times Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has doubled down on his opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state, rebuffing pressure from President Biden to agree to that path after the war in Gaza ends. But as the death toll has climbed in Gaza, the push for Palestinian statehood has intensified. Allies like Canada, France and Britain have long shared the Biden administration's stance about the need for a two-state solution negotiated with Israel. But some have in recent months suggested that they might recognize a Palestinian state sooner. David Cameron, Britain's foreign secretary, signaled in January that Britain was willing to move up conversations about formally recognizing a Palestinian state, saying that his country and other allies should show Palestinians 'irreversible progress' toward that long-sought goal. In February, President Emmanuel Macron of France said, 'Recognition of a Palestinian state is not a taboo for France.' It was unclear whether Mr. Macron was referring to France's longstanding support for a two-state solution in general or to the idea of giving recognition before any negotiated agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians. And last month, the leaders of Spain, Ireland, Malta and Slovenia issued a joint statement saying that they had 'discussed together our readiness to recognize Palestine and said that we would do so when it can make a positive contribution and the circumstances are right.' The Security Council has consistently called for a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Credit... Angela Weiss/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images The United States blocked the U.N. Security Council on Thursday from moving forward on a Palestinian bid to be recognized as a full member state at the United Nations, quashing an effort by Palestinian allies to get the world body to back the effort. The Palestinian envoy to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, was visibly emotional after the vote, asking, 'What will you do \u2014 you, the international Security Council that is charged with the maintenance of international peace and security? What are you doing to do? What are you willing to do?' The Security Council has consistently called for a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, a result that has failed to materialize during negotiations between the two sides. In Washington, a spokesman for the State Department, Vedant Patel, said before the vote that the statehood resolution was dead on arrival. 'It remains the U.S. view that the most expeditious path toward statehood for the Palestinian people is through direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority with the support of the United States and other partners,' Mr. Patel told reporters at a news briefing on Thursday. The United States, along with the four other permanent members of the Council, can veto any action before it. Israel's foreign minister, Israel Katz, praised the U.S. decision to block the proposal on Thursday, saying, 'The shameful proposal was rejected. Terrorism will not be rewarded.' The resolution had asked the 15-member Security Council to recommend to the 193-member U.N. General Assembly that 'the State of Palestine be admitted to membership of the United Nations,' diplomats said. China was one of 12 countries that voted in favor of the proposal, and its ambassador to the United Nations, Fu Cong, said he found the U.S. veto 'most disappointing.' 'The decade-long dream of the Palestinian people ruthlessly dashed,' he said. Two countries, Britain and Switzerland, abstained from the vote, saying they supported a two-state solution but that the war in Gaza must be resolved first. 'We must keep our focus on securing an immediate pause in order to get aid in and hostages out, ' said Barbara Woodward, Britain's ambassador to the U.N. Israel was admitted as a full U.N. member in 1949. The Palestinian Authority has been seeking a state made up of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip for decades; those territories have all been captured or annexed by Israel. The Arab League founded the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1964 with a charter stressing self-determination for Palestinians and the rejection of the creation of the State of Israel. Little progress has been made on achieving statehood since Israel and the Palestinian Authority signed the Oslo Accords in the early 1990s, which established a peace process aimed at a two-state solution. In 2007, the militant group Hamas drove the Palestinian Authority \u2014 which President Mahmoud Abbas leads and which exercises limited self-rule in the occupied West Bank \u2014 from power in the Gaza Strip. Complicating the Palestinian application for statehood is the war that began when Hamas led terrorist attacks on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and prompted Israel's retaliatory attacks in Gaza. That war has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to the Gazan health ministry. The conflict has spilled into the occupied West Bank and neighboring countries like Lebanon and has drawn Iran into the fray. Anushka Patil contributed reporting. President Biden said in a statement that the sanctions aimed to 'further degrade Iran's military industries.' Credit... Al Drago for The New York Times The United States and Britain on Thursday imposed new sanctions on Iranian military leaders and weapon manufacturers to punish Tehran for its missile and drone attack on Israel last weekend, even as they implored Israeli officials not to retaliate too strongly and set off a wider war. White House officials said the sanctions were aimed at disrupting Iran's ability to produce the unmanned aerial vehicles that its military used to attack Israel by cutting off global financial transactions with companies and individuals involved in building them. The sanctions will also try to block exports by Iran's steel industry that bring Tehran billions of dollars in revenue, they said. President Biden said in a statement that the sanctions would 'further degrade Iran's military industries,' adding: 'Let it be clear to all those who enable or support Iran's attacks: The United States is committed to Israel's security.' In a coordinated move, Britain said it had imposed sanctions on seven people and six entities linked to Iran's regional military activity and its attack on Israel, which Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called a 'reckless act and a dangerous escalation.' 'These sanctions \u2014 announced with the U.S. \u2014 show we unequivocally condemn this behavior, and they will further limit Iran's ability to destabilize the region,' Mr. Sunak said in a statement. Earlier Thursday, the president of the European Council announced that new European Union sanctions would be imposed on Iran's drone and missile programs in an effort 'to isolate Iran.' The United States and European allies have been looking for ways to punish Iran while urging Israel not to retaliate in a way that could inflame a wider Middle East conflict. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that Israel will not let outside pressure determine its response, saying on Wednesday, 'We will make our own decisions.' Israel welcomed the announcement of new sanctions, with Foreign Minister Israel Katz thanking Mr. Biden 'for his ironclad commitment to Israel's security.' 'This is our opportunity to form a global front and a regional coalition against Iran, together with the US, the EU, and moderate Arab states, to stop the serpent's head that threatens global stability,' Mr. Katz wrote on social media. 'We must stop Iran now before it's too late.' But it is unclear whether the new sanctions will prove more effective at degrading the Iranian military drone program than previous U.S. efforts. Last October, the Biden administration announced similar sanctions on the Iranian drone program, which officials said at the time were aimed at frustrating Iran's ability to produce just the kind of weapons that it used against Israel in the recent attacks. In a statement at the time, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said those penalties on several individuals and companies were meant to address 'one of the greatest challenges to international peace and security.' The attack on Israel over the weekend suggests that Iran's military has found ways around the previous sanctions. In his statement, Mr. Biden acknowledged the history of sanctions and vowed to continue increasing the pressure on Iran. 'During my administration, the United States has sanctioned over 600 individuals and entities \u2014 including Iran and its proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and Kataib Hezbollah,' he said, listing armed groups that Iran supports in the Middle East. 'And we will keep at it. As Israel's war cabinet continues to weigh a possible response to Iran \u2014 whose attack was itself in retaliation for a deadly April 1 strike against an Iranian Embassy building in Syria \u2014 Tehran has warned it will act harshly against any aggression. Maj. Gen. Ahmad Haghtalab, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps commander in charge of protecting Iran's nuclear sites, said that if Israel were to hit one of those targets, 'the hands are on the trigger' to strike Israeli nuclear facilities in response, according to remarks carried by Iranian state news media.

The agency, Fars News, said the cause of the explosions was not immediately clear.\nThe agency said the explosions were heard in Qahjavarestan, a small city in west-central Iran close to Isfahan airport. Flight tracking websites showed that civilian planes had diverted their routes away from the area.\nThe explosions came five days after Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel, its first direct attack on the country, in response to an Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria that killed seven Iranian officials on April 1.\nFor days, Israeli leaders have threatened to respond to Iran's strikes, which turned the two countries' yearslong shadow war into a direct confrontation.\nThe Israeli military declined to comment about the explosions on Friday in Iran.\nIran's army chief, Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi, said on Wednesday that Iran would respond to any Israeli aggression, according to remarks carried by the IRNA state news agency.\nPresident Biden has advised Israel against responding, amid fears that an Israeli counterattack would escalate into an all-out war. For more than six months, Israel has been fighting on two other fronts \u2014 against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Both are allies of Iran.\nPalestinians inspecting a damaged building on Wednesday after overnight strikes in Rafah, in southern Gaza. Credit... Mohammed Salem/Reuters President Biden's team sought again on Thursday to put the brakes on Israeli plans for a major military assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, prompting the Israelis to agree to rethink their approach and come back for further consultations, the White House said in a statement.\nDuring a virtual meeting led by Jake Sullivan, the president's national security adviser, the American side evaluated options for the attack presented by Israel but was not convinced that those plans met Mr. Biden's insistence that any operation be calibrated to minimize civilian casualties, according to the White House statement. The two sides agreed to 'meet again soon,' the statement said.\nThe meeting was convened just days after the United States came to Israel's defense against a barrage of more than 300 missiles and drones fired by Iran; Israeli, U.S. and other allied forces knocked down nearly all of the incoming Iranian weapons, resulting in little damage and no fatalities.\nDespite that close collaboration, though, the discussion on Thursday underscored that the two sides remained at odds over Israel's conduct of the war against Hamas in Gaza more than six months after the Oct. 7 terrorist attack.\n'U.S. participants expressed concerns with various courses of action in Rafah, and Israeli participants agreed to take these concerns into account and to have further follow up discussions between experts,' the White House statement said. The statement did not elaborate on the specific concerns.\nThe Israeli side was led by Ron Dermer, a close adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and member of the Israeli war cabinet, and Tzachi Hanegbi, the prime minister's national security adviser. The group discussed the Iran attack and efforts to defend Israel against future threats.\nThe White House statement emphasized that the United States shared Israel's goal 'to see Hamas defeated in Rafah,' but the president has resisted a ground operation out of fear of the consequences for more than 1 million Palestinians who have taken refuge there.\nA rally in Jerusalem this month calling for the release of hostages held by Hamas. Credit... Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times Negotiations for a cease-fire and the release of Israeli hostages have stalled because Hamas rejected the latest proposal put forth by Israel, Qatar and Egypt, the C.I.A. director said Thursday, putting the blame for a lack of progress in talks squarely on the group that led the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\nEarlier this month, William J. Burns, C.I.A. director and lead American negotiator, traveled to Cairo and pushed what he called 'a far-reaching proposal' that Egyptian and Qatari negotiators took to Hamas. The proposal contained an offer to allow some Gazans to return to the northern part of the enclave, a key Hamas demand.\nWhile Mr. Burns did not describe the details of that proposal, he said that so far Hamas has not accepted it.\n'It was a deep disappointment to get a negative reaction from Hamas,' said Mr. Burns, speaking at the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas. 'Right now, it's that negative reaction that really is standing in the way of innocent civilians in Gaza getting humanitarian relief that they so desperately need.'\nLast Sunday, Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, expressed regret that Hamas had rejected the proposal and argued it proved that the group was not interested in reaching a deal.\nOther American officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations, have said Hamas has signaled that it does not have enough women and civilian hostages in its control to consummate the first part of the deal, which would release 40 hostages over six weeks in return for a large number of Palestinian prisoners.\nA senior Hamas official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said there were not enough living civilian hostages left who met Israel's criteria to reach their proposed figure of 40 hostages over six weeks. He accused Israel of seeking to free captive soldiers for a lower price than that demanded by the group. Hamas has said most soldiers would be released in a later phase of a cease-fire deal.\nIn its latest proposal to negotiators, Hamas called for releasing fewer than 20 living hostages as part of an initial, six-week phase cease-fire deal, according to two Israeli officials familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Israel had hoped to see wounded and ill hostages freed, but Hamas was insisting on a far more narrow definition limited to the elderly and women, one of the officials said.\nLast year, Mr. Burns helped guide talks that led to the release of roughly 100 hostages in return for a temporary halt in fighting and the release of Palestinian prisoners. Mr. Burns said he could not guarantee that the current talks would succeed.\n'And it breaks your heart because you can see in very human terms what's at stake here as well,' he said.\nMr. Burns also reiterated the Biden administration's desire that Israel not escalate its conflict with Iran, after what he called a failed Iranian attack last weekend. Instead, he said President Biden and other policymakers hope that 'we'll all find a way to de-escalate the situation.'\n'I know the Israeli government, as we sit here this afternoon, is considering a response to what happened last Saturday night,' Mr. Burns said. 'And you know, that's their choice to make that response.'\nBut Mr. Burns said the Israelis had 'clearly demonstrated their superiority' with shooting down Iranian drones and missiles. He said of 330 drones and missiles launched by Iran, only four or five hit the ground in Israel.\n'And none of them did any significant damage,' he said. 'It's a reminder of the quality of the Israeli military. It's a reminder of the fact that the Israelis have friends, starting with the United States.'\nPalestinians rallied in Hebron, West Bank, to support the bid for statehood in 2011. Credit... Rina Castelnuovo for The New York Times A draft resolution that the United States vetoed at the U.N. Security Council on Thursday afternoon was the latest frustrated effort in a long-running campaign to secure recognition for Palestinian statehood.\nStill, that the matter made it to a Security Council vote at all reflects how the debate over Palestinian statehood has been reinvigorated by the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\nThe United Nations voted in 1947 to create an independent Arab state alongside a Jewish one, but the plan was rejected by neighboring Arab governments and Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel was founded amid a war the following year. In the years since, plans for a two-state solution have been repeatedly proposed and stymied.\nHere's a look at some of the Palestinian efforts to gain recognition.\nPalestine became a member of UNESCO in 2011 but a bid for full U.N. membership failed. The next year, Palestine was granted the lesser status of observer at the United Nations, a level shared by the Holy See.\nObservers can participate in U.N. General Assembly sessions but are not allowed to vote. They also can join the International Court of Justice, which is currently hearing a case on the legality of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories.\nPalestine is also party to a number of treaties, and became a member of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2018.\nMahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, with a copy of a letter requesting Palestine's full admission to the United Nations at the General Assembly in 2011. Credit... Timothy A. Clary/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images With the war raging in Gaza, the Palestinian Authority asked the United Nations to take up its bid a second time. Last Monday, as the war entered its seventh month, the Security Council agreed to reopen the application. The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, called it 'a historic moment again' and said that it was high time for the world body to recognize Palestinian statehood. That, he said, would 'open the door slightly in the direction of peace.'\nAbout 140 countries have gone on record in support of the Palestinian bid that reached the Security Council on Thursday.\nTo succeed, the application needed the votes of at least nine of the 15 member countries, and no veto by any of its five permanent members. It received 12 votes, but the United States \u2014 which has a longstanding policy that Palestinian statehood must come as part of a negotiated agreement with Israel \u2014 used its veto power as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council.\nAlready, 138 of the 193 sovereign states that belong to the United Nations recognize Palestinian statehood, according to the World Population Review, including Russia and China \u2014 both permanent members of the Security Council.\nWhile the European Union itself does not recognize the state of Palestine, nearly a third of the bloc's 28 members do.\nThe Vatican has also recognized Palestinian statehood.\nA giant chair symbolizing the statehood of Palestine in Ramallah, in the West Bank, in 2011. Credit... Lynsey Addario for The New York Times Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has doubled down on his opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state, rebuffing pressure from President Biden to agree to that path after the war in Gaza ends. But as the death toll has climbed in Gaza, the push for Palestinian statehood has intensified.\nAllies like Canada, France and Britain have long shared the Biden administration's stance about the need for a two-state solution negotiated with Israel. But some have in recent months suggested that they might recognize a Palestinian state sooner.\nDavid Cameron, Britain's foreign secretary, signaled in January that Britain was willing to move up conversations about formally recognizing a Palestinian state, saying that his country and other allies should show Palestinians 'irreversible progress' toward that long-sought goal.\nIn February, President Emmanuel Macron of France said, 'Recognition of a Palestinian state is not a taboo for France.' It was unclear whether Mr. Macron was referring to France's longstanding support for a two-state solution in general or to the idea of giving recognition before any negotiated agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians.\nAnd last month, the leaders of Spain, Ireland, Malta and Slovenia issued a joint statement saying that they had 'discussed together our readiness to recognize Palestine and said that we would do so when it can make a positive contribution and the circumstances are right.'\nThe Security Council has consistently called for a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Credit... Angela Weiss/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images The United States blocked the U.N. Security Council on Thursday from moving forward on a Palestinian bid to be recognized as a full member state at the United Nations, quashing an effort by Palestinian allies to get the world body to back the effort.\nThe Palestinian envoy to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, was visibly emotional after the vote, asking, 'What will you do \u2014 you, the international Security Council that is charged with the maintenance of international peace and security? What are you doing to do? What are you willing to do?'\nThe Security Council has consistently called for a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, a result that has failed to materialize during negotiations between the two sides. In Washington, a spokesman for the State Department, Vedant Patel, said before the vote that the statehood resolution was dead on arrival.\n'It remains the U.S. view that the most expeditious path toward statehood for the Palestinian people is through direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority with the support of the United States and other partners,' Mr. Patel told reporters at a news briefing on Thursday.\nThe United States, along with the four other permanent members of the Council, can veto any action before it. Israel's foreign minister, Israel Katz, praised the U.S. decision to block the proposal on Thursday, saying, 'The shameful proposal was rejected. Terrorism will not be rewarded.'\nThe resolution had asked the 15-member Security Council to recommend to the 193-member U.N. General Assembly that 'the State of Palestine be admitted to membership of the United Nations,' diplomats said.\nChina was one of 12 countries that voted in favor of the proposal, and its ambassador to the United Nations, Fu Cong, said he found the U.S. veto 'most disappointing.'\n'The decade-long dream of the Palestinian people ruthlessly dashed,' he said.\nTwo countries, Britain and Switzerland, abstained from the vote, saying they supported a two-state solution but that the war in Gaza must be resolved first.\n'We must keep our focus on securing an immediate pause in order to get aid in and hostages out, ' said Barbara Woodward, Britain's ambassador to the U.N.\nIsrael was admitted as a full U.N. member in 1949. The Palestinian Authority has been seeking a state made up of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip for decades; those territories have all been captured or annexed by Israel. The Arab League founded the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1964 with a charter stressing self-determination for Palestinians and the rejection of the creation of the State of Israel.\nLittle progress has been made on achieving statehood since Israel and the Palestinian Authority signed the Oslo Accords in the early 1990s, which established a peace process aimed at a two-state solution. In 2007, the militant group Hamas drove the Palestinian Authority \u2014 which President Mahmoud Abbas leads and which exercises limited self-rule in the occupied West Bank \u2014 from power in the Gaza Strip.\nComplicating the Palestinian application for statehood is the war that began when Hamas led terrorist attacks on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and prompted Israel's retaliatory attacks in Gaza. That war has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to the Gazan health ministry. The conflict has spilled into the occupied West Bank and neighboring countries like Lebanon and has drawn Iran into the fray.\nAnushka Patil contributed reporting.\nPresident Biden said in a statement that the sanctions aimed to 'further degrade Iran's military industries.' Credit... Al Drago for The New York Times The United States and Britain on Thursday imposed new sanctions on Iranian military leaders and weapon manufacturers to punish Tehran for its missile and drone attack on Israel last weekend, even as they implored Israeli officials not to retaliate too strongly and set off a wider war.\nWhite House officials said the sanctions were aimed at disrupting Iran's ability to produce the unmanned aerial vehicles that its military used to attack Israel by cutting off global financial transactions with companies and individuals involved in building them. The sanctions will also try to block exports by Iran's steel industry that bring Tehran billions of dollars in revenue, they said.\nPresident Biden said in a statement that the sanctions would 'further degrade Iran's military industries,' adding: 'Let it be clear to all those who enable or support Iran's attacks: The United States is committed to Israel's security.'\nIn a coordinated move, Britain said it had imposed sanctions on seven people and six entities linked to Iran's regional military activity and its attack on Israel, which Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called a 'reckless act and a dangerous escalation.'\n'These sanctions \u2014 announced with the U.S. \u2014 show we unequivocally condemn this behavior, and they will further limit Iran's ability to destabilize the region,' Mr. Sunak said in a statement.\nEarlier Thursday, the president of the European Council announced that new European Union sanctions would be imposed on Iran's drone and missile programs in an effort 'to isolate Iran.'\nThe United States and European allies have been looking for ways to punish Iran while urging Israel not to retaliate in a way that could inflame a wider Middle East conflict. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that Israel will not let outside pressure determine its response, saying on Wednesday, 'We will make our own decisions.'\nIsrael welcomed the announcement of new sanctions, with Foreign Minister Israel Katz thanking Mr. Biden 'for his ironclad commitment to Israel's security.'\n'This is our opportunity to form a global front and a regional coalition against Iran, together with the US, the EU, and moderate Arab states, to stop the serpent's head that threatens global stability,' Mr. Katz wrote on social media. 'We must stop Iran now before it's too late.'\nBut it is unclear whether the new sanctions will prove more effective at degrading the Iranian military drone program than previous U.S. efforts.\nLast October, the Biden administration announced similar sanctions on the Iranian drone program, which officials said at the time were aimed at frustrating Iran's ability to produce just the kind of weapons that it used against Israel in the recent attacks.\nIn a statement at the time, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said those penalties on several individuals and companies were meant to address 'one of the greatest challenges to international peace and security.'\nThe attack on Israel over the weekend suggests that Iran's military has found ways around the previous sanctions.\nIn his statement, Mr. Biden acknowledged the history of sanctions and vowed to continue increasing the pressure on Iran.\n'During my administration, the United States has sanctioned over 600 individuals and entities \u2014 including Iran and its proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and Kataib Hezbollah,' he said, listing armed groups that Iran supports in the Middle East.

Top members of the World Anti-Doping Agency are scheduled to attend the event, which starts Thursday.\n'The United States stands by its commitment to ensure that every American athlete and those across the globe are provided a level playing field and a fair shot in international athletic competitions,' Dr. Gupta said in response to questions from The New York Times.

In September 2022, the company said it would build a $15 billion factory in its hometown, Boise, Idaho, the first new U.S. memory chip plant in 20 years. A month later, Micron said it would build a giant manufacturing complex near Syracuse, N.Y., pledging to start with a $20 billion project by the end of the decade and spending as much as $100 billion over the next two decades or more. The complex could eventually include up to four new manufacturing plants.\nA senior Biden administration official confirmed the award and said it would help create thousands of jobs. Company officials have said the investment is expected to create roughly 50,000 jobs, including about 9,000 direct positions at its plants.\nThe announcement is the latest award from federal officials to chipmakers in recent weeks. The funding stems from the CHIPS Act, which a bipartisan group of lawmakers passed in 2022 to re-establish the United States as leader in the production of semiconductors, the foundational components that power everything from phones and supercomputers to cars and weapons systems. Equipped with $39 billion, the Commerce Department has distributed several grants to chip manufacturers as an incentive for them to build and expand facilities in the United States.\nThe initiative is intended to strengthen the domestic supply of semiconductors. Although semiconductors were invented in America, manufacturing has largely shifted overseas. Only about 10 percent of the world's semiconductors are currently made in the United States.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The company planned to produce silicon wafers, a critical part of the technology that allows solar panels to turn sunlight into electrical energy.\nThe Massachusetts-based company called the investment a 'direct result of the long-term industrial policy contained within the Inflation Reduction Act,' the 2022 law that directed billions of dollars to develop America's domestic clean energy sectors. CubicPV was considering locations in Texas, where it would employ about 1,000 workers.\nBut a surge of cheap solar panels from China upended that project. In February, CubicPV canceled its plans to build the factory over concerns it would no longer be financially viable thanks to a flood of Chinese exports. As CubicPV was gearing up to make wafers in the United States, prices of those components were dropping by 70 percent.\nThe setback underscores the concerns rippling across the U.S. solar industry and within the Biden administration about whether President Biden's industrial policy agenda can succeed. Top administration officials have begun warning that efforts to finance a domestic clean energy industry are being undermined by a surge of cheaper Chinese exports that are driving down prices and putting the United States at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe fate of the CubicPV factory is the type of outcome that Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen has warned is likely if China does not stop dumping heavily subsidized green energy products into global markets at rock bottom prices. She took that message to China last week, warning that its industrial strategy was warping supply chains and threatening American workers.\nChina appeared to dismiss those concerns. Following Ms. Yellen's meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, his office said, 'The development of China's new energy industry will make an important contribution to the worldwide green and low-carbon transition.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The fourth bill was meant to sweeten the deal for conservatives.\nMr. Johnson structured the measures, which will be melded together into one after each piece is approved, to capture different coalitions of support without allowing opposition to any one element to sink the whole deal. Each of the aid bills for the three nations is expected to pass overwhelmingly, and the Senate is expected to take it up quickly and send the legislation to President Biden's desk, capping its tortured path to enactment.\nThe legislation includes $60 billion for Kyiv; $26 billion for Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza; and $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific. It would direct the president to seek repayment from the Ukrainian government of $10 billion in economic assistance, a stipulation supported by former President Donald J. Trump, who has pushed for any aid to Ukraine to be in the form of a loan. But the legislation also would allow the president to forgive those loans starting in 2026.\nThe scene that is expected to play out on the House floor on Saturday will reflect both the broad bipartisan support in Congress for continuing to help the Ukrainian military beat back Russian forces, and the extraordinary political risk taken by Mr. Johnson to defy the anti-interventionist wing of his party who had blocked the measure for months. In the end, the speaker, himself an ultraconservative who had previously voted against funding Ukraine's war effort, circumvented his right flank and was relying on Democrats to push the measure through.\nFor months, it was uncertain whether Congress would approve another round of funding for Ukraine, even as the momentum of the war in Ukraine shifted in Russia's favor. Republicans dug in against another aid package for Kyiv unless President Biden agreed to stringent anti-immigration measures, and then refused to take up legislation that paired the aid with stiffer border enforcement provisions.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Exposure to PFAS has been associated with metabolic disorders, decreased fertility in women, developmental delays in children and increased risk of some prostate, kidney and testicular cancers, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\nThe chemicals are so ubiquitous that they can be found in the blood of almost every person in the United States. In 2022, the E.P.A. found the chemicals could cause harm at levels 'much lower than previously understood' and that almost no level of exposure was safe.\nThe pair of compounds are part of a larger family of chemical substances known collectively as PFAS.\nThe announcement follows an extraordinary move last week from the E.P.A. mandating that water utilities reduce the PFAS in drinking water to near-zero levels.

Trump that they fear could bring an end to U.S. support for Ukraine, some of Russia's most fervent foes are taking a different tack: making nice with the Trump camp.\nTo that end, the governing party of Lithuania, a steadfast supporter of Ukraine, last month organized meetings between Ukrainians, Baltic politicians who want increases in military spending to counter Russia, and a group of former Trump administration officials. Also attending were members of pro-Trump groups like the Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative group skeptical about helping Ukraine.\nLeading the participants from Ukraine was Oleksandr Merezhko, the chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament's foreign affairs committee and an ally of President Volodymyr Zelensky. Reaching out to the Trump camp, he said, was simply a recognition of Ukraine's perilous vulnerability to the shifting sands of American politics.\n'When we are fighting for our survival, we can't afford to antagonize either Biden or Trump,' Mr. Merezhko said. 'If we place the wrong bet, we risk losing our country.'\nMr. Trump has not detailed his plans for Ukraine if he is re-elected, but many of his supporters are strongly opposed to helping the country in its battle against Russia.\nOleksandr Merezhko, left, the chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament's foreign affairs committee, and Zygimantas Pavilionis, a conservative member of Lithuania's Parliament, in Washington in February.

Campbell told Niger's prime minister, Ali Lamine Zeine, that the United States disagreed with the country's turn toward Russia for security and Iran for a possible deal on its uranium reserves, and the failure of Niger's military government to map out a path to return to democracy, according to a senior State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic talks.\nThe decision was not a particular surprise. Niger said last month that it was revoking its military cooperation deal with the United States following a highly contentious set of meetings in Niger's capital, Niamey, with a high-level American diplomatic and military delegation.\nThat move was in keeping with a recent pattern by countries in the Sahel region, an arid area south of the Sahara, of breaking ties with Western countries. Increasingly, they are partnering with Russia instead.\nAmerican diplomats have sought in the past several weeks to salvage a revamped military cooperation deal with Niger's military government, U.S. officials said, but in the end they failed to strike a compromise.\nThe talks collapsed amid a growing wave of ill feelings toward the U.S. presence in Niger. Thousands of protesters in the capital last Saturday called for the withdrawal of American armed forces personnel only days after Russia delivered its own set of military equipment and instructors to the country's military.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Mr. Netanyahu said in a social media post that his government would 'act by all means' against any such move.\nThe news about the possible sanctions, reported earlier by Axios, came only a day after the House approved $26 billion for Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza. The sanctions, if imposed, would not hold up the military aid that was just approved in Congress.\nOn Sunday, Palestinians in the West Bank went on a general strike to protest a deadly Israeli military raid at a refugee camp. At least 10 people were killed in the raid on Saturday, the latest operation in a sweeping economic and security clampdown in the Israeli-occupied territory.\nSince the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed and detained in raids in the West Bank, which Israeli officials describe as counterterrorism operations against Hamas and other armed groups.\nThe strike on Sunday 'paralyzed all aspects of life' in the West Bank, with shops, schools, universities and banks shuttered, according to the official Palestinian news agency, Wafa.

A national security court this month granted a request from the government that allows the program to operate for another year, even if the law, known as Section 702, expires. Still, it is true that such an expiration could lead to smaller gaps in collecting some messages.\nHere is a closer look.\nIt is a law that authorizes the government to collect, without a warrant and from U.S. companies like AT&T and Google, messages of foreigners abroad who are targeted for intelligence or counterterrorism purposes.\nThe idea is that in the internet era, foreigners' communications are often handled by domestic companies. But it is controversial because the government also sweeps up messages of Americans to and from those foreign targets.\nThe law traces back to a warrantless wiretapping program that President George W. Bush secretly created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. It violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, which requires warrants for national security wiretapping on domestic soil.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The basketball star's long-distance shots and huge following have landed her on 'Saturday Night Live,' attracted interest from sponsors like Nike and sold out jerseys at a rapid pace.\nIn exchange for Clark's once-in-a-generation talent, the W.N.B.A. will pay her \u2026 $76,535.\nNews of the paltry first-year salary has ignited a countrywide debate that even President Biden weighed in on, commenting that 'even if you're the best, women are not paid their fair share.'\nIt also highlighted a hard truth that largely goes unspoken about the W.N.B.A. and many women's sports leagues: They aren't profitable.\nThe simplest reason the W.N.B.A. isn't paying Clark more is that the league brings in just $200 million annually and relies on the N.B.A. for some of its funding. The N.B.A., by contrast, brings in about $10 billion.\nWhen the N.B.A. and its commissioner at the time, David Stern, founded the W.N.B.A. in 1996, return on their investment wasn't their immediate focus. As Stern later recounted, he wanted 'to develop new fans, more programming, have arena content outside the N.B.A. season, give more girls an incentive to play basketball.'\nAnd, he added, 'we knew it was going to be a long haul.'\nIndeed, many argue that the W.N.B.A. simply needs more time: The N.B.A. had a 50-year head start, and stars like Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan helped lift it up in the 1980s and '90s.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The review provides new details about the Islamic State bomber who carried out the suicide mission, including how he slipped into the crowds trying to evacuate the capital's airport just moments before detonating explosives.\nSome Marines who were at the gate have said they identified the suspected bomber \u2014 who became known to investigators as 'Bald Man in Black' \u2014 in the crowds hours before the attack but were twice denied permission by their superiors to shoot him. But the review, building on a previous investigation made public in February 2022, rejected those accusations.\nThe narrative of missed opportunities to avert tragedy has gained momentum over the past year among conservatives and has contributed to broader Republican criticisms of the Biden administration's troop withdrawal and evacuation from Kabul in August 2021.\nThe bombing was a searing experience for the military after 20 years of war in Afghanistan. Thirteen flag-draped coffins were flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, and a succession of funerals were held across the country for the service members, most of them under the age of 25.\nMilitary officials had stood by the conclusions of the earlier inquiry that a lone Islamic State suicide bomber carried out the attack and was not joined by accomplices firing into the crowd.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

President Biden and the Democrats, with whom Mr. Lammy has cultivated a deep network of contacts, are fighting to hold off a resurgent Donald J. Trump.\nHaving been chosen by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, partly because of his trans-Atlantic credentials, Mr. Lammy, 51, is scrambling to build ties with Republicans and, more challengingly, with those around Mr. Trump. It's a very different American establishment from the Democratic one he knows so well.\nWould Mr. Lammy pay a visit to Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's Palm Beach estate, as David Cameron, Britain's current foreign secretary, did two weeks ago to lobby the former president on military aid to Ukraine?\n'Of course,' he said in an interview this week in Portcullis House, the parliamentary office building across the street from Big Ben.

The arrangement's unraveling and the spike in superpower tensions make this a dangerous moment.","summary":"When Iran agreed to a deal in 2015 that would require it to surrender 97 percent of the uranium it could use to make nuclear bombs, Russia and China worked alongside the United States and Europe to get the pact done.\nThe Russians even took Iran's nuclear fuel, for a hefty fee, prompting celebratory declarations that President Vladimir V. Putin could cooperate with the West on critical security issues and help constrain a disruptive regime in a volatile region.\nA lot has changed in the subsequent nine years. China and Russia are now more aligned with Iran's 'Axis of Resistance' to an American-led order, along with the likes of North Korea. When President Biden gathered the leaders of six nations for a video call from the White House on Sunday to plot a common strategy for de-escalating the crisis between Israel and Iran, there was no chance of getting anyone from Beijing or Moscow on the screen.\nThe disappearance of that unified front is one of the many factors that make this moment seems 'particularly dangerous,' said Vali Nasr, an Iranian-born professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, 'maybe the most dangerous in decades.'\nBut it is hardly the only one.\nPresident Donald J. Trump's decision to pull out of the Obama-era nuclear deal triggered a predictable counterreaction from Tehran, and after a long pause, Iran resumed enriching uranium \u2014 some to near-bomb-grade quality. Today it is far closer to producing a bomb than it was when the accord was in effect.\nIran has moved forward with its ballistic missile programs, and some of those weapons were used against Israel this weekend.

The coalition first sprang up last year to spare the government a catastrophic debt default, and has reassembled at key moments since then to keep federal agencies funded.\nUnable to deliver legislation on their own because of a razor-thin majority and the refusal of those on the right to give ground, House Republicans had no choice but to break with their fringe members and join with Democrats if they wanted to accomplish much of anything, including bolstering Ukraine in its war against Russia.\n'Look at what MAGA extremism has got you: nothing,' Representative James P. McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, told Republicans on the House floor as lawmakers took their first steps toward approving the aid package. 'Nothing. Not a damn thing. In fact, it has empowered Democrats. At every critical juncture in this Congress, it has been Democrats who have been the ones to stand up for our country and do the right thing for the American people.'\nThe moments of bipartisan coming-together are hardly a template for a new paradigm of governing in polarized times. The grudging G.O.P. collaboration with Democrats has only come about on truly existential, must-pass legislation \u2014 and typically only at the last minute after Republicans have exhausted all other options, making the coalition unlikely to hold on less critical bills and the social policy issues that sharply divide the two parties.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Israel said almost nothing about the limited strike, which appeared to do little damage in Iran. U.S. officials noted that the Iranian decision to downplay the explosions in Isfahan \u2014 and the suggestions by Iranian officials that Israel may not have been responsible \u2014 was a clear effort by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps to avoid another round of escalation.\nInside the White House, officials asked the Pentagon, State Department and intelligence agencies to stay quiet about the operation, hoping to ease Iran's efforts to calm the tensions in the region.\nBut in interviews, officials quickly added they worried that relations between Israel and Iran were now in a very different place than they had been just a week ago. The taboo against direct strikes on each other's territory was now gone. If there is another round \u2014 a conflict over Iran's nuclear advances, or another strike by Israel on Iranian military officers \u2014 both sides might feel more free to launch directly at the other.\nMr. Netanyahu was under competing pressures: President Biden was urging him to 'take the win' after a largely ineffective aerial barrage launched by Iran last week, while hard-liners in Israel were urging him to strike back hard to re-establish deterrence after the first direct effort to strike Israel from Iranian territory in the 45 years since the Iranian revolution.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Many media outlets \u2014 including The New York Times \u2014 have used 'hush-money trial' as a shorthand for the proceedings. It's a nod to the fact that Trump is accused of directing a payoff, and then falsifying business records, to cover up a potential sex scandal involving a porn star.\nAlvin Bragg, the district attorney in Manhattan, has argued that the case is about something much bigger: that the payment, made to Stormy Daniels, was part of an effort to hide information from voters ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n'It's an election interference case,' he said in an interview on NY1 in January.\nTrump, who has always understood the power of catchy shorthand, is trying to label the case the 'Biden trial,' falsely claiming that the charges have been orchestrated by the president to influence the 2024 election.\nDisagreement over the most basic facts is a fixture of American politics, particularly when Trump is involved. He has described the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, as a beautiful day. He wrongly says the 2020 election was stolen. So it is not surprising that he has tried to reframe his trial as interference in the 2024 election \u2014 even as he tries to wield it to his benefit by using it to grab attention in New York and solicit funds across the country.\nCrucially, the judge, Juan Merchan, seems to echo Bragg's framing of the case \u2014 and it is his interpretation that could matter most.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Israel said its aims were to defeat Hamas and free the hostages taken that day, around 100 of whom remain in Gaza. Local health authorities say the war has killed more than 33,000 people, and the United Nations says the population is on the brink of famine.\nHere is a look at where the military conflict stands:\nIsrael withdrew its forces from southern Gaza this month, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that the military still plans to invade Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, to 'complete the elimination of Hamas's battalions' and to destroy its tunnel networks.\nMourning over the bodies of relatives in Rafah, in southern Gaza, on Tuesday.

But passage of those measures, each of which enjoys bipartisan support from different coalitions, was not in doubt, making Friday's action the key indicator that the legislation will have the backing needed to prevail.\nThe rule for considering the bill \u2014 historically a straight party-line vote \u2014 passed with more Democratic than Republican support, but it also won a majority of G.O.P. votes, making it clear that despite a pocket of deep resistance from the far right, there is broad bipartisan backing for the $95.3 billion package.\nThe vote was an enormous victory in the long effort to fund to Ukraine as it battles against Russian aggression, a major priority of President Biden that has met with bitter resistance from the right. It was a triumph against the forces of isolationism within the G.O.P. and a major moment of bipartisan consensus in a Congress that for the past year has been mostly defined by its dysfunction.\nBut it came only after Speaker Mike Johnson, who put his own job on the line to push through the plan over his party's objections, was forced to turn to Democrats in a significant breach of custom in the House, further imperiling his position even as he paved the way for the legislation to be voted on and approved.\nOn the House floor, Democrats held back their votes until it was clear there was not enough Republican support for the measure to pass without their backing, and then their 'yes' votes began pouring in. Ultimately, 165 Democrats voted for the measure, more than the 149 Republicans who supported it.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump was evidently not happy with what he saw out the window of his chauffeured S.U.V. as he rode through Lower Manhattan on Monday morning for the beginning of opening arguments in his first criminal trial.\nThe scene that confronted him as he approached the dingy courthouse at 100 Centre Street was underwhelming. Across the street, at Collect Pond Park, the designated site for protesters during the trial, only a handful of Trump supporters had gathered, and the number would not grow much throughout the morning.\nMr. Trump has portrayed his legal jeopardy as a threat to America itself, and he has suggested that the country would not put up with it. But the streets around the courthouse on Monday were chaos-free \u2014 well-patrolled and relatively quiet. As his motorcade made its way to the courthouse, the few Trump supporters gathered in the park were outnumbered by Trump detractors, who waved signs about his alleged liaison with a porn star.\nMr. Trump had tried to gin up something noisier. Shortly after 7 a.m., he posted on his social media website that 'America Loving Protesters should be allowed to protest at the front steps of Courthouses' and he followed this lament with a call for his supporters to 'GO OUT AND PEACEFULLY PROTEST.

Trump has signaled that he will accomplish all this by appointing loyalists, rather than the more moderate military leaders and corporate executives from his first term.\nEven so, many C.E.O.s are unconcerned, as my colleague Jonathan Mahler described them in a recent article. They don't believe Trump will do what he has promised, in contrast to many scholars who have studied politicians like Trump and believe that he will follow through.\nTo make sense of the situation, I asked for help from Jonathan and three Times reporters who have been covering Trump's second-term plans: Maggie Haberman, Charlie Savage and Jonathan Swan.

At least for the moment.","summary":"Two weeks ago, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain was facing a chorus of calls to cut off arms shipments to Israel because of its devastating war in Gaza. On Monday, Mr. Sunak saluted the British warplanes that had shot down several Iranian drones as part of a successful campaign to thwart Iran's attack on Israel.\nIt was a telling example of how the clash between Israel and Iran has scrambled the equation in the Middle East. Faced with a barrage of Iranian missiles, Britain, the United States, France and others rushed to Israel's aid. They set aside their anger over Gaza to defend it from a country they view as an archnemesis, even as they pleaded for restraint in Israel's response to the Iranian assault.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose approval of a deadly airstrike on a meeting of Iranian generals in Damascus on April 1 provoked Iran's retaliation, has managed to change the narrative, according to British and American diplomats and analysts. But it could prove to be a fleeting change, they said, if Mr. Netanyahu orders a counterstrike damaging enough to pitch the region into wider war.\n'We would urge them to take the win at this point,' Mr. Sunak said in Parliament, borrowing a phrase that President Biden used in a phone call with Mr. Netanyahu on Sunday after Iran's attack had been mostly repelled.\nMr. Sunak was expected to have his own call with Mr. Netanyahu on Tuesday, part of a full-court press by European leaders to urge him not to allow the clash with Iran to spiral uncontrollably. President Emmanuel Macron of France, which played a supporting role in the military operation, told a French news channel, 'We will do everything to avoid a conflagration \u2014 that is to say, an escalation.'\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain making a statement in the House of Commons on Monday about the Iranian missile attack.

He drew only about $216,100 from other donors in that time, according to the filings.\nMr. Trone is seeking to make up ground in his hotly contested Democratic primary against Angela Alsobrooks, the prominent executive of Prince George's County, and a slate of lesser known candidates. Now in his third term in the House of Representatives, Mr. Trone has picked up endorsements from top House Democrats. But his use of the slur has drawn criticism.\nLast month, while praising President Biden's tax proposals at a congressional budget hearing, Mr. Trone dropped a derogatory term used to caricature Black people. He later apologized, adding that he misspoke and meant to say 'bugaboo.' 'Regardless of what I meant to say, I shouldn't have used that language, and I apologize,' he said at the time.\nFive Black Democrats in the House then endorsed Ms. Alsobrooks, who is Black, though they made no mention of the slur. She ended the latest quarter with nearly $3.2 million cash on hand, according to federal filings. The primary is on May 14.\nThe winner is likely to face Larry Hogan, a popular former governor of the state who is seeking the Republican nomination, in what is expected to be a competitive general election. While Maryland has not elected a Republican senator in more than 40 years, it elected Mr. Hogan as governor twice.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

But with Israel still weighing its response, the attack's military and diplomatic consequences have yet to be determined.","summary":"The enormous salvo of Iranian weapons fired at Israel this weekend turned the countries' long-running shadow war into a direct confrontation, raising fears that the countries' old paradigm of trading carefully measured blows had been replaced by something more overt, violent and risky.\nBut by Monday, Israel had yet to respond to the Iranian assault. Rather than preparing the public for a showdown with its archrival, the government signaled a return to relative normalcy, lifting restrictions on large gatherings and allowing schools to reopen.\nSome right-wing Israeli politicians, dismayed by the lack of an immediate response, have argued that Israel needs to strike back forcefully \u2014 and soon \u2014 or risk losing its deterrence. Other more centrist officials have argued that Israel should instead bide its time before responding and capitalize on the support it has received from allies and regional actors, who are otherwise angry about Israel's war in Gaza.\nAny forceful Israeli response would risk angering President Biden, who has pressed Israel to de-escalate and whose military support Israel would need in the event of a major confrontation. Israel has already drawn the president's criticism for dragging out the war in Gaza, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel must weigh the perceived benefits of retaliation against the risk of further displeasing the president and the potential cost \u2014 both human and financial \u2014 of fighting two wars at the same time.\nAn Israeli official briefed on cabinet discussions who requested anonymity to discuss security matters said that as of Monday several options were being considered, ranging from diplomacy to an imminent strike, but gave no further details.\nIn short, the next steps in the conflict remain uncertain.\nThe nature of Israel's response, analysts said, could increase or decrease the possibility of a regional war. And it could improve or strain Israel's ties with Arab nations who share an antipathy for Iran but have been critical of the war in Gaza.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

They came after a remark from President Biden last week that the administration was considering a request from Mr. Assange's home country of Australia that he be allowed to return there, prompting speculation that the U.S. could be rethinking the case.\nBut the filing of the commitments, requested by a British court last month as part of Mr. Assange's five-year battle against extradition to the United States, suggested that American authorities may still be pursuing his removal.\nMr. Assange, 52, was the head of WikiLeaks in 2010 when it published tens of thousands of classified military and diplomatic documents leaked by Chelsea Manning, an Army intelligence analyst. He has been held in a high-security British prison since the charges were filed in 2019. Before that, he had taken refuge for years in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London. The charges raised questions about First Amendment issues, and some saw them as a threat to press freedom.\nMr. Assange's extradition was put on hold by the court earlier this year pending assurances about his treatment if he were sent to the United States, as the judges sought commitments that he would not be penalized for his nationality, that he would be able to seek protections under the First Amendment and that he would not face the death penalty.\nIn a letter to the British Foreign Office, the U.S. Embassy in London said that Mr. Assange, who is Australian, 'will not be prejudiced by reason of his nationality,' promising that, if he were extradited, he would have the ability to seek 'the rights and protections given under the First Amendment.' The Embassy also noted that the death penalty would 'neither be sought or imposed' in his case.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Minutes before the vote on assistance for Kyiv, Democrats began to wave small Ukrainian flags on the House floor, as hard-right Republicans jeered.\nThe legislation includes $60 billion for Kyiv; $26 billion for Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza; and $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific region. It would direct the president to seek repayment from the Ukrainian government of $10 billion in economic assistance, a concept supported by former President Donald J. Trump, who had pushed for any aid to Kyiv to be in the form of a loan. But it also would allow the president to forgive those loans starting in 2026.\nIt also contained a measure to help pave the way to selling off frozen Russian sovereign assets to help fund the Ukrainian war effort, and a new round of sanctions on Iran. The Senate is expected to pass the legislation as early as Tuesday and send it to President Biden's desk, capping its tortured journey through Congress.\n'Our adversaries are working together to undermine our Western values and demean our democracy,' Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said Saturday as the House debated the measure. 'We cannot be afraid at this moment. We have to do what's right. Evil is on the march. History is calling and now is the time to act.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

It has said the goal of its offensive in Gaza is to eradicate Hamas, the armed group that has controlled the Gaza Strip for nearly two decades.\n'It was like an earthquake,' Mohammad al-Masri, a 31-year-old accountant who is sheltering with his family in a tent in a large Rafah encampment, said of the shaking from the strikes.\nThe first strike hit at a little past midnight, shaking the earth and lighting up the night sky, and a second one came soon after, he said. 'When we hear these strikes we don't know what to do,' he said. 'Everyone is saying the same thing, \u2018Where can we go?''\nPresident Biden and other world leaders have urged Israel not to invade Rafah because it would make an already dire humanitarian crisis even worse.\nBut Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not heeded those calls and claims a ground offensive is necessary to 'complete the elimination of Hamas's battalions' and to destroy its tunnel networks.\nSaturday's strikes stoked fears for Palestinians in Rafah that an invasion could be imminent.\nIn a briefing to the Security Council this week, Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said that Israel's military offensive in Rafah would 'compound this humanitarian catastrophe.'\nRahaf Al-Madhoun, 17, was streaming live on TikTok to talk about the living conditions in Rafah, when the first airstrike hit very close, she said. She stopped to collect herself before continuing. Then she described the terror sown by the strikes and the ever-present buzz of surveillance drones overhead.\n'We're at a loss, I swear,' she said.

Trump who is running for a Senate seat in Arizona, called on her supporters on Sunday to arm themselves ahead of an 'intense' period leading up to the election, urging them to 'strap on a Glock,' referring to a brand of firearm.\n'The next six months is going to be intense,' Ms. Lake said during a rally in Lake Havasu City. 'We're going to strap on our seatbelt. We're going to put on our helmet \u2014 or your Kari Lake ball cap. We are going to put on the armor of God. And maybe strap on a Glock on the side of us just in case.'\nThe crowd roared its approval, and she continued, 'You can put one here,' gesturing to the side of her hip, 'and one in the back or one in the front. Whatever you guys decide. Because we're not going to be the victims of crime. We're not going to have our Second Amendment taken away. We're certainly not going to have our First Amendment taken away by these tyrants.'\nWhen asked about Ms. Lake's remarks on Tuesday, Alex Nicoll, a representative of the campaign, said that 'Kari Lake is clearly talking about the Second Amendment right for Arizonans to defend themselves.'\nIt is not the first time Ms. Lake has alluded to armed conflict with her and her supporters. Last year, she said: 'If you want to get to President Trump, you are going to have go through me, and you are going to have to go through 75 million Americans just like me. And I'm going to tell you, most of us are card-carrying members of the N.R.A.,' referring to the National Rifle Association.

They ended the year in a political bind after two House members left to become mayors of suburbs, leaving that chamber with an even partisan split and making it impossible for Democrats to pass bills without Republican support.\nOn Tuesday, five months after their House majority evaporated, Democrats won two special elections to reclaim those seats and full control at the Michigan Capitol. The Associated Press said the Democrats Mai Xiong, a Macomb County commissioner, and Peter Herzberg, a Westland City Council member, defeated their Republican opponents.\nThe results of the special elections had never been in great doubt. Both districts, situated in the Detroit area, are liberal strongholds that Democratic candidates had carried by large margins in 2022. But the details of scheduling and running special elections meant a long, slow winter for Democratic lawmakers in Lansing while the House was evenly divided between the two parties. Michigan's governor, Gretchen Whitmer, is a Democrat, and her party has a majority in the State Senate.\nRepublicans hope the Democrats' renewed House majority is short-lived. Michigan, long a swing state, is expected to be a pivotal presidential battleground again this year. President Biden is working to rebuild a coalition that helped him win the state in 2020, but early polling has been favorable to former President Donald J. Trump. Republicans see an opening to deliver Michigan for Mr. Trump in November and to win control of the Michigan House, a goal that could be helped by newly redrawn legislative maps in the Detroit area. All 110 Michigan House seats are up for election in November, including the two seats that were contested on Tuesday.\nBefore losing their House majority last year, Michigan Democrats raced through a list of longstanding policy goals that had been stymied during decades of divided government or Republican control of the state. In the span of several months in 2023, Ms. Whitmer and legislative Democrats enacted new gun laws, codified civil rights for L.G.B.T.Q. people, solidified abortion rights and undid Republican laws that they said weakened labor unions.\nThose efforts slowed in November after one House member, Kevin Coleman, was elected mayor of Westland and another, Lori M. Stone, was elected mayor of Warren. Under Michigan law, Mr. Coleman and Ms. Stone had to resign from the Legislature when they became mayor.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Credit... Ilia Yefimovich/picture-alliance/dpa, via Associated Press The top diplomats from Britain and Germany visited Jerusalem on Wednesday in a bid to calm tensions in the Middle East, as Israel signaled that it would not let Iran's large aerial attack over the weekend go unanswered. David Cameron, the British foreign secretary, and Annalena Baerbock, Germany's foreign minister, held talks with President Isaac Herzog of Israel in the morning. Israeli news media said they were also set to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, as well as with war cabinet minister Benny Gantz and Foreign Minister Israel Katz. Mr. Cameron pressed for restraint while indicating that Israeli officials appear determined to take action after Iran's missile and drone assault, believed to be the first time in the two countries' decades-long shadow war that Tehran had taken aim directly at Israeli territory. 'It is clear that the Israelis are making a decision to act,' Mr. Cameron told the BBC. 'We hope that they do so in a way that does as little to escalate this as possible.' Israel's war cabinet has met several times since the weekend with no apparent decision on when and how to strike back. Officials are said to be considering a range of options, from a direct strike on Iran to a cyberattack or targeted assassinations, trying to send a clear message to Iran while not sparking a major escalation. 'Israel will respond when it sees fit,' an Israeli official said on Wednesday, adding that it had 'multiple ways' to do so. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel on Saturday night, almost all of which were intercepted by Israel's air defenses, supported by the United States, Britain, France and Jordan. Israel's allies have condemned the assault while urging a response that does not further raise tensions with Iran. Mr. Cameron said that the Group of 7 nations, which includes the United States as well as Britain and Germany, should work together to penalize Iran with sanctions. U.S. and European officials said separately on Tuesday that they were considering placing additional sanctions on Tehran that could target its oil revenue and weapons programs. Before the meetings on Wednesday, Ms. Baerbock said that Iran's actions had 'led an entire region to the brink of the abyss.' 'The aim now is to stop Iran without further escalation,' she said in a post on social media on Tuesday. 'Iran's plan to sow further violence must not work.' Both ministers said they were also visiting to press for a humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza and call attention to the continued captivity of the hostages held there.

Menahem Kahana/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images Israeli leaders on Tuesday were debating how best to respond to Iran's unprecedented weekend airstrike, officials said, weighing a set of options calibrated to achieve different strategic outcomes: deterring a similar attack in the future, placating their American allies and avoiding all-out war. Iran's attack on Israel, a barrage of hundreds of ballistic missiles and exploding drones, changed the unspoken rules in the archrivals' long-running shadow war. Until this month, the two nations had refrained from launching major airstrikes from one country's territory directly at the other's. Now, the calculus that Israel must use to decide its next move has also changed, according to the Israeli officials, who requested anonymity to discuss Iran. The government is making the decision under diplomatic pressure from allies who want it to de-escalate the conflict. American officials have publicly and privately tried to persuade Israel that it does not need to retaliate for the Iranian strike, which did little damage. But Israeli officials disagree. 'We cannot stand still from this kind of aggression,' Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the spokesman for Israel's military, said on Tuesday. Iran, he added, would not get off 'scot-free.' Iran's attack was a response to an Israeli airstrike in Syria that destroyed a building in Damascus that was part of the Iranian embassy complex, normally considered off-limits to attack, and killed several of Iran's high-ranking military officials. Israeli officials have said the building was used as an Iranian military and intelligence base, making it a legitimate target. There is now an internal debate among Israeli officials about the next step. Israel does not want Iran to conclude that it can now attack Israeli territory whenever Israel strikes Iranian interests in a third country, some of the officials said. But, they added, Israel also does not want and cannot afford a major conflict with Iran while still fighting a war in Gaza and skirmishing with Iranian proxies along its borders. The members of Israel's small but fractious war cabinet, the officials said, are considering options big enough to send a clear message to Iran that such attacks will not go unanswered, but not so big as to spark a major escalation. After three days of meetings, the cabinet has yet to decide on a response. On Tuesday, the five-member cabinet met with security officials for two hours of consultations, according to one official, and they were expected to convene again on Wednesday. \u2014 Ronen Bergman, Isabel Kershner, Julian E.

Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images Iran's attack on Israel has shifted focus from the war in Gaza, but Israeli military operations press on there with the aim of eliminating Hamas, the armed group that controlled the territory before the fighting began. Israel's military launched its assault in Gaza after Oct. 7, when Hamas led an attack that Israeli authorities say killed around 1,200 people. Israel said its aims were to defeat Hamas and free the hostages taken that day, around 100 of whom remain in Gaza. Local health authorities say the war has killed more than 33,000 people, and the United Nations says the population is on the brink of famine. Here is a look at where the military conflict stands: Israel withdrew its forces from southern Gaza this month, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that the military still plans to invade Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, to 'complete the elimination of Hamas's battalions' and to destroy its tunnel networks.

Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images The timing of any operation in Rafah, on the border with Egypt, is unclear. President Biden is among many world leaders who have urged Israel not to invade the city because of the harm it could cause civilians. Rafah's population has swelled to over a million, as people have flocked there for shelter from fighting elsewhere, and border crossings in southern Gaza are a main conduit for humanitarian aid. Israel began its ground invasion in northern Gaza in late October, urging civilians to leave. Much of the north, including Gaza City, has been destroyed by airstrikes and ground combat. Israel began to pull its forces from northern Gaza in January, saying it had dismantled Hamas's military structure there. In March, however, Israeli troops mounted an operation at Al-Shifa Hospital, in Gaza City, where it said Hamas fighters had returned. Israeli troops said they had killed about 200 fighters and captured 500 more. The hospital, once Gaza's largest, was left in ruins.

Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times Some analysts said the raid showed that by leaving northern Gaza without a plan in place for governing the area, Israel had made it possible for Hamas to return. At the same time, some civilians who had fled south and attempted to return via a coastal road said this week that Israeli forces had fired on them. Their testimony could not be independently confirmed. The Israeli troops that remain in Gaza are mainly guarding a road that the military has built across the center of the strip to facilitate its operations. The Institute for the Study of War, a research group, said that was consistent with Israel's plans to shift to a strategy of more targeted raids rather than wider assaults. Israel retains the capacity to launch airstrikes anywhere in Gaza and it has conducted several around the central city of Deir al Balah. This month, Israeli planes attacked a convoy of the World Central Kitchen charity near the city, killing seven aid workers. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has said that Israel regrets the strikes. In Deir al Balah, in central Gaza, leaflets dropped by the Israeli army on Tuesday warned people to stay away from the area. Credit... Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images Experts say the Israeli military has had considerable success in dismantling Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades. It has broken the strength of most of its battalions with tens of thousands of airstrikes and ground combat, said Robert Blecher, an expert at the International Crisis Group think tank. Israel has also killed at least one of Hamas's top commanders and has destroyed some of the tunnels in which the group operates. But Hamas retains significant organizational and military capacity, particularly in southern Gaza where its tunnel network acts as a shield, and its leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, is still at large. 'Israel has done a good job of disabling those stronger battalions,' Mr. Blecher said, but he added: 'Hamas is going to remain as an insurgent force.'

Solmaz Daryani for The New York Times The United States plans to impose new sanctions on Iran in the coming days to punish it for the attacks on Israel over the weekend, U.S. officials said on Tuesday. Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, said in a statement that the sanctions would target Iran's 'missile and drone program' and entities that support the country's military groups. 'These new sanctions and other measures will continue a steady drumbeat of pressure to contain and degrade Iran's military capacity and effectiveness and confront the full range of its problematic behaviors,' Mr. Sullivan said. Mr. Sullivan did not specify how the sanctions might undermine Iranian weapons programs, but a Treasury official, who declined to be named in order to discuss private deliberations, said the United States was looking at ways to cut off Iran's access to military components that it uses to build weapons such as the drones that it used against Israel. On Saturday night, Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel in retaliation for an Israeli airstrike that killed several senior Iranian military officials in Syria earlier in the month. Most of the missiles and drones were intercepted and shot down by Israel and its allies, including the United States and Britain. The United States has imposed extensive sanctions on Iran over the years as part of a broad effort to put pressure on its economy and prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons. At a news conference on Tuesday ahead of the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington, Janet L. Yellen, the secretary of the Treasury, suggested that the Biden administration was considering ways to further restrict Iranian oil exports. Ms. Yellen noted that the Biden administration had already targeted more than 500 Iranian individuals and entities associated with terrorist financing over the last three years. 'I fully expect that we will take additional sanctions action against Iran in the coming days,' Ms. Yellen said. Ms. Yellen said that the United States does not generally reveal the details of sanctions before imposing them but she signaled that the Biden administration is focusing on Iranian oil, which is a major source of its government revenue. 'We have been working to diminish Iran's ability to export oil,' Ms. Yellen said. 'Clearly Iran is continuing to export some oil \u2014 there may be more that we could do.' The United States will also be discussing Iran with finance ministers from the Group of 7 nations, who are in Washington this week. Those talks will be centered on how to coordinate sanctions to cut off Iran's supply of military components for weapons like the Shahed drones that it deployed against Israel, according to the Treasury official. The United States will also be talking with other countries, including China, about the need to stop supplying Iran with weapons or technology that it has been using to destabilize the Middle East. Ms. Yellen noted that since the attack by Hamas on Israel on Oct. 7 of last year, the United States has targeted Iran with more than 100 sanctions intended to debilitate its procurement networks for ballistic missiles and the terrorist groups that it finances. Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington. \u2014 Alan Rappeport Reporting from Washington Josep Borrell Fontelles, the foreign policy chief of the European Union, said on Tuesday that economic sanctions could be broadened to include Iran's missile program, as well as the delivery of those weapons systems to its proxy militias. Credit... John Thys/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images The European Union is considering expanding economic sanctions against Iran's weapons program to punish it for last weekend's attack on Israel and try to prevent any escalation of violence across the Middle East, the bloc's top diplomat said on Tuesday. 'I'm not trying to exaggerate when I say that, in the Middle East, we are at the edge of a very deep precipice,' Josep Borrell Fontelles, the European Union's foreign policy chief, said after European diplomats were hastily called to discuss the crisis. Member states agreed to mobilize all diplomatic efforts to avoid a violent spillover that would be 'leading us into a regional war,' Mr. Borrell said. 'That is what we're trying to avoid.' The European Union has already penalized Iran for equipping Russia with drones in Moscow's war against Ukraine. On Tuesday, Mr. Borrell said those sanctions could be broadened to include Iran's missile program, as well as the delivery of those weapons systems to its proxy militias in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria. He also said the European Union could expand sanctions against entities that provide Iran with the necessary components to build drones, but that, by and large, such penalties were already in place. It is far from clear how the proposed restrictions would curb Iran, which has spent decades finding ways to skirt Western sanctions, including illicit shipments of oil and, notably, its armaments to Russia. But even as he voiced the bloc's support for Israel, Mr. Borrell said 'let's not forget Gaza,' where an Israeli siege has created a hunger crisis that the United Nations says borders on famine. 'Yes, we have to pay a lot of attention to the Iranian attack on Israel,' Mr. Borrell said. 'But we don't have to forget about what's happening in Gaza. Because there will be no regional stability \u2014 there will not be a possibility to build enduring peace in the region if the Gaza war continues.' He also noted the awkward disparity between the West's resistance to being pulled directly into the conflict in Ukraine and the interception of Iranian drones by the United States and several allies last weekend to protect Israel. The conflicts are vastly different, Mr. Borrell said, in part because Iran's drones put allied air bases in the Middle East at risk by flying over them to get to Israel. But, he said, if he were President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, 'I would certainly wish to highlight that Ukraine is being bombed as well.' Mr. Borrell predicted that European defense ministers could commit to sending more air defense to Ukraine at a meeting on Monday. \u2014 Lara Jakes Reporting from Brussels  \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nFrom left, Annalena Baerbock, Germany's foreign minister; Isaac Herzog, Israel's president; and David Cameron, Britain's foreign secretary, at a hotel in Jerusalem on Wednesday.

Solmaz Daryani for The New York Times The United States plans to impose new sanctions on Iran in the coming days to punish it for the attacks on Israel over the weekend, U.S. officials said on Tuesday.\nJake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, said in a statement that the sanctions would target Iran's 'missile and drone program' and entities that support the country's military groups.\n'These new sanctions and other measures will continue a steady drumbeat of pressure to contain and degrade Iran's military capacity and effectiveness and confront the full range of its problematic behaviors,' Mr. Sullivan said.\nMr. Sullivan did not specify how the sanctions might undermine Iranian weapons programs, but a Treasury official, who declined to be named in order to discuss private deliberations, said the United States was looking at ways to cut off Iran's access to military components that it uses to build weapons such as the drones that it used against Israel.\nOn Saturday night, Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel in retaliation for an Israeli airstrike that killed several senior Iranian military officials in Syria earlier in the month. Most of the missiles and drones were intercepted and shot down by Israel and its allies, including the United States and Britain.\nThe United States has imposed extensive sanctions on Iran over the years as part of a broad effort to put pressure on its economy and prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons.\nAt a news conference on Tuesday ahead of the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington, Janet L. Yellen, the secretary of the Treasury, suggested that the Biden administration was considering ways to further restrict Iranian oil exports.\nMs. Yellen noted that the Biden administration had already targeted more than 500 Iranian individuals and entities associated with terrorist financing over the last three years.\n'I fully expect that we will take additional sanctions action against Iran in the coming days,' Ms. Yellen said.\nMs. Yellen said that the United States does not generally reveal the details of sanctions before imposing them but she signaled that the Biden administration is focusing on Iranian oil, which is a major source of its government revenue.\n'We have been working to diminish Iran's ability to export oil,' Ms. Yellen said. 'Clearly Iran is continuing to export some oil \u2014 there may be more that we could do.'\nThe United States will also be discussing Iran with finance ministers from the Group of 7 nations, who are in Washington this week. Those talks will be centered on how to coordinate sanctions to cut off Iran's supply of military components for weapons like the Shahed drones that it deployed against Israel, according to the Treasury official.\nThe United States will also be talking with other countries, including China, about the need to stop supplying Iran with weapons or technology that it has been using to destabilize the Middle East.\nMs. Yellen noted that since the attack by Hamas on Israel on Oct. 7 of last year, the United States has targeted Iran with more than 100 sanctions intended to debilitate its procurement networks for ballistic missiles and the terrorist groups that it finances.\nPeter Baker contributed reporting from Washington.\n\u2014 Alan Rappeport Reporting from Washington\n\u2014 Alan Rappeport Reporting from Washington Josep Borrell Fontelles, the foreign policy chief of the European Union, said on Tuesday that economic sanctions could be broadened to include Iran's missile program, as well as the delivery of those weapons systems to its proxy militias. Credit... John Thys/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images The European Union is considering expanding economic sanctions against Iran's weapons program to punish it for last weekend's attack on Israel and try to prevent any escalation of violence across the Middle East, the bloc's top diplomat said on Tuesday.\n'I'm not trying to exaggerate when I say that, in the Middle East, we are at the edge of a very deep precipice,' Josep Borrell Fontelles, the European Union's foreign policy chief, said after European diplomats were hastily called to discuss the crisis.\nMember states agreed to mobilize all diplomatic efforts to avoid a violent spillover that would be 'leading us into a regional war,' Mr. Borrell said. 'That is what we're trying to avoid.'\nThe European Union has already penalized Iran for equipping Russia with drones in Moscow's war against Ukraine. On Tuesday, Mr. Borrell said those sanctions could be broadened to include Iran's missile program, as well as the delivery of those weapons systems to its proxy militias in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria.\nHe also said the European Union could expand sanctions against entities that provide Iran with the necessary components to build drones, but that, by and large, such penalties were already in place.\nIt is far from clear how the proposed restrictions would curb Iran, which has spent decades finding ways to skirt Western sanctions, including illicit shipments of oil and, notably, its armaments to Russia.\nBut even as he voiced the bloc's support for Israel, Mr. Borrell said 'let's not forget Gaza,' where an Israeli siege has created a hunger crisis that the United Nations says borders on famine.\n'Yes, we have to pay a lot of attention to the Iranian attack on Israel,' Mr. Borrell said. 'But we don't have to forget about what's happening in Gaza. Because there will be no regional stability \u2014 there will not be a possibility to build enduring peace in the region if the Gaza war continues.'\nHe also noted the awkward disparity between the West's resistance to being pulled directly into the conflict in Ukraine and the interception of Iranian drones by the United States and several allies last weekend to protect Israel.\nThe conflicts are vastly different, Mr. Borrell said, in part because Iran's drones put allied air bases in the Middle East at risk by flying over them to get to Israel.\nBut, he said, if he were President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, 'I would certainly wish to highlight that Ukraine is being bombed as well.' Mr. Borrell predicted that European defense ministers could commit to sending more air defense to Ukraine at a meeting on Monday.\n\u2014 Lara Jakes Reporting from Brussels\n\u2014 Lara Jakes Reporting from Brussels Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Matthew Mpoke Bigg","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/17/world/17mideast-crisis-diplo/17mideast-crisis-diplo-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":4.459879,"_id":"bba68da21e7e50acbe638b0bfd46f8ee"},{"title":"Lawyers Use Social Media Posts to Strike Prospective Trump Jurors","author":"Matthew Haag","published_date":"2024-04-18 21:55:57","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/nyregion/trump-jurors-social-media.html","clean_url":"nytimes.com","excerpt":"'Oops, that sounds bad': One prospective juror read aloud one of her old posts and apologized.","summary":"Donald J.

The case has broad implications for homelessness policy throughout the country.","summary":"Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index The Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis. The case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces. The issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years. The dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces. The question before the justices is whether those laws went so far that they punished people for being homeless and violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. A group of homeless residents is challenging the city's enforcement of the ordinances as unconstitutional, arguing that they are involuntarily homeless in the city because there are not shelter beds available and that the city may not punish them without offering shelter. City officials in Grants Pass counter that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment. They warn that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would fuel homeless encampments across the country and hamstring the ability of local governments to respond. Here's what else to know: The case began in October 2018, when Debra Blake, a homeless woman in Grants Pass, sued the city, accusing officials of breaching the Constitution. 'The city of Grants Pass is trying to run homeless people out of town,' the lawsuit said. 'On any given day or night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, are forced to live outside due to the lack of emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.'\nThe plaintiffs' argument rests in part on a 1962 case, Robinson v. California, in which the Supreme Court held that laws imposing penalties on people for narcotics addiction violated the Eighth Amendment because they punished a state of being, not a specific action, like drug possession or sale. In a similar fashion, the plaintiffs contend, Grants Pass is punishing people for being involuntarily homeless, not for specific actions.\nThat argument held sway in a separate case, Martin v. Boise, in 2018. In that case, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Boise, Idaho, had violated the constitutional rights of homeless people by imposing criminal penalties for sleeping and camping outdoors, even though the city did not have enough shelter beds.\nLawyers for Grants Pass point to the Boise case as a cautionary tale. The decision only hastened 'sprawling encampments, rising deaths and widespread harms to the community, as localities are forced to surrender their public spaces,' the lawyers wrote in a brief. The lawyers added that lawmakers, not courts, were best suited to address homelessness and the complexity of its root causes.\nUnderlining the tricky balance inherent in the case, a number of groups have sought to strike something of a compromise. The Biden administration, the city and county of Los Angeles, the city and county of San Francisco, California and the state's governor have weighed in, all seeking to find a careful balance between support for homeless residents and for broader communities.\nThe Biden administration, which will participate in the oral arguments, has not chosen a side in the dispute. Even as it was sharply critical of laws that in effect criminalize homelessness \u2014 policies that it argues can make it harder for people to escape their circumstances \u2014 the administration said local governments had a basic responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces like parks and sidewalks. Inside a warming shelter, Laura Gutowski detailed how her life had changed since she became homeless two and a half years ago in Grants Pass, a former timber hub in the foothills of southern Oregon. Her husband's death left her without steady income. She lived in a sedan, and then in a tent, in sight of the elementary school where her son was once a student. She constantly scrambled to move her belongings to avoid racking up more fines from the police. 'I never expected it to come to this,' said Ms. Gutowski, 55. She is one of several hundred homeless people in this city of about 40,000 that is at the center of a major case before the Supreme Court on Monday with broad ramifications for the nationwide struggle with homelessness. After Grants Pass stepped up enforcement of local ordinances that banned sleeping and camping in public spaces by ticketing, fining and jailing homeless people, lower courts ruled that it amounted to 'cruel and unusual punishment' by penalizing people who had nowhere else to go. Many states and cities that are increasingly overwhelmed by homelessness are hoping the Supreme Court overturns that decision \u2014 or severely limits it. They argue that it has crippled their efforts to address sprawling encampments, rampant public drug use and fearful constituents who say they cannot safely use public spaces. That prospect has alarmed homeless people and their advocates, who contend that a ruling against them would lead cities to fall back on jails, instead of solutions like affordable housing and social services. The case highlights the fierce divide over the thorny issue of how to regulate homelessness. Theane Evangelis, a lawyer representing Grants Pass, said the Supreme Court's decision would reverberate widely. If it does not overturn the lower-court decision, she said, cities around the United States 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.' Ed Johnson, a lawyer for the Oregon Law Center, a nonprofit legal aid group, who represents the homeless residents, said a ruling against them would strip them of their few protections. 'Can a city make it illegal on every inch of city land, every minute of the day, for people to live outside when they have nowhere else to go?' he said. Homelessness across the country climbed to the highest total on record last year, increasing by 12 percent to more than 650,000 people, according to a count by the federal government.  At the core of the Supreme Court battle over a small Oregon town's treatment of its homeless people is a narrow question: Does the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual treatment apply to a city's efforts to crack down on public sleeping and camping? The Eighth Amendment is most commonly applied to punishments, not to laws themselves, and it is often the focus of litigation around the death penalty, solitary confinement and life without the possibility of parole. But in the case on Monday, lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Because the town, Grants Pass, has no homeless shelter, unaffiliated with any religious group, that is open to everyone, they argue, all homeless people there are involuntarily homeless and cannot be punished for having nowhere to go. To make that argument, the homeless plaintiffs have looked to rulings that apply the amendment beyond punishments themselves and to the concept that a person cannot be penalized for their state of being. In one landmark 1962 decision, Robinson v. California, the court found that a person could not be punished for being addicted to drugs, paving the way for subsequent applications. Because those rulings found that the Eighth Amendment prohibits punishing people for having 'an involuntary status,' the homeless plaintiffs say that it would also be relevant to their situation. They add that they are being disciplined for circumstances outside their control, in this instance 'universal biological necessities like sleeping and using a blanket to survive cold temperatures when they have no choice but to be outside.' The city argues that this is an inappropriate use of the Eighth Amendment and a fundamental misunderstanding of its purpose. Two legal experts, in filing a friend-of-the-court brief siding with Grants Pass, argued that the Constitution did bar criminalizing someone's state of being, rather than their specific conduct. But that prohibition, the law professors \u2014 Peter W. Low of the University of Virginia and Joel S. Johnson of Pepperdine \u2014 added, had a 'shaky Eighth Amendment footing.'  \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis.\nThe case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces.\nThe issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years.\nThe dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces.

The Iranian officials said that a strike had hit a military air base near the city of Isfahan, in central Iran. Initial reaction in both Israel and Iran was muted, which analysts said was a sign that the rivals were seeking to lower the temperature of their conflict. World leaders, who for nearly a week have urged Israel and Iran to avoid starting a broader war in the region, called for both sides to de-escalate tensions on Friday. The Israeli military declined to comment on the strike. A senior U.S. official said that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before the attack. All the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The explosions came less than a week after Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel \u2014 nearly all of which were shot down \u2014 in response to an April 1 strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria that killed seven Iranian officials. That attack brought the decades-long shadow war between Israel and Iran \u2014 waged on land, at sea, in air and in cyberspace \u2014 more clearly into the open. A Western official and two Iranian officials said that Israel used both missiles fired from warplanes and drones in the strike, suggesting that the attack included more advanced firepower than initial reports indicated. Iranian officials initially told The New York Times that the attack had been carried out only by small drones, possibly launched from inside Iran, and that radar systems had not detected unidentified aircraft entering Iranian airspace. They said that a separate group of small drones was shot down in the region of Tabriz, roughly 500 miles north of Isfahan.\nIn public, Iranian officials sought to downplay the strike. Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi, the commander in chief of Iran's army, said explosions heard early Friday in Isfahan 'were from our air defense firing at a suspicious object,' and that there had been 'no damage.' Iranian news agencies appeared keen to show that things were 'back to normal' in the city.\nPresident Ebrahim Raisi of Iran had warned that 'the tiniest act of aggression' on his country's soil would draw a response. But in the hours after Israel's strike, there have been no public calls for retribution by Iranian officials. One lawmaker, Seyed Nezamedin Mousavi, called the strike 'ridiculous,' saying it showed Israel 'is content with these ineffective actions.'\nIsfahan is one of Iran's most famous and historic cities. The area also hosts a number of Iranian military sites. Iranian media reported that nuclear facilities in Isfahan had not been hit.\nIsraeli leaders came close to ordering widespread strikes in Iran on the night Iran attacked, officials said, but the war cabinet postponed a decision. Mr. Biden and other world leaders urged Israel for days not to retaliate in a way that would inflame a wider Middle East war while it fights Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both allies of Iran. April 19, 2024, 8:07 p.m. ET April 19, 2024, 8:07 p.m. ET Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, who is in New York attending U.N. meetings, told Iran's state news agency that the small quadcopter targeting a military base in Isfahan did not have casualties or damage. 'Israel is determined to portray its defeat as a victory,' Mr. Amir Abdollahian said, the most senior official to comment on the attacks and draw a link to Israel publicly. Credit... Angela Weiss/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images The Israeli attack on an Iranian air base in Isfahan hit a crucial part of an air defense system, a New York Times analysis of satellite imagery found. Images showed that the precision attack at the 8th Shekari Air Base damaged or destroyed the 'flap-lid' radar, which is used in S-300 air defense systems to track incoming targets. The Times used several satellite images in its analysis; the location of the damaged area was first pointed out on the social media platform X by Aurora Intel, and the findings have also been confirmed by a former U.S. government imagery analyst, Chris Biggers. The radar is typically surrounded by several vehicles, including four trucks carrying missiles. Before the strike, the missiles were seen positioned next to the radar. After the strike, they had been moved and did not appear visibly damaged. It was not clear why the missiles had been moved. However, the fact that they appear undamaged indicated that the attack had a very precise target, according to Mr. Biggers. An air defense system at the air base in Isfahan in October 2021.

The precision of the strike, deep within Iran and with several sensitive sites close by, suggested Israel chose the specific and narrow target, the air defense system. According to the Missile Defense Project of the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies, Iran has acquired Russian-made S-300 air defense systems to deter Israeli and other airstrikes. Some Democrats are fine sending defensive weapons to Israel, but want to see some limits on offensive weapons, which could be used against civilians in Gaza. Credit... -/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images A group of left-leaning House Democrats is urging its colleagues to oppose the $26 billion aid package for Israel, hoping to maximize the number of 'no' votes from the party and send a warning to President Biden about the depth of his political coalition's discontent over his support for Israel's tactics in Gaza. Framing the upcoming vote as a make-or-break moral choice akin to Congress's votes to authorize and fund the Iraq war, progressive leaders in the House are working to muster a sizable bloc of Democratic opposition to the aid measure, which is expected to pass on Saturday and become law in the coming days. 'In the wake of those votes, people came around much, much later and said, \u2018We shouldn't have allowed that to go forward,'' Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington and the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said of the decades-ago debate over Iraq. 'And I think that this is that moment.' Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas, called it a 'defining vote,' adding, 'We're either going to participate in the carnage, or we're not.' There is little doubt that the bill, which would send roughly $13 billion in military assistance to Israel as it continues its offensive in Gaza, will pass the House, along with money for Ukraine, Taiwan and other American allies. But progressive Democrats estimated that 40 to 60 members of their party may oppose it on the House floor on Saturday. That would be a striking signal from Congress, where ironclad bipartisan backing for Israel has long been the norm. And it would highlight the fraught divisions the war in Gaza has sown within the Democratic Party, even as more Democrats including Mr. Biden have begun to criticize Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's approach to the conflict and urge him to better protect civilians. The legislation would allocate $5 billion to Israel's defense capabilities and $9 billion for 'worldwide humanitarian aid,' including for civilians in Gaza. But it would not place further conditions on how Israel could use American military aid, nor block future arms transfers from the United States as an increasing number of Democrats have sought to do. Democrats who are leading the push against the Israel aid bill said they strongly supported the Jewish state and its right to defend itself, and would vote in favor of sending military aid that supports Israel's defense capabilities, such as by replenishing the Iron Dome, David's Sling and Iron Beam defense systems. They also denounced the Oct. 7 terrorist attack by Hamas that prompted the war, and said the hostages taken by Hamas must be released. But they argued that approving more offensive weaponry without conditions was an untenable moral and political position that would amount to an endorsement of Mr. Netanyahu's prosecution of the war, including his intention to invade Rafah over the objections of the Biden administration. More than 33,000 people in Gaza have been killed since the start of the conflict, according to the health ministry there, and the population is facing a hunger crisis. 'I understand the need for defensive weapons for Israel, particularly in light of the attack by Iran,' said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, who ran his first campaign on an antiwar platform and helped lead efforts to end U.S. participation in the war in Yemen. 'But there is no justification to provide bombs and weapons to Netanyahu to continue the war in Gaza that is killing thousands of innocent Palestinian women and children.' Saturday's vote will recall a similar situation from 2007, when the speaker at the time, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, split a piece of spending legislation to allow Democrats to register their opposition to funding the Iraq war while backing a domestic funding bill. Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, similarly divided the foreign aid package to be considered on Saturday in order to get each element across the finish line in the face of distinct coalitions of resistance to different pieces of the bill. In a critical test vote on Friday, the House agreed, 316 to 94, to bring up the package, with 39 Democrats \u2014 mostly progressives \u2014 joining 55 Republicans in opposition. 'This is a moment for members of Congress who support a safe and secure Israel to send a message that giving Netanyahu more offensive weapons is not a path for peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians,' Representative Becca Balint, Democrat of Vermont and the first Jewish member of Congress to call for a cease-fire, said in an interview. 'To give Netanyahu more offensive weapons at this stage, I believe, is to condone the destruction of Gaza that we've seen in the last six months. And it's also a green light for an invasion of Rafah.' Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat who led the opposition to funding for the Iraq war in 2007, said the conversations among Democrats in Congress opposing continued U.S. backing for the war in Gaza were 'not unlike' those that took place 17 years ago. 'We may well be casting the vote on whether a much wider war takes place, and whether American weapons go that result in the death of thousands of innocent people,' Mr. Doggett said. The Democrats who oppose the aid package for Israel represent a minority of their caucus. But they see a 'no' vote as part of a strategy to pressure Mr. Biden to condition aid and halt future offensive weapons transfers. Through many meetings, text chains and conversations with the administration, they have worked to shift the president's approach to Israel, while underscoring the electoral risks Mr. Biden faces among voters who helped power him to the White House in 2020 and are now furious over his handling of the war. 'The only way to get a course correction is for a sizable number within the Democratic caucus to say it must shift,' Ms. Balint said. Representative Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat who has been pressing Mr. Biden to withhold offensive weapons from Israel, said a big 'no' vote would strengthen the president's hand to do so. 'It helps the administration to have some number of Democrats express ourselves in this way,' he said. Representative Greg Casar, Democrat of Texas, said he hoped a substantial number of Democrats opposing the bill would give the Biden administration greater leverage to influence the Israeli government's approach to the war. 'I hope this vote will show the world that there is a really significant segment of the United States that doesn't want to see expanded and widening wars,' he said.

Ohad Zwigenberg/Associated Press Israeli warplanes fired missiles on Iran during a retaliatory strike early Friday morning, one Western official and two Iranian officials said, suggesting that the attack included more advanced firepower than initial reports indicated. It was not immediately clear the types of missiles used, from where they were fired, whether any were intercepted by Iran's defenses or where they landed. The Western official and the Iranian officials requested anonymity to discuss classified information. Previously, Iranian officials said Friday's attack on a military base in central Iran was conducted by small aerial drones, most likely launched from inside Iranian territory. A separate group of small drones, they said soon after the attack, was shot down in the region of Tabriz, roughly 500 miles north of Isfahan. Israel has not publicly claimed responsibility for Friday's attack and would not comment on the use of planes or missiles. Israel's strike came in response to an Iranian attack last weekend in which Iran fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel. A majority of the weapons used in that salvo were fired from Iranian territory and intercepted by Israel and its allies before causing any damage. By contrast, the Iranian officials said, Iran's military did not detect anything entering Iran's airspace on Friday, including drones, missiles and aircraft. Iran's state news agency IRNA reported that no missile attacks occurred and that Iran's air defense system was not activated. Iran's decision to launch its strike primarily from its own soil last week was perceived by Israel as an escalation in the countries' long-simmering shadow war. The Iranians believe the large salvo is helping with deterrence. Throughout the yearslong conflict, the two countries have traded clandestine attacks, including targeted assassinations, cyberattacks and conventional strikes conducted from and within third countries. Iran's attack last week was itself prompted by an Israeli strike on April 1, in which Israeli aircraft killed several Iranian armed forces commanders in Syria. By using drones seemingly launched from inside Iran's territory rather than its own, Israel hinted at a willingness to turn down the temperature on the conflict while also demonstrating an ability to conduct attacks that Iran could not detect. One Iranian official, a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, said that even though the strike did little damage, the likelihood that drones were fired from under Iran's nose sent a message about Israel's capabilities. A guided missile fired from an undetected warplane, even if it landed outside Iranian territory, would most likely deliver a similar threat. Officials from both countries remained largely quiet about Friday's attack, a gesture that appeared aimed at de-escalating a conflict some fear could spiral into a broader regional war. Israel's silence on the attack, an Iranian official said, would allow Tehran to treat the strike as it had comparable previous attacks and not prompt an immediate response. Mahdi Mohammadi, a senior adviser to Iran's Parliament speaker, said that Israel's limited attack on Iran showed that Iran had achieved its goal of deterrence. Israel's refusal to openly claim responsibility, he said, amounts to a victory for Iran. Israel's attack, he said on the messaging app Telegram, was meant to show that it had the 'capability to access Iran but in practice it also showed that it has accepted that it should not repeat its miscalculation.' April 19, 2024, 2:43 p.m. ET April 19, 2024, 2:43 p.m. ET The White House maintained public silence about the Israeli strike on Iran. 'I'm not going to speak or speculate about any of the reports that are out there,' Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said at her daily briefing. John Kirby, the national security spokesman who typically speaks on foreign policy issues, did not join the briefing.

Pete Marovich for The New York Times The Israeli military struck a Syrian air defense site in southern Syria with missiles early Friday, causing material damage, though no casualties were reported, according to Syrian state news media. Syria's official news agency, SANA, provided no other details and Israel did not comment on whether it was responsible for the attack, in keeping with its usual practice. The strike happened around the same time that Israel carried out a strike on a military air base near the city of Isfahan, in central Iran. That strike came less than a week after Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel \u2014 nearly all of which were shot down \u2014 in retaliation for an April 1 attack on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria that killed seven Iranian military officers. Friday's strike in Syria targeted a radar system in the southern province of Dara'a, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group based in Britain. The Syrian military detected Israeli aircraft entering Syrian airspace, but its air defenses did not try to intercept the strikes, the Observatory said. Iranian-backed armed groups throughout Syria have been on high alert since Iran's strikes on Israel last weekend, the Observatory said. The groups obscured their positions and gave some of their leaders a week of leave. Iran is closely allied with Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia, and with the Syrian government, and both Hezbollah and Iran's Quds Force operate in Syria. For years, Iranian proxies like Hezbollah have launched strikes at northern Israel. Israel has repeatedly targeted Iran and its allies with strikes in Syria, including in Damascus, the capital, and Aleppo. Attacks across Israel's borders with Syria and Lebanon have escalated since the Oct. 7 assault by Hamas on Israel. Since the first of the year, Israel has carried out nearly three dozen attacks in Syria, destroying buildings, military headquarters and weapon and ammunition warehouses, the Observatory said. The strikes have killed 129 fighters and 12 civilians, the group said.

Jordan lies between the two enemies, and it played a key role in helping shoot down the barrage of missiles and drones Iran fired at Israel on Saturday. A group at the ancient Si-o-Se Pol bridge in Isfahan, Iran, in 2023. Daily life appeared to return to normal in Isfahan on Friday, according to Iranian state news media and a resident who was interviewed, hours after Israel's attack on a nearby military base continued the cycle of strikes and counterstrikes between the two countries. But tensions from the overnight attack reverberated through the city, and some residents described the threat of full-fledged war as crippling \u2014 despite analysts' assessment that both nations were trying to avoid further escalation. Mehrdad, 43, an engineer from Isfahan, said the latest retaliation left him and his pregnant wife feeling stressed and unwell. He asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution. 'The future of this country concerns me,' he said. 'I believe nothing good is expected.' Though he said that the city had returned 'back to its normal' and reactions from officials were muted \u2014 which he believed was to help make people feel at ease \u2014 many residents remain scared after a stressful night of explosions. For the first six months of the war between Israel and Hamas, Iran's involvement in fighting had been limited to its proxies, including the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and the Yemeni Houthi militia. But after Iran's first direct strike on Israel last weekend, Mehrdad said, 'things are coming to the surface.' He hoped that diplomatic mediation would put an end to the threat of war, and he worried that the county's infrastructure would be 'ruined' by further Israeli attacks. 'Our economic situation is awful. We have 50 percent annual inflation,' he said. 'Now guess what would happen if the war materialized. What would happen to our living conditions in this country?' Mahsa, 34, an accountant from Isfahan who also asked that her last name not be used for fear of retribution, described a tense atmosphere of fear and instability. The economy is often the main topic of conversation when people gather, she said, and many are worried about the consequences of a wider war. 'When Iran attacked, we were all worried and we really didn't know what to expect,' she said, describing the cycle of retaliation between Israel and Iran as a 'show game.' 'Of course, after this Israeli attack, the direction of the game will be determined,' she added. 'Either a full-scale war, or the end of this line, or just threats.' The distress is crushing. Mahsa said her mental health had deteriorated, describing an instance last week when she broke down sobbing in the middle of the street for seemingly no reason while on a run. Dreams seem 'more impossible to achieve, day by day,' she said. 'We don't have much mental energy left,' she added.

Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times For decades, Israel and Iran have fought a shadow war across the Middle East, trading attacks by land, sea, air and in cyberspace. A recent round of strikes \u2014 mainly an aerial barrage by Iran against Israel last weekend \u2014 has brought the conflict more clearly into the open and raised fears of a broader war. A retaliatory Israeli strike on an Iranian air base on Friday, however, appeared limited in scope, and analysts said it suggested an effort to pull back from the dangerous cycle and potentially move the war back into the shadows. Here is a recent history of the conflict: August 2019: An Israeli airstrike killed two Iranian-trained militants in Syria, a drone set off a blast near a Hezbollah office in Lebanon and an airstrike in Qaim, Iraq, killed a commander of an Iran-backed Iraqi militia. Israel accused Iran at the time of trying to establish an overland arms-supply line through Iraq and northern Syria to Lebanon, and analysts said the strikes were aimed at stopping Iran and signaling to its proxies that Israel would not tolerate a fleet of smart missiles on its borders. January 2020: Israel greeted with satisfaction the assassination of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the commander of the foreign-facing arm of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, in an American drone strike in Baghdad. Iran hit back by attacking two bases in Iraq that housed American troops with a barrage of missiles, wounding about 100 U.S. military personnel. 2021-22: In July 2021, an oil tanker managed by an Israeli-owned shipping company was attacked off the coast of Oman, killing two crew members, according to the company and three Israeli officials. Two of the officials said that the attack appeared to have been carried out by Iranian drones. Iran did not explicitly claim or deny responsibility, but a state-owned television channel described the episode as a response to an Israeli strike in Syria. In November 2021, Israel killed Iran's top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, and followed up with the assassination of a Revolutionary Guards commander, Col. Sayad Khodayee, in May 2022. December 2023: After Israel's bombardment of Gaza began in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led assault, Iranian-backed militias stepped up their own attacks. And late last year, Iran accused Israel of killing a high-level military figure, Brig. Gen. Sayyed Razi Mousavi, in a missile strike in Syria. A senior adviser to the Revolutionary Guards, General Mousavi was described as having been a close associate of General Suleimani and was said to have helped oversee the shipment of arms to Hezbollah. Israel, adopting its customary stance, declined to comment directly on whether it was behind General Mousavi's death. January 2024: An explosion in a suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, killed Saleh al-Arouri, a Hamas leader, along with two commanders from that group's armed wing, the first assassination of a top Hamas official outside the West Bank and Gaza in recent years. Officials from Hamas, Lebanon and the United States ascribed the blast to Israel, which did not publicly confirm involvement. Hezbollah, which receives major support from Iran, stepped up its assaults on Israel after Mr. al-Arouri's death. Israel's military hit back at Hezbollah in Lebanon, killing several of the group's commanders. March: An Israeli drone strike hit a car in southern Lebanon, killing at least one person. Israel's military said it had killed the deputy commander of Hezbollah's rocket and missile unit. Hezbollah acknowledged the death of a man, Ali Abdulhassan Naim, but did not provide further details. The same day, airstrikes killed soldiers near Aleppo, northern Syria, in what appeared to be one of the heaviest Israeli attacks in the country in years. The strikes killed 36 Syrian soldiers, seven Hezbollah fighters and a Syrian from a pro-Iran militia, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group that tracks Syria's civil war. Israel's military did not claim responsibility. But the country's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, wrote on social media, 'We will pursue Hezbollah every place it operates and we will expand the pressure and the pace of the attacks.' April: A strike on an Iranian Embassy building in Damascus on April 1 killed three top Iranian commanders and four officers. Iran blamed Israel and vowed to hit back forcefully. Two weeks later, Tehran launched a barrage of more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel, an unexpectedly large-scale attack, although nearly all the weapons were shot down by Israel and allies. Israel said for days it would respond, before a strike on Friday hit a military air base near the central Iranian city of Isfahan.

Planet Labs PBC Iranian officials said that the Israeli strike on Friday morning was carried out by small exploding drones, a tactic that would follow a well-established pattern in Israeli attacks on Iranian military targets. As Israel has targeted Iranian defense and military officials and infrastructure, small drones \u2014 specifically ones known as quadcopters \u2014 have been a signature of those operations. Quadcopter drones, so named because they have four rotors, have a short flight range and can explode on impact. The drones might have been launched from inside Iran, whose radar systems had not detected unidentified aircraft entering Iranian airspace, Iranian officials said. If the drones were launched within the country, it demonstrates once again Israel's ability to mount clandestine operations in Iranian territory. Israel's military has not commented on Friday's strike. Though it rarely claims responsibility publicly for attacks against Iranian targets, several attacks in recent years have used drones: August 2019: Israel sent an exploding drone into the heart of a Hezbollah-dominated neighborhood in Beirut, Lebanon, to destroy what Israeli officials described as machinery used in the production of precision missiles.\nJune 2021: A quadcopter exploded outside Tehran at one of Iran's main manufacturing centers for centrifuges, which purify uranium and are used at the country's two major uranium enrichment facilities. Western officials have closely watched activity at those facilities for signs that Iran could be moving toward producing a nuclear weapon. Iran claimed that there had been no damage to the site outside Tehran, but satellite images showed evidence of significant damage.\nFebruary 2022: Six quadcopters exploded at Kermanshah, Iran's main manufacturing and storage plant for military drones.\nMay 2022: A strike targeted the highly sensitive Parchin military site outside Tehran, where Iran develops missile, nuclear and drone technology. Quadcopter drones exploded into a building, killing an engineer and injuring another person, Iranians with knowledge of the attack said at the time.\nJanuary 2023: A drone attack on an Iranian military facility in January 2023 caused a large explosion in the center of Isfahan, the city near the air base that was struck on Friday. At the time, Iran made no effort to hide the fact that an attack had happened, but said it had done little damage. Iranian state media reported that drones had targeted an ammunition manufacturing plant but had been shot down by a surface-to-air defense system. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken at a news conference in Capri, Italy, on Friday. Credit... Gregorio Borgia/Associated Press Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Friday that the United States 'has not been involved in any offensive operations' in Iran when asked about Israel's strike on the country on Friday, but he declined to comment further. Mr. Blinken spoke on the last day of a meeting of Group of 7 ministers in Capri, Italy, where the agenda was dominated by the conflict in the Middle East, including the exchanges of strikes in the past week between Israel and Iran. In remarks to reporters before departing the island, Mr. Blinken said the G7 was unified in urging de-escalation between Iran and Israel to avoid a wider war. But Mr. Blinken would not even directly confirm the Israeli strike, which appeared to be the country's first military response to Iran's attack last weekend, referring instead to 'reported events,' and he would not say whether the United States had been notified in advance of the Israeli action. Shortly before he spoke, Italy's foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, told reporters that the United States had been 'informed at the last minute' of the Israeli strike. 'But there was no involvement on the part of the United States,' Mr. Tajani said. 'It was simply information which was provided,' adding that he believed the G7's collective efforts deserved credit for 'the small scale of the event.' Mr. Tajani did not say how he knew the United States had not been notified in advance, but he had recently come from a meeting with Mr. Blinken and other G7 ministers. A senior American official said on Friday that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before its attack on Iran. The G7 weighed in collectively in a statement concluding the three-day meeting, urging countries to prevent further escalation 'in light of reports of strikes' on Friday. The G7 includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and the European Union. The statement also said that the member nations 'condemn in the strongest terms Iran's direct and unprecedented attack' on Israel. 'Israel and its people have our full solidarity and support and we reaffirm our commitment toward Israel's security,' it added. The G7 also issued a new warning to Tehran, demanding that 'Iran and its affiliated groups cease their attacks' throughout the Middle East and saying that 'we stand ready to adopt further sanctions or take other measures.' Mr. Blinken said of Iran that 'degrading its missile and drone capabilities' was a key G7 goal. Mr. Blinken also addressed the ongoing conflict in Gaza, pointing a finger at Hamas for the failure so far to reach a cease-fire deal that would include the release of Israeli prisoners. 'The only thing standing behind the Gaza people and a cease-fire is Hamas,' he said. But he also addressed a major friction point with Israel, warning against what Israel says is its planned attack on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have sought shelter from fighting elsewhere in the enclave. Israel has said an invasion of Rafah is necessary to eliminate Hamas battalions in the city. 'We cannot support a major military operation in Rafah,' Mr. Blinken said. Mr. Blinken said that protecting and caring for civilians amid such an operation was 'a monumental task for which we have yet to see a plan.' Asked about the U.S. veto on Thursday of a United Nations Security Council resolution to recognize a Palestinian state, Mr. Blinken said that while the United States supports the creation of such a state, doing so requires negotiations and that the proposed resolution 'will have no effect on actually moving things forward and achieving a Palestinian state.' He added: 'You can put something down on a piece of paper and wave it around. It has no effect. What does and can have an effect is actual diplomacy.' Mr. Blinken also noted that, under U.S. law passed by Congress, U.N. acceptance of a Palestinian member state would require 'cutting off all of our funding for the United Nations.'

Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times World leaders on Friday urged Israel and Iran to de-escalate tensions after Israel struck an Iranian military base, the latest salvo in a cycle of retaliation that has raised fears of a broader war in recent weeks. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain, whose military participated in defending Israel last weekend against Iran's missile and drone attack, told reporters, 'Significant escalation is not in anyone's interests \u2014 what we want to see is calm heads prevail across the region.' Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, told reporters during a visit to China, 'It is absolutely essential that the region remains stable and that all sides refrain from further action.' Italy's foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said the Group of 7 nations \u2014 which includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States \u2014 had changed the agenda of its meeting Friday on the resort island of Capri to 'address the Iran issue and put priority attention on the Middle East.' 'The political goal of the G7 is de-escalation,' Mr. Tajani said. The government of Jordan, which has been criticized in the Arab world for playing a role in intercepting Iran's attack last weekend, issued an especially pointed plea. 'Israeli-Iranian retaliations must end,' Ayman Safadi, Jordan's foreign minister said on Friday. He urged the international community to turn its attention back to Gaza, where six months of Israel's bombardment and ground invasion have killed over 33,000 people and led to extreme hunger in parts of the territory. 'The inhumane war on Gaza must end now,' Mr. Safadi said. 'The focus of the world must remain on ending the catastrophic aggression on Gaza.' A senior American official said on Friday that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before its attack against Iran. Israel gave the administration an alert moments before its warplanes struck the Iranian embassy complex in Damascus on April 1, but the official said the latest attack was expected given all the warnings Israel had issued during the week. 'We were not surprised,' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters. Publicly, Biden administration officials were tight-lipped about Friday's strike, refusing to comment at all about it. Administration officials were keeping quiet to avoid getting the United States pulled into the conflict between Iran and Israel, the official said. Speaking to reporters in Capri, Italy, at a meeting of foreign ministers from Group of 7 nations, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken declined to address the strike, saying only that 'the United States was not involved in any offensive operations.' He added that the G7 was urging all parties to de-escalate. Antonio Tajani, Italy's foreign minister, told reporters in Capri that the United States had been 'informed at the last minute' of the Israeli strike. Michael Crowley contributed reporting from Capri, Italy.  \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe Israeli military struck Iran early on Friday, according to two Israeli and three Iranian officials, in what appeared to be Israel's first military response to Iran's attack last weekend but one whose scope, at least initially, appeared to be limited.\nThe Iranian officials said that a strike had hit a military air base near the city of Isfahan, in central Iran. Initial reaction in both Israel and Iran was muted, which analysts said was a sign that the rivals were seeking to lower the temperature of their conflict. World leaders, who for nearly a week have urged Israel and Iran to avoid starting a broader war in the region, called for both sides to de-escalate tensions on Friday.\nThe Israeli military declined to comment on the strike. A senior U.S. official said that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before the attack. All the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\nThe explosions came less than a week after Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel \u2014 nearly all of which were shot down \u2014 in response to an April 1 strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria that killed seven Iranian officials. That attack brought the decades-long shadow war between Israel and Iran \u2014 waged on land, at sea, in air and in cyberspace \u2014 more clearly into the open.\nA Western official and two Iranian officials said that Israel used both missiles fired from warplanes and drones in the strike, suggesting that the attack included more advanced firepower than initial reports indicated. Iranian officials initially told The New York Times that the attack had been carried out only by small drones, possibly launched from inside Iran, and that radar systems had not detected unidentified aircraft entering Iranian airspace. They said that a separate group of small drones was shot down in the region of Tabriz, roughly 500 miles north of Isfahan.\nIn public, Iranian officials sought to downplay the strike. Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi, the commander in chief of Iran's army, said explosions heard early Friday in Isfahan 'were from our air defense firing at a suspicious object,' and that there had been 'no damage.' Iranian news agencies appeared keen to show that things were 'back to normal' in the city.\nPresident Ebrahim Raisi of Iran had warned that 'the tiniest act of aggression' on his country's soil would draw a response. But in the hours after Israel's strike, there have been no public calls for retribution by Iranian officials. One lawmaker, Seyed Nezamedin Mousavi, called the strike 'ridiculous,' saying it showed Israel 'is content with these ineffective actions.'\nIsfahan is one of Iran's most famous and historic cities. The area also hosts a number of Iranian military sites. Iranian media reported that nuclear facilities in Isfahan had not been hit.\nIsraeli leaders came close to ordering widespread strikes in Iran on the night Iran attacked, officials said, but the war cabinet postponed a decision. Mr. Biden and other world leaders urged Israel for days not to retaliate in a way that would inflame a wider Middle East war while it fights Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both allies of Iran.\nApril 19, 2024, 8:07 p.m. ET April 19, 2024, 8:07 p.m. ET Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, who is in New York attending U.N. meetings, told Iran's state news agency that the small quadcopter targeting a military base in Isfahan did not have casualties or damage. 'Israel is determined to portray its defeat as a victory,' Mr. Amir Abdollahian said, the most senior official to comment on the attacks and draw a link to Israel publicly.\nCredit... Angela Weiss/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images The Israeli attack on an Iranian air base in Isfahan hit a crucial part of an air defense system, a New York Times analysis of satellite imagery found.\nImages showed that the precision attack at the 8th Shekari Air Base damaged or destroyed the 'flap-lid' radar, which is used in S-300 air defense systems to track incoming targets.\nThe Times used several satellite images in its analysis; the location of the damaged area was first pointed out on the social media platform X by Aurora Intel, and the findings have also been confirmed by a former U.S. government imagery analyst, Chris Biggers.\nThe radar is typically surrounded by several vehicles, including four trucks carrying missiles. Before the strike, the missiles were seen positioned next to the radar. After the strike, they had been moved and did not appear visibly damaged. It was not clear why the missiles had been moved. However, the fact that they appear undamaged indicated that the attack had a very precise target, according to Mr. Biggers.\nAn air defense system at the air base in Isfahan in October 2021.

Maxar Technologies, via Google Earth Other areas of the air base and adjacent airport also appeared to be undamaged. The precision of the strike, deep within Iran and with several sensitive sites close by, suggested Israel chose the specific and narrow target, the air defense system.\nAccording to the Missile Defense Project of the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies, Iran has acquired Russian-made S-300 air defense systems to deter Israeli and other airstrikes.\nSome Democrats are fine sending defensive weapons to Israel, but want to see some limits on offensive weapons, which could be used against civilians in Gaza. Credit... -/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images A group of left-leaning House Democrats is urging its colleagues to oppose the $26 billion aid package for Israel, hoping to maximize the number of 'no' votes from the party and send a warning to President Biden about the depth of his political coalition's discontent over his support for Israel's tactics in Gaza.\nFraming the upcoming vote as a make-or-break moral choice akin to Congress's votes to authorize and fund the Iraq war, progressive leaders in the House are working to muster a sizable bloc of Democratic opposition to the aid measure, which is expected to pass on Saturday and become law in the coming days.\n'In the wake of those votes, people came around much, much later and said, \u2018We shouldn't have allowed that to go forward,'' Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington and the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said of the decades-ago debate over Iraq. 'And I think that this is that moment.'\nRepresentative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas, called it a 'defining vote,' adding, 'We're either going to participate in the carnage, or we're not.'\nThere is little doubt that the bill, which would send roughly $13 billion in military assistance to Israel as it continues its offensive in Gaza, will pass the House, along with money for Ukraine, Taiwan and other American allies.\nBut progressive Democrats estimated that 40 to 60 members of their party may oppose it on the House floor on Saturday. That would be a striking signal from Congress, where ironclad bipartisan backing for Israel has long been the norm. And it would highlight the fraught divisions the war in Gaza has sown within the Democratic Party, even as more Democrats including Mr. Biden have begun to criticize Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's approach to the conflict and urge him to better protect civilians.\nThe legislation would allocate $5 billion to Israel's defense capabilities and $9 billion for 'worldwide humanitarian aid,' including for civilians in Gaza. But it would not place further conditions on how Israel could use American military aid, nor block future arms transfers from the United States as an increasing number of Democrats have sought to do.\nDemocrats who are leading the push against the Israel aid bill said they strongly supported the Jewish state and its right to defend itself, and would vote in favor of sending military aid that supports Israel's defense capabilities, such as by replenishing the Iron Dome, David's Sling and Iron Beam defense systems. They also denounced the Oct. 7 terrorist attack by Hamas that prompted the war, and said the hostages taken by Hamas must be released.\nBut they argued that approving more offensive weaponry without conditions was an untenable moral and political position that would amount to an endorsement of Mr. Netanyahu's prosecution of the war, including his intention to invade Rafah over the objections of the Biden administration. More than 33,000 people in Gaza have been killed since the start of the conflict, according to the health ministry there, and the population is facing a hunger crisis.\n'I understand the need for defensive weapons for Israel, particularly in light of the attack by Iran,' said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, who ran his first campaign on an antiwar platform and helped lead efforts to end U.S. participation in the war in Yemen. 'But there is no justification to provide bombs and weapons to Netanyahu to continue the war in Gaza that is killing thousands of innocent Palestinian women and children.'\nSaturday's vote will recall a similar situation from 2007, when the speaker at the time, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, split a piece of spending legislation to allow Democrats to register their opposition to funding the Iraq war while backing a domestic funding bill. Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, similarly divided the foreign aid package to be considered on Saturday in order to get each element across the finish line in the face of distinct coalitions of resistance to different pieces of the bill.\nIn a critical test vote on Friday, the House agreed, 316 to 94, to bring up the package, with 39 Democrats \u2014 mostly progressives \u2014 joining 55 Republicans in opposition.\n'This is a moment for members of Congress who support a safe and secure Israel to send a message that giving Netanyahu more offensive weapons is not a path for peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians,' Representative Becca Balint, Democrat of Vermont and the first Jewish member of Congress to call for a cease-fire, said in an interview. 'To give Netanyahu more offensive weapons at this stage, I believe, is to condone the destruction of Gaza that we've seen in the last six months. And it's also a green light for an invasion of Rafah.'\nRepresentative Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat who led the opposition to funding for the Iraq war in 2007, said the conversations among Democrats in Congress opposing continued U.S. backing for the war in Gaza were 'not unlike' those that took place 17 years ago.\n'We may well be casting the vote on whether a much wider war takes place, and whether American weapons go that result in the death of thousands of innocent people,' Mr. Doggett said.\nThe Democrats who oppose the aid package for Israel represent a minority of their caucus. But they see a 'no' vote as part of a strategy to pressure Mr. Biden to condition aid and halt future offensive weapons transfers. Through many meetings, text chains and conversations with the administration, they have worked to shift the president's approach to Israel, while underscoring the electoral risks Mr. Biden faces among voters who helped power him to the White House in 2020 and are now furious over his handling of the war.\n'The only way to get a course correction is for a sizable number within the Democratic caucus to say it must shift,' Ms. Balint said.\nRepresentative Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat who has been pressing Mr. Biden to withhold offensive weapons from Israel, said a big 'no' vote would strengthen the president's hand to do so.\n'It helps the administration to have some number of Democrats express ourselves in this way,' he said.\nRepresentative Greg Casar, Democrat of Texas, said he hoped a substantial number of Democrats opposing the bill would give the Biden administration greater leverage to influence the Israeli government's approach to the war.\n'I hope this vote will show the world that there is a really significant segment of the United States that doesn't want to see expanded and widening wars,' he said.\nAn Israeli air force F-15 warplane landing at an air base in central Israel on Monday. Credit... Ohad Zwigenberg/Associated Press Israeli warplanes fired missiles on Iran during a retaliatory strike early Friday morning, one Western official and two Iranian officials said, suggesting that the attack included more advanced firepower than initial reports indicated.\nIt was not immediately clear the types of missiles used, from where they were fired, whether any were intercepted by Iran's defenses or where they landed.\nThe Western official and the Iranian officials requested anonymity to discuss classified information.\nPreviously, Iranian officials said Friday's attack on a military base in central Iran was conducted by small aerial drones, most likely launched from inside Iranian territory. A separate group of small drones, they said soon after the attack, was shot down in the region of Tabriz, roughly 500 miles north of Isfahan.\nIsrael has not publicly claimed responsibility for Friday's attack and would not comment on the use of planes or missiles.\nIsrael's strike came in response to an Iranian attack last weekend in which Iran fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel. A majority of the weapons used in that salvo were fired from Iranian territory and intercepted by Israel and its allies before causing any damage.\nBy contrast, the Iranian officials said, Iran's military did not detect anything entering Iran's airspace on Friday, including drones, missiles and aircraft. Iran's state news agency IRNA reported that no missile attacks occurred and that Iran's air defense system was not activated.\nIran's decision to launch its strike primarily from its own soil last week was perceived by Israel as an escalation in the countries' long-simmering shadow war. The Iranians believe the large salvo is helping with deterrence. Throughout the yearslong conflict, the two countries have traded clandestine attacks, including targeted assassinations, cyberattacks and conventional strikes conducted from and within third countries.\nIran's attack last week was itself prompted by an Israeli strike on April 1, in which Israeli aircraft killed several Iranian armed forces commanders in Syria.\nBy using drones seemingly launched from inside Iran's territory rather than its own, Israel hinted at a willingness to turn down the temperature on the conflict while also demonstrating an ability to conduct attacks that Iran could not detect.\nOne Iranian official, a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, said that even though the strike did little damage, the likelihood that drones were fired from under Iran's nose sent a message about Israel's capabilities.\nA guided missile fired from an undetected warplane, even if it landed outside Iranian territory, would most likely deliver a similar threat.\nOfficials from both countries remained largely quiet about Friday's attack, a gesture that appeared aimed at de-escalating a conflict some fear could spiral into a broader regional war. Israel's silence on the attack, an Iranian official said, would allow Tehran to treat the strike as it had comparable previous attacks and not prompt an immediate response.\nMahdi Mohammadi, a senior adviser to Iran's Parliament speaker, said that Israel's limited attack on Iran showed that Iran had achieved its goal of deterrence. Israel's refusal to openly claim responsibility, he said, amounts to a victory for Iran.\nIsrael's attack, he said on the messaging app Telegram, was meant to show that it had the 'capability to access Iran but in practice it also showed that it has accepted that it should not repeat its miscalculation.'\nApril 19, 2024, 2:43 p.m. ET April 19, 2024, 2:43 p.m. ET The White House maintained public silence about the Israeli strike on Iran. 'I'm not going to speak or speculate about any of the reports that are out there,' Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said at her daily briefing.

But after Iran's first direct strike on Israel last weekend, Mehrdad said, 'things are coming to the surface.'\nHe hoped that diplomatic mediation would put an end to the threat of war, and he worried that the county's infrastructure would be 'ruined' by further Israeli attacks.\n'Our economic situation is awful.

A recent round of strikes \u2014 mainly an aerial barrage by Iran against Israel last weekend \u2014 has brought the conflict more clearly into the open and raised fears of a broader war.\nA retaliatory Israeli strike on an Iranian air base on Friday, however, appeared limited in scope, and analysts said it suggested an effort to pull back from the dangerous cycle and potentially move the war back into the shadows.\nHere is a recent history of the conflict:\nAugust 2019: An Israeli airstrike killed two Iranian-trained militants in Syria, a drone set off a blast near a Hezbollah office in Lebanon and an airstrike in Qaim, Iraq, killed a commander of an Iran-backed Iraqi militia.

Credit... Planet Labs PBC Iranian officials said that the Israeli strike on Friday morning was carried out by small exploding drones, a tactic that would follow a well-established pattern in Israeli attacks on Iranian military targets.\nAs Israel has targeted Iranian defense and military officials and infrastructure, small drones \u2014 specifically ones known as quadcopters \u2014 have been a signature of those operations. Quadcopter drones, so named because they have four rotors, have a short flight range and can explode on impact.\nThe drones might have been launched from inside Iran, whose radar systems had not detected unidentified aircraft entering Iranian airspace, Iranian officials said. If the drones were launched within the country, it demonstrates once again Israel's ability to mount clandestine operations in Iranian territory.\nIsrael's military has not commented on Friday's strike. Though it rarely claims responsibility publicly for attacks against Iranian targets, several attacks in recent years have used drones:\nAugust 2019: Israel sent an exploding drone into the heart of a Hezbollah-dominated neighborhood in Beirut, Lebanon, to destroy what Israeli officials described as machinery used in the production of precision missiles.\nJune 2021: A quadcopter exploded outside Tehran at one of Iran's main manufacturing centers for centrifuges, which purify uranium and are used at the country's two major uranium enrichment facilities. Western officials have closely watched activity at those facilities for signs that Iran could be moving toward producing a nuclear weapon. Iran claimed that there had been no damage to the site outside Tehran, but satellite images showed evidence of significant damage.\nFebruary 2022: Six quadcopters exploded at Kermanshah, Iran's main manufacturing and storage plant for military drones.\nMay 2022: A strike targeted the highly sensitive Parchin military site outside Tehran, where Iran develops missile, nuclear and drone technology. Quadcopter drones exploded into a building, killing an engineer and injuring another person, Iranians with knowledge of the attack said at the time.\nJanuary 2023: A drone attack on an Iranian military facility in January 2023 caused a large explosion in the center of Isfahan, the city near the air base that was struck on Friday.

Blinken said on Friday that the United States 'has not been involved in any offensive operations' in Iran when asked about Israel's strike on the country on Friday, but he declined to comment further.\nMr. Blinken spoke on the last day of a meeting of Group of 7 ministers in Capri, Italy, where the agenda was dominated by the conflict in the Middle East, including the exchanges of strikes in the past week between Israel and Iran. In remarks to reporters before departing the island, Mr. Blinken said the G7 was unified in urging de-escalation between Iran and Israel to avoid a wider war.\nBut Mr. Blinken would not even directly confirm the Israeli strike, which appeared to be the country's first military response to Iran's attack last weekend, referring instead to 'reported events,' and he would not say whether the United States had been notified in advance of the Israeli action. Shortly before he spoke, Italy's foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, told reporters that the United States had been 'informed at the last minute' of the Israeli strike.\n'But there was no involvement on the part of the United States,' Mr. Tajani said. 'It was simply information which was provided,' adding that he believed the G7's collective efforts deserved credit for 'the small scale of the event.'\nMr. Tajani did not say how he knew the United States had not been notified in advance, but he had recently come from a meeting with Mr. Blinken and other G7 ministers. A senior American official said on Friday that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before its attack on Iran.\nThe G7 weighed in collectively in a statement concluding the three-day meeting, urging countries to prevent further escalation 'in light of reports of strikes' on Friday. The G7 includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and the European Union.\nThe statement also said that the member nations 'condemn in the strongest terms Iran's direct and unprecedented attack' on Israel.\n'Israel and its people have our full solidarity and support and we reaffirm our commitment toward Israel's security,' it added.\nThe G7 also issued a new warning to Tehran, demanding that 'Iran and its affiliated groups cease their attacks' throughout the Middle East and saying that 'we stand ready to adopt further sanctions or take other measures.'\nMr. Blinken said of Iran that 'degrading its missile and drone capabilities' was a key G7 goal.\nMr. Blinken also addressed the ongoing conflict in Gaza, pointing a finger at Hamas for the failure so far to reach a cease-fire deal that would include the release of Israeli prisoners.\n'The only thing standing behind the Gaza people and a cease-fire is Hamas,' he said.\nBut he also addressed a major friction point with Israel, warning against what Israel says is its planned attack on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have sought shelter from fighting elsewhere in the enclave. Israel has said an invasion of Rafah is necessary to eliminate Hamas battalions in the city.\n'We cannot support a major military operation in Rafah,' Mr. Blinken said. Mr. Blinken said that protecting and caring for civilians amid such an operation was 'a monumental task for which we have yet to see a plan.'\nAsked about the U.S. veto on Thursday of a United Nations Security Council resolution to recognize a Palestinian state, Mr. Blinken said that while the United States supports the creation of such a state, doing so requires negotiations and that the proposed resolution 'will have no effect on actually moving things forward and achieving a Palestinian state.'\nHe added: 'You can put something down on a piece of paper and wave it around. It has no effect. What does and can have an effect is actual diplomacy.'\nMr. Blinken also noted that, under U.S. law passed by Congress, U.N. acceptance of a Palestinian member state would require 'cutting off all of our funding for the United Nations.'\nApril 19, 2024, 9:49 a.m. ET April 19, 2024, 9:49 a.m. ET Cassandra Vinograd\nCassandra Vinograd Reporting from Jerusalem The Iranian news media appear keen to show that things are 'back to normal' in Isfahan.

Lawmakers say it's a national security threat, and that the Chinese government could lean on its owner, ByteDance, to obtain sensitive U.S. user data or influence content on the app to serve its interests.\nRoughly 170 million Americans use TikTok. That's half the population of the United States.\nRoughly 170 million Americans use TikTok. That's half the population of the United States. There's a long road of legislation, deal making and legal challenges ahead before TikTok could be forced to change ownership or even be banned. The Senate would need to pass the legislation \u2014which it may do as soon as next week, now that the House has bundled it into a foreign aid package that it is likely to vote on over the weekend. It would have to survive lawsuits from TikTok and creators. Buyers would have to clear regulatory approval. And after all that, Beijing could simply block a deal. But imagining what a United States without TikTok would look like throws into sharp relief just how much the app has worked its way into American culture.\nTikTok, which officially landed in the United States in 2018, was the most downloaded app in the country, and the world, in 2020, 2021 and 2022. It wasn't that the elements of it were so new \u2014 compelling videos from randos had long been a staple of American pop culture \u2014 but TikTok put the pieces together in a new way.\nUnlike Instagram, Facebook or Snapchat, TikTok didn't build itself around social connections. Its goal is pure, uncut entertainment. The algorithm ingested every data point it could from what users skipped, liked or shared \u2014 and spat it directly into the maddeningly habit-forming For You Page. Fans whispered reverently that it knew them better than they knew themselves.\nHere are 19 ways of understanding how TikTok became part of American life. The music America listens to, the movies it sees, what conspiracies it believes, how it can make or break a product's success, who it defines as a celebrity \u2014 all of it has been influenced by TikTok, for good and bad. Even if you've never opened the app, you've lived in a culture that exists downstream of what happens there.\nof what happens there.

We're way too busy making pictures to worry about some new short-form video app. Then came denial. (This thing is just another fad.) Next, fear. (Teenagers and young adults are never going to the movies again!)\nBut there's a plot twist: Hollywood has come to see TikTok as indispensable.\n'Anyone But You,' a Sony romantic comedy starring Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell, arrived to a piddly $8 million in ticket sales over Christmas weekend. The movie turned into a full-fledged hit ($219 million) after TikTok users (at the urging of Sony) began making videos of themselves re-enacting the credit sequence.\nTikTok also served as a ticket-selling machine for 'M3gan,' a Universal-Blumhouse horror movie about a sassy robot that has spawned a new franchise; 'Wonka,' which debuted in December and collected $632 million; and the Barbenheimer box office phenomenon, otherwise known as 'Barbie,' with $1.4 billion, and 'Oppenheimer,' with about $1 billion. Rote glamour shots and insipid interviews \u2014 ye olde studio publicity tools \u2014 don't work on TikTok; users want behind-the-scenes 'realness.' Hence 'Oppenheimer' stars goofing in a hotel hallway before a premiere, and pink-clad 'Barbie' stars cavorting on the floor with puppies.\n'Now that studios have figured out how to harness TikTok, the last thing they want is for it to go dark,' said Sue Fleishman, a former Universal and Warner Bros. executive who is now a consultant. 'That would actually be a big problem.'\nRecently, V Spehar has posted TikTok videos telling viewers what they might have missed from President Biden's State of the Union address, the first 15 actions that former President Donald J.

Spehar posts to more than three million followers from the handle @UnderTheDeskNews and films many clips lying on the floor, a gimmick that began as an effort to differentiate from the authoritative tone of traditional television news anchors. The style of communication has resonated enough to make Mx. Spehar a regular at White House briefings with social media influencers.\nNews aggregation and analysis accounts like Mx.

Other sites have similar draws. Roughly 16 percent of all American adults get their news from Instagram, and a similar amount from X. Far more people consume news on Facebook and YouTube.\nThe appeal of TikTok and other social sites has made mainstream outlets nervous, and has raised some concerns around accuracy and context as original reporting is funneled through other accounts. The Wall Street Journal has more than 340,000 followers on TikTok, while The New York Times has nearly 630,000 \u2014 numbers that pale in comparison with the followings of individual commentators like Mx.

Their efforts garnered far fewer views than the video that offered up the theory in early January. Not counting all the times the post was referenced in videos by other TikTok users, it has been seen more than seven million times in less than three months.\nTall tales are common on TikTok, where a flimsy patchwork of assumptions and coincidences \u2014 often concerning the schemes of a nefarious echelon of elites \u2014 is illustrated by dramatic images generated by artificial intelligence and spooky musical tracks. (Other such hits include false theories that President Joe Biden rigged the Super Bowl in favor of the Kansas City Chiefs or that Justin Bieber had signaled he was a victim of PizzaGate. False allegations of voter fraud also abound.)\nAbbie Richards, a misinformation researcher who studies the TikTok ecosystem, said that such posts thrive because of the platform's potent recommendation algorithms and its low barrier to entry.\nTikTok allows users to earn money from their videos through tools such as its creator rewards program and livestream subscriptions. Conspiracy theories, which draw high engagement, are one of the most profitable categories, said Ms. Richards, a senior video producer at the liberal watchdog group Media Matters.\n'It's like candy for your brain \u2014 it tells a story that simplifies the world in a way that feels good to you,' she said.\nA quarter of American adults who use the app create 98 percent of its videos.\nA quarter of American adults who use the app create 98 percent of its videos. The toothpaste theory was promoted by two young men known for conspiratorial content, including popular posts about satanic hit men and Britney Spears. They claimed that the colored dots on toothpaste tubes correspond to all-natural, medicinal or chemical ingredients.\nThe post was quickly reposted, copied and stitched into reaction videos. Some came from dentists, who explained that the dots were actually used during the toothpaste packaging process to help guide manufacturing equipment to properly cut and seal the tubes.\nThat conspiracy theory is not new \u2014 they rarely are on TikTok. Colgate, a major toothpaste manufacturer, addressed the color patch rumor last year and said that 'as much as we love cracking secret codes, this one actually has nothing to crack because it's entirely untrue.'\nEven silly rumors, however, can spin out from TikTok into real-world harms. The baseless concerns that store-bought toothpaste tubes might hide toxic ingredients reignited recommendations to opt instead for unproven and potentially damaging homemade options.\nBy Madison Malone Kircher\nIncluding but certainly not limited to: Butter boards, sexy water, blueberry milk nails, unexpected red, lucky girl syndrome, first-time-cool syndrome, bed rotting, 75 soft, 75 cozy, bookshelf wealth, loud budgeting, broccoli freckles, strawberry makeup, glazed donut skin, latte makeup, cowboy copper hair, old money blonde, expensive brunette, orange peel theory, quiet luxury, stealth wealth, tomato girl summer, indie sleaze, coquette, looksmaxxing, male perms, vanilla girl, clean girl, soft girl, coastal grandma, coastal cowgirl, low-high visual weight makeup, sleepy-girl mocktails, fluffy coffee, shrimp tree, girl math, girl dinner, mob wife, clowncore, balletcore, Barbiecore, royalcore, corecore.\nFor the music industry , TikTok has become a potent but unpredictable promotional outlet, and a vital one in the race to mint a new hit.

Young artists like Olivia Rodrigo and Lil Nas X saw their popularity explode on the platform, and acts like Fleetwood Mac have seen decades-old songs get a boost from memes on the app. But TikTok is also the latest tech platform to draw the anger of the music industry for low royalty rates. In February, Universal Music Group, which represents artists like Ms. Rodrigo, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and Drake, withdrew the rights to its music on the app, saying that TikTok was trying to 'bully' the company to accept low terms.\nWithin days, millions of TikTok videos using music from Universal artists went mute, and since then guessing which side would blink first has become a media-business parlor game.\nLast week, however, Ms. Swift \u2014 who releases her music through Universal, but has owned the copyrights to her work since 2018 \u2014 broke ranks and put her songs back on TikTok, just ahead of the release of her next album on Friday. Now the question is, will other artists will follow.\nFor years I thought TikTok was mostly a parenting problem , and had only tangential bearing on what I cover: threats to national security. It took a while \u2014 and a lot of conversations with both tech firms and government officials \u2014 for me to become concerned about the potential that it could also pose a major problem on that front.\nFor years I thought TikTok was mostly a parenting problem, and had only tangential bearing on what I cover: threats to national security. It took a while \u2014 and a lot of conversations with both tech firms and government officials \u2014 for me to become concerned about the potential that it could also pose a major problem on that front. Not because the company's Chinese owners could figure out your dance-move preferences, but because the algorithm at the core of the app is wrapped in such mystery.\nSo what's the issue? The algorithm doesn't belong to TikTok; it is provided by engineers working for ByteDance, the Chinese company that controls the platform and develops the code in enormous secrecy in laboratories around the world, in Beijing, Singapore and Mountain View, Calif.\nThe Chinese government is intent on keeping it that way. It has issued regulations that require Beijing's regulators to grant permission before any ByteDance algorithms can be licensed to outsiders. They are unlikely to do so.\nAnd so, as long as it is written by ByteDance, and can't be picked apart on the outside, there will always be the risk that it will become a pipeline for influencing citizens, and thus voters, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways.\nSenator Mark Warner, the chairman of Senate Intelligence Committee, has noted that because TikTok has emerged as a major source of news \u2014 and because it collects data on users that the Chinese government could find useful, even crucial \u2014 it poses a serious threat, and could become 'the most powerful propaganda tool ever.'\nAt least based on what the United States has made public. The intelligence agencies have been giving closed-door briefings, but presumably there hasn't been a classified blockbuster, since there would likely be great pressure to declassify it.\nStill, we have seen waves of new influence campaigns flowing out of China \u2014 much of it aimed at nations other than the United States. While TikTok has not been at the center of those campaigns, clearly, the Chinese have learned a lot in the past few years, including from the Russians. (Researchers have also found that topics commonly suppressed in China, including about the Tibetan and Uyghur populations, appear to be unusually underrepresented on TikTok compared with Instagram.)\nThis is not a problem that would be solved by simply selling TikTok's operations to an American buyer. Sure, the bill that went through the House bans a new, Western-owned TikTok from having any 'operational relationship' with ByteDance, 'including any cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm.' Good luck with that \u2014 TikTok would no longer be TikTok.\nThe real question is whether anyone gets to look under the hood. Because to make Americans trust TikTok, the country will need an early warning system, something that will assure everyone that a technology that became popular because it generated memes and celebrates self-expression does not become a conduit for a foreign government interested in subtly influencing how we vote.\nSouthern Alamance Middle School, a public school in Graham, N.C., recently came up with a novel way to combat student distractions from social media. Or at least to curb the phenomenon that some teachers have dubbed 'Toilet TikToks.'\nSouthern Alamance Middle School, a public school in Graham, N.C., recently came up with a novel way to combat student distractions from social media. Or at least to curb the phenomenon that some teachers have dubbed 'Toilet TikToks.' The problem: Educators there noticed a spike in the number of students asking to leave class \u2014 sometimes as frequently as nine times per day \u2014 to go to the bathroom, where they made TikTok videos.\nThe solution: Administrators decided to remove the bathroom mirrors that students used to film TikToks and primp for their close-ups. They also introduced an online system that issues students digital hall passes when they want to be excused from class and that allows administrators to track students' locations. 'Since removing the mirrors,' administrators wrote in a message to parents in January, 'we have seen a drastic decrease in bathroom visits from students asking to be excused just to make videos.'\nToilettoks \u2014 a TikTok genre, dating back at least five years, in which students use school bathrooms as film sets for dance routines, lip-syncing clips or critiques of unclean lavatories \u2014 are one of the milder social media annoyances for schools.\nAcross the United States, students have also used school bathrooms as arenas to stage, film and post videos of bullying, physical assaults on schoolmates and acts of vandalism.\nIn March, Alamance-Burlington schools announced that it was joining dozens of other U.S. districts that have filed lawsuits accusing social media platforms, including TikTok, of unfairly ensnaring young people.\n'We're seeing the negative impacts of social media on our students every day,' Kristy Davis, the acting superintendent of Alamance-Burlington schools, said. 'Their well-being has to be the top priority.'\nMy favorite Instagram account is a collection of TikToks.

By the time TikTok debuted, in 2017, I was already in my 30s and too old and lazy to work another app into my rotation. Instagram and Twitter were distracting enough. But now those platforms lie downstream of TikTok's creative wellspring, waiting for bits of its most popular content to drift into the open internet. TikToks float into my friends' Instagram stories, percolate into our group chats, swirl into my Twitter feed. My phone is always bleating with its outro sound effect. I rarely open TikTok, but I watch TikToks all the time.\nTikToks let loose a chaotic element into Instagram's internet mall, and they break the monotony of Twitter's boosted tech-bro threads. They stock YouTube compilations and spark Facebook debates and fuel trend pieces.\nIf TikTok were to disappear, it would feel, at least for a while, like the internet's big content spigot had been turned to a trickle. Rival platforms have tried to remake themselves in TikTok's image \u2014 building in short-form videos, algorithmic timelines and searchable sound clips \u2014 but have failed to reproduce the hypnotic energy of its perpetual discovery machine. We'd be left with a diluted version of its secret sauce.\nBut any network that hopes to capitalize on its own popularity will disrupt its product. Even as other social media platforms try to become TikTok, TikTok is trying to become them, lengthening its videos to compete with YouTube and introducing an e-commerce platform to 'drive meaningful shopping experiences' and rival Instagram. Eventually some new, inexplicably addictive platform will rise in its place. And I will rely on the kindness of some slightly younger strangers to show me what's on it.\nMuch has been said about the 'addictive design' of TikTok. But what is the social media site actually doing to our brains?\nThere is very little research looking at what goes on inside people's heads while they're using TikTok. But one small study conducted on Chinese university students used magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain activity while they watched personalized TikTok videos (ones the algorithm had selected based on their past use) versus generalized ones (videos the app recommended to new users).\nThe students had greater activity in several areas of the brain, including ones associated with reward, attention and processing social information, while viewing personalized videos. In other words, the algorithm did its job.\nOther social media platforms have been shown to turn on similar brain regions. So what makes TikTok different? Some experts have proposed that it can send users into a 'flow state': the experience of being so absorbed in a task that the person loses track of time. Backing this up, one study found that TikTok users reported experiencing higher levels of flow than Instagram users.\n'Flow' is often associated with work or hobbies \u2014 activities that are challenging enough to be engaging but not frustrating. Watching videos doesn't require skill the way that many flow-inducing activities do, yet the app is able to induce the feelings of enjoyment, concentration and time distortion that are characteristic of flow \u2014 possibly because of the algorithm's immersive quality.\nIs there any more official signal that a business titan has arrived at the heart of the American social-financial-artistic-political power nexus than being invited to be an honorary host of the annual Met Gala, a.k.a. 'the party of the year'?

'the party of the year'? Any more glamorous recognition than being asked to join its convener, the Vogue editor, Anna Wintour, in the Metropolitan Museum's soaring atrium as the great and the good of Hollywood, fashion, sports, Wall Street and Washington swan past? On May 6, TikTok will be lead sponsor of both the party and the museum fashion exhibition it celebrates. The company's chief executive, Shou Chew, has been named an honorary chair of this year's gala, along with the Loewe designer Jonathan Anderson, while Ms. Wintour, Zendaya, Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez and Chris Hemsworth are the event's co-chairs.\nThat placement would put TikTok firmly in the tradition of previous gala sponsors like Amazon, Instagram and Apple \u2014 tech companies bedazzled by the Old Establishment, which in turn is bedazzled by their blush of upstart cool.\nIt is an acknowledgment, if any were needed, of the prominent role the app has come to play in fashion in a mere few years.\nIt was only in 2021, after all, that Ms. Wintour was criticized for inviting TikTok stars such as Addison Rae and Dixie D'Amelio to the party \u2014 for somehow cheapening it by catering to the buzzfeed machine of the smartphone, rather than the elite. After all, not just anyone can get an invite, even if they can afford the $50,000 price tag for a seat; Ms. Wintour vets every guest, and the price of admission has to do with cultural currency even more than actual currency.\nWhich is why, of course, TikTok belongs. Despite the fact that all social media is forbidden inside the party.\nFast-forward three years, and there are more than 75 billion views associated with the #TikTokfashion hashtag; almost 500 million with #2023Gala alone. Luxury brands routinely sign up TikTok stars as brand ambassadors along with every other kind of star, hoping to access their audience (received relevance is something Vogue might be getting out of the association, too). And thus is created a virtuous \u2014 or vicious? \u2014 cycle in which TikTok feeds the gala machine, which feeds TikTok, which is the vicarious experience that has come to feed us all.\nTikTok is a motherlode of mental health content , filled with compelling first-person accounts of everything from major depression to selective mutism.

Depending on your perspective, that's either a very good thing \u2014 or concerning. Corey Basch, who analyzed 100 popular TikTok videos with the hashtag mentalhealth for a 2022 study, emerged concerned about the looping effect of the algorithm.\n'What's so important and disturbing to recognize is the downward spiral that users can get swept into,' said Dr. Basch, a professor of public health at William Paterson University. 'If one is drawn to posts related to despair and anxiety, they can easily spend hours exposed to repetitive content known as an echo chamber.'\nThe surge of content about mental health has meant that young people are more likely to self-diagnose before seeing a clinician, psychiatrists report. Diagnoses for ADHD and anxiety disorders shot up during the pandemic years, especially among young people.\nSome researchers have expressed concern about how profit motives may feed into these trends, since platforms often feature advertising from app-based mental health services, and influencers have sponsorship deals with such companies.\n'They say we can diagnose you really quick, just take this five-question quiz and we can send you a prescription in a nice little box,' said Holly Avella, a Ph.D. candidate at Rutgers University who has researched mental health and social media.\nResearchers also warn that TikTok videos can deliver misinformation. A review of literature published last year found that around one-fifth of videos mentioning cognitive behavioral therapy were inaccurate, describing it as ineffective or harmful.\nBut some users credit the app with breaking open the national conversation around mental illness.\n'You can sit there on your pedestal and pooh-pooh it all you want,' said Kate Speer, who has used her social media feeds to describe her experience of serious mental illness. TikTok is helpful for 'the very people who are struggling the most, those who don't have access to services in the real world and who might even be so disabled by mental illness that they are locked in their houses.'\nBy Michael M.

Instead, he released his first TikTok. 'Chiefs or Niners?' asked a disembodied, youthful-sounding voice. 'Two great quarterbacks; hard to decide,' replied the president, casually dressed in a half-zip sweater and khakis.

TikTok can use your I.P. address and location to determine the advertising you see, but it can also reveal other real-life associations.

Ms. Lee's primary is one of the first down-ballot electoral tests of the Israel-Gaza conflict this year.\n'To fight for common sense in the House is to often be alone. I have seen Summer walk alone,' Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. 'On Tuesday, what we must do is show her and show the world and show the people in that big white house that she is not alone.'\n'It's not about winning \u2014 it's about winning big,' she added.\nMs. Lee won a close primary in 2022 against a moderate challenger on her way to become the first Black woman to represent Pennsylvania in Congress. She has garnered broad support from Democrats this year. Even so, she has also faced pressure within her district after becoming one of the first members of Congress to call for an immediate cease-fire, just over a week after Hamas attacked Israel, and Israel responded with a military assault on Gaza.\nDuring her remarks, Ms. Lee reiterated her support for union jobs, affordable housing and a 'pro peace movement.' At one point, she told the audience that there was 'no room for people who would use our communities against each other for their own political ambitions.'\nShe framed her race as being about democracy and appeared to acknowledge the heightened focus on her Israel-Gaza stance, saying, 'You don't have a democracy if one issue determines whether or not my community has representation.'\nHer opponent, Bhavini Patel, a municipal councilwoman, has repeatedly criticized Ms. Lee's votes relating to the conflict. Ms. Patel said in an interview that on Sunday she attended a 'rally focused on the Jewish community' and decried her opponent's rally as 'bringing people here who are not from here.'\nMs. Lee and her supporters have sharply criticized the involvement of Jeff Yass, a Republican megadonor in Pennsylvania who gave significantly to Moderate PAC, a super PAC backing centrist Democrats and running ads supporting Ms. Patel. Ms. Lee and her supporters have seized on them: Her campaign distributed signs on Sunday that read 'Move, Yass! Get out of the way.' (Ms. Patel said she had denounced Mr. Yass and his support.)\nAllies of Ms. Lee also indirectly praised her Gaza stance. Mr. Jones told the crowd that Ms. Lee 'shows us that solidarity is about consistency in showing up for each other,' and that solidarity includes a spectrum of people, 'whether it's workers in Pittsburgh or the people of Palestine.'\n'Summer is somebody who knows that sometimes confrontation is confirmation that we are on the right path for victory,' he said.\nAnd when Ms. Ocasio-Cortez began to criticize AIPAC, the pro-Israel group that is backing challenges to progressive incumbents outside Pennsylvania, the audience promptly booed the group's mention.\nBackers of Ms. Lee have pointed to her diverse coalition as evidence that she can draw support from the groups that the national Democratic Party is looking to motivate, such as young people and voters of color.\nMeanwhile, a handful of critics outside the venue, several of whom said they were backing Ms. Patel, held signs that criticized Iran and cast Ms. Lee and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez as opposing Israel. The protesters said they were especially unhappy with Ms. Lee's vote last week against parts of a foreign aid package that allocated billions to Israel and imposed new sanctions on Iran.\n'We as a Jewish community are afraid, and we want her to understand that by not supporting things like Iran sanctions, it makes not just Israel but also America less safe,' said Julie Paris, a regional director for the pro-Israel group StandWithUs and Pittsburgh resident.\nBut Ms. Lee's backers vastly outnumbered Ms. Paris and her compatriots.\nWill Allison, who served as president of College Democrats at the University of Pittsburgh, said his group had endorsed Ms. Lee, the first primary endorsement he said the group had made.\n'We're very lucky to have her as a congresswoman who can bring the money back to the district and can make the system work for us as her constituents, but who can also authentically hold to her positions and take those tough votes,' he said.\nAnd when Mayor Ed Gainey of Pittsburgh took the stage and asked the crowd, 'Y'all know what time it is?' the audience emphatically shouted back: 'Summer time!'\nA correction was made on : Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated how Ms. Lee voted on some parts of the foreign aid package.

The city claims that's not what the Eighth Amendment means.","summary":"Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index The Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis. The case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces. The issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years. The dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces. The question before the justices is whether those laws went so far that they punished people for being homeless and violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. A group of homeless residents is challenging the city's enforcement of the ordinances as unconstitutional, arguing that they are involuntarily homeless in the city because there are not shelter beds available and that the city may not punish them without offering shelter. City officials in Grants Pass counter that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment. They warn that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would fuel homeless encampments across the country and hamstring the ability of local governments to respond. Here's what else to know: The case began in October 2018, when Debra Blake, a homeless woman in Grants Pass, sued the city, accusing officials of breaching the Constitution. 'The city of Grants Pass is trying to run homeless people out of town,' the lawsuit said. 'On any given day or night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, are forced to live outside due to the lack of emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.'\nThe plaintiffs' argument rests in part on a 1962 case, Robinson v. California, in which the Supreme Court held that laws imposing penalties on people for narcotics addiction violated the Eighth Amendment because they punished a state of being, not a specific action, like drug possession or sale. In a similar fashion, the plaintiffs contend, Grants Pass is punishing people for being involuntarily homeless, not for specific actions.\nThat argument held sway in a separate case, Martin v. Boise, in 2018. In that case, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Boise, Idaho, had violated the constitutional rights of homeless people by imposing criminal penalties for sleeping and camping outdoors, even though the city did not have enough shelter beds.\nLawyers for Grants Pass point to the Boise case as a cautionary tale. The decision only hastened 'sprawling encampments, rising deaths and widespread harms to the community, as localities are forced to surrender their public spaces,' the lawyers wrote in a brief. The lawyers added that lawmakers, not courts, were best suited to address homelessness and the complexity of its root causes.\nUnderlining the tricky balance inherent in the case, a number of groups have sought to strike something of a compromise. The Biden administration, the city and county of Los Angeles, the city and county of San Francisco, California and the state's governor have weighed in, all seeking to find a careful balance between support for homeless residents and for broader communities.\nThe Biden administration, which will participate in the oral arguments, has not chosen a side in the dispute. Even as it was sharply critical of laws that in effect criminalize homelessness \u2014 policies that it argues can make it harder for people to escape their circumstances \u2014 the administration said local governments had a basic responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces like parks and sidewalks. April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET The argument is scheduled for 65 minutes. But it will probably last more than twice that long. April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET The stakes are high. In San Francisco, which is embroiled in a lawsuit over encampments, city officials have complained for months that a sweeping injunction based on the Grants Pass decision and other Ninth Circuit rulings has complicated law enforcement around downtown tent camps. Over the weekend, I asked Senator Scott Wiener, a Democratic legislator who represents San Francisco, what he was hoping for from the Supreme Court. 'Certainty,' he told me, 'because things have been chaotic here.'  April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET In briefs on the case, California leaders have tried to take a nuanced position, arguing, in essence, that they don't want to criminalize homelessness but need more flexibility to clear the most dangerous encampments and compel people to take shelter when it is offered. This tricky balance was reflected in Gov. Gavin Newsom's brief 'in support of neither party.' April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET Outside the Supreme Court building this morning, activists hoping to protect the rights of homeless people have gathered with signs that call for 'Housing Not Handcuffs.'

Mark Abramson for The New York Times Tent encampments lining public parks and city sidewalks. Piles of garbage, human waste and used needles. According to leaders across the political spectrum who have asked the Supreme Court to address homelessness, those are the consequences of a sharp increase in homelessness that have forced many cities to 'a breaking point.' Although the case before the court on Monday centers on the narrow issue of whether the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment shields homeless people with no options for shelter from fines, fees and jail time, officials and advocates across the country are watching the case closely for its potential to reshape homelessness policy. The case underscores deep divisions over how best to address homelessness and how much leeway to give to local and state officials to help solve the problem. Theane Evangelis, a lawyer for the city of Grants Pass, Ore., who also represented the city of Boise, Idaho, in a similar case in 2018, warned that 'the stakes could not be higher for every city in the country.' If the Supreme Court upheld an appeals court ruling on behalf of the homeless plaintiffs, she added, cities everywhere 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.' Those who side with the homeless plaintiffs counter that the issue before the court is a focused one, on how to interpret the Constitution. The cities' willingness to embrace solutions like more affordable housing will determine whether the homelessness crisis will begin to abate, they say. 'The first thing for folks who aren't in this field \u2014 or understanding the nuances of this case \u2014 to understand is that nobody wants a country where people are forced to sleep outside,' said Ann Oliva, chief executive of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, an advocacy group founded in the 1980s with bipartisan roots. In briefs, supporters of Grants Pass have contended that local and state policymakers, not judges, are best placed to devise homelessness policies. The cases from Grants Pass and Boise had allowed 'federal judges to serve as the nation's \u2018homelessness policy czars,'' wrote the Cicero Institute, a Texas policy group critical of longstanding federal policy that channels funds to programs to provide the homeless with permanent housing without requiring people to undergo mental health or drug treatment. Lawyers for the National Alliance to End Homelessness say that imposing penalties, rather than providing housing and services, ignores the roots of the issue. In its brief to the court, the group said that the city of Grants Pass and its defenders, 'rather than working to end it,' sought 'to banish homeless people out of sight and out of mind.' 'The threat of criminal penalties does not reduce homelessness,' the brief argued. 'At most, it drives unsheltered homeless people into hiding, leading to greater health and safety concerns for localities. Criminal punishment for peaceably sleeping outside as an unsheltered homeless person is not only cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but unnecessary, expensive and counterproductive.'  April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET It is early in California, but today's arguments are being closely watched here. California has about 12 percent of the nation's population, but roughly a third of the nation's homeless people. A lot of factors play into that, including the sunny weather to a crippling housing shortage. But rulings by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit constraining tent camp enforcement have made California's homelessness crisis particularly wrenching and visible. April 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET This is the start of a big week at the court, featuring the final arguments of the term. In addition to the homelessness case today, the justices will hear an abortion case on Wednesday and a case on Trump's claim that he is immune from prosecution on Thursday. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has said that he opposes criminalizing homelessness but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass have impeded the ability of the local authorities to move people into shelters and temporary housing. Credit... Jeff Chiu/Associated Press The Goldwater Institute and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California ordinarily have little in common. One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation's most liberal states. But for the past six years, they have been aligned on one highly charged issue: the need for some legal way to clear homeless encampments that have proliferated in cities throughout the West. On Monday, the Supreme Court will consider an Oregon case that could reshape homelessness policy nationally. On its face, The City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks. More broadly, however, the case deals with one of the thorniest aspects of the homelessness crisis \u2014 the balance between the government's responsibility to protect public health and the human right to exist without housing. The conflict has been particularly acute in the West, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has issued opinions over the past six years that officials blame for the sprawling tent encampments in public spaces that have spread since the pandemic. As voters' frustration has grown, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping, only to have the courts reject them. Advocates for homeless people, the American Psychiatric Association and several left-leaning states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, argue that criminalizing homelessness only worsens the problem. More effective, they say, is focusing on housing, treatment, education and jobs for people who are homeless. In the nine Western states in the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction, however, officials have increasingly begged the court to explicitly define the point at which a community can reclaim its shared spaces without triggering lawsuits. Some echo conservative appointees on the Ninth Circuit like Judge Daniel Bress, who issued a scathing response last year after the liberal majority voted not to give the Grants Pass case a rehearing before the full appeals court. (The three-judge had panel found that penalties for bunking outdoors violated the Constitution if the local population of homeless people exceeded the city's shelter capacity.) The Ninth Circuit, he wrote, need only look to its doorstep to see the fruit of its decision \u2014 a dystopia of 'homelessness, drug addiction, barely concealed narcotics dealing, severe mental health impairment' and post-Covid 'hollowing out.' In Phoenix, where a massive encampment near the Arizona State Capitol consumed millions of state dollars and years of litigation, Timothy Sandefur, vice president for legal affairs of the Goldwater Institute, noted that both sides had asked the court for clarification. 'It just shows,' he said, 'that across the board, the Ninth Circuit ruling that you have a constitutional right to sleep in a public park is unworkable and has got to be reversed.' In California, where more than 180,000 people are homeless, Mr. Newsom wrote in his brief to the court that he opposes criminalizing homelessness, but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass 'have impeded not only the ability to enforce basic health and safety measures, but also the ability to move people into available shelter beds and temporary housing.' Since his election in 2018, California has pumped more than $20 billion into programs to address homelessness, including specialized housing, a new court-based approach for dealing with addiction and mental illness and a $6.38 billion bond. At a news conference last week, he recalled pitching in to dismantle one tent camp in Oakland that 'felt like a scene out of a \u2018Raiders of the Lost Ark' where, you know, thousands and thousands of rats appeared running all around us.' 'This is to me just about common sense, not about ideology,' the governor said.  'Suddenly, I found myself homeless,' Laura Gutowski said. 'I never expected it to come to this.' Credit... Mason Trinca for The New York Times Inside a warming shelter, Laura Gutowski detailed how her life had changed since she became homeless two and a half years ago in Grants Pass, a former timber hub in the foothills of southern Oregon. Her husband's death left her without steady income. She lived in a sedan, and then in a tent, in sight of the elementary school where her son was once a student. She constantly scrambled to move her belongings to avoid racking up more fines from the police. 'I never expected it to come to this,' said Ms. Gutowski, 55. She is one of several hundred homeless people in this city of about 40,000 that is at the center of a major case before the Supreme Court on Monday with broad ramifications for the nationwide struggle with homelessness. After Grants Pass stepped up enforcement of local ordinances that banned sleeping and camping in public spaces by ticketing, fining and jailing homeless people, lower courts ruled that it amounted to 'cruel and unusual punishment' by penalizing people who had nowhere else to go. Many states and cities that are increasingly overwhelmed by homelessness are hoping the Supreme Court overturns that decision \u2014 or severely limits it. They argue that it has crippled their efforts to address sprawling encampments, rampant public drug use and fearful constituents who say they cannot safely use public spaces. That prospect has alarmed homeless people and their advocates, who contend that a ruling against them would lead cities to fall back on jails, instead of solutions like affordable housing and social services. The case highlights the fierce divide over the thorny issue of how to regulate homelessness. Theane Evangelis, a lawyer representing Grants Pass, said the Supreme Court's decision would reverberate widely. If it does not overturn the lower-court decision, she said, cities around the United States 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.' Ed Johnson, a lawyer for the Oregon Law Center, a nonprofit legal aid group, who represents the homeless residents, said a ruling against them would strip them of their few protections.

Lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Credit... Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times At the core of the Supreme Court battle over a small Oregon town's treatment of its homeless people is a narrow question: Does the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual treatment apply to a city's efforts to crack down on public sleeping and camping? The Eighth Amendment is most commonly applied to punishments, not to laws themselves, and it is often the focus of litigation around the death penalty, solitary confinement and life without the possibility of parole. But in the case on Monday, lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Because the town, Grants Pass, has no homeless shelter, unaffiliated with any religious group, that is open to everyone, they argue, all homeless people there are involuntarily homeless and cannot be punished for having nowhere to go. To make that argument, the homeless plaintiffs have looked to rulings that apply the amendment beyond punishments themselves and to the concept that a person cannot be penalized for their state of being. In one landmark 1962 decision, Robinson v. California, the court found that a person could not be punished for being addicted to drugs, paving the way for subsequent applications. Because those rulings found that the Eighth Amendment prohibits punishing people for having 'an involuntary status,' the homeless plaintiffs say that it would also be relevant to their situation. They add that they are being disciplined for circumstances outside their control, in this instance 'universal biological necessities like sleeping and using a blanket to survive cold temperatures when they have no choice but to be outside.' The city argues that this is an inappropriate use of the Eighth Amendment and a fundamental misunderstanding of its purpose. Two legal experts, in filing a friend-of-the-court brief siding with Grants Pass, argued that the Constitution did bar criminalizing someone's state of being, rather than their specific conduct. But that prohibition, the law professors \u2014 Peter W. Low of the University of Virginia and Joel S. Johnson of Pepperdine \u2014 added, had a 'shaky Eighth Amendment footing.'  \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis.\nThe case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces.\nThe issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years.\nThe dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces. The question before the justices is whether those laws went so far that they punished people for being homeless and violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\nA group of homeless residents is challenging the city's enforcement of the ordinances as unconstitutional, arguing that they are involuntarily homeless in the city because there are not shelter beds available and that the city may not punish them without offering shelter.\nCity officials in Grants Pass counter that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment. They warn that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would fuel homeless encampments across the country and hamstring the ability of local governments to respond.\nHere's what else to know:\nThe case began in October 2018, when Debra Blake, a homeless woman in Grants Pass, sued the city, accusing officials of breaching the Constitution. 'The city of Grants Pass is trying to run homeless people out of town,' the lawsuit said. 'On any given day or night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, are forced to live outside due to the lack of emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.'\nThe plaintiffs' argument rests in part on a 1962 case, Robinson v. California, in which the Supreme Court held that laws imposing penalties on people for narcotics addiction violated the Eighth Amendment because they punished a state of being, not a specific action, like drug possession or sale. In a similar fashion, the plaintiffs contend, Grants Pass is punishing people for being involuntarily homeless, not for specific actions.\nThat argument held sway in a separate case, Martin v. Boise, in 2018. In that case, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Boise, Idaho, had violated the constitutional rights of homeless people by imposing criminal penalties for sleeping and camping outdoors, even though the city did not have enough shelter beds.\nLawyers for Grants Pass point to the Boise case as a cautionary tale. The decision only hastened 'sprawling encampments, rising deaths and widespread harms to the community, as localities are forced to surrender their public spaces,' the lawyers wrote in a brief. The lawyers added that lawmakers, not courts, were best suited to address homelessness and the complexity of its root causes.\nUnderlining the tricky balance inherent in the case, a number of groups have sought to strike something of a compromise. The Biden administration, the city and county of Los Angeles, the city and county of San Francisco, California and the state's governor have weighed in, all seeking to find a careful balance between support for homeless residents and for broader communities.\nThe Biden administration, which will participate in the oral arguments, has not chosen a side in the dispute. Even as it was sharply critical of laws that in effect criminalize homelessness \u2014 policies that it argues can make it harder for people to escape their circumstances \u2014 the administration said local governments had a basic responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces like parks and sidewalks.\nApril 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET The argument is scheduled for 65 minutes. But it will probably last more than twice that long.\nApril 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET The stakes are high. In San Francisco, which is embroiled in a lawsuit over encampments, city officials have complained for months that a sweeping injunction based on the Grants Pass decision and other Ninth Circuit rulings has complicated law enforcement around downtown tent camps.

The cities' willingness to embrace solutions like more affordable housing will determine whether the homelessness crisis will begin to abate, they say.\n'The first thing for folks who aren't in this field \u2014 or understanding the nuances of this case \u2014 to understand is that nobody wants a country where people are forced to sleep outside,' said Ann Oliva, chief executive of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, an advocacy group founded in the 1980s with bipartisan roots.\nIn briefs, supporters of Grants Pass have contended that local and state policymakers, not judges, are best placed to devise homelessness policies.\nThe cases from Grants Pass and Boise had allowed 'federal judges to serve as the nation's \u2018homelessness policy czars,'' wrote the Cicero Institute, a Texas policy group critical of longstanding federal policy that channels funds to programs to provide the homeless with permanent housing without requiring people to undergo mental health or drug treatment.\nLawyers for the National Alliance to End Homelessness say that imposing penalties, rather than providing housing and services, ignores the roots of the issue.\nIn its brief to the court, the group said that the city of Grants Pass and its defenders, 'rather than working to end it,' sought 'to banish homeless people out of sight and out of mind.'\n'The threat of criminal penalties does not reduce homelessness,' the brief argued. 'At most, it drives unsheltered homeless people into hiding, leading to greater health and safety concerns for localities. Criminal punishment for peaceably sleeping outside as an unsheltered homeless person is not only cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but unnecessary, expensive and counterproductive.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET It is early in California, but today's arguments are being closely watched here.

She lived in a sedan, and then in a tent, in sight of the elementary school where her son was once a student. She constantly scrambled to move her belongings to avoid racking up more fines from the police.\n'I never expected it to come to this,' said Ms. Gutowski, 55. She is one of several hundred homeless people in this city of about 40,000 that is at the center of a major case before the Supreme Court on Monday with broad ramifications for the nationwide struggle with homelessness.\nAfter Grants Pass stepped up enforcement of local ordinances that banned sleeping and camping in public spaces by ticketing, fining and jailing homeless people, lower courts ruled that it amounted to 'cruel and unusual punishment' by penalizing people who had nowhere else to go.\nMany states and cities that are increasingly overwhelmed by homelessness are hoping the Supreme Court overturns that decision \u2014 or severely limits it. They argue that it has crippled their efforts to address sprawling encampments, rampant public drug use and fearful constituents who say they cannot safely use public spaces.\nThat prospect has alarmed homeless people and their advocates, who contend that a ruling against them would lead cities to fall back on jails, instead of solutions like affordable housing and social services.\nThe case highlights the fierce divide over the thorny issue of how to regulate homelessness.\nTheane Evangelis, a lawyer representing Grants Pass, said the Supreme Court's decision would reverberate widely.

Her husband's death left her without steady income. She lived in a sedan, and then in a tent, in sight of the elementary school where her son was once a student. She constantly scrambled to move her belongings to avoid racking up more fines from the police. 'I never expected it to come to this,' said Ms. Gutowski, 55. She is one of several hundred homeless people in this city of about 40,000 that is at the center of a major case before the Supreme Court on Monday with broad ramifications for the nationwide struggle with homelessness. After Grants Pass stepped up enforcement of local ordinances that banned sleeping and camping in public spaces by ticketing, fining and jailing homeless people, lower courts ruled that it amounted to 'cruel and unusual punishment' by penalizing people who had nowhere else to go. Many states and cities that are increasingly overwhelmed by homelessness are hoping the Supreme Court overturns that decision \u2014 or severely limits it. They argue that it has crippled their efforts to address sprawling encampments, rampant public drug use and fearful constituents who say they cannot safely use public spaces. That prospect has alarmed homeless people and their advocates, who contend that a ruling against them would lead cities to fall back on jails, instead of solutions like affordable housing and social services. The case highlights the fierce divide over the thorny issue of how to regulate homelessness. Theane Evangelis, a lawyer representing Grants Pass, said the Supreme Court's decision would reverberate widely. If it does not overturn the lower-court decision, she said, cities around the United States 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.' Ed Johnson, a lawyer for the Oregon Law Center, a nonprofit legal aid group, who represents the homeless residents, said a ruling against them would strip them of their few protections. 'Can a city make it illegal on every inch of city land, every minute of the day, for people to live outside when they have nowhere else to go?' he said. Homelessness across the country climbed to the highest total on record last year, increasing by 12 percent to more than 650,000 people, according to a count by the federal government. Lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Credit... Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times At the core of the Supreme Court battle over a small Oregon town's treatment of its homeless people is a narrow question: Does the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual treatment apply to a city's efforts to crack down on public sleeping and camping? The Eighth Amendment is most commonly applied to punishments, not to laws themselves, and it is often the focus of litigation around the death penalty, solitary confinement and life without the possibility of parole. But in the case on Monday, lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Because the town, Grants Pass, has no homeless shelter, unaffiliated with any religious group, that is open to everyone, they argue, all homeless people there are involuntarily homeless and cannot be punished for having nowhere to go. To make that argument, the homeless plaintiffs have looked to rulings that apply the amendment beyond punishments themselves and to the concept that a person cannot be penalized for their state of being. In one landmark 1962 decision, Robinson v. California, the court found that a person could not be punished for being addicted to drugs, paving the way for subsequent applications. Because those rulings found that the Eighth Amendment prohibits punishing people for having 'an involuntary status,' the homeless plaintiffs say that it would also be relevant to their situation. They add that they are being disciplined for circumstances outside their control, in this instance 'universal biological necessities like sleeping and using a blanket to survive cold temperatures when they have no choice but to be outside.' The city argues that this is an inappropriate use of the Eighth Amendment and a fundamental misunderstanding of its purpose. Two legal experts, in filing a friend-of-the-court brief siding with Grants Pass, argued that the Constitution did bar criminalizing someone's state of being, rather than their specific conduct. But that prohibition, the law professors \u2014 Peter W. Low of the University of Virginia and Joel S. Johnson of Pepperdine \u2014 added, had a 'shaky Eighth Amendment footing.'  \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis.\nThe case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces.\nThe issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years.\nThe dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces. The question before the justices is whether those laws went so far that they punished people for being homeless and violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\nA group of homeless residents is challenging the city's enforcement of the ordinances as unconstitutional, arguing that they are involuntarily homeless in the city because there are not shelter beds available and that the city may not punish them without offering shelter.\nCity officials in Grants Pass counter that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment. They warn that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would fuel homeless encampments across the country and hamstring the ability of local governments to respond.\nHere's what else to know:\nThe case began in October 2018, when Debra Blake, a homeless woman in Grants Pass, sued the city, accusing officials of breaching the Constitution. 'The city of Grants Pass is trying to run homeless people out of town,' the lawsuit said. 'On any given day or night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, are forced to live outside due to the lack of emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.'\nThe plaintiffs' argument rests in part on a 1962 case, Robinson v. California, in which the Supreme Court held that laws imposing penalties on people for narcotics addiction violated the Eighth Amendment because they punished a state of being, not a specific action, like drug possession or sale. In a similar fashion, the plaintiffs contend, Grants Pass is punishing people for being involuntarily homeless, not for specific actions.\nThat argument held sway in a separate case, Martin v. Boise, in 2018. In that case, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Boise, Idaho, had violated the constitutional rights of homeless people by imposing criminal penalties for sleeping and camping outdoors, even though the city did not have enough shelter beds.\nLawyers for Grants Pass point to the Boise case as a cautionary tale. The decision only hastened 'sprawling encampments, rising deaths and widespread harms to the community, as localities are forced to surrender their public spaces,' the lawyers wrote in a brief. The lawyers added that lawmakers, not courts, were best suited to address homelessness and the complexity of its root causes.\nUnderlining the tricky balance inherent in the case, a number of groups have sought to strike something of a compromise. The Biden administration, the city and county of Los Angeles, the city and county of San Francisco, California and the state's governor have weighed in, all seeking to find a careful balance between support for homeless residents and for broader communities.\nThe Biden administration, which will participate in the oral arguments, has not chosen a side in the dispute. Even as it was sharply critical of laws that in effect criminalize homelessness \u2014 policies that it argues can make it harder for people to escape their circumstances \u2014 the administration said local governments had a basic responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces like parks and sidewalks.\nApril 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET The argument is scheduled for 65 minutes. But it will probably last more than twice that long.\nApril 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET The stakes are high. In San Francisco, which is embroiled in a lawsuit over encampments, city officials have complained for months that a sweeping injunction based on the Grants Pass decision and other Ninth Circuit rulings has complicated law enforcement around downtown tent camps. Over the weekend, I asked Senator Scott Wiener, a Democratic legislator who represents San Francisco, what he was hoping for from the Supreme Court. 'Certainty,' he told me, 'because things have been chaotic here.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET In briefs on the case, California leaders have tried to take a nuanced position, arguing, in essence, that they don't want to criminalize homelessness but need more flexibility to clear the most dangerous encampments and compel people to take shelter when it is offered. This tricky balance was reflected in Gov. Gavin Newsom's brief 'in support of neither party.'\nApril 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET Outside the Supreme Court building this morning, activists hoping to protect the rights of homeless people have gathered with signs that call for 'Housing Not Handcuffs.'

Mark Abramson for The New York Times Tent encampments lining public parks and city sidewalks. Piles of garbage, human waste and used needles. According to leaders across the political spectrum who have asked the Supreme Court to address homelessness, those are the consequences of a sharp increase in homelessness that have forced many cities to 'a breaking point.'\nAlthough the case before the court on Monday centers on the narrow issue of whether the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment shields homeless people with no options for shelter from fines, fees and jail time, officials and advocates across the country are watching the case closely for its potential to reshape homelessness policy.\nThe case underscores deep divisions over how best to address homelessness and how much leeway to give to local and state officials to help solve the problem.\nTheane Evangelis, a lawyer for the city of Grants Pass, Ore., who also represented the city of Boise, Idaho, in a similar case in 2018, warned that 'the stakes could not be higher for every city in the country.'\nIf the Supreme Court upheld an appeals court ruling on behalf of the homeless plaintiffs, she added, cities everywhere 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.'\nThose who side with the homeless plaintiffs counter that the issue before the court is a focused one, on how to interpret the Constitution. The cities' willingness to embrace solutions like more affordable housing will determine whether the homelessness crisis will begin to abate, they say.\n'The first thing for folks who aren't in this field \u2014 or understanding the nuances of this case \u2014 to understand is that nobody wants a country where people are forced to sleep outside,' said Ann Oliva, chief executive of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, an advocacy group founded in the 1980s with bipartisan roots.\nIn briefs, supporters of Grants Pass have contended that local and state policymakers, not judges, are best placed to devise homelessness policies.\nThe cases from Grants Pass and Boise had allowed 'federal judges to serve as the nation's \u2018homelessness policy czars,'' wrote the Cicero Institute, a Texas policy group critical of longstanding federal policy that channels funds to programs to provide the homeless with permanent housing without requiring people to undergo mental health or drug treatment.\nLawyers for the National Alliance to End Homelessness say that imposing penalties, rather than providing housing and services, ignores the roots of the issue.\nIn its brief to the court, the group said that the city of Grants Pass and its defenders, 'rather than working to end it,' sought 'to banish homeless people out of sight and out of mind.'\n'The threat of criminal penalties does not reduce homelessness,' the brief argued. 'At most, it drives unsheltered homeless people into hiding, leading to greater health and safety concerns for localities. Criminal punishment for peaceably sleeping outside as an unsheltered homeless person is not only cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but unnecessary, expensive and counterproductive.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET It is early in California, but today's arguments are being closely watched here. California has about 12 percent of the nation's population, but roughly a third of the nation's homeless people. A lot of factors play into that, including the sunny weather to a crippling housing shortage. But rulings by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit constraining tent camp enforcement have made California's homelessness crisis particularly wrenching and visible.\nApril 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET This is the start of a big week at the court, featuring the final arguments of the term. In addition to the homelessness case today, the justices will hear an abortion case on Wednesday and a case on Trump's claim that he is immune from prosecution on Thursday.\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California has said that he opposes criminalizing homelessness but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass have impeded the ability of the local authorities to move people into shelters and temporary housing. Credit... Jeff Chiu/Associated Press The Goldwater Institute and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California ordinarily have little in common. One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation's most liberal states.\nBut for the past six years, they have been aligned on one highly charged issue: the need for some legal way to clear homeless encampments that have proliferated in cities throughout the West.\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court will consider an Oregon case that could reshape homelessness policy nationally. On its face, The City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks.\nThe City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks. More broadly, however, the case deals with one of the thorniest aspects of the homelessness crisis \u2014 the balance between the government's responsibility to protect public health and the human right to exist without housing.\nThe conflict has been particularly acute in the West, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has issued opinions over the past six years that officials blame for the sprawling tent encampments in public spaces that have spread since the pandemic. As voters' frustration has grown, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping, only to have the courts reject them.\nAdvocates for homeless people, the American Psychiatric Association and several left-leaning states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, argue that criminalizing homelessness only worsens the problem. More effective, they say, is focusing on housing, treatment, education and jobs for people who are homeless.\nIn the nine Western states in the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction, however, officials have increasingly begged the court to explicitly define the point at which a community can reclaim its shared spaces without triggering lawsuits. Some echo conservative appointees on the Ninth Circuit like Judge Daniel Bress, who issued a scathing response last year after the liberal majority voted not to give the Grants Pass case a rehearing before the full appeals court. (The three-judge had panel found that penalties for bunking outdoors violated the Constitution if the local population of homeless people exceeded the city's shelter capacity.)\nThe Ninth Circuit, he wrote, need only look to its doorstep to see the fruit of its decision \u2014 a dystopia of 'homelessness, drug addiction, barely concealed narcotics dealing, severe mental health impairment' and post-Covid 'hollowing out.'\nIn Phoenix, where a massive encampment near the Arizona State Capitol consumed millions of state dollars and years of litigation, Timothy Sandefur, vice president for legal affairs of the Goldwater Institute, noted that both sides had asked the court for clarification.\n'It just shows,' he said, 'that across the board, the Ninth Circuit ruling that you have a constitutional right to sleep in a public park is unworkable and has got to be reversed.'\nIn California, where more than 180,000 people are homeless, Mr. Newsom wrote in his brief to the court that he opposes criminalizing homelessness, but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass 'have impeded not only the ability to enforce basic health and safety measures, but also the ability to move people into available shelter beds and temporary housing.' Since his election in 2018, California has pumped more than $20 billion into programs to address homelessness, including specialized housing, a new court-based approach for dealing with addiction and mental illness and a $6.38 billion bond.\nAt a news conference last week, he recalled pitching in to dismantle one tent camp in Oakland that 'felt like a scene out of a \u2018Raiders of the Lost Ark' where, you know, thousands and thousands of rats appeared running all around us.'\n'This is to me just about common sense, not about ideology,' the governor said.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT 'Suddenly, I found myself homeless,' Laura Gutowski said.

Debs campaigned from a prison cell more than a century ago has the United States experienced what might now happen: a prominent candidate with a felony conviction running for president. And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning.\nFor now, he faces no formal campaign restrictions, beyond having to be present in a courtroom, and he remains highly competitive in polls. But some of the cases are proceeding at a pace that could bring verdicts before the election \u2014 and the Constitution and American law have clear answers for only some of the questions that will arise if he is convicted.\nOthers would bring the country into truly uncharted territory, with huge decisions resting in the hands of federal judges.\nHere is what we know, and what we don't know.\nThis is the simplest question of the bunch. The answer is yes.\nThe Constitution sets very few eligibility requirements for presidents. They must be at least 35 years old, be 'natural born' citizens and have lived in the United States for at least 14 years.\nThere are no limitations based on character or criminal record. While some states prohibit felons from running for state and local office, these laws do not apply to federal offices.\nThe Republican and Democratic Parties have guaranteed spots on general-election ballots in every state, and the parties tell election officials whose name to put in their spot. States could, in theory, try to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on legally shaky ground.\n'We let states set the time, place and manner' of elections, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who specializes in election law, 'but I think the best reading of our Constitution is you don't let the state add new substantive requirements.'\nWhile that view is not universal among legal experts, it prevailed in court in 2019, after California passed a law requiring candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on primary ballots. A federal district judge blocked the law from taking effect, saying it was most likely unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court also unanimously blocked it as a violation of the state constitution, and the case never reached the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that states could not keep Mr. Trump off their ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies people who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' after taking an oath to support the Constitution.\nNumerous lawsuits had argued that Mr. Trump's actions before and on Jan. 6, 2021, met this bar. In December, the Colorado Supreme Court found him ineligible, and Maine's secretary of state did the same. But the Supreme Court \u2014 led by a conservative supermajority, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump himself \u2014 concluded that only Congress had the power to enforce Section 3 against candidates for federal office. (Four of the justices, including the three liberals, wanted to allow a wider range of options for disqualification.)\nCongress is not going to do that with Republicans in control of the House. And the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal cases, meaning convictions would not disqualify Mr. Trump either.\nCongress can designate either groups of people to whom Section 3 applies (such as people who fought for the Confederacy) or specific crimes that, upon conviction, would trigger disqualification, said Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University. But none of the crimes Mr. Trump is charged with carry that automatic penalty.\n'Whether or not Trump is tried, convicted, acquitted, that's a separate question from whether or not he's disqualified,' said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nOne of the charges in the federal case related to Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election \u2014 conspiracy to violate civil rights \u2014 once carried a disqualification penalty, Mr. Kreis said, but Congress removed it decades ago.\nNow that Mr. Trump has secured a majority of delegates to the Republican convention, the party has no mechanism to nominate somebody else. Under the party's official convention rules, if a delegate tries to support someone other than the person the primary results bound them to, 'such support shall not be recognized.'\nNor have top Republicans shown any interest in another nominee.\nIf he were forced to withdraw from the race after the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him.\nafter the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him. Probably not.\nMr. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, and he would be disenfranchised there if convicted of a felony.\nMost felons in Florida regain voting rights after completing their full sentence, including parole or probation, and paying all fines and fees. But it is highly unlikely that Mr. Trump, if convicted, would have time to complete his sentence before Election Day.\nHe could also petition for clemency, which would require the approval of the governor \u2014 Ron DeSantis, who ran against Mr. Trump in the Republican primary \u2014 and two Florida cabinet members. Chris Taylor, the director of external affairs for the Florida Commission on Offender Review, confirmed that a Florida resident convicted of a felony could apply to have their voting rights restored through that process even if their conviction happened outside Florida.\nSince Mr. Trump also has a residence in New York, he could switch his voter registration there to take advantage of its more permissive approach: Felons in New York can vote while on parole or probation. But, as in Florida and almost every other state, they are still disenfranchised while in prison.\nSo if Mr. Trump is imprisoned, he could be in the extraordinary position of being deemed fit to be voted for, but unfit to vote.\nNo one knows.\n'We're so far removed from anything that's ever happened,' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley. 'It's just guessing.'\nLegally, Mr. Trump would remain eligible to be president even if he were imprisoned. The Constitution says nothing to the contrary. 'I don't think that the framers ever thought we were going to be in this situation,' Professor Levinson said.\nIn practice, the election of an incarcerated president would create a legal crisis that would almost certainly need to be resolved by the courts.\nIn theory, Mr. Trump could be stripped of his authority under the 25th Amendment, which provides a process to transfer authority to the vice president if the president is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' But that would require the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare Mr. Trump unable to fulfill his duties, a remote prospect given that these would be loyalists appointed by Mr. Trump himself.\nMore likely, Mr. Trump could sue to be released on the basis that his imprisonment was preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional obligations as president. Such a case would probably focus on the separation of powers, with Mr. Trump's lawyers arguing that keeping a duly elected president in prison would be an infringement by the judicial branch on the operations of the executive branch.\nOn the federal charges only, he could also try to pardon himself \u2014 or to commute his sentence, leaving his conviction in place but ending his imprisonment. Either action would be an extraordinary assertion of presidential power, and the Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of whether a 'self pardon' was constitutional.\nOr President Biden, on his way out the door, could pardon Mr. Trump on the basis that 'the people have spoken and I need to pardon him so he can govern,' Professor Chemerinsky said.\nBut that wouldn't apply to the New York or Georgia cases, because the president does not have pardon power for state charges.\nAgain, no one knows, particularly when it comes to the New York and Georgia cases.\nIn the two federal cases, a likely outcome would be that a Trump-appointed attorney general would withdraw the charges.\nThe Justice Department does not indict sitting presidents, a policy outlined in a 1973 memo, during the Nixon era. It has never had reason to develop a policy on what to do with an incoming president who has already been indicted. But the rationale for not indicting sitting presidents \u2014 that it would interfere with their ability to perform their duties \u2014 applies just as well in this hypothetical scenario.\n'The reasons why we wouldn't want to indict a sitting president are the reasons we wouldn't want to prosecute a sitting president,' said Professor Chemerinsky, who has disagreed with the department's reasoning. 'My guess is, if the Trump prosecution were still ongoing in some way and Trump were elected, the Justice Department \u2014 which would be the Trump Justice Department \u2014 would say, \u2018We're following the 1973 memo.''\nLike so much else here, this would be legally untested, and it is impossible to say what the Supreme Court would do if the question reached it.\nIn its Clinton v. Jones ruling in 1997, the court allowed a lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed. But that case was civil, not criminal, and it was filed by a private citizen, not by the government itself.\nCharlie Savage contributed reporting.","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ben Protess,Jonah E.

Israeli military analysts are divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza. Credit...Within moments of Israel and its allies shooting down a fusillade of Iranian missiles and drones this weekend, many began wondering what the latest exchange between Israel and Iran would mean for the war in the Gaza Strip. The Iranian attack was retaliation for what was widely believed to be an Israeli strike this month on an embassy building in Damascus that killed seven Iranian officials, including three top commanders in Iran's armed forces. But it occurred against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel is battling Hamas, a militant group funded and armed by Iran. Israeli military analysts were divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza, now in its sixth month. The next fulcrum in that war could hinge on whether Israel decides to pursue Hamas in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have fled amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis. Some analysts argued that the implications for Gaza would depend on whether Israel responded with a major counterattack against Iran. Others contended that Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip would be unaffected. Shlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general and a former director of the Israeli military's strategic planning division, said that if Israel responds with substantial force to the Iranian attack, it could spark a multifront war that would compel the Israeli leadership to move its attention away from Gaza. In the case of a significant regional conflagration, General Brom said, Israel might choose to delay its plans to invade Rafah, which Israeli officials describe as the last Hamas stronghold. 'It's not comfortable for us to have simultaneous, high-intensity wars in multiple theaters,' General Brom added. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to send ground forces into Rafah, despite international pressure to back off the operation. On Sunday, an Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that the Iranian attack would have no effect on the military's plan to invade Rafah. A large-scale direct confrontation with Iran could potentially bring the war in Gaza to a close, General Brom said. But for the war to end in such a way, it would require a broader cease-fire that encompassed several parties, including Israel, Iran and the Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. 'There's an idea that in order to resolve a crisis, the situation first needs to become worse,' he said, explaining that an escalation followed by a comprehensive cease-fire with Iran might incline that country to push its regional proxies to stop fighting with Israel. While the members of Israel's war cabinet did not issue a formal statement after meeting on Sunday, a separate Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, indicated that the country would respond to the Iranian assault \u2014 although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how. Other military experts, however, dismissed the link between the Iranian attack and the war in Gaza. 'There's no connection at all,' said Amos Gilead, a retired major general who served in Israeli military intelligence. General Gilead said that Israel's army had enough resources to fight against Iran and continue to wage war against Hamas in Gaza. Others analysts made a similar point, arguing that the resources needed to fight Iran were different from those needed in Gaza. Israel needs fighter jets and air defense systems to counter Iran, they said. In contrast, they added, the army mainly requires ground troops, drones, and attack helicopters to fight Hamas in Gaza. 'There's no real tension between these two things,' said Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former head of Israel's National Security Council. Still, General Eiland said that the success of the coalition that repelled the Iranian attack, which included the United States, Britain and Jordan, could inspire Israel to take advantage of the momentum to overcome its declining status internationally by ending the war in Gaza. Though the United States, Israel's closest ally, has broadly supported Israel's decision to go to war in Gaza, it has increasingly signaled its displeasure over the mounting death toll and warned against a major ground assault in Rafah. The support the United States provided Israel on Sunday in shooting down Iranian drones and missiles could give it more leverage over its Israeli counterparts. While General Eiland said such an outcome could help Israel develop good will in the international community and contribute to reaching a solution to end the war in Gaza and skirmishes with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, he was doubtful that Mr. Netanyahu would purse such a path. 'He says he wants to achieve \u2018total victory' in Gaza and conquer Rafah, a process that could last two or three months,' he said, referring to the prime minister. 'It's clear Netanyahu has a different mind-set and priorities.' Aaron Boxerman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

Yuki Iwamura/Associated Press The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, with diplomats urging restraint by all parties to prevent conflict in the region from escalating. The brazen attack this weekend, when Iran launched a barrage of drones and missiles in retaliation for Israel's attacking its embassy compound in Syria earlier in the month, was the first time Iran had launched open attacks against Israel from its soil. The attack has unnerved a region already roiling in conflict, raising concerns among diplomats and U.N. officials that a new, potentially wide and destructive war could spark if both sides don't stand down. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the Secretary General of the U.N., told the Council that it was 'time to step back from the brink,' and that its members, as well as the United Nations at large, had the collective responsibility 'to actively engage all parties concerned to prevent further escalation.' The meeting on Sunday was convened at the request of Israel. The Council has not collectively issued a statement condemning Iran's attack, and it has also not issued a statement condemning Israel's attack on Iran's embassy in Damascus that killed several senior commanders. All 15 members of the Council must reach a consensus for a statement to be issued and none was reached on both issues. The Security Council is one of the few venues where adversaries engaged in conflict come face to face and sit in the same chamber. On Sunday, both Israel and Iran's ambassadors were present and delivered fiery comments about the other's country, blaming each other for actions they both called terrorism. Gilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador, said Iran's attack had 'crossed every red line' and Israel reserved the right to retaliate. Mr. Erdan called for the Council to take severe action against Iran, including 'crippling' sanctions and statements of condemnation. 'The fact that Israel's air defense proved to be superior does not change the brutality of Iran's attack,' he said. Iran's ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, said his country had an 'inherent right to self-defense' after Israel's attack on its diplomatic compound. Mr. Iravani said that Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region,' but that if its interests, people or national security came under attack it would 'respond to any such threat or aggressions vigorously and in accordance with international law.' The United States and Iran both said that they do not seek war with one another, but that if one attacks the other's interests, there would be a defensive response. Robert A. Wood, a U.S. representative to the U.N., told the Security Council that the 'U.S. is not seeking escalation, our actions have been defensive in nature,' and said the U.S. goal was to 'de-escalate' and then get back to securing an end to the conflict in Gaza. Mr. Wood said the U.S. planned to bring further action on Iran at the Council and called on the Council to unequivocally condemn Iran's actions. Any resolution against Iran put forth by the U.S. at the Council would likely be vetoed by Russia and China, two of Iran's close allies, who sharply criticized Israel for what they said was reckless violation of international law when it attacked Iran's embassy compound. 'What happened in the night of the 14th of April did not happen in a vacuum,' said Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's ambassador to the U.N. China's ambassador, Dai Bing, called on the Council to 'exercise maximum calm and restraint' and said the implementation of an immediate cease-fire is the 'top priority.' Israel has said that the embassy compound was a legitimate military target because senior commanders from Iran's Quds Forces, the external branch of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, were holding a meeting inside the building.

Shear Reporting from Washington The White House said that President Biden and King Abdullah II of Jordan spoke on Sunday about the Iranian attacks and pledged to stay in contact in the days ahead. Officials said the two men also discussed the situation in Gaza, pledging to increase humanitarian aid and to work to end the conflict as soon as possible.

Ramadan Abed/Reuters As thousands of displaced Palestinians tried to return to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday, Israeli troops fired at the crowd, forcing people to turn back in panic, according to an emergency worker and two people who tried to make the journey. Wafa, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency, reported that five people were killed and 23 wounded by Israeli gunfire and artillery in the incident on Al-Rashid Street south of Gaza City as a crowd of Gazans headed north to their homes. The circumstances of the deaths could not be confirmed independently, and the Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions about whether its forces opened fire on Palestinian civilians trying to cross to northern Gaza. For months, the Israeli military has barred Palestinians who have been displaced by the war in Gaza from returning to their homes in northern Gaza. It has become a sticking point in negotiations between Israel and Hamas. It was not clear why some Palestinians believed that Israel would not block them from returning on Sunday. But they were making the journey on a day when Iran had launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel. More than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its assault there in October, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health. The assault occurred in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people, according to the Israeli authorities. On Sunday morning Jamila Ibrahim, 39, said that she began hearing of some Palestinians who left early and managed to get back to the north. She later spoke with friends who were able to return north. But there were very few. Around 10:30 a.m. she and her three children \u2014 who are between 10 and 17 \u2014 set out, joining other people on the journey. She said there were no official notices from the Israel military, which has occupied large parts of Gaza after it launched a ground invasion, that residents would be allowed to return to their homes. It was just based on word of mouth, as well as people seeing others leaving and being encouraged to join the trek home, she said. 'Some people were scared, they didn't know what fate they were heading to, they didn't know what would happen,' she said. 'Some were happy that they were going to return.' Most people were on foot \u2014 carrying what little food they had or their few belongings in bags and luggage \u2014 and some paid large sums of money to go by car, trucks or donkey carts, she said. But they all took the same seaside road, heading north toward an Israeli checkpoint that has cut off southern Gaza from the north. 'There was lots of tension, lots of tension among the people,' she said. 'They were scared they could be shot.' Those who tried to cross north in the middle of the night \u2014 around 4 a.m. \u2014 managed to make it to the north, she said, based on her conversation with friends who crossed successfully. But later that morning, by the time she and other displaced Palestinians tried to follow, Israeli forces opened fire on them, she said. 'Around 12:30 the Israelis started shooting,' she said. Mazen Al-Harazeen, a first responder in Gaza, said Israeli forces fired weapons and he did not know how many had been killed, but he said, 'There was shooting and martyrs.' Early Sunday morning, Avichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, or I.D.F., wrote on social media that the rumors that the army was allowing residents to return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip were false. 'The I.D.F. will not allow the return of residents,' he added. 'For your safety, do not approach the forces operating there.' Nearly two million Gazans have been displaced by the war between Hamas and Israel, now in its sixth month. One of their biggest concerns is when and if they will be allowed to return to their homes, or whether they will be permanently displaced, as previous generations were. Around 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes in 1947 and 1948 during the wars surrounding Israel's establishment as a state. Bilal Shbair contributed reporting.

At Amina al-Hasoni's house in the village of al-Fur'ah, Israel, the Iranian attack wounded her and ripped holes in the roof and floor. Credit... Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times The hospital waiting room was quiet on Sunday: There was no crowd of relatives, no flood of patients. Israel's air defenses had just fended off a large-scale Iranian attack, with only one serious casualty recorded. But there was no sense that a crisis had been averted outside the pediatric intensive care unit at Soroka Medical Center in southern Israel's city of Beersheba. Instead, tension filled the air until the doors to the ward swung open and a gasping mother stumbled out, her face contorted. Then raw emotion quickly took its place as she crumbled into a chair, crying. While Israel suffered little in the way of significant damage overnight, this one family was dealt a devastating blow. Amina al-Hasoni, 7, was clinging to life \u2014 the sole serious casualty of the Iranian barrage. And were it not for systemic inequities in Israel, her relatives said, maybe she too could have been spared. There are roughly 300,000 Arab Bedouins in the Negev desert. About a quarter of them live in villages that are not recognized by Israeli officials. Without state recognition, those communities have long suffered from a lack of planning and basic services like running water, sewers and electricity. And few have access to bomb shelters, despite repeated requests to the state. The Hasoni family lives in one such community, sharing a hilltop in the Negev village of al-Fur'ah with a plot of disconnected houses. When rocket warning sirens went off on Saturday night, Amina's uncle Ismail said he felt stuck \u2014 there was nowhere to go. Booms overhead signaled air defenses intercepting missiles before there was a big explosion. Then he heard a woman screaming \u2014 his sister \u2014 and 'I started running,' he said. Ismail, 38, found his sister outside her house holding Amina, who was bleeding from the head. Her family had decided to flee the rockets, running out the front door. But Amina, who slept in a back room with pink walls covered in painted butterflies, didn't make it. A missile fragment ripped through the home's thin metal roof, shearing a hole with sharp metallic edges. It made impact just in front of the door \u2014 which is where Amina was knocked unconscious. 'I think it hit her while she was running away,' Ismail said. He said he took the injured Amina from his sister and lifted the girl into his own arms. Ismail then tracked down a car that raced her toward the hospital, more than 40 minutes away on a rutted, winding road that fades out in some places, with camels crossing in others. Only then, with Amina on her way, did he go inside the house, where he said he saw a large, black piece of shrapnel about the size of a pretzel jar. And 'there was blood,' he said, a puddle that had turned into a stream across the tile floor, to the front door. By Sunday afternoon, the orange patterned tiles had been cleaned. None of the dozen or so relatives there could say who had done it, only that 'it was bad for the children to see' all the blood. But Ismail hasn't gone back inside. 'It's difficult,' he said, his jeans and boots still spattered with blood. Not far from where he sat, a pink Minnie Mouse blanket and a small black-and-white girl's dress hung on a family clothesline. 'We could have built shelters here,' Ismail added. He dismissed any suggestions that what happened to Amina was bad luck. 'It's part of a policy,' he said. 'We can't do anything.' The missile fragment that tore into Amina's home was one of more than 150 collected in the area on Sunday by police bomb disposal teams, and the family said officers had taken away the piece that hit their home. The teams combed the desert for hours, searching for debris and carting away huge hunks of twisted metal \u2014 efforts repeated across Israel. The Hasoni home is not far from a military base, Nevatim, that was reportedly a target of the Iranian assault and that Israeli officials said was lightly damaged. That is little consolation to Amina's father, Muhammad, who spent the morning at the hospital taking turns at her bedside. He didn't say much to her, he said, and just repeated her name. Amina \u2014 the youngest of his 14 children \u2014 'likes to laugh and have fun all the time,' said Muhammad, 49. She's a good student with a 'strong personality,' he added, who doesn't always listen to instructions. And she loves to draw. He called Iran's actions 'inhumane.' 'May God demolish them,' he said, without hesitation.

Tomer Neuberg/Associated Press After convening a virtual meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, Group of 7 leaders adopted a joint declaration that reaffirmed their 'full solidarity and support to Israel' and accused Iran of having risked 'provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation' that must be avoided. Iran's attack, which appeared to have been mostly intercepted by Israel and its allies, was carried out in retaliation for Israeli attacks on an Iranian Embassy building in Syria earlier this month. Iranian leaders have signaled that their retaliation is over unless they are attacked again. The joint declaration from the leaders of G7 nations \u2014 Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, as well as the European Union \u2014 demanded that 'Iran and its proxies cease their attacks.' The leaders said they were ready 'to take further measures now and in response to further destabilizing initiatives.' Hoping to head off Israel from further escalating the conflict, President Biden privately advised Israel against firing back on Iran, U.S. officials said on Sunday. It was not yet clear how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his government would respond. Leaders of the European Union have publicly urged restraint from both countries as they, too, condemned Iran's actions. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, called the attack 'blatant and unjustifiable,' adding that 'all actors must now refrain from further escalation.' Charles Michel, president of the European Council, said that the condemnation from G7 leaders was unanimous and that 'all parties must exercise restraint.' 'Ending the crisis in Gaza as soon as possible, notably through an immediate cease-fire, will make a difference,' Mr. Michel added. Demonstrators gather at Palestine Square in Tehran on Sunday. Credit... Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times Many Iranians stayed glued to their television screens and phones Saturday night, anxiously following updates as their country launched a military attack on Israel and fearing a wider war that would only add to the country's current economic upheaval. In Tehran and several other big cities, lines of cars stretched a mile or more outside gas stations in the middle of the night. Some parents kept their children home from school on Sunday. Tehran's airport closed down, and will remain that way until at least Monday morning. Iranians living inside the country said in interviews that they were worried the confrontation with Israel would spiral out of control and hoped both sides would avoid escalating the conflict. Soheil, a 37-year-old engineer in Isfahan who, like several other Iranians, asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution, said all he and his colleagues could talk about at work on Sunday was the prospect of a broader conflict. 'I'm afraid of war,' he said. 'It will have a great impact on our daily lives, especially on the economy and the price of dollar, and the anxiety will affect our mental health.' Since a strike two weeks ago on the Iranian Embassy complex in Syria that killed three top military commanders, Iran's currency, the rial, has fallen sharply against the U.S. dollar, shrinking purchasing power as Iran's leaders vowed to respond. Nafiseh, a 36-year-old high school teacher in Tehran, said that many of her students did not attend school on Sunday because parents were worried about counterattacks from Israel. 'It's all everyone is talking about, from teenagers to teachers and family members, it's all about the war and attacks,' she said. Supporters of the government hailed the attacks as Iran's showcasing its military might to defend itself on Saturday, with several hundred gathering in Tehran's Palestine Square to celebrate with fireworks and chants of 'Death to Israel.' A large mural on the square depicted Iranian missiles with a message written in Farsi and Hebrew that read, 'Next time the slap will be harder.' On Sunday night, a crowd formed again in the square, carrying signs and chanting anti-Israel slogans. Others took to social media to say they would fight for their country unconditionally if Iran were to go to war. 'When a foreign enemy is involved, honor means standing with our country even at the cost of our lives,' Reza Rashidpour, a civil engineer, wrote on social media. 'Long live Iran, long live soldiers of Iran.' But critics of the government denounced the attacks, seeing them as a misadventure that risks harming ordinary Iranians. Many Iranians oppose government policies that include funding, arming and training groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanese armed group that has increasingly traded fire with Israel since the Oct. 7 attacks that set off the current fighting in Gaza. In protests against the government over the past few years a recurring chant has been, 'No to Gaza, no to Lebanon, my life for Iran.' Ali, a 53-year-old veteran of the Iran-Iraq war who lives in Kerman, said the existence of the Islamic Republic depends on 'crisis.' 'Now they are exploiting the war and the crisis to survive,' he said. A woman carries a weapon in Tel Aviv on Sunday after Iran launched drones and missiles toward Israel. Credit... Hannah Mckay/Reuters After many Israelis spent a long night huddled in bomb shelters, life crept back toward calm on Sunday, even as the people of Israel waited tensely to see how their government would respond to the Iranian strikes that set off rarely heard sirens in Jerusalem. Jerusalem is targeted much less frequently than border communities or the coastal metropolis of Tel Aviv, but during the assault loud booms resounded in the skies, where missiles and interceptors wove around one another like fireflies. In areas of Jerusalem with a mostly Jewish population, many crowded into public bomb shelters, some wearing pajamas and lugging sleeping bags. 'There were more people there than usual,' said Zev Palatnik, 33, who spent some of the night in his building's bomb shelter alongside his neighbors. 'There's a sense that the rockets from Iran are more sophisticated than the ones from Gaza,' he said, adding that there was a higher level of anxiety as a result. But on Sunday, a relatively steady amount of foot traffic flowed in downtown Jerusalem as Israelis returned to work. Ron Cohen, a 37-year-old engineer, said he had hoped that the Israeli government would immediately strike back at Iran, but he did not expect a significant Israeli response. 'Not much, maybe a few small things,' he said. 'Our government knows how to defend, but not how to attack.' For the Israelis among the tens of thousands forced to flee communities along the borders with Gaza and Lebanon, the assault compounded six exhausting months of war. Many expressed uncertainty over the best way for the government to respond. Gidi Lapid, who left his home in Metula, near the border with Lebanon, with his family at the beginning of the war, said Israel might be able to show strength through restrained action. But at the same time, Iranians 'should be the ones in existential dread, in bomb shelters, stocking up on food and water,' Mr. Lapid said by phone from Eliav, a small town near Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem.

The attack has unnerved a region already roiling in conflict, raising concerns among diplomats and U.N. officials that a new, potentially wide and destructive war could spark if both sides don't stand down.\nAnt\u00f3nio Guterres, the Secretary General of the U.N., told the Council that it was 'time to step back from the brink,' and that its members, as well as the United Nations at large, had the collective responsibility 'to actively engage all parties concerned to prevent further escalation.'\nThe meeting on Sunday was convened at the request of Israel. The Council has not collectively issued a statement condemning Iran's attack, and it has also not issued a statement condemning Israel's attack on Iran's embassy in Damascus that killed several senior commanders. All 15 members of the Council must reach a consensus for a statement to be issued and none was reached on both issues.\nThe Security Council is one of the few venues where adversaries engaged in conflict come face to face and sit in the same chamber. On Sunday, both Israel and Iran's ambassadors were present and delivered fiery comments about the other's country, blaming each other for actions they both called terrorism.\nGilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador, said Iran's attack had 'crossed every red line' and Israel reserved the right to retaliate. Mr. Erdan called for the Council to take severe action against Iran, including 'crippling' sanctions and statements of condemnation.\n'The fact that Israel's air defense proved to be superior does not change the brutality of Iran's attack,' he said.\nIran's ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, said his country had an 'inherent right to self-defense' after Israel's attack on its diplomatic compound. Mr. Iravani said that Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region,' but that if its interests, people or national security came under attack it would 'respond to any such threat or aggressions vigorously and in accordance with international law.'\nThe United States and Iran both said that they do not seek war with one another, but that if one attacks the other's interests, there would be a defensive response.\nRobert A. Wood, a U.S. representative to the U.N., told the Security Council that the 'U.S. is not seeking escalation, our actions have been defensive in nature,' and said the U.S. goal was to 'de-escalate' and then get back to securing an end to the conflict in Gaza. Mr. Wood said the U.S. planned to bring further action on Iran at the Council and called on the Council to unequivocally condemn Iran's actions.\nAny resolution against Iran put forth by the U.S. at the Council would likely be vetoed by Russia and China, two of Iran's close allies, who sharply criticized Israel for what they said was reckless violation of international law when it attacked Iran's embassy compound.\n'What happened in the night of the 14th of April did not happen in a vacuum,' said Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's ambassador to the U.N.\nChina's ambassador, Dai Bing, called on the Council to 'exercise maximum calm and restraint' and said the implementation of an immediate cease-fire is the 'top priority.'\nIsrael has said that the embassy compound was a legitimate military target because senior commanders from Iran's Quds Forces, the external branch of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, were holding a meeting inside the building.\nApril 14, 2024, 7:11 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 7:11 p.m. ET Michael D.

It has become a sticking point in negotiations between Israel and Hamas.\nIt was not clear why some Palestinians believed that Israel would not block them from returning on Sunday. But they were making the journey on a day when Iran had launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel.\nMore than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its assault there in October, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health. The assault occurred in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people, according to the Israeli authorities.\nOn Sunday morning Jamila Ibrahim, 39, said that she began hearing of some Palestinians who left early and managed to get back to the north. She later spoke with friends who were able to return north. But there were very few.\nAround 10:30 a.m. she and her three children \u2014 who are between 10 and 17 \u2014 set out, joining other people on the journey.\nShe said there were no official notices from the Israel military, which has occupied large parts of Gaza after it launched a ground invasion, that residents would be allowed to return to their homes. It was just based on word of mouth, as well as people seeing others leaving and being encouraged to join the trek home, she said.\n'Some people were scared, they didn't know what fate they were heading to, they didn't know what would happen,' she said. 'Some were happy that they were going to return.'\nMost people were on foot \u2014 carrying what little food they had or their few belongings in bags and luggage \u2014 and some paid large sums of money to go by car, trucks or donkey carts, she said. But they all took the same seaside road, heading north toward an Israeli checkpoint that has cut off southern Gaza from the north.\n'There was lots of tension, lots of tension among the people,' she said. 'They were scared they could be shot.'\nThose who tried to cross north in the middle of the night \u2014 around 4 a.m. \u2014 managed to make it to the north, she said, based on her conversation with friends who crossed successfully.\nBut later that morning, by the time she and other displaced Palestinians tried to follow, Israeli forces opened fire on them, she said.\n'Around 12:30 the Israelis started shooting,' she said.\nMazen Al-Harazeen, a first responder in Gaza, said Israeli forces fired weapons and he did not know how many had been killed, but he said, 'There was shooting and martyrs.'\nEarly Sunday morning, Avichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, or I.D.F., wrote on social media that the rumors that the army was allowing residents to return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip were false.\n'The I.D.F. will not allow the return of residents,' he added. 'For your safety, do not approach the forces operating there.'\nNearly two million Gazans have been displaced by the war between Hamas and Israel, now in its sixth month. One of their biggest concerns is when and if they will be allowed to return to their homes, or whether they will be permanently displaced, as previous generations were.\nAround 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes in 1947 and 1948 during the wars surrounding Israel's establishment as a state.\nBilal Shbair contributed reporting.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:49 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:49 p.m. ET Aaron Boxerman\nAaron Boxerman Reporting from Jerusalem While Israel's war cabinet members didn't issue a formal statement after the meeting, an Israeli official familiar with the discussions indicated that Israel would undoubtedly respond \u2014 although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how.

Credit... Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times The hospital waiting room was quiet on Sunday: There was no crowd of relatives, no flood of patients. Israel's air defenses had just fended off a large-scale Iranian attack, with only one serious casualty recorded.\nBut there was no sense that a crisis had been averted outside the pediatric intensive care unit at Soroka Medical Center in southern Israel's city of Beersheba. Instead, tension filled the air until the doors to the ward swung open and a gasping mother stumbled out, her face contorted. Then raw emotion quickly took its place as she crumbled into a chair, crying.\nWhile Israel suffered little in the way of significant damage overnight, this one family was dealt a devastating blow. Amina al-Hasoni, 7, was clinging to life \u2014 the sole serious casualty of the Iranian barrage. And were it not for systemic inequities in Israel, her relatives said, maybe she too could have been spared.\nThere are roughly 300,000 Arab Bedouins in the Negev desert. About a quarter of them live in villages that are not recognized by Israeli officials. Without state recognition, those communities have long suffered from a lack of planning and basic services like running water, sewers and electricity. And few have access to bomb shelters, despite repeated requests to the state.\nThe Hasoni family lives in one such community, sharing a hilltop in the Negev village of al-Fur'ah with a plot of disconnected houses. When rocket warning sirens went off on Saturday night, Amina's uncle Ismail said he felt stuck \u2014 there was nowhere to go.\nBooms overhead signaled air defenses intercepting missiles before there was a big explosion. Then he heard a woman screaming \u2014 his sister \u2014 and 'I started running,' he said.\nIsmail, 38, found his sister outside her house holding Amina, who was bleeding from the head. Her family had decided to flee the rockets, running out the front door. But Amina, who slept in a back room with pink walls covered in painted butterflies, didn't make it.\nA missile fragment ripped through the home's thin metal roof, shearing a hole with sharp metallic edges. It made impact just in front of the door \u2014 which is where Amina was knocked unconscious.\n'I think it hit her while she was running away,' Ismail said.\nHe said he took the injured Amina from his sister and lifted the girl into his own arms. Ismail then tracked down a car that raced her toward the hospital, more than 40 minutes away on a rutted, winding road that fades out in some places, with camels crossing in others.\nOnly then, with Amina on her way, did he go inside the house, where he said he saw a large, black piece of shrapnel about the size of a pretzel jar. And 'there was blood,' he said, a puddle that had turned into a stream across the tile floor, to the front door.\nBy Sunday afternoon, the orange patterned tiles had been cleaned. None of the dozen or so relatives there could say who had done it, only that 'it was bad for the children to see' all the blood. But Ismail hasn't gone back inside.\n'It's difficult,' he said, his jeans and boots still spattered with blood. Not far from where he sat, a pink Minnie Mouse blanket and a small black-and-white girl's dress hung on a family clothesline.\n'We could have built shelters here,' Ismail added.\nHe dismissed any suggestions that what happened to Amina was bad luck.\n'It's part of a policy,' he said. 'We can't do anything.'\nThe missile fragment that tore into Amina's home was one of more than 150 collected in the area on Sunday by police bomb disposal teams, and the family said officers had taken away the piece that hit their home. The teams combed the desert for hours, searching for debris and carting away huge hunks of twisted metal \u2014 efforts repeated across Israel.\nThe Hasoni home is not far from a military base, Nevatim, that was reportedly a target of the Iranian assault and that Israeli officials said was lightly damaged.\nThat is little consolation to Amina's father, Muhammad, who spent the morning at the hospital taking turns at her bedside. He didn't say much to her, he said, and just repeated her name.\nAmina \u2014 the youngest of his 14 children \u2014 'likes to laugh and have fun all the time,' said Muhammad, 49. She's a good student with a 'strong personality,' he added, who doesn't always listen to instructions. And she loves to draw.\nHe called Iran's actions 'inhumane.'\n'May God demolish them,' he said, without hesitation.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET Iran's ambassador to the U.N., Amir Saeid Iravani, addressed the Council after his Israeli counterpart and defended his country's actions as the 'inherent right to self-defense' in response to the attack on its diplomatic compound in Syria two weeks ago.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET Iravani said Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region' and has 'no intention' of engaging in conflict with the United States, but warned that it would respond proportionately if Israel or the U.S. military were to attack Iran or its interests.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:26 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:26 p.m. ET Israel's U.N. ambassador, Gilad Erdan, who had requested the emergency meeting of the Security Council, assailed Iran and its proxies, saying Iran had crossed every red line in its attack and that Israel reserved the right to retaliate.

Iranian leaders have signaled that their retaliation is over unless they are attacked again.\nThe joint declaration from the leaders of G7 nations \u2014 Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, as well as the European Union \u2014 demanded that 'Iran and its proxies cease their attacks.' The leaders said they were ready 'to take further measures now and in response to further destabilizing initiatives.'\nHoping to head off Israel from further escalating the conflict, President Biden privately advised Israel against firing back on Iran, U.S. officials said on Sunday. It was not yet clear how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his government would respond.\nLeaders of the European Union have publicly urged restraint from both countries as they, too, condemned Iran's actions. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, called the attack 'blatant and unjustifiable,' adding that 'all actors must now refrain from further escalation.'\nCharles Michel, president of the European Council, said that the condemnation from G7 leaders was unanimous and that 'all parties must exercise restraint.'\n'Ending the crisis in Gaza as soon as possible, notably through an immediate cease-fire, will make a difference,' Mr. Michel added.\nDemonstrators gather at Palestine Square in Tehran on Sunday. Credit... Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times Many Iranians stayed glued to their television screens and phones Saturday night, anxiously following updates as their country launched a military attack on Israel and fearing a wider war that would only add to the country's current economic upheaval.\nIn Tehran and several other big cities, lines of cars stretched a mile or more outside gas stations in the middle of the night. Some parents kept their children home from school on Sunday. Tehran's airport closed down, and will remain that way until at least Monday morning.\nIranians living inside the country said in interviews that they were worried the confrontation with Israel would spiral out of control and hoped both sides would avoid escalating the conflict.\nSoheil, a 37-year-old engineer in Isfahan who, like several other Iranians, asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution, said all he and his colleagues could talk about at work on Sunday was the prospect of a broader conflict.\n'I'm afraid of war,' he said. 'It will have a great impact on our daily lives, especially on the economy and the price of dollar, and the anxiety will affect our mental health.'\nSince a strike two weeks ago on the Iranian Embassy complex in Syria that killed three top military commanders, Iran's currency, the rial, has fallen sharply against the U.S. dollar, shrinking purchasing power as Iran's leaders vowed to respond.\nNafiseh, a 36-year-old high school teacher in Tehran, said that many of her students did not attend school on Sunday because parents were worried about counterattacks from Israel. 'It's all everyone is talking about, from teenagers to teachers and family members, it's all about the war and attacks,' she said.\nSupporters of the government hailed the attacks as Iran's showcasing its military might to defend itself on Saturday, with several hundred gathering in Tehran's Palestine Square to celebrate with fireworks and chants of 'Death to Israel.' A large mural on the square depicted Iranian missiles with a message written in Farsi and Hebrew that read, 'Next time the slap will be harder.' On Sunday night, a crowd formed again in the square, carrying signs and chanting anti-Israel slogans.\nOthers took to social media to say they would fight for their country unconditionally if Iran were to go to war.\n'When a foreign enemy is involved, honor means standing with our country even at the cost of our lives,' Reza Rashidpour, a civil engineer, wrote on social media. 'Long live Iran, long live soldiers of Iran.'\nBut critics of the government denounced the attacks, seeing them as a misadventure that risks harming ordinary Iranians.\nMany Iranians oppose government policies that include funding, arming and training groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanese armed group that has increasingly traded fire with Israel since the Oct. 7 attacks that set off the current fighting in Gaza. In protests against the government over the past few years a recurring chant has been, 'No to Gaza, no to Lebanon, my life for Iran.'\nAli, a 53-year-old veteran of the Iran-Iraq war who lives in Kerman, said the existence of the Islamic Republic depends on 'crisis.'\n'Now they are exploiting the war and the crisis to survive,' he said.\nA woman carries a weapon in Tel Aviv on Sunday after Iran launched drones and missiles toward Israel. Credit... Hannah Mckay/Reuters After many Israelis spent a long night huddled in bomb shelters, life crept back toward calm on Sunday, even as the people of Israel waited tensely to see how their government would respond to the Iranian strikes that set off rarely heard sirens in Jerusalem.\nJerusalem is targeted much less frequently than border communities or the coastal metropolis of Tel Aviv, but during the assault loud booms resounded in the skies, where missiles and interceptors wove around one another like fireflies.\nIn areas of Jerusalem with a mostly Jewish population, many crowded into public bomb shelters, some wearing pajamas and lugging sleeping bags.\n'There were more people there than usual,' said Zev Palatnik, 33, who spent some of the night in his building's bomb shelter alongside his neighbors. 'There's a sense that the rockets from Iran are more sophisticated than the ones from Gaza,' he said, adding that there was a higher level of anxiety as a result.\nBut on Sunday, a relatively steady amount of foot traffic flowed in downtown Jerusalem as Israelis returned to work. Ron Cohen, a 37-year-old engineer, said he had hoped that the Israeli government would immediately strike back at Iran, but he did not expect a significant Israeli response.\n'Not much, maybe a few small things,' he said. 'Our government knows how to defend, but not how to attack.'\nFor the Israelis among the tens of thousands forced to flee communities along the borders with Gaza and Lebanon, the assault compounded six exhausting months of war. Many expressed uncertainty over the best way for the government to respond.\nGidi Lapid, who left his home in Metula, near the border with Lebanon, with his family at the beginning of the war, said Israel might be able to show strength through restrained action.\nBut at the same time, Iranians 'should be the ones in existential dread, in bomb shelters, stocking up on food and water,' Mr. Lapid said by phone from Eliav, a small town near Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem. 'Not our peace-seeking nation.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Mike Ives","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/15/multimedia/15mideast-crisis-promo/15mideast-crisis-header-bjlp-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":2.4853706,"_id":"7faf2c2f1050e63d4db4ba39407eadfb"},{"title":"After Iran's Barrage, Israel Questions What Might Be Next for the Gaza War","author":"Adam Rasgon","published_date":"2024-04-15 04:01:34","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/14/world/iran-israel-gaza-war-news/israel-iran-gaza","clean_url":"nytimes.com","excerpt":"Military analysts are divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran might alter the war or affect a decision to invade the southern city of Rafah.","summary":"Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index The United States and other members of the United Nations Security Council urged restraint in the Middle East on Sunday, as officials in Israel debated how to respond to a direct attack by Iran over the weekend that threatened to further destabilize the region. Israel's military, with the help of the United States, Britain and Jordan, shot down nearly all of the drones and missiles that Iran fired on Saturday, in what was believed to be the first direct Iranian attack on Israel after years of a shadow war. Life largely returned to normal in Israel on Sunday, and there were indications that the military would not seek to immediately retaliate against Iran, even as tensions remained high in the region. Iranian officials also appeared to signal that its operation against Israel was over. Israel's war cabinet concluded a meeting on Sunday evening without deciding how to respond to Iran's assault, according to an official briefed on the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks more freely. By nightfall, the military had yet to detail possible options, the official said.\nIn public, Israeli ministers appeared divided over how to respond. Benny Gantz, a centrist minister and one of three voting members of the war cabinet, said that Israel should exact a price from Iran, but only 'in a way and at a time that suits us.' Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right minister, then criticized Mr. Gantz for his perceived moderation, arguing that Israel should deter Iran by going 'crazy.'\nThe Biden administration is advising Israel that it does not necessarily need to fire back at Iran, with U.S. officials saying that Israel had proved its ability to protect itself.\nIranian officials issued a series of statements that appeared designed to keep tensions from escalating further.

Israeli military analysts are divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza. Credit...Within moments of Israel and its allies shooting down a fusillade of Iranian missiles and drones this weekend, many began wondering what the latest exchange between Israel and Iran would mean for the war in the Gaza Strip. The Iranian attack was retaliation for what was widely believed to be an Israeli strike this month on an embassy building in Damascus that killed seven Iranian officials, including three top commanders in Iran's armed forces. But it occurred against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel is battling Hamas, a militant group funded and armed by Iran. Israeli military analysts were divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza, now in its sixth month. The next fulcrum in that war could hinge on whether Israel decides to pursue Hamas in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have fled amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis. Some analysts argued that the implications for Gaza would depend on whether Israel responded with a major counterattack against Iran. Others contended that Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip would be unaffected. Shlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general and a former director of the Israeli military's strategic planning division, said that if Israel responds with substantial force to the Iranian attack, it could spark a multifront war that would compel the Israeli leadership to move its attention away from Gaza. In the case of a significant regional conflagration, General Brom said, Israel might choose to delay its plans to invade Rafah, which Israeli officials describe as the last Hamas stronghold. 'It's not comfortable for us to have simultaneous, high-intensity wars in multiple theaters,' General Brom added. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to send ground forces into Rafah, despite international pressure to back off the operation. On Sunday, an Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that the Iranian attack would have no effect on the military's plan to invade Rafah. A large-scale direct confrontation with Iran could potentially bring the war in Gaza to a close, General Brom said. But for the war to end in such a way, it would require a broader cease-fire that encompassed several parties, including Israel, Iran and the Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. 'There's an idea that in order to resolve a crisis, the situation first needs to become worse,' he said, explaining that an escalation followed by a comprehensive cease-fire with Iran might incline that country to push its regional proxies to stop fighting with Israel. While the members of Israel's war cabinet did not issue a formal statement after meeting on Sunday, a separate Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, indicated that the country would respond to the Iranian assault \u2014 although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how. Other military experts, however, dismissed the link between the Iranian attack and the war in Gaza. 'There's no connection at all,' said Amos Gilead, a retired major general who served in Israeli military intelligence. General Gilead said that Israel's army had enough resources to fight against Iran and continue to wage war against Hamas in Gaza. Others analysts made a similar point, arguing that the resources needed to fight Iran were different from those needed in Gaza. Israel needs fighter jets and air defense systems to counter Iran, they said. In contrast, they added, the army mainly requires ground troops, drones, and attack helicopters to fight Hamas in Gaza. 'There's no real tension between these two things,' said Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former head of Israel's National Security Council. Still, General Eiland said that the success of the coalition that repelled the Iranian attack, which included the United States, Britain and Jordan, could inspire Israel to take advantage of the momentum to overcome its declining status internationally by ending the war in Gaza. Though the United States, Israel's closest ally, has broadly supported Israel's decision to go to war in Gaza, it has increasingly signaled its displeasure over the mounting death toll and warned against a major ground assault in Rafah. The support the United States provided Israel on Sunday in shooting down Iranian drones and missiles could give it more leverage over its Israeli counterparts. While General Eiland said such an outcome could help Israel develop good will in the international community and contribute to reaching a solution to end the war in Gaza and skirmishes with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, he was doubtful that Mr. Netanyahu would purse such a path. 'He says he wants to achieve \u2018total victory' in Gaza and conquer Rafah, a process that could last two or three months,' he said, referring to the prime minister. 'It's clear Netanyahu has a different mind-set and priorities.' Aaron Boxerman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

Yuki Iwamura/Associated Press The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, with diplomats urging restraint by all parties to prevent conflict in the region from escalating. The brazen attack this weekend, when Iran launched a barrage of drones and missiles in retaliation for Israel's attacking its embassy compound in Syria earlier in the month, was the first time Iran had launched open attacks against Israel from its soil. The attack has unnerved a region already roiling in conflict, raising concerns among diplomats and U.N. officials that a new, potentially wide and destructive war could spark if both sides don't stand down. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the Secretary General of the U.N., told the Council that it was 'time to step back from the brink,' and that its members, as well as the United Nations at large, had the collective responsibility 'to actively engage all parties concerned to prevent further escalation.' The meeting on Sunday was convened at the request of Israel. The Council has not collectively issued a statement condemning Iran's attack, and it has also not issued a statement condemning Israel's attack on Iran's embassy in Damascus that killed several senior commanders. All 15 members of the Council must reach a consensus for a statement to be issued and none was reached on both issues. The Security Council is one of the few venues where adversaries engaged in conflict come face to face and sit in the same chamber. On Sunday, both Israel and Iran's ambassadors were present and delivered fiery comments about the other's country, blaming each other for actions they both called terrorism. Gilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador, said Iran's attack had 'crossed every red line' and Israel reserved the right to retaliate. Mr. Erdan called for the Council to take severe action against Iran, including 'crippling' sanctions and statements of condemnation.

Mr. Iravani said that Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region,' but that if its interests, people or national security came under attack it would 'respond to any such threat or aggressions vigorously and in accordance with international law.' The United States and Iran both said that they do not seek war with one another, but that if one attacks the other's interests, there would be a defensive response. Robert A. Wood, a U.S. representative to the U.N., told the Security Council that the 'U.S. is not seeking escalation, our actions have been defensive in nature,' and said the U.S. goal was to 'de-escalate' and then get back to securing an end to the conflict in Gaza. Mr. Wood said the U.S. planned to bring further action on Iran at the Council and called on the Council to unequivocally condemn Iran's actions. Any resolution against Iran put forth by the U.S. at the Council would likely be vetoed by Russia and China, two of Iran's close allies, who sharply criticized Israel for what they said was reckless violation of international law when it attacked Iran's embassy compound. 'What happened in the night of the 14th of April did not happen in a vacuum,' said Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's ambassador to the U.N. China's ambassador, Dai Bing, called on the Council to 'exercise maximum calm and restraint' and said the implementation of an immediate cease-fire is the 'top priority.' Israel has said that the embassy compound was a legitimate military target because senior commanders from Iran's Quds Forces, the external branch of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, were holding a meeting inside the building.

For months, the Israeli military has barred Palestinians who have been displaced by the war in Gaza from returning to their homes in northern Gaza. It has become a sticking point in negotiations between Israel and Hamas. It was not clear why some Palestinians believed that Israel would not block them from returning on Sunday. But they were making the journey on a day when Iran had launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel. More than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its assault there in October, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health. The assault occurred in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people. On Sunday morning Jamila Ibrahim, 39, said that she began hearing of some Palestinians who left early and managed to get back to the north. She later spoke with friends who were able to return north. But there were very few. Around 10:30 a.m. she and her three children \u2014 who are between 10 and 17 \u2014 set out, joining other people on the journey. She said there were no official notices from the Israel military, which has occupied large parts of Gaza after it launched a ground invasion, that residents would be allowed to return to their homes. It was just based on word of mouth, as well as people seeing others leaving and being encouraged to join the trek home, she said. 'Some people were scared, they didn't know what fate they were heading to, they didn't know what would happen,' she said. 'Some were happy that they were going to return.' Most people were on foot \u2014 carrying what little food they had or their few belongings in bags and luggage \u2014 and some paid large sums of money to go by car, trucks or donkey carts, she said. But they all took the same seaside road, heading north toward an Israeli checkpoint that has cut off southern Gaza from the north. 'There was lots of tension, lots of tension among the people, they were scared they could be shot,' she said. Those who tried to cross north in the middle of the night \u2014 around 4 a.m. \u2014 managed to make it to the north, she said, based on her conversation with friends who crossed successfully. But later that morning, by the time she and other displaced Palestinians tried to follow, Israeli forces opened fire on them, she said. 'Around 12:30 the Israelis started shooting,' she said. Mazen Al-Harazeen, a first responder in Gaza, said Israeli forces fired weapons and he did not know how many had been killed, but he said, 'There was shooting and martyrs.' Early Sunday morning, Avichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces, or I.D.F., wrote on social media that the rumors that the army was allowing residents to return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip were false. 'The I.D.F. will not allow the return of residents,' he added. 'For your safety, do not approach the forces operating there.' Nearly 2 million Gazans have been displaced by the war between Hamas and Israel, now in its sixth month. One of their biggest concerns is when and if they will be allowed to return to their homes, or whether they will be permanently displaced, as previous generations were. Around 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes in 1947 and 1948 during the wars surrounding Israel's establishment as a state. Bilal Shbair contributed reporting.

At Amina al-Hasoni's house in the village of al-Fur'ah, Israel, the Iranian attack wounded her and ripped holes in the roof and floor. Credit... Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times The hospital waiting room was quiet on Sunday: There was no crowd of relatives, no flood of patients. Israel's air defenses had just fended off a large-scale Iranian attack, with only one serious casualty recorded. But there was no sense that a crisis had been averted outside the pediatric intensive care unit at Soroka Medical Center in southern Israel's city of Beersheba. Instead, tension filled the air until the doors to the ward swung open and a gasping mother stumbled out, her face contorted. Then raw emotion quickly took its place as she crumbled into a chair, crying. While Israel suffered little in the way of significant damage overnight, this one family was dealt a devastating blow. Amina al-Hasoni, 7, was clinging to life \u2014 the sole serious casualty of the Iranian barrage. And were it not for systemic inequities in Israel, her relatives said, maybe she too could have been spared. There are roughly 300,000 Arab Bedouins in the Negev desert. About a quarter of them live in villages that are not recognized by Israeli officials. Without state recognition, those communities have long suffered from a lack of planning and basic services like running water, sewers and electricity. And few have access to bomb shelters, despite repeated requests to the state. The Hasoni family lives in one such community, sharing a hilltop in the Negev village of al-Fur'ah with a plot of disconnected houses. When rocket warning sirens went off on Saturday night, Amina's uncle Ismail said he felt stuck \u2014 there was nowhere to go. Booms overhead signaled air defenses intercepting missiles before there was a big explosion. Then he heard a woman screaming \u2014 his sister \u2014 and 'I started running,' he said. Ismail, 38, found his sister outside her house holding Amina, who was bleeding from the head. Her family had decided to flee the rockets, running out the front door. But Amina, who slept in a back room with pink walls covered in painted butterflies, didn't make it. A missile fragment ripped through the home's thin metal roof, shearing a hole with sharp metallic edges. It made impact just in front of the door \u2014 which is where Amina was knocked unconscious. 'I think it hit her while she was running away,' Ismail said. He said he took the injured Amina from his sister and lifted the girl into his own arms. Ismail then tracked down a car that raced her toward the hospital, more than 40 minutes away on a rutted, winding road that fades out in some places, with camels crossing in others. Only then, with Amina on her way, did he go inside the house, where he said he saw a large, black piece of shrapnel about the size of a pretzel jar. And 'there was blood,' he said, a puddle that had turned into a stream across the tile floor, to the front door. By Sunday afternoon, the orange patterned tiles had been cleaned. None of the dozen or so relatives there could say who had done it, only that 'it was bad for the children to see' all the blood. But Ismail hasn't gone back inside. 'It's difficult,' he said, his jeans and boots still spattered with blood. Not far from where he sat, a pink Minnie Mouse blanket and a small black-and-white girl's dress hung on a family clothesline. 'We could have built shelters here,' Ismail added. He dismissed any suggestions that what happened to Amina was bad luck. 'It's part of a policy,' he said. 'We can't do anything.' The missile fragment that tore into Amina's home was one of more than 150 collected in the area on Sunday by police bomb disposal teams, and the family said officers had taken away the piece that hit their home. The teams combed the desert for hours, searching for debris and carting away huge hunks of twisted metal \u2014 efforts repeated across Israel. The Hasoni home is not far from a military base, Nevatim, that was reportedly a target of the Iranian assault and that Israeli officials said was lightly damaged. That is little consolation to Amina's father, Muhammad, who spent the morning at the hospital taking turns at her bedside. He didn't say much to her, he said, and just repeated her name. Amina \u2014 the youngest of his 14 children \u2014 'likes to laugh and have fun all the time,' said Muhammad, 49. She's a good student with a 'strong personality,' he added, who doesn't always listen to instructions. And she loves to draw. He called Iran's actions 'inhumane.' 'May God demolish them,' he said, without hesitation.

Tomer Neuberg/Associated Press After convening a virtual meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, Group of 7 leaders adopted a joint declaration that reaffirmed their 'full solidarity and support to Israel' and accused Iran of having risked 'provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation' that must be avoided. Iran's attack, which appeared to have been mostly intercepted by Israel and its allies, was carried out in retaliation for Israeli attacks on an Iranian Embassy building in Syria earlier this month. Iranian leaders have signaled that their retaliation is over unless they are attacked again. The joint declaration from the leaders of G7 nations \u2014 Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, as well as the European Union \u2014 demanded that 'Iran and its proxies cease their attacks.' The leaders said they were ready 'to take further measures now and in response to further destabilizing initiatives.' Hoping to head off Israel from further escalating the conflict, President Biden privately advised Israel against firing back on Iran, U.S. officials said on Sunday. It was not yet clear how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his government would respond. Leaders of the European Union have publicly urged restraint from both countries as they, too, condemned Iran's actions. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, called the attack 'blatant and unjustifiable,' adding that 'all actors must now refrain from further escalation.' Charles Michel, president of the European Council, said that the condemnation from G7 leaders was unanimous and that 'all parties must exercise restraint.' 'Ending the crisis in Gaza as soon as possible, notably through an immediate cease-fire, will make a difference,' Mr. Michel added.

It was not immediately clear what the group had decided about possibly responding to Iran's overnight strikes. Demonstrators gather at Palestine Square in Tehran on Sunday. Credit... Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times Many Iranians stayed glued to their television screens and phones Saturday night, anxiously following updates as their country launched a military attack on Israel and fearing a wider war that would only add to the country's current economic upheaval. In Tehran and several other big cities, lines of cars stretched a mile or more outside gas stations in the middle of the night. Some parents kept their children home from school on Sunday. Tehran's airport closed down, and will remain that way until at least Monday morning. Iranians living inside the country said in interviews that they were worried the confrontation with Israel would spiral out of control and hoped both sides would avoid escalating the conflict. Soheil, a 37-year-old engineer in Isfahan who, like several other Iranians, asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution, said all he and his colleagues could talk about at work on Sunday was the prospect of a broader conflict. 'I'm afraid of war,' he said. 'It will have a great impact on our daily lives, especially on the economy and the price of dollar, and the anxiety will affect our mental health.' Since a strike two weeks ago on the Iranian Embassy complex in Syria that killed three top military commanders, Iran's currency, the rial, has fallen sharply against the U.S. dollar, shrinking purchasing power as Iran's leaders vowed to respond. Nafiseh, a 36-year-old high school teacher in Tehran, said that many of her students did not attend school on Sunday because parents were worried about counterattacks from Israel. 'It's all everyone is talking about, from teenagers to teachers and family members, it's all about the war and attacks,' she said. Supporters of the government hailed the attacks as Iran's showcasing its military might to defend itself on Saturday, with several hundred gathering in Tehran's Palestine Square to celebrate with fireworks and chants of 'Death to Israel.' A large mural on the square depicted Iranian missiles with a message written in Farsi and Hebrew that read, 'Next time the slap will be harder.' On Sunday night, a crowd formed again in the square, carrying signs and chanting anti-Israel slogans. Others took to social media to say they would fight for their country unconditionally if Iran were to go to war. 'When a foreign enemy is involved, honor means standing with our country even at the cost of our lives,' Reza Rashidpour, a civil engineer, wrote on social media. 'Long live Iran, long live soldiers of Iran.' But critics of the government denounced the attacks, seeing them as a misadventure that risks harming ordinary Iranians. Many Iranians oppose government policies that include funding, arming and training groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanese armed group that has increasingly traded fire with Israel since the Oct. 7 attacks that set off the current fighting in Gaza. In protests against the government over the past few years a recurring chant has been, 'No to Gaza, no to Lebanon, my life for Iran.' Ali, a 53-year-old veteran of the Iran-Iraq war who lives in Kerman, said the existence of the Islamic Republic depends on 'crisis.' 'Now they are exploiting the war and the crisis to survive,' he said.

'Now is the time to defuse and deescalate. Now is the time for maximum restraint.' April 14, 2024, 4:36 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 4:36 p.m. ET For the Security Council to issue any statement condemning Iran's actions all of its 15 members would have to agree \u2014 a prospect that appears unlikely, given its recent lack of consensus over issuing condemnation statements on Hamas's Oct. 7 attacks and the attack on the Iranian Embassy compound in Syria, which prompted Iran's strikes.

Hannah Mckay/Reuters After many Israelis spent a long night huddled in bomb shelters, life crept back toward calm on Sunday, even as the people of Israel waited tensely to see how their government would respond to the Iranian strikes that set off rarely heard sirens in Jerusalem. Jerusalem is targeted much less frequently than border communities or the coastal metropolis of Tel Aviv, but during the assault loud booms resounded in the skies, where missiles and interceptors wove around one another like fireflies. In areas of Jerusalem with a mostly Jewish population, many crowded into public bomb shelters, some wearing pajamas and lugging sleeping bags. 'There were more people there than usual,' said Zev Palatnik, 33, who spent some of the night in his building's bomb shelter alongside his neighbors. 'There's a sense that the rockets from Iran are more sophisticated than the ones from Gaza,' he said, adding that there was a higher level of anxiety as a result. But on Sunday, a relatively steady amount of foot traffic flowed in downtown Jerusalem as Israelis returned to work. Ron Cohen, a 37-year-old engineer, said he had hoped that the Israeli government would immediately strike back at Iran, but he did not expect a significant Israeli response. 'Not much, maybe a few small things,' he said. 'Our government knows how to defend, but not how to attack.' For the Israelis among the tens of thousands forced to flee communities along the borders with Gaza and Lebanon, the assault compounded six exhausting months of war. Many expressed uncertainty over the best way for the government to respond. Gidi Lapid, who left his home in Metula, near the border with Lebanon, with his family at the beginning of the war, said Israel might be able to show strength through restrained action. But at the same time, Iranians 'should be the ones in existential dread, in bomb shelters, stocking up on food and water,' Mr. Lapid said by phone from Eliav, a small town near Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem. 'Not our peace-seeking nation.'

Although Hezbollah, Iran's most powerful regional proxy, launched rockets into the Golan Heights amid the overnight attack, it largely remained on the sidelines. April 14, 2024, 2:48 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 2:48 p.m. ET Adam Sella Reporting from Tel Aviv With much attention shifted to Iran, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an Israeli grass-roots citizens' group, reiterated its call for a deal to release the approximately 100 hostages held in Gaza. The group said in a statement that the fear and uncertainty felt by Israelis during Iran's overnight strike 'pale in comparison to the terror, dread, despair, loneliness, cold, physical and mental torment' experienced by the hostages. April 14, 2024, 2:32 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 2:32 p.m. ET Eric Schmitt Reporting from Washington American officials said U.S. fighter jets shot down more than 70 exploding drones in the attack Saturday, while two Navy warships in the eastern Mediterranean destroyed between four and six ballistic missiles and an Army Patriot battery in Iraq knocked down at least one missile that passed overhead. The more than 300 drones and missiles Iran launched was on the high end of what U.S. analysts had expected, one official said.

'We're going to try again this week,' Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday about voting on a bill to aid Israel. Credit... Kenny Holston/The New York Times Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday after Iran's overnight attack on Israel that the House would vote in the coming days on aid for Israel, and he suggested that aid for Ukraine could be included in the legislation. 'House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing with Israel,' Mr. Johnson said on Fox News, noting that he had previously advanced two aid bills to help the U.S. ally. 'We're going to try again this week, and the details of that package are being put together. Right now, we're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues.' U.S. funding for both Israel and Ukraine has languished in Congress; Mr. Johnson initially refused to take up a $95 billion aid package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan passed by the Senate, and the Senate refused to take up a House Republican proposal that conditioned aid to Israel on domestic spending cuts. In recent weeks, Mr. Johnson has repeatedly vowed to ensure that the House moves to assist Ukraine. He has been searching for a way to structure a foreign aid package that could secure a critical mass of support amid stiff Republican resistance to sending aid to Kyiv and mounting opposition among Democrats to unfettered military aid for Israel. But the attacks from Iran have ratcheted up the pressure on Mr. Johnson to bring some kind of package to the floor this week, potentially forcing him to make a decision he has been agonizing over for weeks. He left it unclear on Sunday whether the legislation he said the House would advance this week would also include aid for Ukraine. Mr. Johnson said he believed that some proposals around Ukraine aid enjoyed broad support among House Republicans. He noted that he met with former President Donald J. Trump on Friday at his estate in Florida and that Mr. Trump had been supportive of conditioning the aid as a loan. 'I think these are ideas that I think can get consensus, and that's what we've been working through,' Mr. Johnson said. 'We'll send our package. We'll put something together and send it to the Senate and get these obligations completed.' Before the attacks in Israel over the weekend, Mr. Johnson had privately floated bringing up the $95 billion spending package for Ukraine and Israel passed by the Senate in February \u2014 and moving it through the House in tandem with a second bill containing policies endorsed by the conservative wing of his party. That plan envisioned two consecutive votes \u2014 one on the Senate-passed bill and another on a package of sweeteners geared toward appeasing Republicans who otherwise would be infuriated by Mr. Johnson's decision to push through a bipartisan aid package for Ukraine. Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Sunday that the two conflicts were tied together, and that he hoped they would be addressed together. 'What happened in Israel last night happens in Ukraine every night,' he said on CBS's 'Face The Nation.' Mr. McCaul said that he had previously secured a 'commitment' from Mr. Johnson that a broad national security bill would be brought to the House floor for a vote, but that the timing was unclear. 'My preference,' he said, 'is this week.' Minho Kim contributed reporting.

Credit...Within moments of Israel and its allies shooting down a fusillade of Iranian missiles and drones this weekend, many began wondering what the latest exchange between Israel and Iran would mean for the war in the Gaza Strip.\nThe Iranian attack was retaliation for what was widely believed to be an Israeli strike this month on an embassy building in Damascus that killed seven Iranian officials, including three top commanders in Iran's armed forces. But it occurred against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel is battling Hamas, a militant group funded and armed by Iran.\nIsraeli military analysts were divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza, now in its sixth month. The next fulcrum in that war could hinge on whether Israel decides to pursue Hamas in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have fled amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis.\nSome analysts argued that the implications for Gaza would depend on whether Israel responded with a major counterattack against Iran. Others contended that Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip would be unaffected.\nShlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general and a former director of the Israeli military's strategic planning division, said that if Israel responds with substantial force to the Iranian attack, it could spark a multifront war that would compel the Israeli leadership to move its attention away from Gaza.\nIn the case of a significant regional conflagration, General Brom said, Israel might choose to delay its plans to invade Rafah, which Israeli officials describe as the last Hamas stronghold.\n'It's not comfortable for us to have simultaneous, high-intensity wars in multiple theaters,' General Brom added.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to send ground forces into Rafah, despite international pressure to back off the operation. On Sunday, an Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that the Iranian attack would have no effect on the military's plan to invade Rafah.\nA large-scale direct confrontation with Iran could potentially bring the war in Gaza to a close, General Brom said. But for the war to end in such a way, it would require a broader cease-fire that encompassed several parties, including Israel, Iran and the Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah.\n'There's an idea that in order to resolve a crisis, the situation first needs to become worse,' he said, explaining that an escalation followed by a comprehensive cease-fire with Iran might incline that country to push its regional proxies to stop fighting with Israel.\nWhile the members of Israel's war cabinet did not issue a formal statement after meeting on Sunday, a separate Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, indicated that the country would respond to the Iranian assault \u2014 although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how.\nOther military experts, however, dismissed the link between the Iranian attack and the war in Gaza.\n'There's no connection at all,' said Amos Gilead, a retired major general who served in Israeli military intelligence.\nGeneral Gilead said that Israel's army had enough resources to fight against Iran and continue to wage war against Hamas in Gaza.\nOthers analysts made a similar point, arguing that the resources needed to fight Iran were different from those needed in Gaza. Israel needs fighter jets and air defense systems to counter Iran, they said. In contrast, they added, the army mainly requires ground troops, drones, and attack helicopters to fight Hamas in Gaza.\n'There's no real tension between these two things,' said Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former head of Israel's National Security Council.\nStill, General Eiland said that the success of the coalition that repelled the Iranian attack, which included the United States, Britain and Jordan, could inspire Israel to take advantage of the momentum to overcome its declining status internationally by ending the war in Gaza.\nThough the United States, Israel's closest ally, has broadly supported Israel's decision to go to war in Gaza, it has increasingly signaled its displeasure over the mounting death toll and warned against a major ground assault in Rafah. The support the United States provided Israel on Sunday in shooting down Iranian drones and missiles could give it more leverage over its Israeli counterparts.\nWhile General Eiland said such an outcome could help Israel develop good will in the international community and contribute to reaching a solution to end the war in Gaza and skirmishes with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, he was doubtful that Mr. Netanyahu would purse such a path.\n'He says he wants to achieve \u2018total victory' in Gaza and conquer Rafah, a process that could last two or three months,' he said, referring to the prime minister. 'It's clear Netanyahu has a different mind-set and priorities.'\nAaron Boxerman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.\nWhere air defense systems were seen intercepting missiles or drones Damage or other evidence of attack visible\nWhere air defense systems were seen intercepting missiles or drones Damage or other evidence of attack visible United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addresses the United Nations Security Council during an emergency meeting at U.N. headquarters on Sunday. Credit... Yuki Iwamura/Associated Press The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, with diplomats urging restraint by all parties to prevent conflict in the region from escalating.\nThe brazen attack this weekend, when Iran launched a barrage of drones and missiles in retaliation for Israel's attacking its embassy compound in Syria earlier in the month, was the first time Iran had launched open attacks against Israel from its soil. The attack has unnerved a region already roiling in conflict, raising concerns among diplomats and U.N. officials that a new, potentially wide and destructive war could spark if both sides don't stand down.\nAnt\u00f3nio Guterres, the Secretary General of the U.N., told the Council that it was 'time to step back from the brink,' and that its members, as well as the United Nations at large, had the collective responsibility 'to actively engage all parties concerned to prevent further escalation.'\nThe meeting on Sunday was convened at the request of Israel. The Council has not collectively issued a statement condemning Iran's attack, and it has also not issued a statement condemning Israel's attack on Iran's embassy in Damascus that killed several senior commanders. All 15 members of the Council must reach a consensus for a statement to be issued and none was reached on both issues.\nThe Security Council is one of the few venues where adversaries engaged in conflict come face to face and sit in the same chamber. On Sunday, both Israel and Iran's ambassadors were present and delivered fiery comments about the other's country, blaming each other for actions they both called terrorism.\nGilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador, said Iran's attack had 'crossed every red line' and Israel reserved the right to retaliate. Mr. Erdan called for the Council to take severe action against Iran, including 'crippling' sanctions and statements of condemnation.\n'The fact that Israel's air defense proved to be superior does not change the brutality of Iran's attack,' he said.\nIran's ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, said his country had an 'inherent right to self-defense' after Israel's attack on its diplomatic compound. Mr. Iravani said that Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region,' but that if its interests, people or national security came under attack it would 'respond to any such threat or aggressions vigorously and in accordance with international law.'\nThe United States and Iran both said that they do not seek war with one another, but that if one attacks the other's interests, there would be a defensive response.\nRobert A. Wood, a U.S. representative to the U.N., told the Security Council that the 'U.S. is not seeking escalation, our actions have been defensive in nature,' and said the U.S. goal was to 'de-escalate' and then get back to securing an end to the conflict in Gaza. Mr. Wood said the U.S. planned to bring further action on Iran at the Council and called on the Council to unequivocally condemn Iran's actions.\nAny resolution against Iran put forth by the U.S. at the Council would likely be vetoed by Russia and China, two of Iran's close allies, who sharply criticized Israel for what they said was reckless violation of international law when it attacked Iran's embassy compound.\n'What happened in the night of the 14th of April did not happen in a vacuum,' said Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's ambassador to the U.N.\nChina's ambassador, Dai Bing, called on the Council to 'exercise maximum calm and restraint' and said the implementation of an immediate cease-fire is the 'top priority.'\nIsrael has said that the embassy compound was a legitimate military target because senior commanders from Iran's Quds Forces, the external branch of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, were holding a meeting inside the building.\nApril 14, 2024, 7:11 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 7:11 p.m. ET Michael D.

Credit... Ramadan Abed/Reuters As thousands of displaced Palestinians attempted to return to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday, Israeli troops fired at the crowd, forcing people to turn back in panic, according to an emergency worker and two people who tried to make the journey.\nWafa, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency, reported that five people were killed and 23 wounded by Israeli gunfire and artillery in the incident on Al-Rashid Street south of Gaza City as a crowd of Gazans headed north to their homes.\nThe circumstances of the deaths could not be confirmed independently, and the Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions about whether its forces opened fire on Palestinian civilians trying to cross to northern Gaza.\nFor months, the Israeli military has barred Palestinians who have been displaced by the war in Gaza from returning to their homes in northern Gaza. It has become a sticking point in negotiations between Israel and Hamas.\nIt was not clear why some Palestinians believed that Israel would not block them from returning on Sunday. But they were making the journey on a day when Iran had launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel.\nMore than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its assault there in October, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health. The assault occurred in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people.\nOn Sunday morning Jamila Ibrahim, 39, said that she began hearing of some Palestinians who left early and managed to get back to the north. She later spoke with friends who were able to return north. But there were very few.\nAround 10:30 a.m. she and her three children \u2014 who are between 10 and 17 \u2014 set out, joining other people on the journey.\nShe said there were no official notices from the Israel military, which has occupied large parts of Gaza after it launched a ground invasion, that residents would be allowed to return to their homes. It was just based on word of mouth, as well as people seeing others leaving and being encouraged to join the trek home, she said.\n'Some people were scared, they didn't know what fate they were heading to, they didn't know what would happen,' she said. 'Some were happy that they were going to return.'\nMost people were on foot \u2014 carrying what little food they had or their few belongings in bags and luggage \u2014 and some paid large sums of money to go by car, trucks or donkey carts, she said. But they all took the same seaside road, heading north toward an Israeli checkpoint that has cut off southern Gaza from the north.\n'There was lots of tension, lots of tension among the people, they were scared they could be shot,' she said.\nThose who tried to cross north in the middle of the night \u2014 around 4 a.m. \u2014 managed to make it to the north, she said, based on her conversation with friends who crossed successfully.\nBut later that morning, by the time she and other displaced Palestinians tried to follow, Israeli forces opened fire on them, she said.\n'Around 12:30 the Israelis started shooting,' she said.\nMazen Al-Harazeen, a first responder in Gaza, said Israeli forces fired weapons and he did not know how many had been killed, but he said, 'There was shooting and martyrs.'\nEarly Sunday morning, Avichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces, or I.D.F., wrote on social media that the rumors that the army was allowing residents to return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip were false.\n'The I.D.F. will not allow the return of residents,' he added. 'For your safety, do not approach the forces operating there.'\nNearly 2 million Gazans have been displaced by the war between Hamas and Israel, now in its sixth month. One of their biggest concerns is when and if they will be allowed to return to their homes, or whether they will be permanently displaced, as previous generations were.\nAround 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes in 1947 and 1948 during the wars surrounding Israel's establishment as a state.\nBilal Shbair contributed reporting.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:49 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:49 p.m. ET Aaron Boxerman\nAaron Boxerman Reporting from Jerusalem While Israel's war cabinet members didn't issue a formal statement after the meeting, an Israeli official familiar with the discussions indicated that Israel would undoubtedly respond \u2014 although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how.

Credit... Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times The hospital waiting room was quiet on Sunday: There was no crowd of relatives, no flood of patients. Israel's air defenses had just fended off a large-scale Iranian attack, with only one serious casualty recorded.\nBut there was no sense that a crisis had been averted outside the pediatric intensive care unit at Soroka Medical Center in southern Israel's city of Beersheba. Instead, tension filled the air until the doors to the ward swung open and a gasping mother stumbled out, her face contorted. Then raw emotion quickly took its place as she crumbled into a chair, crying.\nWhile Israel suffered little in the way of significant damage overnight, this one family was dealt a devastating blow. Amina al-Hasoni, 7, was clinging to life \u2014 the sole serious casualty of the Iranian barrage. And were it not for systemic inequities in Israel, her relatives said, maybe she too could have been spared.\nThere are roughly 300,000 Arab Bedouins in the Negev desert. About a quarter of them live in villages that are not recognized by Israeli officials. Without state recognition, those communities have long suffered from a lack of planning and basic services like running water, sewers and electricity. And few have access to bomb shelters, despite repeated requests to the state.\nThe Hasoni family lives in one such community, sharing a hilltop in the Negev village of al-Fur'ah with a plot of disconnected houses. When rocket warning sirens went off on Saturday night, Amina's uncle Ismail said he felt stuck \u2014 there was nowhere to go.\nBooms overhead signaled air defenses intercepting missiles before there was a big explosion. Then he heard a woman screaming \u2014 his sister \u2014 and 'I started running,' he said.\nIsmail, 38, found his sister outside her house holding Amina, who was bleeding from the head. Her family had decided to flee the rockets, running out the front door. But Amina, who slept in a back room with pink walls covered in painted butterflies, didn't make it.\nA missile fragment ripped through the home's thin metal roof, shearing a hole with sharp metallic edges. It made impact just in front of the door \u2014 which is where Amina was knocked unconscious.\n'I think it hit her while she was running away,' Ismail said.\nHe said he took the injured Amina from his sister and lifted the girl into his own arms. Ismail then tracked down a car that raced her toward the hospital, more than 40 minutes away on a rutted, winding road that fades out in some places, with camels crossing in others.\nOnly then, with Amina on her way, did he go inside the house, where he said he saw a large, black piece of shrapnel about the size of a pretzel jar. And 'there was blood,' he said, a puddle that had turned into a stream across the tile floor, to the front door.\nBy Sunday afternoon, the orange patterned tiles had been cleaned. None of the dozen or so relatives there could say who had done it, only that 'it was bad for the children to see' all the blood. But Ismail hasn't gone back inside.\n'It's difficult,' he said, his jeans and boots still spattered with blood. Not far from where he sat, a pink Minnie Mouse blanket and a small black-and-white girl's dress hung on a family clothesline.\n'We could have built shelters here,' Ismail added.\nHe dismissed any suggestions that what happened to Amina was bad luck.\n'It's part of a policy,' he said. 'We can't do anything.'\nThe missile fragment that tore into Amina's home was one of more than 150 collected in the area on Sunday by police bomb disposal teams, and the family said officers had taken away the piece that hit their home. The teams combed the desert for hours, searching for debris and carting away huge hunks of twisted metal \u2014 efforts repeated across Israel.\nThe Hasoni home is not far from a military base, Nevatim, that was reportedly a target of the Iranian assault and that Israeli officials said was lightly damaged.\nThat is little consolation to Amina's father, Muhammad, who spent the morning at the hospital taking turns at her bedside. He didn't say much to her, he said, and just repeated her name.\nAmina \u2014 the youngest of his 14 children \u2014 'likes to laugh and have fun all the time,' said Muhammad, 49. She's a good student with a 'strong personality,' he added, who doesn't always listen to instructions. And she loves to draw.\nHe called Iran's actions 'inhumane.'\n'May God demolish them,' he said, without hesitation.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET Iran's ambassador to the U.N., Amir Saeid Iravani, addressed the Council after his Israeli counterpart and defended his country's actions as the 'inherent right to self-defense' in response to the attack on its diplomatic compound in Syria two weeks ago.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET Iravani said Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region' and has 'no intention' of engaging in conflict with the United States, but warned that it would respond proportionately if Israel or the U.S. military were to attack Iran or its interests.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:26 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:26 p.m. ET Israel's U.N. ambassador, Gilad Erdan, who had requested the emergency meeting of the Security Council, assailed Iran and its proxies, saying Iran had crossed every red line in its attack and that Israel reserved the right to retaliate.

Kenny Holston/The New York Times Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday after Iran's overnight attack on Israel that the House would vote in the coming days on aid for Israel, and he suggested that aid for Ukraine could be included in the legislation.\n'House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing with Israel,' Mr. Johnson said on Fox News, noting that he had previously advanced two aid bills to help the U.S. ally. 'We're going to try again this week, and the details of that package are being put together. Right now, we're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues.'\nU.S. funding for both Israel and Ukraine has languished in Congress; Mr. Johnson initially refused to take up a $95 billion aid package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan passed by the Senate, and the Senate refused to take up a House Republican proposal that conditioned aid to Israel on domestic spending cuts.\nIn recent weeks, Mr. Johnson has repeatedly vowed to ensure that the House moves to assist Ukraine. He has been searching for a way to structure a foreign aid package that could secure a critical mass of support amid stiff Republican resistance to sending aid to Kyiv and mounting opposition among Democrats to unfettered military aid for Israel.\nBut the attacks from Iran have ratcheted up the pressure on Mr. Johnson to bring some kind of package to the floor this week, potentially forcing him to make a decision he has been agonizing over for weeks.\nHe left it unclear on Sunday whether the legislation he said the House would advance this week would also include aid for Ukraine.\nMr. Johnson said he believed that some proposals around Ukraine aid enjoyed broad support among House Republicans. He noted that he met with former President Donald J. Trump on Friday at his estate in Florida and that Mr. Trump had been supportive of conditioning the aid as a loan.\n'I think these are ideas that I think can get consensus, and that's what we've been working through,' Mr. Johnson said. 'We'll send our package. We'll put something together and send it to the Senate and get these obligations completed.'\nBefore the attacks in Israel over the weekend, Mr. Johnson had privately floated bringing up the $95 billion spending package for Ukraine and Israel passed by the Senate in February \u2014 and moving it through the House in tandem with a second bill containing policies endorsed by the conservative wing of his party. That plan envisioned two consecutive votes \u2014 one on the Senate-passed bill and another on a package of sweeteners geared toward appeasing Republicans who otherwise would be infuriated by Mr. Johnson's decision to push through a bipartisan aid package for Ukraine.\nRepresentative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Sunday that the two conflicts were tied together, and that he hoped they would be addressed together. 'What happened in Israel last night happens in Ukraine every night,' he said on CBS's 'Face The Nation.'\nMr. McCaul said that he had previously secured a 'commitment' from Mr. Johnson that a broad national security bill would be brought to the House floor for a vote, but that the timing was unclear.\n'My preference,' he said, 'is this week.'\nMinho Kim contributed reporting.\nApril 14, 2024, 1:02 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 1:02 p.m. ET Adam Sella\nAdam Sella Reporting from Tel Aviv The Israeli military said in a statement that it is calling up 'approximately two reserve brigades for operational activities on the Gaza front.'

Credit... Jim Hollander/EPA, via Shutterstock In a deeply divided Israel, even the dramatic scene above the country's skies on Sunday is open to political interpretation.\nFor supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's display of defensive technology against an Iranian salvo that included hundreds of drones and missiles proves Mr. Netanyahu has long been right to warn about the threat posed by Iran.\nHis opponents are loath to give him any credit, reserving their praise for the air force.\n'Like everything in Israel in recent years, the story is split into two narratives,' said Mazal Mualem, an Israeli political commentator for Al-Monitor, a Middle East news site, and the author of a recent biography of the Israeli leader.\n'The division and polarization in Israeli society prevents people from seeing the full picture,' Ms. Mualem added.\nIran's barrage on Sunday, launched in response to an Israeli attack on an Iranian Embassy building this month in Damascus that killed several high-ranking commanders in Iran's armed forces, came at a perilous time for Mr. Netanyahu.\nAt home, he is an unpopular leader whom many hold responsible for his government's policy and intelligence failures that led to the deadly Hamas-led attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, which prompted Israel to go to war in Gaza. Abroad, he is the focus of international censure over Israel's prosecution of that war, which has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Gazans.\nHow he ultimately emerges from this episode may depend on what happens next.\nMr. Netanyahu now must make a choice. Will he respond to Iran with a forceful counterattack and potentially entangle Israel and other countries in a broader war? Or will he absorb the attack, which gravely injured one 7-year-old girl but otherwise did limited damage, and defer to the coalition that helped defend Israel in the interests of regional stability?\nIsrael's allies have been urging restraint.\n'The question is whether Israel is going to retaliate immediately, or surprise the Iranians in one way or another,' said Efraim Halevy, who served as director of Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, during the latter part of Mr. Netanyahu's first term in the 1990s.\nNo Israeli leader has warned about Iran so consistently as Mr. Netanyahu or, for that matter, has spent so long in office. Israel's longest serving prime minister, he has been in power for about 17 years overall.\nSince his first year in office in 1996, Mr. Netanyahu warned that a nuclear Iran would be catastrophic and that time was running out. For the nearly three decades since, he has been sounding the same alarm.\nIran maintains a network of proxy militias across the region, including in Gaza, which the government funds and supplies with weapons. Some of those militias in Yemen, Syria and Lebanon have battled with Israel, creating distractions for the Israeli government and military amid the war with Hamas.\nBut perhaps more troubling, experts say, is that Iran is closer than ever to obtaining a nuclear weapon. Mr. Netanyahu's backers still credit him with having put Iran's nuclear program on the world agenda then, and they praise him now for investing in the mighty, multilayered air defense system that allowed Israel and its allies, including the United States, to intercept the vast majority of Iranian drones and missiles this weekend before they reached Israel.\nSometimes resorting to gimmicks and antics to draw attention to Iran's nuclear progress, Mr. Netanyahu has in the past made opposing Iran a key part of his global diplomacy. Once, at the United Nations General Assembly he held up a cartoonish drawing of a bomb marked with red lines depicting enrichment levels. Another time, at the Munich Security Conference, he waved around a piece of wreckage from what he said was an Iranian drone sent from Syria and shot down by Israel.\n'Everywhere he went he was talking about it,' recalled Jeremy Issacharoff, a former Israeli ambassador to Germany and for years the Ministry of Foreign Affairs point man coordinating diplomatic efforts on regional security and the Iranian threat.\nAt times, Mr. Netanyahu's campaign against Iran has severely strained Israel's relations with American presidents, though bipartisan U.S. support for Israel has long been considered a strategic asset.\nAround 2012, Mr. Netanyahu infuriated the Obama administration by pushing hard for President Barack Obama to set clear 'red lines' on Iran's nuclear progress that would prompt the United States to undertake a military strike. Before that, the Israeli prime minister was making plans for a unilateral Israeli strike in the face of tough opposition from Washington and public criticism from a string of former Israeli security chiefs. It was never clear if Mr. Netanyahu was bluffing, and the prospect of an imminent strike receded.\nHe further challenged Mr. Obama in 2015 with an impassioned speech to a joint meeting of Congress denouncing what he called a 'bad deal' being negotiated by the United States and other world powers with Iran to curb its nuclear program.\nWhen President Donald J. Trump came to power, Mr. Netanyahu encouraged him to withdraw from the agreement \u2014 a move that many Israeli experts have called a dire mistake and a failure of Mr. Netanyahu's Iran policy.\n'Since then, there have been no constraints on the program,' Mr. Issacharoff said, adding, 'It has never been more advanced.'\nBut it was also under Mr. Netanyahu's watch that Israel forged diplomatic relations with more Arab states that are considered part of the moderate, anti-Iranian axis, including the United Arab Emirates.\nRegardless of what comes next, Ms. Mualem, the Netanyahu biographer, said, 'Bibi is still in the game,' referring to him by his nickname. 'He's a central player, and it isn't over, diplomatically or politically. And he plays a long game.'\nMourners on Sunday with the bodies of Palestinians in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip. Credit... Ramadan Abed/Reuters As the world's attention shifted to Iran's attack on Israel, Palestinians in Gaza experienced a relatively calm night for the first time in more than six months but were quickly jolted back to reality when airstrikes there continued on Sunday morning.\nWhile Iranian drones and aircraft were making their way to Israeli territory on Saturday night, the incessant noise of Israeli drones and warplanes disappeared from Gaza's skies, residents said.\n'Finally some calmness after six months of buzzing and noises!' Yousef Mema, a Gazan activist with a significant social media following, wrote on Instagram.\nAnother influencer, Mahmoud Shurrab, recorded himself walking in the middle of the street, the skies overhead quiet. 'I can't believe it, silence,' he said in a video posted on Instagram.\nThe calm did not last. The Israeli military said on Sunday that its forces were pressing on with a raid in the central Gaza Strip for the fourth day, where they 'eliminated dozens of terrorists in face-to-face battles and with air support.' And Wafa, the Palestinian Authority news agency, reported that several Palestinians had been killed in a strike on a home in Nuseirat in central Gaza, and that at least eight others were wounded in a strike on three homes in Beit Hanoun, a city in the northeast of the strip.\nSome Palestinians worried that an escalation between Israel and Iran would distract from the dire situation in the Gaza Strip, potentially diverting international attention from the Israeli bombardment and looming famine there.\n'I think it is not at all in the Palestinians' side or favor to have a new front open with Israel,' said Amer Nasser, 64. 'This will distract the people around the world from seeing what is happening in Gaza,' he added.\nFor many, the Iranian attack was unexpected.\nFayez al-Samman, a 76-year-old car trader from Gaza City who is sheltering in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza, said he spent the night listening to the news on the radio. 'It was a surprise for me when I heard the missiles were targeting Israeli sites,' he said.\nOsama al-Hato, 53, another man from Gaza City staying in Deir al-Balah, said he was happy that Iran had targeted Israel. 'However, I did not follow the news nor expect the Iranian reaction to this extent,' he added.\nAymen Zidan, 57, a wholesale vegetable supplier from Deir al-Balah, said he had had little expectation that Iran would target Israel, although he believed Iran's attack was for its own interests, not for the sake of Palestinians in Gaza like him.\nEven so, he said, he felt 'relieved that there is a country that said no to Israel.'\nRaja Abdulrahim contributed reporting from New York.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Adam Rasgon","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/15/multimedia/15mideast-crisis-gaza-war-analysis/pwlt-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":2.468121,"_id":"41f4176586c824d22abb8e1aedc1dcde"},{"title":"Trying to Stop Violence, One Conversation at a Time","author":"Dean Majd","published_date":"2024-04-22 21:23:21","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/22/headway/gun-violence-intervention-baton-rouge.html","clean_url":"nytimes.com","excerpt":"In Baton Rouge, a public safety experiment could help to answer a critical question: Do community efforts to reduce street violence work?","summary":"When Liz and Louis Robinson's eldest son, Louis Jr., began to court trouble on the streets of Baton Rouge, La., Ms. Robinson worried that one of the bullets flying through their neighborhood \u2014 and occasionally through their windows and walls \u2014 would eventually find him. So she gave him an ultimatum.\n'I told him, \u2018A military man is going to come,'' she remembered. '\u2018Either you go with him or you get out of my house.'' This was 2008, and Americans were stationed in war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. But she figured those places were safer than Baton Rouge.\nLouis Jr. took Option A, joining the Army the year after he graduated from high school.\nAfter six years in the service, including one year in Iraq, Louis came home. He took a Coca-Cola warehouse job, became a father to three children and was performing as a rapper under the name Louis BadAzz.\nJust shy of his 30th birthday, Louis Jr. was leaving a friend's house when he was shot dead. He was one of 78 people killed in Baton Rouge in 2018.\nMs. Robinson grieved. She was also angry \u2014 at the people shooting up her neighborhood, at potential witnesses who wouldn't help the police solve the crime, at the police for not finding her son's killer.\nLouis Robinson Jr., who performed under the name Louis BadAzz, is memorialized in his parents' home. Ms. Robinson with two of her grandchildren.\nLouis Robinson Jr., who performed under the name Louis BadAzz, is memorialized in his parents' home.\nMs. Robinson with two of her grandchildren.\nAn empty lot on Cadillac Street near where Louis Jr. became one of 78 people killed in Baton Rouge in 2018.\nSix months before Louis Jr. was killed, Murphy Paul became the chief of police in Baton Rouge. Mr. Paul had come from the upper ranks of the Louisiana State Police, and Sharon Weston Broome, the mayor who hired him, gave him a mandate: make change. Among his early acts was dismissing a white police officer who shot and killed a Black man named Alton Sterling in 2016. The officer's actions and Sterling's death, caught on phone cameras, ignited existing tensions between police and Black residents in the city. Chief Paul, who is Black, began an overhaul of the Police Department's policies on discipline and the use of force.\nChief Murphy Paul was given a mandate to make change in the Baton Rouge Police Department.\nBut reforming a mostly white police department in a Black-majority city was only part of the job; just as urgent was confronting the street gun violence \u2014 what social scientists sometimes call community gun violence \u2014 that led to Louis Jr.'s death.\nWhile mass shootings strike at seemingly random locations \u2014 concerts, parades, schools \u2014 community gun violence strikes dependably in the most disadvantaged city blocks. Apart from suicide, it is by far the deadliest use of guns in the United States and hits hardest in places where poverty and lack of opportunity give rise to crime. Homicide was the leading cause of death among Black people between 15 and 24 in 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In Baton Rouge, where just over half of the 221,000 residents are Black, 85 percent of homicide victims in 2022 \u2014 and 80 percent of homicide suspects \u2014 were Black, according to a study by the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform.\nThe concentration of this violence helps fuel it. Victims, shooters and their families are often entangled in networks that can be impervious to and suspicious of law enforcement. Chief Paul wanted to break through those barriers.\nHe embraced the prevailing progressive theory of police reform: police should be guardians of a community, not warriors against it. If the police are trusted, the theory goes, witnesses feel comfortable coming forward and crimes are solved, disrupting cycles of violence and retaliation among a tiny number of heavily armed young men.\nTo that end, in early 2019, Chief Paul met with Ms. Robinson and other people who had lost family members to violence. 'I wasn't prepared for the passion, outrage, the anger and the pain that I was going to experience,' the chief said. Ms. Robinson, in particular, gave him an earful.\nHe persisted. Better policing, he told the family members, was essential, but insufficient. 'Look,' he told them, 'we need help.'\nAfter Liz Robinson lost her son to gun violence, she decided to run a non-profit called C.H.A.N.G.E. to help other families affected by gun violence\nKaran Deep Singh and Kathleen Flynn for The New York Times\nThe chief promised to work with members of the community, directing more resources and police help to groups already trying to prevent violence. Moreover, in a new experiment, he would work within a broader public safety program run by the mayor's office and community groups, spreading responsibility for public safety beyond the police.\nAll this, he hoped, would help to prevent further violence. But determining which prevention strategies really work is an evolving and complicated science. Law enforcement strategies are studied more often than community-driven alternatives, which means most existing research backs up police-driven approaches. Federal anti-violence funding has long skewed heavily toward policing, and police departments have the training and systems to collect the raw data that researchers use to study violence trends. When it comes to community-violence intervention methods like the one being tried in Baton Rouge, there are some promising results, but the number of studies is limited and the overall evidence remains unsettled.\nIn recent years, however, hundreds of millions of dollars from private foundations and the Biden administration have gone into these alternatives, offering a genuine opportunity to study their effectiveness.\n'It's exciting, and it's a moment of some trepidation as well, because there's a lot on the line,' said Nina Revoyr of Ballmer Group, the lead private funder of the organization advising Baton Rouge's experimental program. To people on the ground, helping a teenager get a summer job or calming a street dispute before it boils over is a self-evident success. But funders and policymakers want quantifiable, statistical evidence that these programs reduce violence overall. Future support nationwide hinges on the rigorous collection and analysis of that data.\nBaton Rouge is taking on the data collection challenge. And that means the people trying to prevent violence must learn a strange new language. Complex, sometimes messy situations \u2014 offhand conversations with teenagers in schools, bedside visits to hospital emergency rooms, late-night responses to chaotic crime scenes \u2014 have to be translated into atomized units that can flow into spreadsheets and databases and regression analyses. The process of codifying human interactions into orderly, ruthless statistics falls to teams of people whose preparation for this work often began with surviving violent traumas of their own.\nA year after Louis Jr.'s death, Chief Paul approached Ms. Robinson once again with a specific request: He wanted her to join a victims support group.\nThis time, she agreed.\nLearning the Newark Method The victims support group was run by Sateria Tate-Alexander, another woman Chief Paul had recruited. Like Ms. Robinson, Ms. Tate-Alexander, 48, raised her family in Baton Rouge. Her son had also been struck by a bullet, at age 17, though he survived. But it was the police killing of Alton Sterling that 'that kind of really lit my fire,' she said. She organized demonstrations, pitched in to lobby legislators for police reform, and convened neighborhood meetings.\nAs the Baton Rouge project was taking off, Ms. Tate-Alexander visited Newark, N.J., for inspiration. There, she saw the city's street team in action and decided that 'this is exactly what we need.'\nNewark had become a national beacon of violence reduction, in part through the work of Aqeela Sherrills, whom an admirer calls 'one of the godfathers of community-based violence intervention.' In 1992, at age 22, Mr. Sherrills, a former gang member, helped broker a truce between the Bloods and the Crips in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles. For the next dozen years, he crisscrossed the country and the globe, teaching about how he did it. That is what he was doing in 2004 when his 18-year-old son, Terrell, home on a break from college, was shot dead at a party.\n'It made me question everything,' Mr. Sherrills told me. 'I was broken.'\nHis son's murder went unsolved. Friends urged retaliation against the man believed to have fired the gun. Neither the justice system nor street justice offered any balm for his trauma, and he began to understand this failure as the root of the problem. The system was sorting people into victims (who were offered counseling and compensation) and perpetrators(whom it either punished harshly or failed to hold accountable). To Mr. Sherrills, this binary view encouraged a never-ending cycle of retaliatory violence.\nAqeela Sherrills, an anti-violence activist, brought the methods he had used in Newark to Baton Rouge and other cities.\nMr. Sherrills argued that breaking that divide and providing mental health care and other support could deter young men from taking matters into their own hands. He took those ideas to Newark in 2014 and would later help to create a street team that focused as much on would-be shooters as on shooting victims and their families. The idea is to deploy former gang members or others with criminal records to mediate disputes and prevent retaliation. The street team offered people counseling and connections to jobs, housing and health care. Government agencies and community-based organizations partnered to create what Mr. Sherrills called a public safety ecosystem.\nIn 2020, when cities nationwide saw spikes in gun violence, Newark held the line while all but eliminating police shootings. Mr. Sherrills said he was besieged with calls from cities wanting to learn Newark's special sauce. Later, he made connections in the Biden White House and helped organize a Black-led push for the national programs that are now funding efforts like the one in Baton Rouge. By 2023, his strategies were credited with helping to cut homicides in Newark in half since 2016.\nBaton Rouge became the first city outside New Jersey to be tutored in the Newark method. The mayor's office started an effort to mimic Newark's public safety ecosystem, overseen by Courtney Scott, then a mayoral aide. Four national organizations, including one founded by Mr. Sherrills, advise the city on community intervention, crime data analysis and other matters. At the heart of this national and local apparatus is the street team, led by Ms. Tate-Alexander.\nCalming the urge to retaliate By June 2021, when Ms. Tate-Alexander started assembling the street team, Ms. Robinson joined up. She had already taken a leading role at the victims support group and, eager to make an impact, she doubled up on her work.\nThe two women clicked from the start. Ms. Tate-Alexander has a college degree and a background in information technology and project management. Ms. Robinson, 55, who ran an office-cleaning crew with her husband for many years, has dyed bright-red hair and lets fly the occasional F-bomb. 'Liz came in and we could just see it in her,' Ms. Tate-Alexander said. 'The fight was just there.'\nChief Paul ordered police dispatchers to send alerts to the team for shootings in the high-crime neighborhoods that the team covers. The team's high-risk interventionists are the first responders to shooting scenes and heated disputes, but Ms. Robinson got an exemption from shooting-scene duties. 'I just can't see a Black man laid out there like that,' she said. 'No.'\nFour men do the bulk of the street team's outreach. They all grew up in Baton Rouge, and as in other cities with intervention programs, some sold drugs or committed even more serious crimes.\nOne of the group's elders is Gerald Haynes, 51, whom everyone calls Face for the jagged scar that runs from his left ear to his throat. Mr. Haynes spent 27 years in prison for his role in a drive-by shooting, an attempt at retribution for the killing of a friend.\nMr. Haynes knew a thing or two about the urge to retaliate: It had cost him nearly three decades of freedom. He also thought he knew how to talk to young hotheads. In prison, he said, 'I had to learn how to deal with them in a confined area where I could not get away from them and they couldn't get away from me.' But during his training in Newark, he discovered more refined skills of listening, reflecting back what people say to make them feel heard, and coming up with plans for people to step away from an argument without losing face.\nGerald Haynes joined the Baton Rouge anti-violence street team after spending 27 years in prison.\nKhoury Brown, 32, another high-risk interventionist, is best known to many of the young people the street team works with as the rapper Geaux Yella, with 129,000 Instagram followers. His skill with words is central to his job, but sometimes when a fight is brewing, he fears words will fail him. 'I could have both parties in a full-blooded conversation where everything's about to die down, and I got one knucklehead who feels like what I'm doing is soft,' he said. But he's a powerful influence even when he's not on the scene.\nThe high-risk interventionists will 'get up out of their beds at 2 o'clock in the morning to do whatever it is that's necessary,' says Ms. Tate-Alexander, who runs the street team. A high-risk interventionist, Khoury Brown is known around Baton Rouge as the rapper Geaux Yella.\nThe high-risk interventionists will 'get up out of their beds at 2 o'clock in the morning to do whatever it is that's necessary,' says Ms. Tate-Alexander, who runs the street team.\nA high-risk interventionist, Khoury Brown is known around Baton Rouge as the rapper Geaux Yella.\nDarius Crockett with his son.\nOne of the street team's initiatives is a mentorship program, in which young people at risk of violence are paired with mentors like Darius Crockett. Mr. Crockett had drifted to the streets as a teenager in Baton Rouge, selling drugs. But he had since gotten his G.E.D. and found work as a welder. He was assigned to work with a 15-year-old named Markel.\nShootings happen frequently on Markel's street. His mother, Kayla Atkins, uses a wheelchair, having been paralyzed by a gunshot long ago. From a young age, Markel had to be a caregiver. As he entered his teens, he was getting into fights. When he was 14, one of his best friends was shot and killed. His mother said she desperately wanted to save her son 'from going down that path.'\nThe mentorship program required Markel to complete three goals. Knowing Markel wanted to rap, Mr. Crockett urged him to enter a talent contest, where he performed an original rap song. Markel took first place, which meant he not only accomplished his first goal, but won prizes that would satisfy his other two: He would be a featured performer in a video with Geaux Yella himself and participate in a recording session. Markel eagerly looked forward to the coming winter when the session would happen. Mr. Crockett also helped the boy land a job at a city-run summer camp.\nMr. Crockett, left, acted as a mentor to Markel, helping him focus on music and a summer job.\nThen, in June, Markel got into an argument with his sister. He had a 'meltdown,' slamming doors and throwing things, Ms. Atkins said. Feeling helpless to control him, she called the police \u2014 and Mr. Crockett. The police officer put Markel in handcuffs in the back of his cruiser.\nWhen Mr. Crockett showed up, he asked to speak privately with Markel. The officer let him into the car. Mr. Crockett empathized with Markel. He told the teenager that he himself had 'lost my anger a little bit' with his girlfriend a few days earlier and had to reel himself in. 'Everybody gets angry,' Mr. Crockett told Markel. 'But right now, at this moment, you got to control it.'\nHe leveraged Markel's aspirations, promising that he could still appear in the Geaux Yella video. 'I'm still your big brother,' he assured him. 'I'll always be out here.' Markel settled down, and the police officer, with Ms. Atkins's blessing, let Mr. Crockett take the boy to another relative's house.\nA 'faith-based movement'? Poverty has always bred violence. In the 1990s, an upsurge in violent crime led cities to try new methods to address it on the streets. The first experiments leaned heavily on law enforcement. Hot-spots policing, for instance, the practice of focusing police attention on particular troubled neighborhoods, spread around the country.\nThen, in 1999, a Chicago epidemiologist named Gary Slutkin picked up an old idea of using outreach workers to mediate street disputes. Framing the problem in public health terms, he argued that retaliatory violence was like a communicable disease and that outreach workers \u2014 he called them violence interrupters \u2014 could mimic an immune response. Groups more or less modeled after Dr. Slutkin's organization, which came to be called Cure Violence, popped up in other cities.\nOther efforts springing from communities found a foothold in the violence prevention universe: youth counseling programs, visits with shooting victims while they are still in the hospital, cleanup of empty buildings and vacant lots that attract crime.\nThese ideas had an instinctive appeal. Violence was not about bad people, but about behaviors that could be changed. And violence interruption, in particular, gave agency both to members of a stricken community and people who regretted their own violent history. Overall, these methods emphasized prevention rather than punishment.\nAs these programs proliferated, however, policymakers had one overriding question: Do they work?\nStrong evidence emerged for some law enforcement efforts. Hot-spots policing has been studied many times in different cities and has consistently been shown to reduce violence. A carrot-and-stick approach called focused deterrence, which offers counseling and job training alongside the threat of prosecution for future crimes, has also gotten a research thumbs-up. Federal grants to initiate these policing programs often came with money for outside researchers to study them.\nHistorically, more research money has gone toward violence prevention programs run by the police than toward those run by community groups.\nBut money wasn't flowing to studies of community-based programs like violence interruption. Those studies require taxing, time-consuming design, said Jeffrey A. Butts, a violence researcher and the director of the Research and Evaluation Center at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. He lays some fault on researchers who prefer the easier work of analyzing police data.\nMuch of the research that has been done on community prevention programs is not sufficiently rigorous, Dr. Butts argues. He has studied community interventions for decades and supports systemic responses to violence, but criticizes organizations that champion their success without sufficient data. 'I see it becoming a faith-based movement,' Dr. Butts said. 'There has to be really transparent professional research in order to stand up in public and say this works.' When it comes to community-based interventions, he added, 'we are nowhere close to having that.'\nWhat troubles him most is that governments and foundations will walk away from programs that lack consistent and replicable evidence. This, he fears, will lead cities to rely only on strategies that have strong evidence \u2014 like policing.\nTo bulk up on evidence, Baton Rouge hired a data analysis company to create a system to capture the raw data. That system is still in its infancy, Ms. Scott said, and needs at least two more years before the city should even consider commissioning a formal quantitative evaluation. 'We're still working like a science project in a testing and observation mode,' she said.\nThe burden of logging that raw data falls to the street team. It's not a job they particularly relish. 'They'll get up out of their beds at 2 o'clock in the morning to go do whatever it is that's necessary,' Ms. Tate-Alexander said. 'The work is fulfilling to them. But the writing part? Yeah, no, that's not their favorite thing.'\nAbout once a week, Ms. Tate-Alexander calls a data day where they all come to the 'war room,' a windowless hovel tucked away in a community center, to get their logging done.\nMs. Robinson, Ms. Tate-Alexander and Mr. Sherrills in the street team's 'war room.'\nThey categorize each interaction on the streets: a mediation (getting conflicting parties to talk before violence occurs), an intervention (an attempt to head off retaliation after a violent incident) or a prevention (an intervention that demonstrably headed off more violence). They record whom they talked to, what was said and what they believe should be done next. 'We absolutely track everything,' Ms. Tate-Alexander said.\nThose reports are confidential, to protect sources' safety and to preserve the team's independence from law enforcement and build trust with the community. But every month, categories and actions are counted, anonymously, and then fed into the system that tracks the entire Baton Rouge public safety program, which includes 20 other agencies and organizations.\nThe dull mechanics of bureaucratic accountability are needed to comply with the multiple federal and private grants that pay for this work. Each grant has its own requirements.\nOne afternoon, interventionists reviewed work assignments at one end of a war room conference table while Ms. Tate-Alexander reviewed spreadsheet format changes the city wanted as it tracked the spending of one federal grant.\nMr. Sherrills was in town for one of his periodic visits. Six feet tall, with an ever-present Stacy Adams fedora, he cuts a striking figure. He is something of a celebrity in town, hugging and hand-slapping his way through talks and meetings.\nThe demands of funders and the research community sometimes frustrate him. He fears that the emphasis in social science toward quantitative research strips out the texture of real lives. Statistics can't capture what Markel felt when he won the talent competition or how a visit from Liz Robinson comforted a grieving family.\nMr. Sherrills is a believer in research. He was instrumental in getting a team from the University of California, Los Angeles to conduct a narrative evaluation of the Newark street team. But even Newark's precipitous fall in crime did not have the statistical backing necessary to prove that community-led interventions were responsible. When I brought up Dr. Butts's critiques to Mr. Sherrills, he grew heated, even tearing up at one point. 'Why we got to keep proving ourselves?'\nThe effort in Baton Rouge presents an opportunity not only to save lives, but to establish the community's role in doing so. While members of the street team groaned and eye-rolled through a conference call with a city official, Mr. Sherrills counseled patience. 'This,' he told them, 'is the biggest challenge of this work.'\n'I can't touch everybody' In 2023, homicides and nonfatal shootings fell as quickly across the country as they had risen during the Covid years. Analysts posit that some combination of pandemic shutdowns and protests after the murder of George Floyd threw normal social supports and policing into chaos, and that the trend is starting to reverse as life gets back to normal. But the data puzzle applies here, too: Nobody can say for sure.\nIn Baton Rouge, homicides and nonfatal shootings dropped by one-third between 2021 and 2023, to 359 victims from 535. That was a sharper decline than in many other cities.\nYet the picture still isn't clear. Violence in Baton Rouge remains higher than it was in the years before the pandemic and is still extraordinarily high for a city its size. And there were 31 homicides in the first quarter of 2024, double the number in the same period in 2023. The answer to whether community-based efforts help Baton Rouge make significant strides will only come with rigorous research down the line.\nIn July, Chief Paul announced he would retire after nearly six years on the job. Under his watch, officers' use of force went down, more Black officers were hired, and department policies and crime statistics became more accessible.\nBut throughout his tenure, there were pockets of opposition to his approach to violence prevention, including from members of the Metropolitan Council. Weeks after Mr. Paul announced his retirement, two lawsuits were filed claiming that officers secretly interrogated and brutalized suspects at a police warehouse. The mayor shut down the warehouse and the unit that was accused of using it. (The lawsuits are ongoing.) When questioned at a Metropolitan Council meeting about the lawsuits and alleged misconduct, Chief Paul lashed out at two council members who represent white-majority districts, essentially accusing them of racist motivations in trying to undermine him and his efforts to rid the department of 'bad cops.' (They denied his accusations and then unsuccessfully pressed the mayor to fire Mr. Paul ahead of his planned departure.) Community members held a 'Stand With Chief Murphy Paul Rally' outside police headquarters. In the front row at that rally was Ms. Robinson.\nThe homicides increased in Baton Rouge during the pandemic, and fell afterwards. But the number of deaths is still high \u2014 359 people in 2023.\nChief Paul's replacement is Thomas S. Morse Jr., a 20-year veteran of the department. Mr. Morse, who is white, came into office voicing support for the community's role in violence prevention. At first, Ms. Robinson and Ms. Tate-Alexander seemed wary when I asked about him. They didn't know him, they said, but hoped he would follow Chief Paul's example.\nAs 2023 came to a close, the street team faced new troubles. In early December, Mr. Crockett, the street team member who had mentored Markel, was charged with aggravated battery, domestic abuse and child endangerment. His girlfriend told the police that he had slammed her head against a wall and thrown a steam iron at her while children were sleeping in the next room. When I called Mr. Crockett to ask about the police report, he confirmed that he and his girlfriend had fought, but insisted he had not attacked her.\nMs. Tate-Alexander said that Mr. Crockett is dedicated to his work and she has never seen him be violent. When he told her about the charges, she put Mr. Crockett on an unpaid suspension for a week, but he is back at work until the case against him is resolved. She will be guided by what happens in court. He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment in March.\nOn Dec. 30, Baton Rouge recorded its last homicide of 2023. A 20-year-old man named Dy'Lan Fillmore-Mitchell had been shot multiple times in his car. Ms. Robinson heard about it when her aunt called that morning. The brutal intimacy of concentrated violence had struck again: Mr. Fillmore-Mitchell was her aunt's grandson.\nMs. Robinson rushed to her family. A video taken at a memorial a week later captured Ms. Robinson in her community-organizing element, reminding the mourners that after they moved on, the family would still grieve. 'I'm telling y'all because I know ,' she said, tapping her chest for emphasis.\nknow ,' she said, tapping her chest for emphasis. Mr. Fillmore-Mitchell and Ms. Robinson's son Louis shared a birthday, 15 years apart. 'Gun violence has touched my family again,' she told me. 'And I put so much hard work in it, in the work, you know, for my family to be protected.'\nShe described the torment she had felt, her mind spinning, trying to fathom what more she could do.\n'I know I can't touch everybody,' she said. 'I know that. I just have to work harder.'","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Mark Obbie,Dean Majd","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/02/multimedia/HW-BATON-ROUGE-01-jczq/HW-BATON-ROUGE-01-jczq-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@nytimes","_score":2.461388,"_id":"c2ee91b4f04592add5bb1bfd52c0910b"},{"title":"As prospective jurors answer questions, they struggle to remain anonymous.","author":"Kate Christobek","published_date":"2024-04-16 17:11:53","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/16/nyregion/trump-hush-money-trial/as-prospective-jurors-answer-questions-they-struggle-to-remain-anonymous","clean_url":"nytimes.com","excerpt":"Skip to contentSkip to site indexThe challenging process of choosing","summary":"Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index The challenging process of choosing a jury in the first criminal trial of a former American president proceeded slowly on Tuesday, as prospective jurors were questioned individually about their ability to fairly consider the charges against Donald J. Trump. Shortly before noon, lawyers began directly questioning the first group of prospective jurors to make it through initial queries. Questions involved their opinions on campaign finance law and on the trial's potential witnesses, including a porn star and a tabloid publisher. Earlier, some prospective jurors who had previously indicated that they would be able to be impartial had changed their minds after taking a night to think about it. 'I don't think I can be as impartial and unbiased as I hoped I could be,' one admitted. He was excused. It could take two weeks or more to pick the 12 jurors who will decide the case, which centers on allegations that the former president falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star, Stormy Daniels. The pool of possible jurors being scrutinized on Tuesday came from an initial group of 96, dozens of whom were dismissed immediately on Monday after indicating that they felt they could not fairly reach a decision. The dismissals underscored the difficulty of picking a jury in a city where the defendant is widely reviled. Mr. Trump, who may take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied all wrongdoing. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records that hid reimbursements to his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who had paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 to buy her silence. Prosecutors say that Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election. Here's what to know about the case: The case was brought a year ago by Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. It is one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, but may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nA day after Mr. Trump appeared to nod off during pretrial motions, he was back at the defense table. He appeared somewhat bored as the jury selection process continued, with prospective jurors responding to a series of mostly yes or no questions.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America.\nMr. Trump has repeatedly complained that the case is a politically motivated witch hunt and has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and his family, as well as key witnesses, including Mr. Cohen. Justice Merchan has imposed a gag order on Mr. Trump that bars him from attacking witnesses, jurors, prosecutors or the judge's family. Even before the trial began on Monday, prosecutors asked Justice Merchan to hold the former president in contempt of court over social media posts about Mr. Cohen; the judge said he would hold a hearing later this month.

Asked about the fairness of Trump being on trial in Manhattan, where he's an unpopular figure, Adams replied, 'That is beyond my pay grade.' But, he added, 'This city is a fair city.'

After stressing that the trial was proceeding in an 'orderly fashion,' he was escorted down Centre Street away from the news media. Video Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, accused Donald J. Trump of falsifying business records connected to a hush money payment to a porn star. Mr. Trump pleaded not guilty to all 34 felony counts. Credit Credit... Andrew Seng for The New York Times All 34 felony counts at the center of the Manhattan criminal case against former President Donald J. Trump stem from a $130,000 hush-money payment handed over to a porn star in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign. The specific charges are far less titillating: falsifying business records in the first degree. But a conviction could still result in jail time. The payment was made by Mr. Trump's fixer, Michael D. Cohen, to Stormy Daniels in order to buy her silence about a sexual liaison she said she had with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump directed him to make the payment. Paying hush money is not illegal. But while serving as the commander in chief, prosecutors say, Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen in a manner that constituted fraud: In internal records, Mr. Trump's company classified the reimbursement as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet there were no such expenses, according to prosecutors, who say the agreement was also fictional. Those records underpin the 34 counts of falsifying business records: 11 involve the checks, 11 center on monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted to the company and 12 involve entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust. Mr. Trump has denied all wrongdoing. In announcing the charges a year ago, Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, said that his office must keep a close eye on how companies conduct business in New York. 'This is the business capital of the world,' Mr. Bragg said. 'We regularly do cases involving false business statements. The bedrock \u2014 in fact, the basis for business integrity and a well-functioning business marketplace \u2014 is true and accurate record-keeping.' The charges against Mr. Trump are all Class E felonies, the lowest category in New York. Each count carries a maximum prison sentence of four years. Nothing in the law requires the judge, Juan E. Merchan, to imprison Mr. Trump if the jury convicts him. The judge could instead sentence him to probation. But Justice Merchan has made it clear that he takes white-collar crime seriously and could put Mr. Trump behind bars. It's possible, however, if Mr. Trump is convicted of more than one count, Justice Merchan would impose a concurrent sentence, under which Mr. Trump would serve all time simultaneously. Key Players in the Trump Criminal Trial \u203a  April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET Olivia Bensimon Reporting from outside the courthouse Journalists still vastly outnumber the Trump supporters who have gathered near the courthouse today. One man's Stars and Stripes flag flaps in the breeze, two other people are sitting on benches. Neighborhood workers on their lunch breaks bask in the spring sun. Jury selection is often a lengthy process, but in the first criminal trial of a former American president, currently taking place in a Manhattan criminal courthouse, it's going more slowly than normal. In part, that is because of the nature of the case: Jurors, once seated, will be asked to decide whether Donald J. Trump committed a crime. Prosecutors have charged him with 34 felonies, accusing him of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal that could have hurt his first presidential run. But the process has been particularly drawn-out because, once would-be jurors say they can be fair and impartial, they are being asked a series of 42 questions. After that, they face additional scrutiny from lawyers for the prosecution and the defense. Here are the 42 questions: 1. Without telling us your address, in what neighborhood do you live? For example, Upper East Side, Lower East Side, Inwood, etc. How long have you lived there? Are you a native New Yorker? If not, where did you live previously? 2. What do you do for a living? How long have you been doing that? If you are retired, please tell us what you did before you retired. 3. Who is your current employer? How large is your current employer?

If so, what was the experience? Would that experience prevent you from being a fair and impartial juror in this case? 19. Have you, a relative, or a close friend ever been accused or convicted of committing a crime? 20. Do you, a relative, or a close friend have a pending criminal case? 21. Do you have any political, moral, intellectual or religious beliefs or opinions which might prevent you from following the Court's instructions on the law or which might slant your approach to this case? Do you have any political, moral, intellectual or religious beliefs or opinions that would interfere with your ability to render a verdict in this criminal case? 22. Do you have a health condition that might interfere with your ability to be here on the appointed days and times or otherwise prevent you from serving as a juror? 23. Without telling us the name(s), do you take any medication that would prevent you from being able to concentrate or pay attention during the proceedings or during the deliberations? 24. Court proceedings normally end around 4:30 in the afternoon though on rare occasions, we might work beyond that. Would your schedule and responsibilities permit you to work later if it were absolutely necessary to complete that day's work? 25. Do you practice a religion that would prevent you from sitting as a juror on any particular weekday or weeknight? 26.

Are you signed up for or have you ever been signed up for, subscribed to, or followed any newsletter or email lists run by or on behalf of any anti-Trump group or organization? Do you currently follow any anti-Trump group or organization on any social media site, or have you done so in the past? 30. Have you ever considered yourself a supporter of or belonged to any of the following: (the QAnon movement, Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Three Percenters, Boogaloo Boys, Antifa) 31. Do you have any strong opinions or firmly held beliefs about whether a former president may be criminally charged in state court? 32. Do you have any feelings or opinions about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case? 33. Can you give us your assurance that you will decide this case solely on the evidence you see and hear in this courtroom and the law as the judge gives it? 34.

The United States Constitution provides that a defendant has no burden to introduce any evidence or to testify in a criminal case. If Mr. Trump chooses not to testify, or to introduce any evidence, can you give us your assurance that you will not hold that against him? 42. Is there any reason, whether it be a bias or something else, that would prevent you from being fair and impartial if you are selected as a juror for this case? New York State makes no provision for anonymous juries, even in a case as sensitive as this one. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Last month, Justice Juan M. Merchan ordered that prospective jurors' names would be shielded from the public, underscoring the need for privacy for those who may decide Donald J. Trump's criminal fate \u2014 and tempt the anger of his followers. Yet on the first two days of jury selection, several prospective jurors revealed potentially identifying information, reflecting the difficulty of having an anonymous jury in a case with an intense media spotlight. On the first day, a woman said she worked for a city agency of approximately 500 people and revealed its name. Later, a man who identified himself as a bookseller revealed the name of the small store where he works. This continued on Tuesday when others revealed the names of employers. While some worked for companies that were large, where the potential jurors could likely remain unidentifiable, others were less cautious. One woman revealed the name of the three-person company she owns with her husband. Justice Merchan did not interject as the prospective jurors divulged the information, nor did he caution them against doing so. Juries are not completely anonymous in New York State. Mr. Trump, his lawyers and the prosecutors have access to the names of the prospective jurors. But after a request by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, Justice Merchan decided to withhold the names from the public. Mr. Trump did not oppose the request. The accidental self-identifications are a notable departure from how federal Judge Lewis A. Kaplan conducted jury selection in Mr. Trump's defamation trial in January, brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll. In the federal system, jurors are allowed to remain anonymous, even to parties in the case. Before potential jurors answered basic questions about their backgrounds, Judge Kaplan instructed them not to reveal personal information. 'Don't give us anything that could enable anybody to pin you down geographically,' he said. He also cautioned them not to reveal their names to each other, and when the trial concluded, he left them with these ominous words: 'My advice to you is that you never disclose that you were on this jury,' Judge Kaplan said. 'And I won't say anything more about it.'

There are currently 18 remaining from yesterday's initial group who have been interviewed by lawyers, and six more who have yet to be interviewed. The judge, Juan Merchan, said that he's hoping to bring in a new group of prospective jurors \u2014 likely around 100 of them \u2014 in the afternoon. Soon, we may have some actual jurors.

Justice Merchan knows the importance of getting this little piece of the process right: an appeals court two years ago overturned a conviction in a case he presided over when a defendant did not appear at an important sidebar, and the defendant hadn't waived the right to do so.

Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times Donald J. Trump first ran for president nearly a decade ago. Now, as he runs again in a political climate that he helped create, his Manhattan criminal trial is partly a referendum on his tactics during that first campaign. The trial's very premise is that prosecutors believe Mr. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign \u2014 sex scandals involving a porn star and a Playboy model, for example \u2014 he concealed them, the prosecutors say. But in a development that will bolster their case, prosecutors on Monday secured permission from the judge to admit evidence connected to Mr. Trump's overall political strategy in 2016. Much of it bears the former president's imprint: aggressive tweets, false denials, coordination with a tabloid publisher and more. The judge's ruling showed how the weapons that worked so well for Mr. Trump then are being turned against him in the courtroom now. The techniques prosecutors highlighted Monday were not invented by Mr. Trump for use in his campaign; they are behaviors he exhibited throughout his life as a businessman and a reality-television star. But in modern American political history, such raw tactics had rarely been seen at such a high level. One example is Mr. Trump's relationship with The National Enquirer tabloid and its publisher, David Pecker, who is expected to appear as a witness. The Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case, obtained permission from the judge on Monday to introduce evidence related to a 2015 meeting among Mr. Trump, Mr. Pecker and Mr. Trump's former fixer, Michael D. Cohen. A prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, said on Monday that the three men had 'conspired to influence the 2016 election.' That meeting laid the groundwork for hush-money deals with a porn star, Stormy Daniels, and a Playboy model, Karen McDougal. But another result of that meeting, Mr. Steinglass said, were explosive headlines about Mr. Trump's opponents in the Republican primary, including those claiming that Ben Carson had committed 'medical malpractice' and that Senator Ted Cruz had a 'family connection to J.F.K.'s assassin.' A lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, protested the admission of evidence related to that meeting, saying that newspaper publishers met with candidates 'all the time,' and that there was nothing improper about it, let alone illegal. That admission worked against him. The judge, Juan M. Merchan, said that he was glad that Mr. Blanche believed that there was nothing wrong with the meeting \u2014 because it meant that he should not mind that the evidence would be introduced. 'There is no reason not to allow it in,' Justice Merchan said. Mr. Steinglass won again when he persuaded Justice Merchan to admit evidence of the Trump campaign in crisis after the publication in 2016 of the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump boasted about grabbing women by their genitals. 'The video sent the campaign into a tailspin,' Mr. Steinglass said. He offered up an email sent by a Washington Post reporter to Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump's campaign spokeswoman. Mr. Steinglass said that Ms. Hicks had forwarded the exchange to Stephen K. Bannon, Kellyanne Conway and other members of the campaign team, 'suggesting that their response should be to deny, deny, deny.' Eventually, he said, Mr. Bannon sent it to Mr. Cohen. Mr. Blanche again protested, but was again rebuffed. The judge said he would allow jurors to see the email, saying that the ensuing thread was relevant. The exchanges that prosecutors and defense lawyers debated on Monday underscored Mr. Trump's penchant for delegating dirty work to others, giving himself some distance in the process. The hush-money deals worked that way: Mr. Cohen paid off Ms. Daniels, while The National Enquirer bought Ms. McDougal's silence. (Mr. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to his reimbursement of Mr. Cohen.) That habit is still on display this year, and can be helpful given that Justice Merchan has barred Mr. Trump from attacking witnesses, prosecutors and the judge's own family. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump posted on social media a video of Laura Loomer, a political ally, in the park outside the courthouse. Ms. Loomer, speaking into a bullhorn, insinuated that the judge's family was politically compromised. Had Mr. Trump said that himself, he would have risked violating the judge's gag order.

Asked whether she knew anyone in the legal field, one prospective juror gave a candid answer. 'I dated a lawyer for a while,' she said, before pausing and adding: 'It ended fine.' Her honesty led to hearty chuckles among the reporters in the overflow room. Trump did not laugh.

But a few of those who have made it to this stage have realized while answering questions that they may have a tougher time than they thought. One prospective juror just admitted: 'I don't think I can be as impartial and unbiased as I hoped I could be.' He was excused.

Occasionally he fidgets, appears to write notes, whispers to his lawyer and at one point examined his tie. He largely stares ahead, not looking in the direction of the prospective jurors. But his glare fixates on the jury box when prospective jurors bring up conflicts, including a woman who said she realized overnight that she could not be impartial and unbiased.

On Tuesday, the spectacle of the first trial of a president was fading into New York's usual urban bustle. Credit... Yuki Iwamura/Associated Press The scene outside Manhattan's Criminal Court on Tuesday morning was placid \u2014 by New York standards \u2014 after the tense crush on the first day of Donald J. Trump's trial. On Monday, cable news stations had staked out every concrete surface bordering Centre Street. On Tuesday, there were swaths of open ground in the space reserved for media organizations. As the sun rose and workers in Collect Pond Park removed overflowing trash cans around 5:30 a.m., only five people were in the line for those holding official passes for entry. In the line for the general public were some familiar faces among court-watchers, including Ron Sinibaldi, whose hobbies include following high-profile cases. He's previously attended proceedings involving Senator Robert Menendez, who is accused of taking bribes, and New Jersey officials involved in closing the George Washington Bridge as political retribution. Everyday street scenes played out nearby. Around 7 a.m., a lone man fed pigeons in the park, which was sparsely populated by the time Mr. Trump's motorcade arrived nearly two hours later. An exception: one older man holding up a red Trump 2024 flag and shouting at television reporters: 'Fight! Fight! Fight for Donald Trump!' Shortly after, a line of young children toddled through, flanked by teacher's aides and clutching a rope, their neon orange vests a pop of color. Anusha Bayya contributed reporting.

Justice Merchan kindly reminded them to be on time going forward.  In court Monday, former President Donald J. Trump scowled and scoffed, and apparently slept. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab New York City courtroom as Mr. Trump looked on. Before jury selection began, the judge, Juan M. Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, rejected another effort to force his recusal by the defense, which cited several issues, including his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. He also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost. But Mr. Trump's lawyers did persuade Justice Merchan that mentioning sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump was recorded bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial. Entering the courtroom Monday, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here,' but he looked less enthusiastic in front of Justice Merchan. He quietly slouched and scowled \u2014 and at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep. By afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into the courtroom. Some quickly left: When the judge asked the first group of 96 if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused. The remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.   The jury selection process in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan could take two weeks or more. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Lawyers representing the State of New York and Donald J. Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate. The potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair. The process could take two weeks or more \u2014 and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court. 'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.' The stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County \u2014 Manhattan, as most people know it \u2014 which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020. Mr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated. Prosecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28. Unlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.' Some may not be completely forthcoming. 'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said. Mr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors. 'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'  Former President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Not since Eugene V. Debs campaigned from a prison cell more than a century ago has the United States experienced what might now happen: a prominent candidate with a felony conviction running for president. And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning. Former President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases: two federal, one in New York and another in Georgia. The first of those to go to trial is the sex scandal cover-up in New York, where jury selection began on Monday. For now, he faces no formal campaign restrictions, beyond having to be present in a courtroom, and he remains highly competitive in polls. But some of the cases are proceeding at a pace that could bring verdicts before the election \u2014 and the Constitution and American law have clear answers for only some of the questions that will arise if he is convicted. Others would bring the country into truly uncharted territory, with huge decisions resting in the hands of federal judges. Here is what we know, and what we don't know. This is the simplest question of the bunch. The answer is yes. The Constitution sets very few eligibility requirements for presidents. They must be at least 35 years old, be 'natural born' citizens and have lived in the United States for at least 14 years. There are no limitations based on character or criminal record. While some states prohibit felons from running for state and local office, these laws do not apply to federal offices. The Republican and Democratic Parties have guaranteed spots on general-election ballots in every state, and the parties tell election officials whose name to put in their spot. States could, in theory, try to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on legally shaky ground. 'We let states set the time, place and manner' of elections, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who specializes in election law, 'but I think the best reading of our Constitution is you don't let the state add new substantive requirements.' While that view is not universal among legal experts, it prevailed in court in 2019, after California passed a law requiring candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on primary ballots. A federal district judge blocked the law from taking effect, saying it was most likely unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court also unanimously blocked it as a violation of the state constitution, and the case never reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that states could not keep Mr. Trump off their ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies people who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' after taking an oath to support the Constitution. Numerous lawsuits had argued that Mr. Trump's actions before and on Jan. 6, 2021, met this bar. In December, the Colorado Supreme Court found him ineligible, and Maine's secretary of state did the same. But the Supreme Court \u2014 led by a conservative supermajority, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump himself \u2014 concluded that only Congress had the power to enforce Section 3 against candidates for federal office. (Four of the justices, including the three liberals, wanted to allow a wider range of options for disqualification.) Congress is not going to do that with Republicans in control of the House. And the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal cases, meaning convictions would not disqualify Mr. Trump either. Congress can designate either groups of people to whom Section 3 applies (such as people who fought for the Confederacy) or specific crimes that, upon conviction, would trigger disqualification, said Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University. But none of the crimes Mr. Trump is charged with carry that automatic penalty. 'Whether or not Trump is tried, convicted, acquitted, that's a separate question from whether or not he's disqualified,' said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. One of the charges in the federal case related to Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election \u2014 conspiracy to violate civil rights \u2014 once carried a disqualification penalty, Mr. Kreis said, but Congress removed it decades ago. Now that Mr. Trump has secured a majority of delegates to the Republican convention, the party has no mechanism to nominate somebody else. Under the party's official convention rules, if a delegate tries to support someone other than the person the primary results bound them to, 'such support shall not be recognized.' Nor have top Republicans shown any interest in another nominee. If he were forced to withdraw from the race after the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him. Probably not. Mr. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, and he would be disenfranchised there if convicted of a felony. Most felons in Florida regain voting rights after completing their full sentence, including parole or probation, and paying all fines and fees. But it is highly unlikely that Mr. Trump, if convicted, would have time to complete his sentence before Election Day. He could also petition for clemency, which would require the approval of the governor \u2014 Ron DeSantis, who ran against Mr. Trump in the Republican primary \u2014 and two Florida cabinet members. Chris Taylor, the director of external affairs for the Florida Commission on Offender Review, confirmed that a Florida resident convicted of a felony could apply to have their voting rights restored through that process even if their conviction happened outside Florida. Since Mr. Trump also has a residence in New York, he could switch his voter registration there to take advantage of its more permissive approach: Felons in New York can vote while on parole or probation. But, as in Florida and almost every other state, they are still disenfranchised while in prison. So if Mr. Trump is imprisoned, he could be in the extraordinary position of being deemed fit to be voted for, but unfit to vote. No one knows. 'We're so far removed from anything that's ever happened,' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley. 'It's just guessing.' Legally, Mr. Trump would remain eligible to be president even if he were imprisoned. The Constitution says nothing to the contrary. 'I don't think that the framers ever thought we were going to be in this situation,' Professor Levinson said. In practice, the election of an incarcerated president would create a legal crisis that would almost certainly need to be resolved by the courts. In theory, Mr. Trump could be stripped of his authority under the 25th Amendment, which provides a process to transfer authority to the vice president if the president is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' But that would require the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare Mr. Trump unable to fulfill his duties, a remote prospect given that these would be loyalists appointed by Mr. Trump himself. More likely, Mr. Trump could sue to be released on the basis that his imprisonment was preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional obligations as president. Such a case would probably focus on the separation of powers, with Mr. Trump's lawyers arguing that keeping a duly elected president in prison would be an infringement by the judicial branch on the operations of the executive branch. On the federal charges only, he could also try to pardon himself \u2014 or to commute his sentence, leaving his conviction in place but ending his imprisonment. Either action would be an extraordinary assertion of presidential power, and the Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of whether a 'self pardon' was constitutional. Or President Biden, on his way out the door, could pardon Mr. Trump on the basis that 'the people have spoken and I need to pardon him so he can govern,' Professor Chemerinsky said. But that wouldn't apply to the New York or Georgia cases, because the president does not have pardon power for state charges. Again, no one knows, particularly when it comes to the New York and Georgia cases. In the two federal cases, a likely outcome would be that a Trump-appointed attorney general would withdraw the charges. The Justice Department does not indict sitting presidents, a policy outlined in a 1973 memo, during the Nixon era. It has never had reason to develop a policy on what to do with an incoming president who has already been indicted. But the rationale for not indicting sitting presidents \u2014 that it would interfere with their ability to perform their duties \u2014 applies just as well in this hypothetical scenario. 'The reasons why we wouldn't want to indict a sitting president are the reasons we wouldn't want to prosecute a sitting president,' said Professor Chemerinsky, who has disagreed with the department's reasoning. 'My guess is, if the Trump prosecution were still ongoing in some way and Trump were elected, the Justice Department \u2014 which would be the Trump Justice Department \u2014 would say, \u2018We're following the 1973 memo.'' Like so much else here, this would be legally untested, and it is impossible to say what the Supreme Court would do if the question reached it. In its Clinton v. Jones ruling in 1997, the court allowed a lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed. But that case was civil, not criminal, and it was filed by a private citizen, not by the government itself.

Trump.\nShortly before noon, lawyers began directly questioning the first group of prospective jurors to make it through initial queries. Questions involved their opinions on campaign finance law and on the trial's potential witnesses, including a porn star and a tabloid publisher.\nEarlier, some prospective jurors who had previously indicated that they would be able to be impartial had changed their minds after taking a night to think about it. 'I don't think I can be as impartial and unbiased as I hoped I could be,' one admitted. He was excused.\nIt could take two weeks or more to pick the 12 jurors who will decide the case, which centers on allegations that the former president falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star, Stormy Daniels.\nThe pool of possible jurors being scrutinized on Tuesday came from an initial group of 96, dozens of whom were dismissed immediately on Monday after indicating that they felt they could not fairly reach a decision. The dismissals underscored the difficulty of picking a jury in a city where the defendant is widely reviled.\nMr. Trump, who may take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied all wrongdoing. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records that hid reimbursements to his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who had paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 to buy her silence. Prosecutors say that Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election.\nHere's what to know about the case:\nThe case was brought a year ago by Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. It is one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, but may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nA day after Mr. Trump appeared to nod off during pretrial motions, he was back at the defense table. He appeared somewhat bored as the jury selection process continued, with prospective jurors responding to a series of mostly yes or no questions.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America.\nMr. Trump has repeatedly complained that the case is a politically motivated witch hunt and has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and his family, as well as key witnesses, including Mr. Cohen. Justice Merchan has imposed a gag order on Mr. Trump that bars him from attacking witnesses, jurors, prosecutors or the judge's family. Even before the trial began on Monday, prosecutors asked Justice Merchan to hold the former president in contempt of court over social media posts about Mr. Cohen; the judge said he would hold a hearing later this month.\nApril 16, 2024, 2:00 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 2:00 p.m. ET Anusha Bayya\nAnusha Bayya Reporting from outside the courthouse A midday addition to the crowd here, albeit briefly: Mayor Eric Adams has come by, flanked by his security detail, and was soon peppered with questions by reporters.

Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, accused Donald J. Trump of falsifying business records connected to a hush money payment to a porn star. Mr. Trump pleaded not guilty to all 34 felony counts. Credit Credit... Andrew Seng for The New York Times All 34 felony counts at the center of the Manhattan criminal case against former President Donald J. Trump stem from a $130,000 hush-money payment handed over to a porn star in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign.\nThe specific charges are far less titillating: falsifying business records in the first degree. But a conviction could still result in jail time.\nThe payment was made by Mr. Trump's fixer, Michael D. Cohen, to Stormy Daniels in order to buy her silence about a sexual liaison she said she had with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump directed him to make the payment.\nPaying hush money is not illegal. But while serving as the commander in chief, prosecutors say, Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen in a manner that constituted fraud: In internal records, Mr. Trump's company classified the reimbursement as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet there were no such expenses, according to prosecutors, who say the agreement was also fictional.\nThose records underpin the 34 counts of falsifying business records: 11 involve the checks, 11 center on monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted to the company and 12 involve entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust. Mr. Trump has denied all wrongdoing.\nIn announcing the charges a year ago, Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, said that his office must keep a close eye on how companies conduct business in New York.\n'This is the business capital of the world,' Mr. Bragg said. 'We regularly do cases involving false business statements. The bedrock \u2014 in fact, the basis for business integrity and a well-functioning business marketplace \u2014 is true and accurate record-keeping.'\nThe charges against Mr. Trump are all Class E felonies, the lowest category in New York. Each count carries a maximum prison sentence of four years.\nNothing in the law requires the judge, Juan E. Merchan, to imprison Mr. Trump if the jury convicts him. The judge could instead sentence him to probation.\nBut Justice Merchan has made it clear that he takes white-collar crime seriously and could put Mr. Trump behind bars. It's possible, however, if Mr. Trump is convicted of more than one count, Justice Merchan would impose a concurrent sentence, under which Mr. Trump would serve all time simultaneously.\nKey Players in the Trump Criminal Trial \u203a Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET Olivia Bensimon\nOlivia Bensimon Reporting from outside the courthouse Journalists still vastly outnumber the Trump supporters who have gathered near the courthouse today.

Neighborhood workers on their lunch breaks bask in the spring sun.\nJury selection is often a lengthy process, but in the first criminal trial of a former American president, currently taking place in a Manhattan criminal courthouse, it's going more slowly than normal.\nIn part, that is because of the nature of the case: Jurors, once seated, will be asked to decide whether Donald J. Trump committed a crime. Prosecutors have charged him with 34 felonies, accusing him of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal that could have hurt his first presidential run.\nBut the process has been particularly drawn-out because, once would-be jurors say they can be fair and impartial, they are being asked a series of 42 questions.

Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Last month, Justice Juan M. Merchan ordered that prospective jurors' names would be shielded from the public, underscoring the need for privacy for those who may decide Donald J. Trump's criminal fate \u2014 and tempt the anger of his followers.\nYet on the first two days of jury selection, several prospective jurors revealed potentially identifying information, reflecting the difficulty of having an anonymous jury in a case with an intense media spotlight.\nOn the first day, a woman said she worked for a city agency of approximately 500 people and revealed its name. Later, a man who identified himself as a bookseller revealed the name of the small store where he works.\nThis continued on Tuesday when others revealed the names of employers. While some worked for companies that were large, where the potential jurors could likely remain unidentifiable, others were less cautious. One woman revealed the name of the three-person company she owns with her husband.\nJustice Merchan did not interject as the prospective jurors divulged the information, nor did he caution them against doing so.\nJuries are not completely anonymous in New York State. Mr. Trump, his lawyers and the prosecutors have access to the names of the prospective jurors. But after a request by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, Justice Merchan decided to withhold the names from the public. Mr. Trump did not oppose the request.\nThe accidental self-identifications are a notable departure from how federal Judge Lewis A. Kaplan conducted jury selection in Mr. Trump's defamation trial in January, brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll.\nIn the federal system, jurors are allowed to remain anonymous, even to parties in the case. Before potential jurors answered basic questions about their backgrounds, Judge Kaplan instructed them not to reveal personal information.\n'Don't give us anything that could enable anybody to pin you down geographically,' he said.\nHe also cautioned them not to reveal their names to each other, and when the trial concluded, he left them with these ominous words: 'My advice to you is that you never disclose that you were on this jury,' Judge Kaplan said. 'And I won't say anything more about it.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 16, 2024, 1:11 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 1:11 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich\nJonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse The prospective jurors have just been excused for lunch.

We are running 5 to 7 minutes per person.\nThe very premise of the trial is that prosecutors believe Donald J. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times Donald J. Trump first ran for president nearly a decade ago.\nNow, as he runs again in a political climate that he helped create, his Manhattan criminal trial is partly a referendum on his tactics during that first campaign.\nThe trial's very premise is that prosecutors believe Mr. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign \u2014 sex scandals involving a porn star and a Playboy model, for example \u2014 he concealed them, the prosecutors say.\nBut in a development that will bolster their case, prosecutors on Monday secured permission from the judge to admit evidence connected to Mr. Trump's overall political strategy in 2016. Much of it bears the former president's imprint: aggressive tweets, false denials, coordination with a tabloid publisher and more.\nThe judge's ruling showed how the weapons that worked so well for Mr. Trump then are being turned against him in the courtroom now.\nThe techniques prosecutors highlighted Monday were not invented by Mr. Trump for use in his campaign; they are behaviors he exhibited throughout his life as a businessman and a reality-television star. But in modern American political history, such raw tactics had rarely been seen at such a high level.\nOne example is Mr. Trump's relationship with The National Enquirer tabloid and its publisher, David Pecker, who is expected to appear as a witness.\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case, obtained permission from the judge on Monday to introduce evidence related to a 2015 meeting among Mr. Trump, Mr. Pecker and Mr. Trump's former fixer, Michael D. Cohen. A prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, said on Monday that the three men had 'conspired to influence the 2016 election.'\nThat meeting laid the groundwork for hush-money deals with a porn star, Stormy Daniels, and a Playboy model, Karen McDougal. But another result of that meeting, Mr. Steinglass said, were explosive headlines about Mr. Trump's opponents in the Republican primary, including those claiming that Ben Carson had committed 'medical malpractice' and that Senator Ted Cruz had a 'family connection to J.F.K.'s assassin.'\nA lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, protested the admission of evidence related to that meeting, saying that newspaper publishers met with candidates 'all the time,' and that there was nothing improper about it, let alone illegal.\nThat admission worked against him. The judge, Juan M. Merchan, said that he was glad that Mr. Blanche believed that there was nothing wrong with the meeting \u2014 because it meant that he should not mind that the evidence would be introduced.\n'There is no reason not to allow it in,' Justice Merchan said.\nMr. Steinglass won again when he persuaded Justice Merchan to admit evidence of the Trump campaign in crisis after the publication in 2016 of the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump boasted about grabbing women by their genitals.\n'The video sent the campaign into a tailspin,' Mr. Steinglass said.\nHe offered up an email sent by a Washington Post reporter to Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump's campaign spokeswoman. Mr. Steinglass said that Ms. Hicks had forwarded the exchange to Stephen K. Bannon, Kellyanne Conway and other members of the campaign team, 'suggesting that their response should be to deny, deny, deny.' Eventually, he said, Mr. Bannon sent it to Mr. Cohen.\nMr. Blanche again protested, but was again rebuffed. The judge said he would allow jurors to see the email, saying that the ensuing thread was relevant.\nThe exchanges that prosecutors and defense lawyers debated on Monday underscored Mr. Trump's penchant for delegating dirty work to others, giving himself some distance in the process.\nThe hush-money deals worked that way: Mr. Cohen paid off Ms. Daniels, while The National Enquirer bought Ms. McDougal's silence. (Mr. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to his reimbursement of Mr. Cohen.)\nThat habit is still on display this year, and can be helpful given that Justice Merchan has barred Mr. Trump from attacking witnesses, prosecutors and the judge's own family.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Trump posted on social media a video of Laura Loomer, a political ally, in the park outside the courthouse. Ms. Loomer, speaking into a bullhorn, insinuated that the judge's family was politically compromised.\nHad Mr. Trump said that himself, he would have risked violating the judge's gag order.\nApril 16, 2024, 10:51 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 10:51 a.m. ET Kate Christobek\nKate Christobek Reporting from the courthouse Jury selection has been a slow and slogging exercise but there are occasional moments of levity.

Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab New York City courtroom as Mr. Trump looked on.\nBefore jury selection began, the judge, Juan M. Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, rejected another effort to force his recusal by the defense, which cited several issues, including his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant.\nHe also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost.\nBut Mr. Trump's lawyers did persuade Justice Merchan that mentioning sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump was recorded bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial.\nEntering the courtroom Monday, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here,' but he looked less enthusiastic in front of Justice Merchan. He quietly slouched and scowled \u2014 and at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep.\nBy afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into the courtroom. Some quickly left: When the judge asked the first group of 96 if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused.\nThe remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT The jury selection process in Donald J.

Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate.\nThe potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair.\nThe process could take two weeks or more \u2014 and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court.\n'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.'\nThe stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County \u2014 Manhattan, as most people know it \u2014 which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020.\nMr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions.\nMr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated.\nProsecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28.\nUnlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.'\nSome may not be completely forthcoming.\n'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said.\nMr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors.\n'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Not since Eugene V. Debs campaigned from a prison cell more than a century ago has the United States experienced what might now happen: a prominent candidate with a felony conviction running for president. And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning.\nFormer President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases: two federal, one in New York and another in Georgia. The first of those to go to trial is the sex scandal cover-up in New York, where jury selection began on Monday.\nFor now, he faces no formal campaign restrictions, beyond having to be present in a courtroom, and he remains highly competitive in polls. But some of the cases are proceeding at a pace that could bring verdicts before the election \u2014 and the Constitution and American law have clear answers for only some of the questions that will arise if he is convicted.\nOthers would bring the country into truly uncharted territory, with huge decisions resting in the hands of federal judges.\nHere is what we know, and what we don't know.\nThis is the simplest question of the bunch. The answer is yes.\nThe Constitution sets very few eligibility requirements for presidents. They must be at least 35 years old, be 'natural born' citizens and have lived in the United States for at least 14 years.\nThere are no limitations based on character or criminal record. While some states prohibit felons from running for state and local office, these laws do not apply to federal offices.\nThe Republican and Democratic Parties have guaranteed spots on general-election ballots in every state, and the parties tell election officials whose name to put in their spot. States could, in theory, try to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on legally shaky ground.\n'We let states set the time, place and manner' of elections, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who specializes in election law, 'but I think the best reading of our Constitution is you don't let the state add new substantive requirements.'\nWhile that view is not universal among legal experts, it prevailed in court in 2019, after California passed a law requiring candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on primary ballots. A federal district judge blocked the law from taking effect, saying it was most likely unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court also unanimously blocked it as a violation of the state constitution, and the case never reached the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that states could not keep Mr. Trump off their ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies people who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' after taking an oath to support the Constitution.\nNumerous lawsuits had argued that Mr. Trump's actions before and on Jan. 6, 2021, met this bar. In December, the Colorado Supreme Court found him ineligible, and Maine's secretary of state did the same. But the Supreme Court \u2014 led by a conservative supermajority, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump himself \u2014 concluded that only Congress had the power to enforce Section 3 against candidates for federal office. (Four of the justices, including the three liberals, wanted to allow a wider range of options for disqualification.)\nCongress is not going to do that with Republicans in control of the House. And the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal cases, meaning convictions would not disqualify Mr. Trump either.\nCongress can designate either groups of people to whom Section 3 applies (such as people who fought for the Confederacy) or specific crimes that, upon conviction, would trigger disqualification, said Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University. But none of the crimes Mr. Trump is charged with carry that automatic penalty.\n'Whether or not Trump is tried, convicted, acquitted, that's a separate question from whether or not he's disqualified,' said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nOne of the charges in the federal case related to Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election \u2014 conspiracy to violate civil rights \u2014 once carried a disqualification penalty, Mr. Kreis said, but Congress removed it decades ago.\nNow that Mr. Trump has secured a majority of delegates to the Republican convention, the party has no mechanism to nominate somebody else. Under the party's official convention rules, if a delegate tries to support someone other than the person the primary results bound them to, 'such support shall not be recognized.'\nNor have top Republicans shown any interest in another nominee.\nIf he were forced to withdraw from the race after the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him.\nafter the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him. Probably not.\nMr. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, and he would be disenfranchised there if convicted of a felony.\nMost felons in Florida regain voting rights after completing their full sentence, including parole or probation, and paying all fines and fees. But it is highly unlikely that Mr. Trump, if convicted, would have time to complete his sentence before Election Day.\nHe could also petition for clemency, which would require the approval of the governor \u2014 Ron DeSantis, who ran against Mr. Trump in the Republican primary \u2014 and two Florida cabinet members. Chris Taylor, the director of external affairs for the Florida Commission on Offender Review, confirmed that a Florida resident convicted of a felony could apply to have their voting rights restored through that process even if their conviction happened outside Florida.\nSince Mr. Trump also has a residence in New York, he could switch his voter registration there to take advantage of its more permissive approach: Felons in New York can vote while on parole or probation. But, as in Florida and almost every other state, they are still disenfranchised while in prison.\nSo if Mr. Trump is imprisoned, he could be in the extraordinary position of being deemed fit to be voted for, but unfit to vote.\nNo one knows.\n'We're so far removed from anything that's ever happened,' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley. 'It's just guessing.'\nLegally, Mr. Trump would remain eligible to be president even if he were imprisoned. The Constitution says nothing to the contrary. 'I don't think that the framers ever thought we were going to be in this situation,' Professor Levinson said.\nIn practice, the election of an incarcerated president would create a legal crisis that would almost certainly need to be resolved by the courts.\nIn theory, Mr. Trump could be stripped of his authority under the 25th Amendment, which provides a process to transfer authority to the vice president if the president is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' But that would require the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare Mr. Trump unable to fulfill his duties, a remote prospect given that these would be loyalists appointed by Mr. Trump himself.\nMore likely, Mr. Trump could sue to be released on the basis that his imprisonment was preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional obligations as president. Such a case would probably focus on the separation of powers, with Mr. Trump's lawyers arguing that keeping a duly elected president in prison would be an infringement by the judicial branch on the operations of the executive branch.\nOn the federal charges only, he could also try to pardon himself \u2014 or to commute his sentence, leaving his conviction in place but ending his imprisonment. Either action would be an extraordinary assertion of presidential power, and the Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of whether a 'self pardon' was constitutional.\nOr President Biden, on his way out the door, could pardon Mr. Trump on the basis that 'the people have spoken and I need to pardon him so he can govern,' Professor Chemerinsky said.\nBut that wouldn't apply to the New York or Georgia cases, because the president does not have pardon power for state charges.\nAgain, no one knows, particularly when it comes to the New York and Georgia cases.\nIn the two federal cases, a likely outcome would be that a Trump-appointed attorney general would withdraw the charges.\nThe Justice Department does not indict sitting presidents, a policy outlined in a 1973 memo, during the Nixon era. It has never had reason to develop a policy on what to do with an incoming president who has already been indicted. But the rationale for not indicting sitting presidents \u2014 that it would interfere with their ability to perform their duties \u2014 applies just as well in this hypothetical scenario.\n'The reasons why we wouldn't want to indict a sitting president are the reasons we wouldn't want to prosecute a sitting president,' said Professor Chemerinsky, who has disagreed with the department's reasoning. 'My guess is, if the Trump prosecution were still ongoing in some way and Trump were elected, the Justice Department \u2014 which would be the Trump Justice Department \u2014 would say, \u2018We're following the 1973 memo.''\nLike so much else here, this would be legally untested, and it is impossible to say what the Supreme Court would do if the question reached it.\nIn its Clinton v. Jones ruling in 1997, the court allowed a lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed. But that case was civil, not criminal, and it was filed by a private citizen, not by the government itself.\nCharlie Savage contributed reporting.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Kate Christobek","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/16/multimedia/16trump-trial-anonymity-bhwz/16trump-trial-anonymity-bhwz-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":2.3575811,"_id":"da12eb2a2f029a71a2d2d3c1ad6a0348"},{"title":"The prosecution of a police officer, Joseph Fischer, led to this hearing.","author":"Alan Feuer","published_date":"2024-04-16 13:20:05","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/16/us/supreme-court-jan-6/the-prosecution-of-a-police-officer-joseph-fischer-led-to-this-hearing","clean_url":"nytimes.com","excerpt":"Skip to contentSkip to site indexThe Supreme Court will hear arguments on Tuesday in a case","summary":"Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index The Supreme Court will hear arguments on Tuesday in a case that could eliminate some of the federal charges against former President Donald J. Trump in the case accusing him of plotting to subvert the 2020 election and could disrupt the prosecutions of hundreds of rioters involved in the Capitol attack. The question the justices will consider is whether a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, enacted in the wake of the collapse of the energy giant Enron, covers the conduct of a former police officer, Joseph W. Fischer, who participated in the Capitol assault, on Jan. 6, 2021. The law figures in two of the federal charges against Mr. Trump in his election subversion case and more than 350 people who stormed the Capitol have been prosecuted under it. If the Supreme Court sides with Mr. Fischer and says the statute does not cover what he is accused of having done, Mr. Trump is almost certain to contend that it does not apply to his conduct, either. The law, signed in 2002, was prompted by accounting fraud and the destruction of documents, but the provision is written in broad terms. At least part of what the law meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code: It was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself. The law sought to close that gap. It did that in a two-part provision. The first part makes it a crime to corruptly alter, destroy or conceal evidence to frustrate official proceedings. The second part, at issue in Mr. Fischer's case, makes it a crime 'otherwise' to corruptly obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding. Here's what else to know: The heart of the case is at the pivot from the first part of the provision to the second. The ordinary meaning of 'otherwise,' prosecutors say, is 'in a different manner.' That means, they say, that the obstruction of official proceedings need not involve the destruction of evidence. The second part, they say, is broad catchall applying to all sorts of conduct. Mr. Fischer's lawyers counter that the first part of the provision must inform and limit the second one \u2014 to obstruction linked to the destruction of evidence. They would read 'otherwise,' in other words, as 'similarly.' The case is one of several affecting or involving Mr. Trump on the court's docket. In a separate case to be argued next week, the justices will consider Mr. Trump's claim that he is totally immune from prosecution.\nMr. Fischer is accused of entering the Capitol around 3:24 p.m. on Jan. 6, 2021, with the counting of electoral ballots having been suspended after the initial assault. Before his trip to Washington, prosecutors said he told a superior in a text message, that 'it might get violent.' In another, he wrote that 'they should storm the capital and drag all the democrates into the street and have a mob trial.' Prosecutors say that videos showed Mr. Fischer yelling 'Charge!' before pushing through the crowd, using a vulgar term to berate police officers and crashing into a line of them.\nMr. Fischer's lawyers dispute some of this. But the question for the justices is legal, not factual: Does the 2002 law cover what Mr. Fischer is accused of? That may turn in part on the meaning of another term in the law \u2014 its requirement that the defendant acted 'corruptly.' The meaning of that word is disputed. Two of the four criminal counts former President Donald J. Trump is facing in that case are based on the obstruction law. Credit... Michelle Gustafson for The New York Times While the Supreme Court's hearing is intended to determine the scope and validity of an obstruction law used against hundreds of rioters who broke into the Capitol on Jan. 6, any decision could also have an impact on a separate criminal case: one in which former President Donald J. Trump has been accused of plotting to overturn the 2020 election. Two of the four criminal counts Mr. Trump is facing in that case are based on the obstruction law. In an indictment filed in Washington last summer, he was charged with conspiring to obstruct the certification of the election on Jan. 6 during a joint session of Congress at the Capitol as well as with actually obstructing it. If the justices determine that prosecutors improperly used the obstruction law against members of the pro-Trump mob who disrupted the session, Mr. Trump's lawyers will surely seek to have the charges against him dismissed as well. In fact, they already tried that in October. They argued unsuccessfully to the trial judge in the case that Mr. Trump's indictment unfairly used the statute, which was initially 'directed at the destruction of records in accounting fraud,' by applying it 'to disputing the outcome of a presidential election.' 'This stretches the statutory language beyond any plausible mooring to its text,' the lawyers wrote. Jack Smith, the special counsel handling Mr. Trump's case, has told the Supreme Court that the two obstruction counts against the former president would be still valid even if the justices narrowed the law to cover only crimes that involved tampering with documents or records. Mr. Trump triggered that provision of the law, Mr. Smith has said, by plotting to create fake slates of electors that claimed he won in several keys swing states that he actually lost to President Biden. Mr. Smith has accused Mr. Trump of trying to use those fake slates to throw the certification proceeding into chaos and by urging his vice president, Mike Pence, to capitalize on the confusion by single-handedly declaring him the winner of the race. Even if the obstruction count were ultimately removed from Trump's indictment, it would probably not be a fatal blow. The indictment contains two other conspiracy counts that overlap almost entirely with the accusations in the obstruction counts. One of the conspiracy charges accuses Mr. Trump of committing fraud by using deceit to subvert the normal course of the election. The other charges him with plotting to deprive millions of Americans of the right to have votes properly counted.  April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET A little backstory on why prosecutors opted to charge so many defendants with obstruction: Michael Sherwin, the U.S. attorney in Washington who initially led the Jan. 6 prosecution, promised 'shock and awe' in charging as many people as possible. But using overtly political crimes like insurrection or seditious conspiracy turned out not to be legally feasible. The government settled on using the obstruction count to describe how the election's certification proceeding was disrupted by defendants who went beyond mere trespass or assault. April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET Prosecutors tried to set general rules for who was charged with the obstruction count. It was often used if a defendant actually entered the Senate chamber or made their way into congressional offices. It was also used if there was evidence that a defendant's behavior had some sort of role in chasing lawmakers away from their sworn duties to certify the election on Jan. 6. April 16, 2024, 9:54 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:54 a.m. ET Of course, one of the biggest attractions of this obstruction count to prosecutors is that it carries a hefty 20-year maximum sentence. No defendant has been sentenced to that maximum yet, but the stiff penalty likely has some sort of deterrent effect on others. April 16, 2024, 9:48 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:48 a.m. ET The argument is likely to be focused on the text and purpose of the obstruction law at issue in the case. Expect close examination, for instance, of the meaning of the word 'otherwise.' More than 1,380 people had been charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol as of early this month, according to the Justice Department. Credit... Hailey Sadler for The New York Times The investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack is already the largest criminal inquiry in Justice Department history, federal prosecutors have said. And even after more than three years, it has shown little sign of slowing down. Every week, a few more rioters are arrested and charges against them are unsealed in Federal District Court in Washington. Prosecutors have suggested that a total of 2,000 or 2,500 people could ultimately face indictment for their roles in the attack. More than 1,380 people had been charged in connection with the attack as of early this month, according to the Justice Department. Among the most common charges brought against them are two misdemeanors: illegal parading inside the Capitol and entering and remaining in a restricted federal area, a type of trespassing. About 350 rioters have been accused of violating the obstruction statute that the Supreme Court is considering at its hearing, and nearly 500 people have been charged with assaulting police officers. Many rioters have been charged with multiple crimes, the most serious of which so far has been seditious conspiracy. Almost 800 defendants have already pleaded guilty; about 250 of them have done so to felony charges. Prosecutors have won the vast majority of the cases that have gone to trial: More than 150 defendants have been convicted at trial and only two have been fully acquitted. More than 850 people have been sentenced so far, and about 520 have received at least some time in prison. The stiffest penalties have been handed down to the former leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, far-right extremist groups that played central roles in the Capitol attack. Enrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys leader, was sentenced to 22 years in prison, and Stewart Rhodes, who once led the Oath Keepers, was given an 18-year term.  April 16, 2024, 9:36 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:36 a.m. ET All along the defense lawyers have claimed that federal prosecutors stretched the statute in an unprecedented way to fit the central crime that took place at the Capitol on Jan. 6: the disruption of the certification of the election. Then again, nothing like the storming of the Capitol had ever happened before. So perhaps it's no surprise that prosecutors use the obstruction law in a novel manner. April 16, 2024, 9:31 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:31 a.m. ET It's worth remembering as today's hearing is poised to get underway that lawyers defending Jan. 6 rioters have been questioning the government's use of this particular obstruction law from the very outset of criminal cases being filed by the Justice Department. It's taken three years, but now the issue has finally reached the Supreme Court. April 16, 2024, 9:26 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:26 a.m. ET The argument will not start promptly at 10:00 a.m. The court has said it will issue one or more decisions first. They will be announced from the bench but will not be broadcast. A mob walked to the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times The man whose case led to the Supreme Court hearing on a controversial federal obstruction law is a former police officer from rural Pennsylvania indicted on charges of storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and crashing into a line of his fellow officers defending the building. Joseph W. Fischer was working for the police department in North Cornwall Township, Pa., when prosecutors say he pushed his way into the Capitol while holding up his cellphone to take videos of the surge. Once inside, he and another rioter 'galloped forward,' prosecutors say, making contact with a line of officers who were fighting off the crowd. Mr. Fischer fell to the ground and, as some nearby officers helped him to his feet, he tried to engage with them, prosecutors say. 'I'm a cop too,' he said, 'sometimes the country is worth more than your job.' According to court papers, Mr. Fischer was concerned about his own job before making the trip to Washington. Investigators unearthed text messages he wrote to the chief of his department, saying that things could get 'violent' on Jan. 6 and that the crowd should 'storm the capital and drag all the democrates.' He also warned the chief that he might need him to post his bail, the papers said. Township officials suspended Mr. Fischer without pay on the day of his arrest in February 2021 and later fired him. But he has pushed back against the government's description of behavior on Jan. 6. His lawyers say that he and a companion were prepared to leave Washington that day after listening President Trump's speech near the White House and turned around to head toward the Capitol only after hearing about the mounting protest there. The lawyers also claim that Mr. Fischer arrived at the Capitol grounds well after Congress had recessed the proceeding to certify the results of the 2020 election because of the attack. 'As Mr. Fischer walked toward the east side of the building, no barricades or fences impeded him,' the lawyers wrote in their brief to the Supreme Court. Mr. Fischer has disputed the assertion by prosecutors that he charged the police line inside the Capitol, telling the court instead that he was pushed into the officers by 'the weight of the crowd.' He also characterized his interactions with the officers differently than prosecutors did, claiming that he merely talked with one of the officers and patted him on the shoulder.  The Supreme Court has said that the purpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was 'to safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets following the collapse of Enron.' Credit...The provision at issue in the case is part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a 2002 law enacted after the collapse of Enron, a giant energy company, after the exposure of widespread accounting fraud and the destruction of documents by its outside auditor, Arthur Andersen. The Supreme Court has said that the purpose of the law was 'to safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets following the collapse of Enron.' At least part of what the law meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code: it was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was meant to close that gap. Lawyers for Joseph W. Fischer, charged under the law with obstructing an official proceeding by joining the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, said his case had an Alice-in-Wonderland quality. 'The Through the Looking Glass moment here,' they wrote in a Supreme Court brief, 'would be for those who wrote the Sarbanes-Oxley Act upon learning that they had created a new and breathtaking obstruction offense by endeavoring to close the narrow Enron-Arthur Anderson loophole.' Indeed, in a different case on the scope of the statute, one of the sponsors of the law, Michael Oxley, filed a supporting brief saying prosecutors had interpreted it too broadly. The law meant to address 'specific loopholes' that Arthur Andersen 'had exploited when they shredded business documents and destroyed hard drives in anticipation of federal law-enforcement action,' wrote Mr. Oxley, a former Ohio representative who died in 2016. In that case, concerning a separate provision of the law, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the law's origins informed its meaning and spared the defendant. 'The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, all agree, was prompted by the exposure of Enron's massive accounting fraud and revelations that the company's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen, had systematically destroyed potentially incriminating documents,' she wrote for four of the justices in the majority. She added that the government had acknowledged that the provision 'was intended to prohibit, in particular, corporate document-shredding to hide evidence of financial wrongdoing.'

Erin Schaff/The New York Times The Supreme Court's decision to consider the soundness of an obstruction law that has been widely used against those who took part in the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, is already having an effect on some of the rioters. A small group of people convicted under the law have been released from custody \u2014 or will soon go free \u2014 even though the justices hearing arguments on Tuesday are not expected to decide the case for months. Over the past several weeks, federal judges in Washington have agreed to release about 10 defendants who were serving prison terms because of the obstruction law, saying the defendants could wait at home as the court determined whether the law should have been used at all to keep them locked up. Among those already free is Matthew Bledsoe, the owner of a moving company from Tennessee who scaled a wall outside the Capitol and then paraded through the building with a Trump flag, ultimately planting it in the arm of a statue of President Gerald R. Ford. Soon to be released are defendants like Kevin Seefried, a drywall installer from Delaware who carried a Confederate flag through the Capitol, and Alexander Sheppard, an Ohio man who overran police lines to become one of the first people to break into the building. The interrupted sentences \u2014 which could be reinstated depending on how the Supreme Court rules \u2014 are just one of the complications to have emerged from the court's review of the obstruction statute, known in the penal code as 18 U.S.C. 1512. The charge has been used so far against more than 350 rioters, including Jacob Chansley, the so-called QAnon Shaman, and members of the far-right extremist groups the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. When the justices announced in December that they planned to scrutinize the law, many legal experts expressed concern that a ruling narrowing its scope or striking down its use in Jan. 6-related cases could deliver a devastating blow to the Justice Department's efforts to hold hundreds of rioters accountable. Federal prosecutors have often used the obstruction count in lieu of more politically fraught charges like seditious conspiracy to punish the central event of Jan. 6: the disruption of a proceeding at the Capitol to certify the election. But in the past few months, judges and prosecutors working on Capitol riot cases have quietly adjusted to the potential threat from a Supreme Court ruling, and the risk that there could be catastrophic consequences to the cases overall no longer seems as grave. For one thing, there are currently no defendants facing only the obstruction charge, according to the Justice Department. Every rioter indicted on that count has also been charged with other crimes, meaning that even if the obstruction law is removed as a tool of the Jan. 6 prosecutions, there would not be any cases that would disappear entirely. Indeed, if the court rules that the obstruction count does not apply to the Capitol attack, the main effect of the decision would be on the sentences defendants face. The obstruction law carries a hefty maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and while few, if any, rioters have gotten that much, the statute has routinely resulted in terms of several years. But some judges have already signaled they would increase the sentences stemming from other charges if the obstruction count was not available to them. In February, for example, Judge Royce C. Lamberth denied an early release to an Iowa man named Leo Kelly, who was sentenced to 30 months in prison on the obstruction count and six other misdemeanors. Judge Lamberth's reason for not setting Mr. Kelly free? Even if the Supreme Court ruled he was not permitted to sentence Mr. Kelly for obstruction, Judge Lamberth said he could increase the defendant's total time in prison by imposing consecutive, not concurrent, terms on the misdemeanor charges.  \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments on Tuesday in a case that could eliminate some of the federal charges against former President Donald J.

Prosecutors have won the vast majority of the cases that have gone to trial: More than 150 defendants have been convicted at trial and only two have been fully acquitted.\nMore than 850 people have been sentenced so far, and about 520 have received at least some time in prison. The stiffest penalties have been handed down to the former leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, far-right extremist groups that played central roles in the Capitol attack.\nEnrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys leader, was sentenced to 22 years in prison, and Stewart Rhodes, who once led the Oath Keepers, was given an 18-year term.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 16, 2024, 9:36 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:36 a.m. ET All along the defense lawyers have claimed that federal prosecutors stretched the statute in an unprecedented way to fit the central crime that took place at the Capitol on Jan. 6: the disruption of the certification of the election. Then again, nothing like the storming of the Capitol had ever happened before. So perhaps it's no surprise that prosecutors use the obstruction law in a novel manner.\nApril 16, 2024, 9:31 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:31 a.m. ET It's worth remembering as today's hearing is poised to get underway that lawyers defending Jan. 6 rioters have been questioning the government's use of this particular obstruction law from the very outset of criminal cases being filed by the Justice Department. It's taken three years, but now the issue has finally reached the Supreme Court.\nApril 16, 2024, 9:26 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:26 a.m. ET The argument will not start promptly at 10:00 a.m. The court has said it will issue one or more decisions first.

A mob walked to the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times The man whose case led to the Supreme Court hearing on a controversial federal obstruction law is a former police officer from rural Pennsylvania indicted on charges of storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and crashing into a line of his fellow officers defending the building.\nJoseph W. Fischer was working for the police department in North Cornwall Township, Pa., when prosecutors say he pushed his way into the Capitol while holding up his cellphone to take videos of the surge. Once inside, he and another rioter 'galloped forward,' prosecutors say, making contact with a line of officers who were fighting off the crowd.\nMr. Fischer fell to the ground and, as some nearby officers helped him to his feet, he tried to engage with them, prosecutors say.\n'I'm a cop too,' he said, 'sometimes the country is worth more than your job.'\nAccording to court papers, Mr. Fischer was concerned about his own job before making the trip to Washington. Investigators unearthed text messages he wrote to the chief of his department, saying that things could get 'violent' on Jan. 6 and that the crowd should 'storm the capital and drag all the democrates.'\nHe also warned the chief that he might need him to post his bail, the papers said.\nTownship officials suspended Mr. Fischer without pay on the day of his arrest in February 2021 and later fired him. But he has pushed back against the government's description of behavior on Jan. 6.\nHis lawyers say that he and a companion were prepared to leave Washington that day after listening President Trump's speech near the White House and turned around to head toward the Capitol only after hearing about the mounting protest there. The lawyers also claim that Mr. Fischer arrived at the Capitol grounds well after Congress had recessed the proceeding to certify the results of the 2020 election because of the attack.\n'As Mr. Fischer walked toward the east side of the building, no barricades or fences impeded him,' the lawyers wrote in their brief to the Supreme Court.\nMr. Fischer has disputed the assertion by prosecutors that he charged the police line inside the Capitol, telling the court instead that he was pushed into the officers by 'the weight of the crowd.'\nHe also characterized his interactions with the officers differently than prosecutors did, claiming that he merely talked with one of the officers and patted him on the shoulder.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT The Supreme Court has said that the purpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was 'to safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets following the collapse of Enron.' Credit...The provision at issue in the case is part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a 2002 law enacted after the collapse of Enron, a giant energy company, after the exposure of widespread accounting fraud and the destruction of documents by its outside auditor, Arthur Andersen.\nThe Supreme Court has said that the purpose of the law was 'to safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets following the collapse of Enron.'\nAt least part of what the law meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code: it was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was meant to close that gap.\nLawyers for Joseph W. Fischer, charged under the law with obstructing an official proceeding by joining the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, said his case had an Alice-in-Wonderland quality.\n'The Through the Looking Glass moment here,' they wrote in a Supreme Court brief, 'would be for those who wrote the Sarbanes-Oxley Act upon learning that they had created a new and breathtaking obstruction offense by endeavoring to close the narrow Enron-Arthur Anderson loophole.'\nIndeed, in a different case on the scope of the statute, one of the sponsors of the law, Michael Oxley, filed a supporting brief saying prosecutors had interpreted it too broadly. The law meant to address 'specific loopholes' that Arthur Andersen 'had exploited when they shredded business documents and destroyed hard drives in anticipation of federal law-enforcement action,' wrote Mr. Oxley, a former Ohio representative who died in 2016.\nIn that case, concerning a separate provision of the law, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the law's origins informed its meaning and spared the defendant.\n'The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, all agree, was prompted by the exposure of Enron's massive accounting fraud and revelations that the company's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen, had systematically destroyed potentially incriminating documents,' she wrote for four of the justices in the majority. She added that the government had acknowledged that the provision 'was intended to prohibit, in particular, corporate document-shredding to hide evidence of financial wrongdoing.'\nA correction was made on : An earlier version of this article misstated the year of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. It was 2021, not 2001.\nHow we handle corrections\nKevin Seefried is among a small group of people convicted under an obstruction law to be released from custody or soon to go free. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times The Supreme Court's decision to consider the soundness of an obstruction law that has been widely used against those who took part in the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, is already having an effect on some of the rioters.\nA small group of people convicted under the law have been released from custody \u2014 or will soon go free \u2014 even though the justices hearing arguments on Tuesday are not expected to decide the case for months.\nOver the past several weeks, federal judges in Washington have agreed to release about 10 defendants who were serving prison terms because of the obstruction law, saying the defendants could wait at home as the court determined whether the law should have been used at all to keep them locked up.\nAmong those already free is Matthew Bledsoe, the owner of a moving company from Tennessee who scaled a wall outside the Capitol and then paraded through the building with a Trump flag, ultimately planting it in the arm of a statue of President Gerald R. Ford.\nSoon to be released are defendants like Kevin Seefried, a drywall installer from Delaware who carried a Confederate flag through the Capitol, and Alexander Sheppard, an Ohio man who overran police lines to become one of the first people to break into the building.\nThe interrupted sentences \u2014 which could be reinstated depending on how the Supreme Court rules \u2014 are just one of the complications to have emerged from the court's review of the obstruction statute, known in the penal code as 18 U.S.C. 1512. The charge has been used so far against more than 350 rioters, including Jacob Chansley, the so-called QAnon Shaman, and members of the far-right extremist groups the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers.\nWhen the justices announced in December that they planned to scrutinize the law, many legal experts expressed concern that a ruling narrowing its scope or striking down its use in Jan. 6-related cases could deliver a devastating blow to the Justice Department's efforts to hold hundreds of rioters accountable.\nFederal prosecutors have often used the obstruction count in lieu of more politically fraught charges like seditious conspiracy to punish the central event of Jan. 6: the disruption of a proceeding at the Capitol to certify the election.\nBut in the past few months, judges and prosecutors working on Capitol riot cases have quietly adjusted to the potential threat from a Supreme Court ruling, and the risk that there could be catastrophic consequences to the cases overall no longer seems as grave.\nFor one thing, there are currently no defendants facing only the obstruction charge, according to the Justice Department. Every rioter indicted on that count has also been charged with other crimes, meaning that even if the obstruction law is removed as a tool of the Jan. 6 prosecutions, there would not be any cases that would disappear entirely.\nIndeed, if the court rules that the obstruction count does not apply to the Capitol attack, the main effect of the decision would be on the sentences defendants face. The obstruction law carries a hefty maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and while few, if any, rioters have gotten that much, the statute has routinely resulted in terms of several years.\nBut some judges have already signaled they would increase the sentences stemming from other charges if the obstruction count was not available to them.\nIn February, for example, Judge Royce C. Lamberth denied an early release to an Iowa man named Leo Kelly, who was sentenced to 30 months in prison on the obstruction count and six other misdemeanors.\nJudge Lamberth's reason for not setting Mr. Kelly free?\nEven if the Supreme Court ruled he was not permitted to sentence Mr. Kelly for obstruction, Judge Lamberth said he could increase the defendant's total time in prison by imposing consecutive, not concurrent, terms on the misdemeanor charges.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Alan Feuer","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/16/multimedia/16scotus-obstruction-fischer-btwg/16scotus-obstruction-fischer-btwg-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":2.128271,"_id":"8d8bb2e14e4c5c163e8695d238871935"},{"title":"Here's what to know about the trial.","author":"Jonah E.

Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab courtroom in New York City while Mr. Trump looked on. Mr. Trump was charged in Manhattan, a deeply Democratic county and his former home, with falsifying nearly three dozen business records in an attempt to cover up a payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, who has said she had a brief sexual encounter with him in 2006. Mr. Trump denies that encounter happened, and has declared his innocence, calling the charges politically motivated. He has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a Democrat, who also attended the first day of trial on Monday. Mr. Trump faces 34 felony counts and could face probation or up to four years of prison time. The trial, which is expected to last weeks, has a fascinating list of potential witnesses: Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer turned apostate, who made the payment; Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who says she, too, had an affair with Mr. Trump; and Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels herself may testify. Before any of that happens, a jury must be selected, a winnowing that began Monday. Here are five takeaways from Mr. Trump's first day on trial: Justice Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, has been consistent about batting back defense motions on issues including the tardy disclosure of documents by prosecutors and efforts to delay or even dismiss the case. That pattern continued on Monday, as Justice Merchan rejected a defense effort to force his recusal. The defense had cited several issues, including the fact that his daughter is a Democratic political consultant. He also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost. But Mr. Trump's lawyers convinced Justice Merchan that sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the so-called Access Hollywood tape, in which Mr. Trump was caught bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial, calling them 'complete rumors, complete gossip, completely hearsay.' Justice Merchan's decisions on Monday made it clear that the trial will resurface unsavory events in the former president's life. Those include the Access Hollywood tape and other stories that Mr. Trump sought to suppress including an alleged affair with Ms. McDougal. Justice Merchan said on Monday that both could be discussed. In a minor victory for the defense, the judge reaffirmed that the 'Access Hollywood' tape itself could not be played, but that Trump's exact words could be entered into the record. Still, most of Mr. Merchan's rulings indicated that salacious details of Mr. Trump's biography will be heard in court. Entering the courtroom, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here.' Once he was in front of Mr. Merchan, Mr. Trump looked a lot less enthusiastic. He slouched. He scowled. He scoffed. And he was quiet, not the norm for a man who built a political career with his gift for slashing attacks and vicious put-downs. In court, the former president spoke only briefly, when asked a few questions by Justice Merchan about procedural matters, and whether he understood the consequences \u2014 ejection or jail \u2014 if he interrupted proceedings. He did whisper with his lawyers. And when the prosecution played a recording of him claiming to have great respect for women, he mouthed the word 'true.' But all in all, it seems it could be an exhausting experience for Mr. Trump; at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep. It's easy to forget how long it takes to do a little in legal settings. On Monday, the morning session was dominated by maneuvering by prosecutors and the defense, even as prospective jurors waited. By lunch, they were still waiting. Jury selection could take days or weeks, and the trial itself may take two months. The Passover holiday could cause delays, Justice Merchan said, though he might make some of that up by holding hearings on court matters on Wednesdays, which was previously going to be an off day. By afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into Justice Merchan's courtroom. He warmly welcomed them, introduced the lawyers and Mr. Trump and read them a summary of the case. Justice Merchan asked if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president. Of the 96 prospective jurors in the room at that time, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused. The remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial. April 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET Trump spoke briefly to TV cameras after court adjourned for the day, repeating his longstanding claims that the trial is a 'political witch hunt' before heading to his motorcade and departing the courthouse. Video Reporter: [inaudible] the trial \u2014 [inaudible] So thank you very much. We had some amazing things happen today. As you know, my son is graduating from high school and it looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation of my son, who's worked very, very hard. He's a great student and he's very proud of the fact that he did so well. And was looking forward for years to have his graduation with his mother and father there. And it looks like the judges isn't going to allow me to escape this scam. It's a scam trial. If you read all of the legal pundits, all of the legal scholars today, there's not one that I see that said, this is a case that should be brought or tried. It's a scam. It's a political witch hunt.

DavidAs former President Donald J. Trump's first criminal trial began inside a Manhattan courthouse on Monday, the scene outside had elements of a feisty political skirmish and a surreal circus rolled into one. The streets below the courtroom drew a mix of gawkers, activists and publicity hounds, along with a large contingent of journalists. Laura Loomer, a right-wing activist known for her aggressive tactics and closeness with Mr. Trump, led a chant of 'Donald Trump Did Nothing Wrong!' alongside Andrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and Trump lawyer. 'We're going to be here every single day talking to all you fake-news media freaks,' Ms. Loomer said through a Harvey Milk-style bullhorn in a video she posted on social media. 'And letting you know that Donald Trump did nothing wrong until you start reporting the truth.' Ms. Loomer described the case as a 'witch hunt' \u2014 a frequent assertion of Mr. Trump's \u2014 and criticized a key witness for the prosecution, Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, and the wife of the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan. Mr. Trump promptly reposted the video on Truth Social \u2014 despite a gag order that bars him from attacking witnesses in the case or Justice Merchan's family. His post, made during the lunch break, came shortly before Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month on prosecutors' request that Mr. Trump be held in contempt of court over statements they say violate the order. Performance artists also vied for attention. One, known as Crackhead Barney, stood screaming outside the gates surrounding Collect Pond Park that she had been kicked out, and demanded police officers' badge numbers. Another played the flute atop a park bench, notes drifting through the wind and his instrument glinting in the sunlight. Some anti-Trump demonstrators held handmade signs emblazoned with 'Loser' and 'Convict Trump Already,' while others tried to confront Ms. Loomer. One, Sue Scarlett Montgomery, asked reporters why they were paying attention to Ms. Loomer, a former Republican candidate for Congress who previously visited a treacherous migrant crossing in Panama as part of her anti-Muslim activism. 'They're covering me because I broke the story about this corrupt judge here,' Ms. Loomer shot back, attacking Judge Merchan's daughter, a Democratic political consultant who has also been a target of Mr. Trump.

Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Everyone expected that picking a jury to try a polarizing figure like former President Donald J. Trump was going to be a challenge. But the experience of the first round of about 100 potential panelists gave a flavor of just how difficult the process could be: More than half told the judge that they could not hear the case against Mr. Trump fairly and were immediately excused. Justice Juan M. Merchan, who is presiding over the case, read aloud to the prospective jurors a list of people who might serve as witnesses or be mentioned during the trial, asking them whether they recognized the names. Many of those names were indeed very recognizable. Among those who could come up during the trial were Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump's former adviser, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and one of Mr. Trump's lawyers. Several of Mr. Trump's relatives were also on the list, including his wife, Melania, his older daughter, Ivanka, and his son-in-law Jared Kushner.

Also a Times reader (thank you prospective juror). He did not answer with any surprises. When we start to get different answers to the final series of questions \u2014 which are more political and some of which concern Trump \u2014 is when we'll get something a little more interesting.

April 15, 2024, 3:27 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:27 p.m. ET One thing that is striking: Trump has used the previous court appearances in other cases to project an image of grandeur.

The jury selection process in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan could take two weeks or more. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Lawyers representing the State of New York and Donald J. Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate. The potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair. The process could take two weeks or more \u2014 and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court. 'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.' The stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County \u2014 Manhattan, as most people know it \u2014 which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020. Mr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated. Prosecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28. Unlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.' Some may not be completely forthcoming. 'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said. Mr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors. 'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'     Former President Donald J. Trump smirked and scoffed during pretrial proceedings on Monday in Manhattan. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Former President Donald J. Trump seemed alternately irritated and exhausted Monday morning, as his lawyers and prosecutors hashed out pretrial motions before jury selection in his criminal case. Even as a judge was hearing arguments on last-minute issues in a criminal case that centers on salacious allegations and threatens to upend his bid for the presidency, Mr. Trump appeared to nod off a few times, his mouth going slack and his head drooping onto his chest. The former president's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, passed him notes for several minutes before Mr. Trump appeared to jolt awake and notice them. At other times, Mr. Trump whispered and exchanged notes with Mr. Blanche. He sat motionless while his own words from the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape \u2014 on which bragged about grabbing women's genitals \u2014 were read from a transcript by a prosecutor. At times, Mr. Trump's emotions were characteristically on display. He smirked and scoffed, and appeared frustrated when the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, did not immediately agree that he could miss court to attend the graduation of his youngest son, Barron. But when Justice Merchan warned that Mr. Trump could be ejected or thrown in jail if he disrupts the proceedings, the former president indicated that he understood. The only time Mr. Trump showed a flash of humor was when he laughed at one of his own social media posts, which attacked his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be the prosecution's central witness.  Former President Donald J. Trump's comments on the 'Access Hollywood' tape will allowed to be introduced as evidence. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times The judge in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial on Monday again refused to allow the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape to be played for jurors, but said that the comments Mr. Trump made on the tape could be introduced as evidence. On the tape, revealed in The Washington Post about a month before Mr. Trump was elected president in 2016, he is heard bragging about grabbing women's genitals, saying he could do so with abandon because 'when you're a star, they let you do it.' 'You can do anything,' Mr. Trump said on the recording. The tape rocked Mr. Trump's campaign. And prosecutors in Manhattan say it led him to agree to pay off Stormy Daniels, a porn star, who was shopping a story of a 2006 sexual encounter with the candidate. Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, paid Ms. Daniels $130,000. The payment is at the heart of the 34 felony charges against Mr. Trump, who is accused of falsifying business records to cover it up. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, had previously ruled that prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office could question witnesses about the tape, but found that it would be prejudicial to allow the actual video to the played. He reaffirmed that ruling on Monday. 'You can bring out what was said in the tape,' Justice Merchan said, adding that he didn't want jurors 'to hear Mr. Trump's voice and his gestures' in the tape. In a victory for the defense, the judge also ruled that the prosecution could not introduce evidence about sexual assault allegations against Mr. Trump that surfaced in the aftermath of the tape becoming public, calling them 'complete hearsay.' However, Justice Merchan said that prosecutors could introduce emails that followed the tape's disclosure, showing frantic efforts by Trump advisers to contain the fallout. The correspondence, he said, 'bolsters the people's claim that this was a crucial event.' Todd Blanche, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, had called on Justice Merchan to reconsider admitting 'this extremely salacious evidence,' which he described as 'very prejudicial.' Mr. Trump, who is again the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has denied any wrongdoing and has cast the case against him as politically motivated. Justice Juan M. Merchan has already reprimanded Donald J. Trump's lawyers for arguments that he considered frivolous. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Inside a dreary Lower Manhattan courtroom on a recent Wednesday, Justice Juan M. Merchan convened a special session for people with mental health troubles who had landed in legal jeopardy. He calmly counseled them, praised any signs of progress and shook the hand of one man who, thanks to medication, had turned his life around. But a different type of criminal defendant is now testing the judge's equanimity: Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump's trial on charges that he covered up a sex scandal before and after the 2016 presidential election will bring a maelstrom that no other judge in New York's vast judiciary has ever experienced. Known as a no-nonsense, drama-averse jurist, Justice Merchan, 61, has already reprimanded Mr. Trump's lawyers for arguments that he considered frivolous and issued a gag order intended to protect prosecutors, witnesses and his own family from Mr. Trump's vitriol \u2014 and yet the former president has continued to post articles with pictures of the judge's daughter, a political consultant who has worked with Democratic candidates. Although Justice Merchan is a registered Democrat, records show he was previously a Republican, and people who know him described the judge as a moderate, law-and-order former prosecutor. Two people close to Justice Merchan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the judge had privately expressed pain over the attacks on his daughter, but the people said that those attacks won't compromise his ability to oversee the case. Other people who know the judge said that he will cast aside Mr. Trump's drama \u2014 and exert control over the trial. 'It is Judge Merchan's show,' said Jill Konviser, a retired judge who has known Justice Merchan for more than 15 years. She added: 'He will do everything he can to, one, control his courtroom and two, ensure a fair trial for the defendant.' In Justice Merchan's 17 years on the bench, 13 as presiding judge in the Mental Health Court he created, he has had his share of unusual cases. There was a murder trial involving a supposed curse on the defendant; the daredevils who jumped off the World Trade Center with parachutes; and a so-called soccer-mom madam accused of running a high-end brothel on the Upper East Side. In that case, an appeals court reduced the steep bail Justice Merchan had set, calling it 'unreasonable.' None of those defendants challenged the judge quite like Mr. Trump, who claims that the case is a witch hunt and declared that Justice Merchan's gag order had infringed on his First Amendment rights. The former president has tested the order's limits by posting articles that named and attacked Justice Merchan's daughter, Loren, and his wife, Lara. The articles, by the conservative activist Laura Loomer, included photos of Loren Merchan and copies of a 2007 mortgage statement for a house owned by Justice Merchan and his wife. Previously, Mr. Trump falsely accused Loren Merchan of posting an image of him behind bars on social media. The trial, which could last two months as a parade of former aides and allies takes the stand against him, will dominate Justice Merchan's calendar this spring. On off-days, he will continue to preside over Mental Health Court. The program is for defendants charged with felonies and diagnosed with a serious mental illness. People who are accepted enter a guilty plea and then begin a period of treatment and judicial supervision. Those who complete the program successfully can have their charges reduced or dismissed. During one recent session, Justice Merchan showed particular interest in the relationship between a defendant and his child, and praised him for his dedication. 'You want to do better by your daughter,' Justice Merchan said. 'I'm sure she's going to appreciate that.'  Donald J. Trump has repeatedly tried to have Juan M. Merchan removed as the judge in his case. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Juan M. Merchan, the judge overseeing Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan, has declined to step aside from the case, rejecting the former president's effort to delay the trial and attack his integrity. The judge announced the decision in the opening minutes of Mr. Trump's trial on Monday morning. After Justice Merchan rules on a variety of legal issues, the trial will begin in earnest with jury selection. 'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said Monday before rejecting the request. 'We want to follow the law,' he added. 'We want justice to be done.' Mr. Trump's lawyers had called on Justice Merchan to recuse himself in a recent court filing, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. The Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case that accuses Mr. Trump of falsifying records to conceal a sex scandal from voters, had argued that no conflict of interest existed. And judicial ethics experts cast doubt on Mr. Trump's request, noting that the judge was not responsible for his daughter's career. It was just the latest attempt by Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, to both delay the trial and oust Justice Merchan. Nor will it be the last: In a separate civil action filed last week, Mr. Trump asked an appeals court to pause the case while it considers whether to remove Justice Merchan. It is a long-shot bid that a single appeals court judge rejected and will be likely to fail before a full five-judge panel. When Mr. Trump tried last year to have Justice Merchan kicked off the case, Justice Merchan rejected it then as well, citing a state advisory committee on judicial ethics that determined that his impartiality could not reasonably be questioned based on his daughter's interests. The repeated attempts reflect the former president's long-running effort to delay all four of his criminal cases past Election Day. Stalling is one of Mr. Trump's favored legal tactics, and he uses it liberally in Manhattan, as well as in the three other cities where he faces criminal charges. If Mr. Trump reclaims the White House, the criminal cases against him would most likely grind to a halt. In the attempt in appeals court to compel the judge's recusal, Emil Bove, a lawyer for the former president, argued that certain facts had changed since Justice Merchan first declined to step aside last year, including that Mr. Trump was now the presumptive Republican nominee for president. But a lawyer for the court system, Lisa Evans, said that there was no reason that the judge should step aside. 'There is absolutely no evidence to show that Judge Merchan will stand to benefit from the outcome of this trial,' Ms. Evans said.

Adam Gray/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images The streets outside the Manhattan courtroom where former President Donald J. Trump was set to go on trial were buzzing with anticipation on Monday morning as a crush of reporters \u2014 and a trickle of protesters \u2014 gathered to bear witness. Right-wing activists were planning rallies in the park directly opposite the court, which was subject to a heavy police presence. Some journalists and line-sitters had arrived late Sunday night, staking out places in the line to secure limited spaces inside the court's overflow room, where most reporters were gathered. Cameras lined the sidewalks outside the courthouse, a glowering edifice at 100 Centre Street, just blocks from New York's City Hall. TV crews were going live in intervals since before dawn, even as the police manned metal barricades. As the sun rose, some anti-Trump demonstrators had arrived, including one toting a sign reading 'Loser,' a favorite insult of the former president. Nadine Seiler, 58, took a midnight bus from Waldorf, Md., to get to the courthouse by dawn. 'This is the first and possibly only trial he's going to be on,' she said, holding up a spray-painted sheet reading 'Convict Trump Already.' Mr. Trump also had fans outside the courthouse, including Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist who argued with an anti-Trump protester as a gaggle of journalists surrounded them. Andrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City and lawyer for Mr. Trump, also came by to show support, arguing that the trial was a political persecution. 'He's somebody who I consider to be a mentor, almost like an uncle to me,' said Mr. Giuliani. Noting Mr. Trump's status as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Mr. Giuliani claimed: 'They want to tie him up for months at a time.' Others were simply there to witness the moment. 'I think it's a really difficult moment in American history,' said Sue Scarlett Montgomery, a filmmaker. 'It's a sad day, but here we are.'  The first criminal trial of an American president officially began on Monday as prosecutors and defense lawyers convened in a Manhattan courtroom to start selecting the jury that will decide Donald J. Trump's fate. The initial pool of prospective jurors dwindled rapidly. More than half of the first group of 96 were dismissed in short order after indicating that they did not believe they could be impartial. Court adjourned for the day roughly two hours after jury selection began, with zero jurors chosen. Before beginning the arduous process of choosing a jury for the landmark trial \u2014 on allegations that Mr. Trump falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star \u2014 the judge overseeing the case once again declined to step aside, rejecting Mr. Trump's latest effort to oust him. But there was also a ruling that favored the former president: The judge, Juan M. Merchan, rejected a request by prosecutors to introduce accusations of sexual assault that women lodged against Mr. Trump years ago, calling them 'rumors' and 'complete gossip.' The Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case against Mr. Trump, also asked the judge to hold Mr. Trump in contempt and penalize him $3,000 for violating a gag order barring him from attacking witnesses in the case. On social media over the weekend, Mr. Trump assailed one of the prosecution's key witnesses: Michael D. Cohen, his former fixer. Mr. Cohen paid $130,000 to the porn star, Stormy Daniels, during the 2016 presidential campaign to keep quiet about a sexual encounter she said she had with Mr. Trump. After the lunch break \u2014 during which Mr. Trump posted a video of an ally yelling about the judge's wife \u2014 Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month to discuss potential violations of the gag order, which also bars Mr. Trump from attacking the judge's family. The jury selection process could take two weeks or more, and the trial may spill into June. Mr. Trump is expected to be in the courtroom for much of it. Mr. Trump seemed alternately irritated and exhausted during pretrial arguments on Monday, sometimes smirking and scoffing, but also appearing to nod off, his mouth slack and his head drooping to his chest. After the trial got underway in the afternoon, he chuckled when Justice Merchan told the first group of 96 prospective jurors that he would ensure a fair trial. Mr. Trump, who might take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied the sexual encounter with Ms. Daniels. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records to hide the reimbursements to Mr. Cohen. They argue the payment to Ms. Daniels was part of a pattern: Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election. Here's what else to know about Mr. Trump's trial: This is the Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump, and it was brought by the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a year ago. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. The case, one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America. Mr. Trump's team will be looking for red needles in a blue haystack.\nMr. Trump has twice sought Justice Merchan's recusal, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. Justice Merchan has declined to step aside, noting a ruling by a judicial ethics commission that found his daughter's work posed no conflict for him. 'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said in court on Monday, adding, 'we want to follow the law, we want justice to be done.' Mr. Trump has also attacked the judge's daughter on social media.\nHundreds of potential jurors have been summoned. Those who say they cannot be fair or otherwise serve are being excused, and the remaining prospective jurors will answer 42 questions compiled before the trial. Lawyers on both sides will be able to remove a limited number of them without explanation. The lawyers can also ask to remove a potential juror 'for cause' by providing specific reasons they believe that person cannot be fair. In addition to the payment to Ms. Daniels, Mr. Bragg's office is expected to highlight two other deals involving The National Enquirer, a tabloid that has longstanding ties to Mr. Trump. In one deal, the tabloid bought the silence of a man who had heard that Mr. Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock, a rumor that turned out to be false, and in the other, it paid Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, who wanted to sell her story of an affair with Mr. Trump.\nThe prosecution's witness list is expected to include David Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, as well as Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal could also testify. Prospective jurors will answer a uniform set of questions aimed at discerning bias for or against the former president. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Follow our live coverage of Trump's hush money trial . The hundreds of New Yorkers who report for jury duty Monday morning in Manhattan will embark on an experience not found in history books: They will be vetted as jurors for the trial of a former U.S. president. The task won't be easy. Lawyers for Donald J. Trump and prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney's office will narrow the pool to 12 jurors and several alternates. Both sides will try to discern biases that could alter the outcome of the trial, posing dozens of questions that have been discussed and debated for weeks. The jurors, for their part, will be expected to answer each question honestly in an intimidating environment, just steps away from the former president, who is expected to attend much of the trial. Here's what we know about the process: The jury pool is composed of Manhattanites. Beyond that, little about the group is known, even by prosecutors and defense lawyers. Both sides will use the next several days, or weeks, to find out all they can. Because New York State does not allow juries to operate in full anonymity, the parties, including the former president, will know the jurors' names. The lawyers will also have access to their addresses. (Mr. Trump will not.) The public may never know the jurors' names. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, granted the prosecutors' request to withhold them. After reading a summary of the allegations, Justice Merchan will ask the prospective jurors whether they believe they can be fair and impartial. They will also be asked if they have any scheduling conflicts that would prevent them from attending every day of the trial, which could last more than six weeks. Those who raise concerns will most likely be removed from the pool. The jurors who remain will all be asked the same set of questions. One by one, they will talk \u2014 briefly and vaguely \u2014 about what they do for a living, their education and their families. They will be asked where they get their news, what radio and podcasts they listen to and whether they've read books written by Mr. Trump or his former fixer Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be a central witness. Other questions will be more pointed. Jurors will be asked if they've ever volunteered or attended a campaign event for Mr. Trump or one of his opponents. They will also be asked to divulge feelings or opinions they have about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case. But the jurors will not be asked how they voted in past elections, whom they plan to vote for, whether they have made political contributions or their party registration. Mr. Trump's legal team and prosecutors for the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, can challenge the inclusion of prospective jurors by providing specific reasons they believe a juror cannot be fair and impartial. The judge has the final say. Both sides will also receive a certain number of chances to remove jurors without explanation. After all of the challenged jurors are removed from the jury pool, Justice Merchan will seat the jury with those who remain. If Mr. Trump's behavior at previous trials is any guide, he is likely to be very involved in jury selection. In a previous defamation case, Mr. Trump was fixated on the jurors from the moment they walked into the courtroom. He pivoted in his chair to study them as they answered biographical questions. He frequently talked to his attorneys. But Mr. Trump's comments about the jurors in this case should start and stop in the courtroom. In addition to being ordered not to reveal their names, Mr. Trump is also subject to a gag order issued by Justice Merchan preventing him from making public statements about them.  \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nDonald J. Trump's lawyers faced an uphill battle Monday with Justice Juan M. Merchan, a no-nonsense jurist. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab courtroom in New York City while Mr. Trump looked on.\nMr. Trump was charged in Manhattan, a deeply Democratic county and his former home, with falsifying nearly three dozen business records in an attempt to cover up a payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, who has said she had a brief sexual encounter with him in 2006.\nMr. Trump denies that encounter happened, and has declared his innocence, calling the charges politically motivated. He has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a Democrat, who also attended the first day of trial on Monday.\nMr. Trump faces 34 felony counts and could face probation or up to four years of prison time.\nThe trial, which is expected to last weeks, has a fascinating list of potential witnesses: Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer turned apostate, who made the payment; Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who says she, too, had an affair with Mr. Trump; and Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels herself may testify.\nBefore any of that happens, a jury must be selected, a winnowing that began Monday.\nHere are five takeaways from Mr. Trump's first day on trial:\nJustice Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, has been consistent about batting back defense motions on issues including the tardy disclosure of documents by prosecutors and efforts to delay or even dismiss the case.\nThat pattern continued on Monday, as Justice Merchan rejected a defense effort to force his recusal. The defense had cited several issues, including the fact that his daughter is a Democratic political consultant.\nHe also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost.\nBut Mr. Trump's lawyers convinced Justice Merchan that sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the so-called Access Hollywood tape, in which Mr. Trump was caught bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial, calling them 'complete rumors, complete gossip, completely hearsay.'\nJustice Merchan's decisions on Monday made it clear that the trial will resurface unsavory events in the former president's life.\nThose include the Access Hollywood tape and other stories that Mr. Trump sought to suppress including an alleged affair with Ms. McDougal. Justice Merchan said on Monday that both could be discussed.\nIn a minor victory for the defense, the judge reaffirmed that the 'Access Hollywood' tape itself could not be played, but that Trump's exact words could be entered into the record.\nStill, most of Mr. Merchan's rulings indicated that salacious details of Mr. Trump's biography will be heard in court.\nEntering the courtroom, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here.'\nOnce he was in front of Mr. Merchan, Mr. Trump looked a lot less enthusiastic. He slouched. He scowled. He scoffed. And he was quiet, not the norm for a man who built a political career with his gift for slashing attacks and vicious put-downs.\nIn court, the former president spoke only briefly, when asked a few questions by Justice Merchan about procedural matters, and whether he understood the consequences \u2014 ejection or jail \u2014 if he interrupted proceedings. He did whisper with his lawyers. And when the prosecution played a recording of him claiming to have great respect for women, he mouthed the word 'true.'\nBut all in all, it seems it could be an exhausting experience for Mr. Trump; at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep.\nIt's easy to forget how long it takes to do a little in legal settings. On Monday, the morning session was dominated by maneuvering by prosecutors and the defense, even as prospective jurors waited. By lunch, they were still waiting.\nJury selection could take days or weeks, and the trial itself may take two months. The Passover holiday could cause delays, Justice Merchan said, though he might make some of that up by holding hearings on court matters on Wednesdays, which was previously going to be an off day.\nBy afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into Justice Merchan's courtroom. He warmly welcomed them, introduced the lawyers and Mr. Trump and read them a summary of the case.\nJustice Merchan asked if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president. Of the 96 prospective jurors in the room at that time, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused.\nThe remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.\nApril 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET Trump spoke briefly to TV cameras after court adjourned for the day, repeating his longstanding claims that the trial is a 'political witch hunt' before heading to his motorcade and departing the courthouse.\nVideo Reporter: [inaudible] the trial \u2014 [inaudible] So thank you very much. We had some amazing things happen today. As you know, my son is graduating from high school and it looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation of my son, who's worked very, very hard. He's a great student and he's very proud of the fact that he did so well. And was looking forward for years to have his graduation with his mother and father there. And it looks like the judges isn't going to allow me to escape this scam. It's a scam trial. If you read all of the legal pundits, all of the legal scholars today, there's not one that I see that said, this is a case that should be brought or tried. It's a scam.

DavidAs former President Donald J. Trump's first criminal trial began inside a Manhattan courthouse on Monday, the scene outside had elements of a feisty political skirmish and a surreal circus rolled into one.\nThe streets below the courtroom drew a mix of gawkers, activists and publicity hounds, along with a large contingent of journalists.\nLaura Loomer, a right-wing activist known for her aggressive tactics and closeness with Mr. Trump, led a chant of 'Donald Trump Did Nothing Wrong!' alongside Andrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and Trump lawyer.\n'We're going to be here every single day talking to all you fake-news media freaks,' Ms. Loomer said through a Harvey Milk-style bullhorn in a video she posted on social media. 'And letting you know that Donald Trump did nothing wrong until you start reporting the truth.'\nMs. Loomer described the case as a 'witch hunt' \u2014 a frequent assertion of Mr. Trump's \u2014 and criticized a key witness for the prosecution, Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, and the wife of the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan.\nMr. Trump promptly reposted the video on Truth Social \u2014 despite a gag order that bars him from attacking witnesses in the case or Justice Merchan's family. His post, made during the lunch break, came shortly before Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month on prosecutors' request that Mr. Trump be held in contempt of court over statements they say violate the order.\nPerformance artists also vied for attention. One, known as Crackhead Barney, stood screaming outside the gates surrounding Collect Pond Park that she had been kicked out, and demanded police officers' badge numbers.

Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate.\nThe potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair.\nThe process could take two weeks or more \u2014 and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court.\n'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.'\nThe stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County \u2014 Manhattan, as most people know it \u2014 which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020.\nMr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions.\nMr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated.\nProsecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28.\nUnlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.'\nSome may not be completely forthcoming.\n'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said.\nMr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors.\n'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J.

He sat motionless while his own words from the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape \u2014 on which bragged about grabbing women's genitals \u2014 were read from a transcript by a prosecutor.\nAt times, Mr. Trump's emotions were characteristically on display. He smirked and scoffed, and appeared frustrated when the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, did not immediately agree that he could miss court to attend the graduation of his youngest son, Barron.\nBut when Justice Merchan warned that Mr. Trump could be ejected or thrown in jail if he disrupts the proceedings, the former president indicated that he understood.\nThe only time Mr. Trump showed a flash of humor was when he laughed at one of his own social media posts, which attacked his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be the prosecution's central witness.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J. Trump's comments on the 'Access Hollywood' tape will allowed to be introduced as evidence. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times The judge in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial on Monday again refused to allow the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape to be played for jurors, but said that the comments Mr. Trump made on the tape could be introduced as evidence.\nOn the tape, revealed in The Washington Post about a month before Mr. Trump was elected president in 2016, he is heard bragging about grabbing women's genitals, saying he could do so with abandon because 'when you're a star, they let you do it.'\n'You can do anything,' Mr. Trump said on the recording.\nThe tape rocked Mr. Trump's campaign. And prosecutors in Manhattan say it led him to agree to pay off Stormy Daniels, a porn star, who was shopping a story of a 2006 sexual encounter with the candidate.\nMichael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, paid Ms. Daniels $130,000. The payment is at the heart of the 34 felony charges against Mr. Trump, who is accused of falsifying business records to cover it up.\nThe judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, had previously ruled that prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office could question witnesses about the tape, but found that it would be prejudicial to allow the actual video to the played. He reaffirmed that ruling on Monday.\n'You can bring out what was said in the tape,' Justice Merchan said, adding that he didn't want jurors 'to hear Mr. Trump's voice and his gestures' in the tape.\nIn a victory for the defense, the judge also ruled that the prosecution could not introduce evidence about sexual assault allegations against Mr. Trump that surfaced in the aftermath of the tape becoming public, calling them 'complete hearsay.'\nHowever, Justice Merchan said that prosecutors could introduce emails that followed the tape's disclosure, showing frantic efforts by Trump advisers to contain the fallout. The correspondence, he said, 'bolsters the people's claim that this was a crucial event.'\nTodd Blanche, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, had called on Justice Merchan to reconsider admitting 'this extremely salacious evidence,' which he described as 'very prejudicial.'\nMr. Trump, who is again the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has denied any wrongdoing and has cast the case against him as politically motivated.\nJustice Juan M. Merchan has already reprimanded Donald J. Trump's lawyers for arguments that he considered frivolous. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Inside a dreary Lower Manhattan courtroom on a recent Wednesday, Justice Juan M. Merchan convened a special session for people with mental health troubles who had landed in legal jeopardy. He calmly counseled them, praised any signs of progress and shook the hand of one man who, thanks to medication, had turned his life around.\nBut a different type of criminal defendant is now testing the judge's equanimity: Donald J. Trump.\nMr. Trump's trial on charges that he covered up a sex scandal before and after the 2016 presidential election will bring a maelstrom that no other judge in New York's vast judiciary has ever experienced.\nKnown as a no-nonsense, drama-averse jurist, Justice Merchan, 61, has already reprimanded Mr. Trump's lawyers for arguments that he considered frivolous and issued a gag order intended to protect prosecutors, witnesses and his own family from Mr. Trump's vitriol \u2014 and yet the former president has continued to post articles with pictures of the judge's daughter, a political consultant who has worked with Democratic candidates.\nAlthough Justice Merchan is a registered Democrat, records show he was previously a Republican, and people who know him described the judge as a moderate, law-and-order former prosecutor.\nTwo people close to Justice Merchan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the judge had privately expressed pain over the attacks on his daughter, but the people said that those attacks won't compromise his ability to oversee the case. Other people who know the judge said that he will cast aside Mr. Trump's drama \u2014 and exert control over the trial.\n'It is Judge Merchan's show,' said Jill Konviser, a retired judge who has known Justice Merchan for more than 15 years. She added: 'He will do everything he can to, one, control his courtroom and two, ensure a fair trial for the defendant.'\nIn Justice Merchan's 17 years on the bench, 13 as presiding judge in the Mental Health Court he created, he has had his share of unusual cases. There was a murder trial involving a supposed curse on the defendant; the daredevils who jumped off the World Trade Center with parachutes; and a so-called soccer-mom madam accused of running a high-end brothel on the Upper East Side. In that case, an appeals court reduced the steep bail Justice Merchan had set, calling it 'unreasonable.'\nNone of those defendants challenged the judge quite like Mr. Trump, who claims that the case is a witch hunt and declared that Justice Merchan's gag order had infringed on his First Amendment rights.\nThe former president has tested the order's limits by posting articles that named and attacked Justice Merchan's daughter, Loren, and his wife, Lara. The articles, by the conservative activist Laura Loomer, included photos of Loren Merchan and copies of a 2007 mortgage statement for a house owned by Justice Merchan and his wife. Previously, Mr. Trump falsely accused Loren Merchan of posting an image of him behind bars on social media.\nThe trial, which could last two months as a parade of former aides and allies takes the stand against him, will dominate Justice Merchan's calendar this spring.\nOn off-days, he will continue to preside over Mental Health Court. The program is for defendants charged with felonies and diagnosed with a serious mental illness. People who are accepted enter a guilty plea and then begin a period of treatment and judicial supervision. Those who complete the program successfully can have their charges reduced or dismissed.\nDuring one recent session, Justice Merchan showed particular interest in the relationship between a defendant and his child, and praised him for his dedication.\n'You want to do better by your daughter,' Justice Merchan said. 'I'm sure she's going to appreciate that.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Donald J. Trump has repeatedly tried to have Juan M. Merchan removed as the judge in his case. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Juan M. Merchan, the judge overseeing Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan, has declined to step aside from the case, rejecting the former president's effort to delay the trial and attack his integrity.\nThe judge announced the decision in the opening minutes of Mr. Trump's trial on Monday morning. After Justice Merchan rules on a variety of legal issues, the trial will begin in earnest with jury selection.\n'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said Monday before rejecting the request. 'We want to follow the law,' he added. 'We want justice to be done.'\nMr. Trump's lawyers had called on Justice Merchan to recuse himself in a recent court filing, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant.\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case that accuses Mr. Trump of falsifying records to conceal a sex scandal from voters, had argued that no conflict of interest existed. And judicial ethics experts cast doubt on Mr. Trump's request, noting that the judge was not responsible for his daughter's career.\nIt was just the latest attempt by Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, to both delay the trial and oust Justice Merchan. Nor will it be the last: In a separate civil action filed last week, Mr. Trump asked an appeals court to pause the case while it considers whether to remove Justice Merchan. It is a long-shot bid that a single appeals court judge rejected and will be likely to fail before a full five-judge panel.\nWhen Mr. Trump tried last year to have Justice Merchan kicked off the case, Justice Merchan rejected it then as well, citing a state advisory committee on judicial ethics that determined that his impartiality could not reasonably be questioned based on his daughter's interests.\nThe repeated attempts reflect the former president's long-running effort to delay all four of his criminal cases past Election Day. Stalling is one of Mr. Trump's favored legal tactics, and he uses it liberally in Manhattan, as well as in the three other cities where he faces criminal charges. If Mr. Trump reclaims the White House, the criminal cases against him would most likely grind to a halt.\nIn the attempt in appeals court to compel the judge's recusal, Emil Bove, a lawyer for the former president, argued that certain facts had changed since Justice Merchan first declined to step aside last year, including that Mr. Trump was now the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\nBut a lawyer for the court system, Lisa Evans, said that there was no reason that the judge should step aside.\n'There is absolutely no evidence to show that Judge Merchan will stand to benefit from the outcome of this trial,' Ms. Evans said.\nVideo transcript\nTrump Supporters Rally Outside New York Courthouse Pro-Trump protesters gathered near the Manhattan courthouse where the former president's criminal trial is taking place.

Trump was set to go on trial were buzzing with anticipation on Monday morning as a crush of reporters \u2014 and a trickle of protesters \u2014 gathered to bear witness.\nRight-wing activists were planning rallies in the park directly opposite the court, which was subject to a heavy police presence. Some journalists and line-sitters had arrived late Sunday night, staking out places in the line to secure limited spaces inside the court's overflow room, where most reporters were gathered.\nCameras lined the sidewalks outside the courthouse, a glowering edifice at 100 Centre Street, just blocks from New York's City Hall. TV crews were going live in intervals since before dawn, even as the police manned metal barricades. As the sun rose, some anti-Trump demonstrators had arrived, including one toting a sign reading 'Loser,' a favorite insult of the former president.\nNadine Seiler, 58, took a midnight bus from Waldorf, Md., to get to the courthouse by dawn. 'This is the first and possibly only trial he's going to be on,' she said, holding up a spray-painted sheet reading 'Convict Trump Already.'\nMr. Trump also had fans outside the courthouse, including Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist who argued with an anti-Trump protester as a gaggle of journalists surrounded them.\nAndrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City and lawyer for Mr. Trump, also came by to show support, arguing that the trial was a political persecution.\n'He's somebody who I consider to be a mentor, almost like an uncle to me,' said Mr. Giuliani.\nNoting Mr. Trump's status as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Mr. Giuliani claimed: 'They want to tie him up for months at a time.'\nOthers were simply there to witness the moment. 'I think it's a really difficult moment in American history,' said Sue Scarlett Montgomery, a filmmaker. 'It's a sad day, but here we are.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT The first criminal trial of an American president officially began on Monday as prosecutors and defense lawyers convened in a Manhattan courtroom to start selecting the jury that will decide Donald J. Trump's fate.\nThe initial pool of prospective jurors dwindled rapidly. More than half of the first group of 96 were dismissed in short order after indicating that they did not believe they could be impartial. Court adjourned for the day roughly two hours after jury selection began, with zero jurors chosen.\nBefore beginning the arduous process of choosing a jury for the landmark trial \u2014 on allegations that Mr. Trump falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star \u2014 the judge overseeing the case once again declined to step aside, rejecting Mr. Trump's latest effort to oust him.\nBut there was also a ruling that favored the former president: The judge, Juan M. Merchan, rejected a request by prosecutors to introduce accusations of sexual assault that women lodged against Mr. Trump years ago, calling them 'rumors' and 'complete gossip.'\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case against Mr. Trump, also asked the judge to hold Mr. Trump in contempt and penalize him $3,000 for violating a gag order barring him from attacking witnesses in the case.\nOn social media over the weekend, Mr. Trump assailed one of the prosecution's key witnesses: Michael D. Cohen, his former fixer. Mr. Cohen paid $130,000 to the porn star, Stormy Daniels, during the 2016 presidential campaign to keep quiet about a sexual encounter she said she had with Mr. Trump.\nAfter the lunch break \u2014 during which Mr. Trump posted a video of an ally yelling about the judge's wife \u2014 Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month to discuss potential violations of the gag order, which also bars Mr. Trump from attacking the judge's family.\nThe jury selection process could take two weeks or more, and the trial may spill into June. Mr. Trump is expected to be in the courtroom for much of it.\nMr. Trump seemed alternately irritated and exhausted during pretrial arguments on Monday, sometimes smirking and scoffing, but also appearing to nod off, his mouth slack and his head drooping to his chest. After the trial got underway in the afternoon, he chuckled when Justice Merchan told the first group of 96 prospective jurors that he would ensure a fair trial.\nMr. Trump, who might take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied the sexual encounter with Ms. Daniels. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records to hide the reimbursements to Mr. Cohen. They argue the payment to Ms. Daniels was part of a pattern: Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election.\nHere's what else to know about Mr. Trump's trial:\nThis is the Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump, and it was brought by the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a year ago. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. The case, one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America. Mr. Trump's team will be looking for red needles in a blue haystack.\nMr. Trump has twice sought Justice Merchan's recusal, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. Justice Merchan has declined to step aside, noting a ruling by a judicial ethics commission that found his daughter's work posed no conflict for him. 'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said in court on Monday, adding, 'we want to follow the law, we want justice to be done.' Mr. Trump has also attacked the judge's daughter on social media.\nHundreds of potential jurors have been summoned. Those who say they cannot be fair or otherwise serve are being excused, and the remaining prospective jurors will answer 42 questions compiled before the trial. Lawyers on both sides will be able to remove a limited number of them without explanation. The lawyers can also ask to remove a potential juror 'for cause' by providing specific reasons they believe that person cannot be fair.\nIn addition to the payment to Ms. Daniels, Mr. Bragg's office is expected to highlight two other deals involving The National Enquirer, a tabloid that has longstanding ties to Mr. Trump. In one deal, the tabloid bought the silence of a man who had heard that Mr. Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock, a rumor that turned out to be false, and in the other, it paid Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, who wanted to sell her story of an affair with Mr. Trump.\nThe prosecution's witness list is expected to include David Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, as well as Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal could also testify.\nProspective jurors will answer a uniform set of questions aimed at discerning bias for or against the former president. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Follow our live coverage of Trump's hush money trial .\nFollow our live coverage of Trump's hush money trial . The hundreds of New Yorkers who report for jury duty Monday morning in Manhattan will embark on an experience not found in history books: They will be vetted as jurors for the trial of a former U.S. president.\nThe task won't be easy. Lawyers for Donald J. Trump and prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney's office will narrow the pool to 12 jurors and several alternates. Both sides will try to discern biases that could alter the outcome of the trial, posing dozens of questions that have been discussed and debated for weeks.\nThe jurors, for their part, will be expected to answer each question honestly in an intimidating environment, just steps away from the former president, who is expected to attend much of the trial.\nHere's what we know about the process:\nThe jury pool is composed of Manhattanites. Beyond that, little about the group is known, even by prosecutors and defense lawyers. Both sides will use the next several days, or weeks, to find out all they can.\nBecause New York State does not allow juries to operate in full anonymity, the parties, including the former president, will know the jurors' names. The lawyers will also have access to their addresses. (Mr. Trump will not.)\nThe public may never know the jurors' names. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, granted the prosecutors' request to withhold them.\nAfter reading a summary of the allegations, Justice Merchan will ask the prospective jurors whether they believe they can be fair and impartial. They will also be asked if they have any scheduling conflicts that would prevent them from attending every day of the trial, which could last more than six weeks. Those who raise concerns will most likely be removed from the pool.\nThe jurors who remain will all be asked the same set of questions. One by one, they will talk \u2014 briefly and vaguely \u2014 about what they do for a living, their education and their families. They will be asked where they get their news, what radio and podcasts they listen to and whether they've read books written by Mr. Trump or his former fixer Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be a central witness.\nOther questions will be more pointed. Jurors will be asked if they've ever volunteered or attended a campaign event for Mr. Trump or one of his opponents. They will also be asked to divulge feelings or opinions they have about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case.\nBut the jurors will not be asked how they voted in past elections, whom they plan to vote for, whether they have made political contributions or their party registration.\nMr. Trump's legal team and prosecutors for the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, can challenge the inclusion of prospective jurors by providing specific reasons they believe a juror cannot be fair and impartial. The judge has the final say.\nBoth sides will also receive a certain number of chances to remove jurors without explanation. After all of the challenged jurors are removed from the jury pool, Justice Merchan will seat the jury with those who remain.\nIf Mr. Trump's behavior at previous trials is any guide, he is likely to be very involved in jury selection. In a previous defamation case, Mr. Trump was fixated on the jurors from the moment they walked into the courtroom. He pivoted in his chair to study them as they answered biographical questions. He frequently talked to his attorneys.\nBut Mr. Trump's comments about the jurors in this case should start and stop in the courtroom. In addition to being ordered not to reveal their names, Mr. Trump is also subject to a gag order issued by Justice Merchan preventing him from making public statements about them.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ben Protess,Jonah E.

The question for the justices is whether a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, enacted in the wake of the collapse of the energy giant Enron, covers the conduct of a former police officer, Joseph W. Fischer, who participated in the Capitol assault, on Jan. 6, 2021. The law figures in two of the federal charges against Mr. Trump in his election subversion case and more than 350 people who stormed the Capitol have been prosecuted under it. If the Supreme Court sides with Mr. Fischer and says the statute does not cover what he is accused of having done, Mr. Trump is almost certain to contend that it does not apply to his conduct, either. The law, signed in 2002, was prompted by accounting fraud and the destruction of documents, but the provision is written in broad terms. At least part of what the law meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code: It was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself. The law sought to close that gap. It did that in a two-part provision. The first part makes it a crime to corruptly alter, destroy or conceal evidence to frustrate official proceedings. The second part, at issue in Mr. Fischer's case, makes it a crime 'otherwise' to corruptly obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding. Here's what else to know: The dense semantics being argued circle an important question: whether this statute \u2014 devised to curb things like destroying documents \u2014 requires specific proof that records were actually tampered with. It also raises another critical question: whether document tampering has anything to do with pro-Trump rioters breaking into the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The heart of the case is at the pivot from the first part of the provision to the second. The ordinary meaning of 'otherwise,' prosecutors say, is 'in a different manner.' That means, they say, that the obstruction of official proceedings need not involve the destruction of evidence. The second part, they say, is broad catchall applying to all sorts of conduct. Mr. Fischer's lawyers counter that the first part of the provision must inform and limit the second one \u2014 to obstruction linked to the destruction of evidence. They would read 'otherwise,' in other words, as 'similarly.' The case is one of several affecting or involving Mr. Trump on the court's docket. In a separate case to be argued next week, the justices will consider Mr. Trump's claim that he is totally immune from prosecution.\nMr. Fischer is accused of entering the Capitol around 3:24 p.m. on Jan. 6, 2021, with the counting of electoral ballots having been suspended after the initial assault. Before his trip to Washington, prosecutors said he told a superior in a text message, that 'it might get violent.' In another, he wrote that 'they should storm the capital and drag all the democrates into the street and have a mob trial.' Prosecutors say that videos showed Mr. Fischer yelling 'Charge!' before pushing through the crowd, using a vulgar term to berate police officers and crashing into a line of them.\nMr. Fischer's lawyers dispute some of this. But the question for the justices is legal, not factual: Does the 2002 law cover what Mr. Fischer is accused of? That may turn in part on the meaning of another term in the law \u2014 its requirement that the defendant acted 'corruptly.' The meaning of that word is disputed. Alan Feuer contributed reporting.

The Supreme Court in Washington. Credit... Kent Nishimura for The New York Times The provision at issue in the case, from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has two parts. The question for the justices is how they interact. And that depends on the word that links them: 'otherwise.' The first part of the provision focuses on evidence, saying that anyone who corruptly 'alters, destroys, mutilates or conceals a record, document or other object' to affect an official proceeding is guilty of a felony. So far, so good. It is uncontroversial to reinforce that destroying documents to impede an investigation has been a core purpose of the law, which was prompted by the shredding of documents in an accounting scandal. The second part of the provision makes it a crime 'otherwise' to corruptly obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding. Prosecutors say the defendant in the case, Joseph W. Fischer, did that by joining the mob that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The heart of the case is how the first part of the provision pivots to the second part. The ordinary meaning of 'otherwise,' prosecutors say, is 'in a different manner.' That means, they say, that the obstruction of official proceedings need not involve the destruction of evidence. The second part, they say, is a broad catchall for any kind of corrupt interference with an official proceeding. Lawyers for Mr. Fischer, the defendant in Tuesday's case, counter that the first part must inform and limit the second one \u2014 meaning that the obstruction of official proceedings must be linked to the destruction of evidence. They would read 'otherwise' as 'similarly.' The alternative, they say, would be to create a crime of breathtaking scope that would allow prosecutors to charge political protesters and others with felonies carrying 20-year prison sentences. In 2008, in Begay v. United States, the court considered a law with a broadly similar structure, the Armed Career Criminal Act, which requires mandatory sentences for people convicted of possessing firearms if they have earlier been found guilty of three violent felonies. In one clause, it listed specific crimes that qualified as violent felonies \u2014 including burglary, arson and extortion. Then, as in the new case, there followed an 'otherwise' clause, this one adding any crime that 'otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.' The Supreme Court ruled that the examples informed and limited the sweep of the 'otherwise' clause. If Congress had 'meant the statute to be all-encompassing, it is hard to see why it would have needed to include the examples at all,' Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote for the majority. A drunken driving offense, the court ruled, did not qualify as one of the covered crimes even though the plain words of the clause would seem to encompass it. Mr. Fisher's lawyers say that the 'otherwise' clause in the obstruction statute must also be anchored in the preceding clause. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit disagreed, with Judge Florence Y. Pan writing that the two uses of 'otherwise' were different. The gun law, she wrote, 'includes a list of examples followed by \u2018otherwise' in a single, unbroken sentence.' By contrast, she wrote, the 'otherwise' in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 'sits within a separately numbered subparagraph, after a semicolon and line break, all of which put distance between it and the lists of verbs and objects' in the previous part. In dissent, Judge Gregory G. Katsas wrote that 'the relationship created by the word otherwise does not depend on punctuation or line breaks.' Rather, he wrote, 'it flows from the connotation of similarity,' among other factors. That meant, he concluded, that the second part of the provision applies 'only to acts that affect the integrity or availability of evidence.'

Kenny Holston/The New York Times At its core, the case is about the meaning of a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. It was enacted following the collapse of Enron, a giant energy company, after the exposure of widespread accounting fraud and the destruction of documents by the company's outside auditor. There is an uneasy fit between the immediate purpose of the law and its recent use in more than 300 prosecutions arising from the violent riot that forced a halt to the constitutionally required congressional count of presidential electors' ballots. At least part of what it meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code at the time: It was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself. The law meant to close that gap. It did, in a two-part provision, Section 1512(c) of the federal criminal code: (c) Whoever corruptly \u2014 (1) alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object , or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding or (2) otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding , or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. The first part focuses on evidence, making it a felony to tamper with it to affect an official proceeding. The second part makes it a crime 'otherwise' to corruptly obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding. The heart of this case is the pivot from the first part to the second part. The ordinary meaning of 'otherwise,' prosecutors say, is 'in a different manner.' That means, they say, that the obstruction of official proceedings need not involve the destruction of evidence \u2014 in their view, making the second part a broad catchall for any kind of corrupt interference with an official proceeding. The lawyers for Joseph W. Fischer, who was accused of breaching the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and of assaulting police officers, counter that the first part must inform and limit the second one \u2014 meaning that the obstruction of official proceedings must be linked to the destruction of evidence. They would read 'otherwise' as 'similarly.' The alternative, they say, would be to create a felony of breathtaking scope that would allow prosecutors to charge political protesters with felonies carrying 20-year prison sentences. April 16, 2024, 10:11 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 10:11 a.m. ET Two lawyers will argue: Jeffrey T. Green for the defendant and Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar for the government. They will each face 30 minutes of free-for-all questions followed by a round of one-by-one questions from the justices in order of seniority. Two of the four criminal counts former President Donald J. Trump is facing in that case are based on the obstruction law. Credit... Michelle Gustafson for The New York Times While the Supreme Court's hearing is intended to determine the scope and validity of an obstruction law used against hundreds of rioters who broke into the Capitol on Jan. 6, any decision could also have an impact on a separate criminal case: one in which former President Donald J. Trump has been accused of plotting to overturn the 2020 election. Two of the four criminal counts Mr. Trump is facing in that case are based on the obstruction law. In an indictment filed in Washington last summer, he was charged with conspiring to obstruct the certification of the election on Jan. 6 during a joint session of Congress at the Capitol as well as with actually obstructing it. If the justices determine that prosecutors improperly used the obstruction law against members of the pro-Trump mob who disrupted the session, Mr. Trump's lawyers will surely seek to have the charges against him dismissed as well. In fact, they already tried that in October. They argued unsuccessfully to the trial judge in the case that Mr. Trump's indictment unfairly used the statute, which was initially 'directed at the destruction of records in accounting fraud,' by applying it 'to disputing the outcome of a presidential election.' 'This stretches the statutory language beyond any plausible mooring to its text,' the lawyers wrote. Jack Smith, the special counsel handling Mr. Trump's case, has told the Supreme Court that the two obstruction counts against the former president would be still valid even if the justices narrowed the law to cover only crimes that involved tampering with documents or records. Mr. Trump triggered that provision of the law, Mr. Smith has said, by plotting to create fake slates of electors that claimed he won in several keys swing states that he actually lost to President Biden. Mr. Smith has accused Mr. Trump of trying to use those fake slates to throw the certification proceeding into chaos and by urging his vice president, Mike Pence, to capitalize on the confusion by single-handedly declaring him the winner of the race. Even if the obstruction count were ultimately removed from Trump's indictment, it would probably not be a fatal blow. The indictment contains two other conspiracy counts that overlap almost entirely with the accusations in the obstruction counts. One of the conspiracy charges accuses Mr. Trump of committing fraud by using deceit to subvert the normal course of the election. The other charges him with plotting to deprive millions of Americans of the right to have votes properly counted.  April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET A little backstory on why prosecutors opted to charge so many defendants with obstruction: Michael Sherwin, the U.S. attorney in Washington who initially led the Jan. 6 prosecution, promised 'shock and awe' in charging as many people as possible. But using overtly political crimes like insurrection or seditious conspiracy turned out not to be legally feasible. The government settled on using the obstruction count to describe how the election's certification proceeding was disrupted by defendants who went beyond mere trespass or assault. April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET Prosecutors tried to set general rules for who was charged with the obstruction count. It was often used if a defendant actually entered the Senate chamber or made their way into congressional offices. It was also used if there was evidence that a defendant's behavior had some sort of role in chasing lawmakers away from their sworn duties to certify the election on Jan. 6. April 16, 2024, 9:54 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:54 a.m. ET Of course, one of the biggest attractions of this obstruction count to prosecutors is that it carries a hefty 20-year maximum sentence. No defendant has been sentenced to that maximum yet, but the stiff penalty likely has some sort of deterrent effect on others. April 16, 2024, 9:48 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:48 a.m. ET The argument is likely to be focused on the text and purpose of the obstruction law at issue in the case. Expect close examination, for instance, of the meaning of the word 'otherwise.' More than 1,380 people had been charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol as of early this month, according to the Justice Department. Credit... Hailey Sadler for The New York Times The investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack is already the largest criminal inquiry in Justice Department history, federal prosecutors have said. And even after more than three years, it has shown little sign of slowing down. Every week, a few more rioters are arrested and charges against them are unsealed in Federal District Court in Washington. Prosecutors have suggested that a total of 2,000 or 2,500 people could ultimately face indictment for their roles in the attack. More than 1,380 people had been charged in connection with the attack as of early this month, according to the Justice Department. Among the most common charges brought against them are two misdemeanors: illegal parading inside the Capitol and entering and remaining in a restricted federal area, a type of trespassing. About 350 rioters have been accused of violating the obstruction statute that the Supreme Court is considering at its hearing, and nearly 500 people have been charged with assaulting police officers. Many rioters have been charged with multiple crimes, the most serious of which so far has been seditious conspiracy. Almost 800 defendants have already pleaded guilty; about 250 of them have done so to felony charges. Prosecutors have won the vast majority of the cases that have gone to trial: More than 150 defendants have been convicted at trial and only two have been fully acquitted. More than 850 people have been sentenced so far, and about 520 have received at least some time in prison. The stiffest penalties have been handed down to the former leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, far-right extremist groups that played central roles in the Capitol attack. Enrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys leader, was sentenced to 22 years in prison, and Stewart Rhodes, who once led the Oath Keepers, was given an 18-year term.  April 16, 2024, 9:36 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:36 a.m. ET All along the defense lawyers have claimed that federal prosecutors stretched the statute in an unprecedented way to fit the central crime that took place at the Capitol on Jan. 6: the disruption of the certification of the election. Then again, nothing like the storming of the Capitol had ever happened before. So perhaps it's no surprise that prosecutors use the obstruction law in a novel manner. April 16, 2024, 9:31 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:31 a.m. ET It's worth remembering as today's hearing is poised to get underway that lawyers defending Jan. 6 rioters have been questioning the government's use of this particular obstruction law from the very outset of criminal cases being filed by the Justice Department. It's taken three years, but now the issue has finally reached the Supreme Court. April 16, 2024, 9:26 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:26 a.m. ET The argument will not start promptly at 10:00 a.m. The court has said it will issue one or more decisions first. They will be announced from the bench but will not be broadcast. A mob walked to the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times The man whose case led to the Supreme Court hearing on a controversial federal obstruction law is a former police officer from rural Pennsylvania indicted on charges of storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and crashing into a line of his fellow officers defending the building. Joseph W. Fischer was working for the police department in North Cornwall Township, Pa., when prosecutors say he pushed his way into the Capitol while holding up his cellphone to take videos of the surge. Once inside, he and another rioter 'galloped forward,' prosecutors say, making contact with a line of officers who were fighting off the crowd. Mr. Fischer fell to the ground and, as some nearby officers helped him to his feet, he tried to engage with them, prosecutors say. 'I'm a cop too,' he said, 'sometimes the country is worth more than your job.' According to court papers, Mr. Fischer was concerned about his own job before making the trip to Washington. Investigators unearthed text messages he wrote to the chief of his department, saying that things could get 'violent' on Jan. 6 and that the crowd should 'storm the capital and drag all the democrates.' He also warned the chief that he might need him to post his bail, the papers said. Township officials suspended Mr. Fischer without pay on the day of his arrest in February 2021 and later fired him. But he has pushed back against the government's description of behavior on Jan. 6. His lawyers say that he and a companion were prepared to leave Washington that day after listening President Trump's speech near the White House and turned around to head toward the Capitol only after hearing about the mounting protest there. The lawyers also claim that Mr. Fischer arrived at the Capitol grounds well after Congress had recessed the proceeding to certify the results of the 2020 election because of the attack. 'As Mr. Fischer walked toward the east side of the building, no barricades or fences impeded him,' the lawyers wrote in their brief to the Supreme Court. Mr. Fischer has disputed the assertion by prosecutors that he charged the police line inside the Capitol, telling the court instead that he was pushed into the officers by 'the weight of the crowd.' He also characterized his interactions with the officers differently than prosecutors did, claiming that he merely talked with one of the officers and patted him on the shoulder.  The Supreme Court has said that the purpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was 'to safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets following the collapse of Enron.' Credit...The provision at issue in the case is part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a 2002 law enacted after the collapse of Enron, a giant energy company, after the exposure of widespread accounting fraud and the destruction of documents by its outside auditor, Arthur Andersen. The Supreme Court has said that the purpose of the law was 'to safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets following the collapse of Enron.' At least part of what the law meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code: it was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was meant to close that gap. Lawyers for Joseph W. Fischer, charged under the law with obstructing an official proceeding by joining the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, said his case had an Alice-in-Wonderland quality. 'The Through the Looking Glass moment here,' they wrote in a Supreme Court brief, 'would be for those who wrote the Sarbanes-Oxley Act upon learning that they had created a new and breathtaking obstruction offense by endeavoring to close the narrow Enron-Arthur Anderson loophole.' Indeed, in a different case on the scope of the statute, one of the sponsors of the law, Michael Oxley, filed a supporting brief saying prosecutors had interpreted it too broadly. The law meant to address 'specific loopholes' that Arthur Andersen 'had exploited when they shredded business documents and destroyed hard drives in anticipation of federal law-enforcement action,' wrote Mr. Oxley, a former Ohio representative who died in 2016. In that case, concerning a separate provision of the law, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the law's origins informed its meaning and spared the defendant. 'The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, all agree, was prompted by the exposure of Enron's massive accounting fraud and revelations that the company's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen, had systematically destroyed potentially incriminating documents,' she wrote for four of the justices in the majority. She added that the government had acknowledged that the provision 'was intended to prohibit, in particular, corporate document-shredding to hide evidence of financial wrongdoing.'

Erin Schaff/The New York Times The Supreme Court's decision to consider the soundness of an obstruction law that has been widely used against those who took part in the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, is already having an effect on some of the rioters. A small group of people convicted under the law have been released from custody \u2014 or will soon go free \u2014 even though the justices hearing arguments on Tuesday are not expected to decide the case for months. Over the past several weeks, federal judges in Washington have agreed to release about 10 defendants who were serving prison terms because of the obstruction law, saying the defendants could wait at home as the court determined whether the law should have been used at all to keep them locked up. Among those already free is Matthew Bledsoe, the owner of a moving company from Tennessee who scaled a wall outside the Capitol and then paraded through the building with a Trump flag, ultimately planting it in the arm of a statue of President Gerald R. Ford. Soon to be released are defendants like Kevin Seefried, a drywall installer from Delaware who carried a Confederate flag through the Capitol, and Alexander Sheppard, an Ohio man who overran police lines to become one of the first people to break into the building. The interrupted sentences \u2014 which could be reinstated depending on how the Supreme Court rules \u2014 are just one of the complications to have emerged from the court's review of the obstruction statute, known in the penal code as 18 U.S.C. 1512. The charge has been used so far against more than 350 rioters, including Jacob Chansley, the so-called QAnon Shaman, and members of the far-right extremist groups the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. When the justices announced in December that they planned to scrutinize the law, many legal experts expressed concern that a ruling narrowing its scope or striking down its use in Jan. 6-related cases could deliver a devastating blow to the Justice Department's efforts to hold hundreds of rioters accountable. Federal prosecutors have often used the obstruction count in lieu of more politically fraught charges like seditious conspiracy to punish the central event of Jan. 6: the disruption of a proceeding at the Capitol to certify the election. But in the past few months, judges and prosecutors working on Capitol riot cases have quietly adjusted to the potential threat from a Supreme Court ruling, and the risk that there could be catastrophic consequences to the cases overall no longer seems as grave. For one thing, there are currently no defendants facing only the obstruction charge, according to the Justice Department. Every rioter indicted on that count has also been charged with other crimes, meaning that even if the obstruction law is removed as a tool of the Jan. 6 prosecutions, there would not be any cases that would disappear entirely. Indeed, if the court rules that the obstruction count does not apply to the Capitol attack, the main effect of the decision would be on the sentences defendants face. The obstruction law carries a hefty maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and while few, if any, rioters have gotten that much, the statute has routinely resulted in terms of several years. But some judges have already signaled they would increase the sentences stemming from other charges if the obstruction count was not available to them. In February, for example, Judge Royce C. Lamberth denied an early release to an Iowa man named Leo Kelly, who was sentenced to 30 months in prison on the obstruction count and six other misdemeanors. Judge Lamberth's reason for not setting Mr. Kelly free? Even if the Supreme Court ruled he was not permitted to sentence Mr. Kelly for obstruction, Judge Lamberth said he could increase the defendant's total time in prison by imposing consecutive, not concurrent, terms on the misdemeanor charges.  \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe Supreme Court is hearing arguments on Tuesday in a case that could eliminate some of the federal charges against former President Donald J.

It is uncontroversial to reinforce that destroying documents to impede an investigation has been a core purpose of the law, which was prompted by the shredding of documents in an accounting scandal.\nThe second part of the provision makes it a crime 'otherwise' to corruptly obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding. Prosecutors say the defendant in the case, Joseph W. Fischer, did that by joining the mob that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\nThe heart of the case is how the first part of the provision pivots to the second part.\nThe ordinary meaning of 'otherwise,' prosecutors say, is 'in a different manner.' That means, they say, that the obstruction of official proceedings need not involve the destruction of evidence. The second part, they say, is a broad catchall for any kind of corrupt interference with an official proceeding.\nLawyers for Mr. Fischer, the defendant in Tuesday's case, counter that the first part must inform and limit the second one \u2014 meaning that the obstruction of official proceedings must be linked to the destruction of evidence. They would read 'otherwise' as 'similarly.'\nThe alternative, they say, would be to create a crime of breathtaking scope that would allow prosecutors to charge political protesters and others with felonies carrying 20-year prison sentences.\nIn 2008, in Begay v. United States, the court considered a law with a broadly similar structure, the Armed Career Criminal Act, which requires mandatory sentences for people convicted of possessing firearms if they have earlier been found guilty of three violent felonies. In one clause, it listed specific crimes that qualified as violent felonies \u2014 including burglary, arson and extortion.\nThen, as in the new case, there followed an 'otherwise' clause, this one adding any crime that 'otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.'\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the examples informed and limited the sweep of the 'otherwise' clause. If Congress had 'meant the statute to be all-encompassing, it is hard to see why it would have needed to include the examples at all,' Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote for the majority.\nA drunken driving offense, the court ruled, did not qualify as one of the covered crimes even though the plain words of the clause would seem to encompass it.\nMr. Fisher's lawyers say that the 'otherwise' clause in the obstruction statute must also be anchored in the preceding clause.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit disagreed, with Judge Florence Y. Pan writing that the two uses of 'otherwise' were different. The gun law, she wrote, 'includes a list of examples followed by \u2018otherwise' in a single, unbroken sentence.'\nBy contrast, she wrote, the 'otherwise' in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 'sits within a separately numbered subparagraph, after a semicolon and line break, all of which put distance between it and the lists of verbs and objects' in the previous part.\nIn dissent, Judge Gregory G. Katsas wrote that 'the relationship created by the word otherwise does not depend on punctuation or line breaks.'\notherwise does not depend on punctuation or line breaks.' Rather, he wrote, 'it flows from the connotation of similarity,' among other factors. That meant, he concluded, that the second part of the provision applies 'only to acts that affect the integrity or availability of evidence.'\nApril 16, 2024, 10:13 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 10:13 a.m. ET Justice Clarence Thomas asked the first question, in keeping with the court's practice since the pandemic.

But the court's decision on how the law applies to the rioters on the ground on Jan. 6 could affect Trump's case too.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT The Supreme Court in Washington. Credit... Kenny Holston/The New York Times At its core, the case is about the meaning of a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. It was enacted following the collapse of Enron, a giant energy company, after the exposure of widespread accounting fraud and the destruction of documents by the company's outside auditor.\nThere is an uneasy fit between the immediate purpose of the law and its recent use in more than 300 prosecutions arising from the violent riot that forced a halt to the constitutionally required congressional count of presidential electors' ballots.\nAt least part of what it meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code at the time: It was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself.\nThe law meant to close that gap. It did, in a two-part provision, Section 1512(c) of the federal criminal code:\n(c) Whoever corruptly \u2014\n\u2014 (1) alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object , or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding\n, or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding or (2) otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding , or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.\n, or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. The first part focuses on evidence, making it a felony to tamper with it to affect an official proceeding. The second part makes it a crime 'otherwise' to corruptly obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding.\nThe heart of this case is the pivot from the first part to the second part. The ordinary meaning of 'otherwise,' prosecutors say, is 'in a different manner.' That means, they say, that the obstruction of official proceedings need not involve the destruction of evidence \u2014 in their view, making the second part a broad catchall for any kind of corrupt interference with an official proceeding.\nThe lawyers for Joseph W. Fischer, who was accused of breaching the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and of assaulting police officers, counter that the first part must inform and limit the second one \u2014 meaning that the obstruction of official proceedings must be linked to the destruction of evidence. They would read 'otherwise' as 'similarly.'\nThe alternative, they say, would be to create a felony of breathtaking scope that would allow prosecutors to charge political protesters with felonies carrying 20-year prison sentences.\nApril 16, 2024, 10:11 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 10:11 a.m. ET Two lawyers will argue: Jeffrey T.

Michelle Gustafson for The New York Times While the Supreme Court's hearing is intended to determine the scope and validity of an obstruction law used against hundreds of rioters who broke into the Capitol on Jan. 6, any decision could also have an impact on a separate criminal case: one in which former President Donald J. Trump has been accused of plotting to overturn the 2020 election.\nTwo of the four criminal counts Mr. Trump is facing in that case are based on the obstruction law. In an indictment filed in Washington last summer, he was charged with conspiring to obstruct the certification of the election on Jan. 6 during a joint session of Congress at the Capitol as well as with actually obstructing it.\nIf the justices determine that prosecutors improperly used the obstruction law against members of the pro-Trump mob who disrupted the session, Mr. Trump's lawyers will surely seek to have the charges against him dismissed as well. In fact, they already tried that in October. They argued unsuccessfully to the trial judge in the case that Mr. Trump's indictment unfairly used the statute, which was initially 'directed at the destruction of records in accounting fraud,' by applying it 'to disputing the outcome of a presidential election.'\n'This stretches the statutory language beyond any plausible mooring to its text,' the lawyers wrote.\nJack Smith, the special counsel handling Mr. Trump's case, has told the Supreme Court that the two obstruction counts against the former president would be still valid even if the justices narrowed the law to cover only crimes that involved tampering with documents or records.\nMr. Trump triggered that provision of the law, Mr. Smith has said, by plotting to create fake slates of electors that claimed he won in several keys swing states that he actually lost to President Biden. Mr. Smith has accused Mr. Trump of trying to use those fake slates to throw the certification proceeding into chaos and by urging his vice president, Mike Pence, to capitalize on the confusion by single-handedly declaring him the winner of the race.\nEven if the obstruction count were ultimately removed from Trump's indictment, it would probably not be a fatal blow.\nThe indictment contains two other conspiracy counts that overlap almost entirely with the accusations in the obstruction counts. One of the conspiracy charges accuses Mr. Trump of committing fraud by using deceit to subvert the normal course of the election. The other charges him with plotting to deprive millions of Americans of the right to have votes properly counted.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET A little backstory on why prosecutors opted to charge so many defendants with obstruction: Michael Sherwin, the U.S. attorney in Washington who initially led the Jan. 6 prosecution, promised 'shock and awe' in charging as many people as possible. But using overtly political crimes like insurrection or seditious conspiracy turned out not to be legally feasible. The government settled on using the obstruction count to describe how the election's certification proceeding was disrupted by defendants who went beyond mere trespass or assault.\nApril 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET Prosecutors tried to set general rules for who was charged with the obstruction count. It was often used if a defendant actually entered the Senate chamber or made their way into congressional offices. It was also used if there was evidence that a defendant's behavior had some sort of role in chasing lawmakers away from their sworn duties to certify the election on Jan. 6.\nApril 16, 2024, 9:54 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:54 a.m. ET Of course, one of the biggest attractions of this obstruction count to prosecutors is that it carries a hefty 20-year maximum sentence.

Hailey Sadler for The New York Times The investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack is already the largest criminal inquiry in Justice Department history, federal prosecutors have said. And even after more than three years, it has shown little sign of slowing down.\nEvery week, a few more rioters are arrested and charges against them are unsealed in Federal District Court in Washington. Prosecutors have suggested that a total of 2,000 or 2,500 people could ultimately face indictment for their roles in the attack.\nMore than 1,380 people had been charged in connection with the attack as of early this month, according to the Justice Department. Among the most common charges brought against them are two misdemeanors: illegal parading inside the Capitol and entering and remaining in a restricted federal area, a type of trespassing.\nAbout 350 rioters have been accused of violating the obstruction statute that the Supreme Court is considering at its hearing, and nearly 500 people have been charged with assaulting police officers. Many rioters have been charged with multiple crimes, the most serious of which so far has been seditious conspiracy.\nAlmost 800 defendants have already pleaded guilty; about 250 of them have done so to felony charges. Prosecutors have won the vast majority of the cases that have gone to trial: More than 150 defendants have been convicted at trial and only two have been fully acquitted.\nMore than 850 people have been sentenced so far, and about 520 have received at least some time in prison. The stiffest penalties have been handed down to the former leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, far-right extremist groups that played central roles in the Capitol attack.\nEnrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys leader, was sentenced to 22 years in prison, and Stewart Rhodes, who once led the Oath Keepers, was given an 18-year term.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 16, 2024, 9:36 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:36 a.m. ET All along the defense lawyers have claimed that federal prosecutors stretched the statute in an unprecedented way to fit the central crime that took place at the Capitol on Jan. 6: the disruption of the certification of the election. Then again, nothing like the storming of the Capitol had ever happened before. So perhaps it's no surprise that prosecutors use the obstruction law in a novel manner.\nApril 16, 2024, 9:31 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:31 a.m. ET It's worth remembering as today's hearing is poised to get underway that lawyers defending Jan. 6 rioters have been questioning the government's use of this particular obstruction law from the very outset of criminal cases being filed by the Justice Department.

A mob walked to the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times The man whose case led to the Supreme Court hearing on a controversial federal obstruction law is a former police officer from rural Pennsylvania indicted on charges of storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and crashing into a line of his fellow officers defending the building.\nJoseph W. Fischer was working for the police department in North Cornwall Township, Pa., when prosecutors say he pushed his way into the Capitol while holding up his cellphone to take videos of the surge. Once inside, he and another rioter 'galloped forward,' prosecutors say, making contact with a line of officers who were fighting off the crowd.\nMr. Fischer fell to the ground and, as some nearby officers helped him to his feet, he tried to engage with them, prosecutors say.\n'I'm a cop too,' he said, 'sometimes the country is worth more than your job.'\nAccording to court papers, Mr. Fischer was concerned about his own job before making the trip to Washington. Investigators unearthed text messages he wrote to the chief of his department, saying that things could get 'violent' on Jan. 6 and that the crowd should 'storm the capital and drag all the democrates.'\nHe also warned the chief that he might need him to post his bail, the papers said.\nTownship officials suspended Mr. Fischer without pay on the day of his arrest in February 2021 and later fired him. But he has pushed back against the government's description of behavior on Jan. 6.\nHis lawyers say that he and a companion were prepared to leave Washington that day after listening President Trump's speech near the White House and turned around to head toward the Capitol only after hearing about the mounting protest there. The lawyers also claim that Mr. Fischer arrived at the Capitol grounds well after Congress had recessed the proceeding to certify the results of the 2020 election because of the attack.\n'As Mr. Fischer walked toward the east side of the building, no barricades or fences impeded him,' the lawyers wrote in their brief to the Supreme Court.\nMr. Fischer has disputed the assertion by prosecutors that he charged the police line inside the Capitol, telling the court instead that he was pushed into the officers by 'the weight of the crowd.'\nHe also characterized his interactions with the officers differently than prosecutors did, claiming that he merely talked with one of the officers and patted him on the shoulder.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT The Supreme Court has said that the purpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was 'to safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets following the collapse of Enron.' Credit...The provision at issue in the case is part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a 2002 law enacted after the collapse of Enron, a giant energy company, after the exposure of widespread accounting fraud and the destruction of documents by its outside auditor, Arthur Andersen.\nThe Supreme Court has said that the purpose of the law was 'to safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets following the collapse of Enron.'\nAt least part of what the law meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code: it was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was meant to close that gap.\nLawyers for Joseph W. Fischer, charged under the law with obstructing an official proceeding by joining the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, said his case had an Alice-in-Wonderland quality.\n'The Through the Looking Glass moment here,' they wrote in a Supreme Court brief, 'would be for those who wrote the Sarbanes-Oxley Act upon learning that they had created a new and breathtaking obstruction offense by endeavoring to close the narrow Enron-Arthur Anderson loophole.'\nIndeed, in a different case on the scope of the statute, one of the sponsors of the law, Michael Oxley, filed a supporting brief saying prosecutors had interpreted it too broadly. The law meant to address 'specific loopholes' that Arthur Andersen 'had exploited when they shredded business documents and destroyed hard drives in anticipation of federal law-enforcement action,' wrote Mr. Oxley, a former Ohio representative who died in 2016.\nIn that case, concerning a separate provision of the law, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the law's origins informed its meaning and spared the defendant.\n'The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, all agree, was prompted by the exposure of Enron's massive accounting fraud and revelations that the company's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen, had systematically destroyed potentially incriminating documents,' she wrote for four of the justices in the majority. She added that the government had acknowledged that the provision 'was intended to prohibit, in particular, corporate document-shredding to hide evidence of financial wrongdoing.'\nA correction was made on : An earlier version of this article misstated the year of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.

Erin Schaff/The New York Times The Supreme Court's decision to consider the soundness of an obstruction law that has been widely used against those who took part in the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, is already having an effect on some of the rioters.\nA small group of people convicted under the law have been released from custody \u2014 or will soon go free \u2014 even though the justices hearing arguments on Tuesday are not expected to decide the case for months.\nOver the past several weeks, federal judges in Washington have agreed to release about 10 defendants who were serving prison terms because of the obstruction law, saying the defendants could wait at home as the court determined whether the law should have been used at all to keep them locked up.\nAmong those already free is Matthew Bledsoe, the owner of a moving company from Tennessee who scaled a wall outside the Capitol and then paraded through the building with a Trump flag, ultimately planting it in the arm of a statue of President Gerald R. Ford.\nSoon to be released are defendants like Kevin Seefried, a drywall installer from Delaware who carried a Confederate flag through the Capitol, and Alexander Sheppard, an Ohio man who overran police lines to become one of the first people to break into the building.\nThe interrupted sentences \u2014 which could be reinstated depending on how the Supreme Court rules \u2014 are just one of the complications to have emerged from the court's review of the obstruction statute, known in the penal code as 18 U.S.C. 1512. The charge has been used so far against more than 350 rioters, including Jacob Chansley, the so-called QAnon Shaman, and members of the far-right extremist groups the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers.\nWhen the justices announced in December that they planned to scrutinize the law, many legal experts expressed concern that a ruling narrowing its scope or striking down its use in Jan. 6-related cases could deliver a devastating blow to the Justice Department's efforts to hold hundreds of rioters accountable.\nFederal prosecutors have often used the obstruction count in lieu of more politically fraught charges like seditious conspiracy to punish the central event of Jan. 6: the disruption of a proceeding at the Capitol to certify the election.\nBut in the past few months, judges and prosecutors working on Capitol riot cases have quietly adjusted to the potential threat from a Supreme Court ruling, and the risk that there could be catastrophic consequences to the cases overall no longer seems as grave.\nFor one thing, there are currently no defendants facing only the obstruction charge, according to the Justice Department. Every rioter indicted on that count has also been charged with other crimes, meaning that even if the obstruction law is removed as a tool of the Jan. 6 prosecutions, there would not be any cases that would disappear entirely.\nIndeed, if the court rules that the obstruction count does not apply to the Capitol attack, the main effect of the decision would be on the sentences defendants face. The obstruction law carries a hefty maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and while few, if any, rioters have gotten that much, the statute has routinely resulted in terms of several years.\nBut some judges have already signaled they would increase the sentences stemming from other charges if the obstruction count was not available to them.\nIn February, for example, Judge Royce C. Lamberth denied an early release to an Iowa man named Leo Kelly, who was sentenced to 30 months in prison on the obstruction count and six other misdemeanors.\nJudge Lamberth's reason for not setting Mr. Kelly free?\nEven if the Supreme Court ruled he was not permitted to sentence Mr. Kelly for obstruction, Judge Lamberth said he could increase the defendant's total time in prison by imposing consecutive, not concurrent, terms on the misdemeanor charges.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Adam Liptak","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/16/multimedia/16scotus-obstruction-obstruction-law-zvhq/16scotus-obstruction-obstruction-law-zvhq-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":1.8885851,"_id":"5be306034a019d7118aa996c56139adc"}],"user_input":{"q":"Biden","search_in":["title_summary_en"],"lang":["en"],"not_lang":null,"countries":null,"not_countries":null,"from":"2024-04-15 00:00:00","to":null,"ranked_only":"True","from_rank":null,"to_rank":null,"sort_by":"relevancy","page":1,"size":100,"sources":["nytimes.com"],"not_sources":[],"topic":null,"published_date_precision":null}}
