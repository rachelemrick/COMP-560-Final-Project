If this continues for more than eight weeks, the coral can die.\nCoral reefs can survive bleaching, but they need time - often decades - to recover.\nAs the Earth's temperature changes due to global warming - so does the risk of mass bleaching - because sea temperatures are increasing.\n\"If given a chance, coral are actually resilient and can recover.

That could be set to change, with Egypt preparing to table a proposal to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the 2036 Games.\nWith construction on potential venues well under way - and some already completed - one Egyptian official has declared it is \"time for Africa\".\n\"We can't claim the IOC and the Olympic Games to be universal without hosting a Games on the African continent,\" Dr Kamilla Swart-Arries, an expert in sport, tourism, and events management, told BBC Sport Africa.\nBut what would it take for the continent to host the Olympics for the first time?\nAfrica has previously put on large sporting events, including the 1995 Rugby World Cup and 2010 Fifa World Cup in South Africa, while Morocco will co-host football's biggest tournament in 2030.\nDakar in Senegal is preparing for the 2026 Youth Olympic Games, but the sheer scale and cost of hosting the Olympics presents the main challenge for any African bid to overcome.\nThere will be 10,500 athletes competing in 329 events in Paris, with the Paralympics in August and September featuring 4,400 athletes in 549 events.\nAround 15 million tourists are expected to visit the French capital.\nAccording to Sharif El Erian, the secretary general of Egypt's National Olympic Committee (NOC), there are \"very few countries in Africa\" which have the capability to host the Games.\n\"They were totally right not to come to Africa before,\" he told BBC Sport Africa.\n\"If you want me to pick three countries who are the best when it comes to facilities in Africa, I can pick easily: Egypt, South Africa and Morocco.

And in places where cities grow without the right planning and infrastructure to deal with rainwater, the risk increases.\nBrazil is the worst-affected country in Latin America, but Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador and Argentina also suffer from the same problem. And beyond the continent, countries in Africa, such as Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria - where some gullies are more than 2km long - are also affected.\nThis type of erosion threatens fertile agricultural land in some parts of China, the US and Europe too.\n'Too dangerous' to live here\n'Too dangerous' to live here There are no official statistics for gully-related deaths, but the authorities in Buriticupu say gullies have swallowed up at least 50 houses and some residents have had to abandon their homes, leaving neighbourhoods deserted.\nMarisa Cardoso Freire's house sits on the edge of a gully and was labelled 'high risk' by the local Civil Defence Force in May 2023.\nAlong with 100 other families , she had to leave her home and move to another part of Buriticupu.\n100 other families, she had to leave her home and move to another part of Buriticupu.

Deforestation plays a big part in this type of soil degradation.\nBuriticupu is now an arid, stony place but it is part of the Amazon rainforest and was once covered in trees, such as cedar, West Indian locust and ip\u00ea.\nIn the 1990s the timber industry was booming here. There were more than 50 sawmills working 24 hours a day. Twenty years later, most of the city's native vegetation was gone.\n'The issue of vegetation is essential, because during a rainy event, it reduces the impact of raindrops' Edilea Dutra Pereira\nGeologist and professor at the Federal University of Maranh\u00e3o\nWhen there are not enough plants or trees to absorb the rain\u2026\nthe drops dislodge soil particles and water collects on the surface.\nStreams form and wear the soil away.\nGullies or ravines can be created.\nWhen there are not enough plants or trees to absorb the rain\u2026\nthe drops dislodge soil particles and water collects on the surface.\nStreams form and wear the soil away.\nGullies or ravines can be created.\nClimate change can exacerbate the process in areas prone to gully erosion as it can lead to more intense rainfall.\nmore intense rainfall.

More than 60 municipalities went into a state of emergency, thousands of people were made homeless and there were dozens of deaths.\nThis ravine is one of about 30 in Buriticupu\n'Rainfall intensity is predicted to increase by 10% to 15% [globally by the end of the century]. That may not sound like much, but if you have more and more episodes of extreme rainfall, the dynamics of erosion changes,' says Matthias Vanmaercke, from KU Leuven University in Belgium.\nHe and his colleague Jean Poesen analysed data from more than 700 gullies around the world and concluded that if extreme rainfall increases by that amount, it could double (or even triple in the worst-case scenario) the risks of gully erosion.\n'You'll have a hard time finding a decent scientist that will not agree with the fact that climate change will probably make this worse,' Prof Vanmaercke says.\nFear of the rain\nrain This phenomenon is affecting people across the world, including millions in Africa.\nThe capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kinshasa , has hundreds of urban gullies - one of which is 2km long.
