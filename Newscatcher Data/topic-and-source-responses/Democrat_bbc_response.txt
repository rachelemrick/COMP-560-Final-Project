And it is advancing at a worrying speed, destroying thousands of homes in Latin America and Africa.\nFormer police officer Jos\u00e9 Ribamar Silveira was nearly killed when he fell into this gully.\nHe got lost as he was driving home from a party one night in May 2023.\nAs he turned the car around, the 79-year-old reversed and accelerated backwards. It was dark, there were no warning signs or barriers around the vo\u00e7oroca, and before he knew it, the car - with him inside - plunged into the vast hole.\n'When the car slid, even though it was falling quickly, I thought of my youngest son,' he tells the BBC.\nBaby Gael had turned four months old the day before. 'I asked God to protect me so that I could raise my little son,' says Lt Silveira.\nHe was knocked unconscious and woke up at the bottom of the ravine three hours later. After a complicated rescue operation and months of convalescence, he can now walk without crutches.\nJos\u00e9 Silveira nearly died when he fell into the ravine\nHis experience is a vivid example of the risks facing Buriticupu's 70,000 residents.\nAs more gullies appear, there are fears that the city in Maranh\u00e3o state, on the edge of the Amazon rainforest, could be split in two. At 350m above sea level, Buriticupu has about 30 gullies , with the largest two separated by less than 1km.\n30 gullies, with the largest two separated by less than 1km. 'If the authorities don't contain this, they will meet and form a river,' says Edilea Dutra Pereira, a geologist and professor at the Federal University of Maranh\u00e3o.\nGullies have been part of the Earth's geological history for millions of years.\nBut Prof Pereira and other experts we spoke to said that existing gullies are expanding more rapidly and they fear new ones will open because of climate change , which can make rainfall more intense.\nclimate change, which can make rainfall more intense. And in places where cities grow without the right planning and infrastructure to deal with rainwater, the risk increases.\nBrazil is the worst-affected country in Latin America, but Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador and Argentina also suffer from the same problem. And beyond the continent, countries in Africa, such as Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria - where some gullies are more than 2km long - are also affected.\nThis type of erosion threatens fertile agricultural land in some parts of China, the US and Europe too.\n'Too dangerous' to live here\n'Too dangerous' to live here There are no official statistics for gully-related deaths, but the authorities in Buriticupu say gullies have swallowed up at least 50 houses and some residents have had to abandon their homes, leaving neighbourhoods deserted.\nMarisa Cardoso Freire's house sits on the edge of a gully and was labelled 'high risk' by the local Civil Defence Force in May 2023.\nAlong with 100 other families , she had to leave her home and move to another part of Buriticupu.\n100 other families, she had to leave her home and move to another part of Buriticupu. City Hall promised to cover the rent of new homes for displaced people, but Marisa says the municipality has not paid rent on time and she has been threatened with eviction.\nWhen we contacted Buriticupu City Hall to ask what was happening, it failed to respond.\nMarisa is struggling to accept that she has lost her home\nAt Marisa's old home, two of the family's dogs fell into the canyon and died.\nThen one day she was trying to get her 10-year-old son Enzo, who is autistic, to come back into the house and she raised her voice.\nEnzo got angry and ran to the edge of the gully. 'If you shout at me again, I'll throw myself in the hole,' he threatened.\n'That's when I told my husband that we couldn't stay here any longer, it's too dangerous' Marisa Cardoso\nShe will probably never be able to live in the home she built.\n'When I left, my heart hurt because it's something we fought so hard to achieve.'\nHow did it reach this point?\nthis point? Deforestation plays a big part in this type of soil degradation.\nBuriticupu is now an arid, stony place but it is part of the Amazon rainforest and was once covered in trees, such as cedar, West Indian locust and ip\u00ea.\nIn the 1990s the timber industry was booming here. There were more than 50 sawmills working 24 hours a day. Twenty years later, most of the city's native vegetation was gone.\n'The issue of vegetation is essential, because during a rainy event, it reduces the impact of raindrops' Edilea Dutra Pereira\nGeologist and professor at the Federal University of Maranh\u00e3o\nWhen there are not enough plants or trees to absorb the rain\u2026\nthe drops dislodge soil particles and water collects on the surface.\nStreams form and wear the soil away.\nGullies or ravines can be created.\nWhen there are not enough plants or trees to absorb the rain\u2026\nthe drops dislodge soil particles and water collects on the surface.\nStreams form and wear the soil away.\nGullies or ravines can be created.\nClimate change can exacerbate the process in areas prone to gully erosion as it can lead to more intense rainfall.\nmore intense rainfall. Buriticupu is experiencing more violent storms than it used to, according to Juarez Mota Pinheiro, a climatologist at the Federal University of Maranh\u00e3o.\nIn the first months of 2023, the state of Maranh\u00e3o faced one of the worst floods in its history. More than 60 municipalities went into a state of emergency, thousands of people were made homeless and there were dozens of deaths.\nThis ravine is one of about 30 in Buriticupu\n'Rainfall intensity is predicted to increase by 10% to 15% [globally by the end of the century]. That may not sound like much, but if you have more and more episodes of extreme rainfall, the dynamics of erosion changes,' says Matthias Vanmaercke, from KU Leuven University in Belgium.\nHe and his colleague Jean Poesen analysed data from more than 700 gullies around the world and concluded that if extreme rainfall increases by that amount, it could double (or even triple in the worst-case scenario) the risks of gully erosion.\n'You'll have a hard time finding a decent scientist that will not agree with the fact that climate change will probably make this worse,' Prof Vanmaercke says.\nFear of the rain\nrain This phenomenon is affecting people across the world, including millions in Africa.\nThe capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kinshasa , has hundreds of urban gullies - one of which is 2km long. There are more than 165km of gullies in the city, which is home to 12 million people.\nKinshasa, has hundreds of urban gullies - one of which is 2km long. There are more than 165km of gullies in the city, which is home to 12 million people.\nA main road in the Mont Ngafula district in Kinshasa collapsed into a gully in 2021\nIn just one night of heavy rain in Kinshasa in December 2022, 60 people died when their homes fell into a ravine.\nAlexandre Kadada was there.\n'It happened within the space of 30 or 40 minutes. The gully started to open up and all the houses disappeared. The neighbourhood was unrecognisable,' he says.\n'My belongings, my house, everything was gone. I only saved my children and my wife.'\nMr Kadada's neighbour and her four children were among the victims. The woman's husband was left disabled.\nAlexandre Kadada is now president of a group representing victims of the tragedy\nMr Kadada's children are now frightened at the slightest hint of bad weather.\n'It was the rain that disrupted everything. The rain brought death and despair,' he says.\n'We really consider it to be a new geohazard of the Anthropocene,' says Prof Vanmaercke. The Anthropocene is a term used by some scientists to refer to recent times, when human activities have profoundly affected the planet.\nnew geohazard of the Anthropocene,' says Prof Vanmaercke. The Anthropocene is a term used by some scientists to refer to recent times, when human activities have profoundly affected the planet. The population of Kinshasa is expected to grow to 20 million by 2030 and 35 million by 2050, becoming the largest megacity in Africa, according to the World Bank.\nUncontrolled urban growth can involve cutting down trees \u2013 a natural barrier to erosion - and illegal occupation of potentially unstable areas.\nUncontrolled urban growth can involve cutting down trees \u2013 a natural barrier to erosion - and illegal occupation of potentially unstable areas. In Buriticupu, people also fear the rain.\n'There are times when land the size of a house collapses. It makes a violent noise, it shakes everything. Then people cry. The sadness it causes is crazy,' says 52-year-old Jo\u00e3o Batista, a mechanic who owns a workshop on the edge of a huge gully.\n'I've lost 40% of my customers. Many are afraid to stop by,' he says. But he refuses to leave.\nThe vo\u00e7oroca behind his workshop was once a playground for children, he says, but the gully swallowed everything.\nOther buildings near Batista's workshop have been abandoned","rights":"bbc.com","rank":79,"topic":"news","country":"GB","language":"en","authors":"BBC News Brasil,Shin Suzuki","media":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/raw/p0hrmg1l.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@BBCNews","_score":3.9738398,"_id":"2bef9f5af519749ab56c2f72cf19dd35"}],"user_input":{"q":"Democrat","search_in":["title_summary_en"],"lang":["en"],"not_lang":null,"countries":null,"not_countries":null,"from":"2024-04-16 00:00:00","to":null,"ranked_only":"True","from_rank":null,"to_rank":null,"sort_by":"relevancy","page":1,"size":100,"sources":["bbc.com"],"not_sources":[],"topic":null,"published_date_precision":null}}
