Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), the House Oversight Committee chairman reiterated repeatedly debunked claims.","summary":"House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer's (R-Ky.) angry effort to rebut the committee's top Democrat Rep. Jamie Raskin's (D-Md.) rhetoric in the middle of a hearing on Wednesday got off to an unusually promising start. The now-discredited allegation that President Biden had taken a hefty bribe from a Ukrainian businessman was, in fact, not the 'genesis' of the Republican-led investigation into Biden as Raskin had said; instead, it was merely one of several ultimately unproductive avenues of inquiry that Comer and his allies explored.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nThen, goaded into a debate by Raskin, Comer quickly lost the high ground.\n'If you believe that it would have been illegal for Joe Biden to take $5 million from Ukraine \u2014 it certainly would have been,' Raskin asked. 'What do you think about Donald Trump taking more than $5 million from the Chinese government while he was president?'\nAdvertisement\n'Well, we know that Donald Trump had a legitimate business that he talked about, and he campaigned on,' Comer said. He followed that up a moment later with a question: 'What business were the Bidens in?'\nComer has been told the answer to this question again and again but \u2014 either because he refuses to acknowledge any fruit of his investigation that undermines his case or because he somehow remains unaware of it \u2014 he still presents it as though it is unanswered.\nBefore we again explain the answer, it's worth addressing Raskin's allegation about money from the Chinese government. It is the case that the Trump Organization received millions of dollars in foreign income from two of its properties while Trump was president, including rent paid by a state-owned Chinese bank for space at Trump Tower. Comer's response, in essence, can be distilled thusly: Because Americans knew or could have known Trump had foreign business partners when he was elected, the money he received at his businesses \u2014 however subsequently inflated \u2014 is off the rhetorical table.\nAdvertisement\nSo we return to Comer's question: What business were the Bidens in?\nThere are a few Bidens at issue here, but the investigation largely centered on the president's brother, James, and son Hunter in an unsuccessful effort to link their partnerships back to the president.\nJames Biden explained his work when he was interviewed by investigators working for Comer's committee.\n'I have a company that provides voluntary worksite benefits to major institutions on behalf of the employees,' he said during the February deposition. Asked about specific limited-liability companies he and his wife had established, he explained further that he was also engaged in 'consulting in many different areas.' When he and Hunter Biden worked together, he explained, 'I basically consulted with and gave advice to Hunter Biden, who is my nephew, \u2026 depending on what the particular enterprise was at the time.'\nAdvertisement\nHunter Biden explained his background at length when he testified that same month.\n'I was a vice president at a major national bank, where I worked in the General Counsel's Office and then as manager of a unit within the Fraud Department,' he said. 'I was executive director of e-commerce policy coordination with the Department of Commerce during the Clinton administration. I founded and built a successful law firm, Oldaker, Biden & Belair, and represented not-for-profit institutions, including close to a dozen primarily Jesuit universities all over the country from Philadelphia to Los Angeles, from Detroit to Denver, and everywhere in between. I then founded and built the successful small business in advising global infrastructure and alternative investment clients.'\nWhen the Oversight Committee interviewed Hunter Biden's former partner Devon Archer last year, Archer confirmed that Hunter Biden had been asked to join the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma for the reason Hunter Biden himself indicated: as an expert in corporate governance. Archer and Biden disagree on the extent to which Biden's last name was an additional incentive, but it remains that Comer's demand has an answer.\nAdvertisement\nQuestioning Raskin about the Bidens' work, Comer established the sorts of business that, in his estimation, qualified as legitimate ones for engaging with foreign partners: 'Did they have hotels? Did they have a social media company? Did they have golf courses? Did they have casinos? Did they have office buildings?' Those are all things in which Trump has been involved, of course, but the idea that owning a casino is less fraught for a political actor than providing advisory services on business partnerships is certainly unusual.\nAs is common, Comer also misrepresented the foreign money that Hunter and James Biden had received. (None of it has been shown to have gone to President Biden.) Raskin, answering Comer's question about what work the Bidens had done, noted that the president earned money after serving as vice president in part by writing a book.\n'That's why Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Romania, China, Russia \u2014 that's why they paid the Biden family money, because of Joe Biden's book?' Comer asked.\nAdvertisement\nIn the same way that Comer often conflates Hunter Biden and his father by referring to 'the Biden family,' he's presenting money that came from people who live in a country with money that came explicitly from the country itself \u2014 i.e., from its government. His inclusion of Russia on that list is particularly egregious since Archer explicitly testified that the money at issue went solely to himself and not to Hunter (or any other) Biden. Again something that Comer should certainly know.\nRep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) tried multiple times to interject as Comer and Raskin yelled at one another, offering answers to Comer's questions. When the time came for this five minutes of questioning the hearing witness \u2014 the hearing being focused on Chinese efforts to exert influence in the U.S., mind you, not the impeachment inquiry \u2014 he came back to the 'What do the Bidens do?' question.\n'Hunter Biden was a corporate governance lawyer appointed by George Bush to the Amtrak board, and then served on a number of corporate boards and investment firms,' Goldman said. 'Jim Biden is a businessman. Joe Biden is the president of the United States and has been a public servant and elected official for the better part of 50 years.'\nAdvertisement\nHe acknowledged that Comer might want to question whether Hunter Biden was qualified for his consulting gigs.\n'But that has nothing to do with your jurisdiction or the impeachment investigation,' Goldman said, 'because you cannot link any of his business dealings a) to any foreign government \u2014 which he was never paid by, unlike Donald Trump's and Donald Trump's family, 'or b) to the president of the United States. And that's why your impeachment investigation is a spectacular failure.'\nThe spat between Raskin and Comer had concluded a while earlier with Comer attempting to declare victory.\n'We'll let the record show that Mr. Raskins could not answer the question,' he said, 'what did the Bidens do to deserve the money.'\nRaskin first angrily noted that his last name was 'Raskin.' ('We've sat next to each other for more than a year,' he said. 'You don't have to add the S.') Then he insisted that Comer identify what crime President Biden had committed that would warrant impeachment.\n'Well, you're about to find out, very soon,' Comer replied.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Philip Bump,National Columnist","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MKYV263AEDYBAO7NUVHOVJOXBY_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.522291,"_id":"1a5c7f3d593039d7c707d44fe48d8cfc"},{"title":"Kennedy family members' embrace carries deeper meaning for Biden","author":"Tyler Pager","published_date":"2024-04-21 10:00:14","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/21/biden-kennedy-family-members-endorsement-catholic-tragedy-rfk-jfk","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Biden has longstanding ties to the family of the only other Catholic president, sharing politics and tragedy.","summary":"Growing up in a proud Irish Catholic middle-class family, Joe Biden's family idolized the Kennedys. They saw the Kennedys \u2014 successful, wealthy, attractive Irish Catholics \u2014 as the embodiment of the American Dream. Biden says Robert F. Kennedy Sr., whose bust sits in the Oval Office, inspired him to become a public defender and ultimately run for office.\n'The Kennedys were, as a group, the people he patterned his life after,' said former senator Ted Kaufman (D-Del.), who was Biden's longtime chief of staff and remains his close friend. 'Not just his political life, but his life.'\nSo when the Kennedy family rallied behind Biden last week in Philadelphia with a full-throated endorsement of his reelection campaign, pointedly choosing him over one of their own \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running as an independent \u2014 it was not just politically helpful. It was a hugely personal victory for Biden, too.\nAdvertisement\nPrivately, Biden told aides that Thursday was one of the best days of his campaign, according to people familiar with his comments who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. The event included more than a dozen members of the extended Kennedy family, including six of Kennedy Jr.'s siblings, and Biden was particularly moved when they said the president was the candidate carrying on their family's legacy.\nPublicly, Biden was visibly touched by the fulsome endorsement by Kerry Kennedy, his rival's sister.\n'That was the most meaningful introduction I've ever gotten in my life, other than when my sister introduced me,' Biden said Thursday after her introduction.\nThe Kennedy family hopes their endorsement will help Biden politically. Kennedy Jr.'s independent presidential campaign threatens to siphon votes from Biden, increasingly worrying Democrats that he could meaningfully hurt the president's chances of defeating Donald Trump. The outcome could hinge on a few thousand votes in key states, and many Democrats say they lost the White House in 2000 and 2016 due to such third-party insurgencies.\nAdvertisement\nInside the Kennedy family, Kennedy Jr.'s quixotic campaign has been painful, people familiar with their discussions said. Initially, when he was challenging Biden for the Democratic nomination, his family was frustrated \u2014 and made clear that they stood with Biden \u2014 but largely ignored the candidacy publicly. They were unconcerned about Kennedy Jr.'s impact on the election, since Biden was almost certain to defeat him the Democratic nomination.\nBut as an independent candidate who is winning ballot access around the country, members of the family have grown increasingly concerned about his ability to influence the election \u2014 and damage their family's legacy.\n'Nearly every single grandchild of Joe and Rose Kennedy supports Joe Biden,' Kerry Kennedy said in her introduction of Biden. 'That's right, the Kennedy family endorses Joe Biden for president.'\nAdvertisement\nShe later directly compared Biden to her father, the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (D-N.Y.).\n'Daddy stood for equal justice, for human rights and freedom from want and fear,' she said, 'just as President Biden does today.'\nThe Kennedy family occupies an unusual place in the U.S. political imagination. President John F. Kennedy was a youthful, charismatic president who energized a generation of Americans until his shocking assassination in 1963. His brother Robert, a more tortured figure, was seen by many Democrats as the embodiment of tragic idealism after his own assassination in 1968 as he campaigned for president.\nScandal has also followed the family, and while members of the next generation have also won political office, none have ascended to the heights of political and cultural influence of their parents. Yet the Kennedy mystique persists for many Democratic voters, especially older ones.\nAdvertisement\nThat backdrop is one reason the candidacy of Kennedy Jr. has thrown such a twist into the current presidential campaign. The son and namesake of the revered senator has embraced controversial, unfounded claims on everything including vaccines and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol \u2014 rattling many Democrats and, it seems, some of his own family members.\nSeveral of those relatives have had pointed conversations with Kennedy Jr. about his candidacy, but to no avail, and many close to him say they do not believe he will drop out of the race. That understanding fueled the family's desire to join in a public endorsement of Biden, the people familiar on their conversations said.\n'This has not been easy for anybody, and I think what shouldn't be lost on anybody is despite the framing of the event, that was not an easy thing for anybody to do given the dynamics of this race,' former congressman Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.), a grandson of the elder Robert F. Kennedy who now serves as Biden's special envoy for Northern Ireland, said in an interview. 'But it was an important thing to do.'\nAdvertisement\nHe, like other members of his family, declined to comment directly on his uncle's presidential campaign. A number of the candidate's family members have condemned Kennedy's comments on vaccines and other matters, but they have been careful not to frame their endorsement of Biden as an explicit rebuke of their relative. Instead, they say it is a reflection of their belief there are only two possible outcomes in November: Biden wins, or former president Trump wins.\n'Given the reality that we're in, there are only two people that have the ability to win this race,' Joe Kennedy said. 'There's only two parties that have the structures in place to be able to win this race. So any additional candidate in that dynamic is taking support away from one side or the other.'\nFor his part, Kennedy Jr. has not commented on his family's endorsement since the event occurred. Before his siblings gathered with Biden, however, he wrote on social media, 'I hear some of my family will be endorsing President Biden today. I am pleased they are politically active \u2014 it's a family tradition. We are divided in our opinions but united in our love for each other.'\nAdvertisement\nAt 81 years old, Biden has found that his own path \u2014 involving both enormous political success and immense personal tragedy \u2014 in some ways mirrors that of the Kennedy family.\nAfter being steeped in Kennedy lore as a child, Biden found solace in the family's embrace when he faced the death of those closest to him. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate in 1972, and before he was even sworn in, Biden's wife and daughter were killed in a car crash. His sons Beau and Hunter were injured, and Biden considered relinquishing his seat to take care of them.\nBut Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), along with other colleagues, convinced Biden to stay. Kennedy helped Biden set up his Senate office, becoming a mentor and close friend.\n'I know the president is somebody that has a deep value on family and puts a big premium on loyalty, and when you are there for somebody at their most vulnerable, he remembers it,' Joe Kennedy said about his family's connection with Biden. 'It's that relationship that I think has had a huge impact on members in both families, particularly for an older generation. They've gone through immense loss, too, and so has he, so there's a commonality there.'\nIn addition to Joe Kennedy, many other Kennedys work in Biden's administration: Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of President John F. Kennedy, is ambassador to Australia; Victoria Reggie Kennedy, Edward Kennedy's widow, is the ambassador to Austria; Katherine Kennedy Townsend, one of Kennedy Jr.'s siblings who stood onstage with Biden, previously worked in Biden's Labor Department as an adviser on retirement and pension issues. (The two ambassadors cannot engage in political activity and were not included in Thursday's endorsement event).\nThat Philadelphia rally, which was largely spearheaded by Joe Kennedy and Kerry Kennedy, came after family members made clear they wanted to publicly endorse the president. It took months to organize, given the family's sprawling size. While there was some discussion of holding the event in Massachusetts, the Kennedys' traditional home, family members decided against it because most of them no longer live in the state.\nAdvertisement\nThey Kennedys also wanted to campaign in a battleground state, and after the rally, some of then went door-knocking and met with Biden campaign volunteers in Philadelphia.\nThis month, nearly 50 members of the Kennedy clan gathered at the White House for the annual St. Patrick's Day celebration, staying for a private tour of the Oval Office and posing for a photo with Biden in the Rose Garden. Biden and many of the Kennedys shared the photo on social media, the first implicit rebuke of Kennedy Jr.'s campaign by his family members.\nof the Kennedy clan gathered at the White House for the annual St. Patrick's Day celebration, staying for a private tour of the Oval Office and posing for a photo with Biden in the Rose Garden. Biden and many of the Kennedys shared the photo on social media, the first implicit rebuke of Kennedy Jr.'s campaign by his family members.\nBut during that visit, just as in Thursday's event, Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign did not explicitly come up, family members said.\n'A lot of what was going in the Oval Office, people were talking to him about President Kennedy being there, and my father, and where he put the bust and why he likes to look at the bust of my father when he is making difficult decisions,' Kathleen Kennedy Townsend said.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Tyler Pager","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SYYVSPQY2B6S5DTB6RZEJSGTJI.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.5138736,"_id":"b2762c883a52df7daa64b9e8e0a82e02"},{"title":"White House rejects long-shot House Republican effort to get President Joe Biden to testify","author":"Farnoush Amiri","published_date":"2024-04-16 01:32:45","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/15/president-joe-biden-james-comer-impeachment-congress/398440b6-fb91-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The White House is rejecting a long-shot effort from House Republicans to get President Joe Biden to testify before lawmakers in the GOP's stalled impeachment inquiry","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House on Monday rejected a long-shot effort from House Republicans to get President Joe Biden to testify before lawmakers in the GOP's stalled impeachment inquiry.\nIn a letter to House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, the White House dismissed the invitation sent to Biden last month, calling it a 'partisan charade' in an impeachment probe that has unearthed no evidence implicating the president in any wrongdoing while in public office. House Republicans had been seeking information related to the Biden family's business dealings in what the GOP characterized as an alleged influence-peddling scheme.\n'Your Committee's purported \u2018impeachment inquiry' has succeeded only in turning up abundant evidence that, in fact, the President has done nothing wrong,' Richard Sauber, special counsel to the president, wrote in the letter sent to Comer on Monday.\nAdvertisement\nSauber added, 'Your insistence on peddling these false and unsupported allegations despite ample evidence to the contrary makes one thing about your investigation abundantly clear: The facts do not matter to you.'\nSauber himself is leaving the White House early next month, another sign from the administration's perspective that the House Republicans' push to impeach Biden is largely over.

Kennedy Jr. taking more votes from Trump than Biden. And they're not the only polls to suggest a changing dynamic.","summary":"It's been something approaching an article of faith on the left and in some corners of the media that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. poses a spoiler threat to President Biden's reelection.\nIt's never been quite clear that'll be the case, though, particularly given that Kennedy is much more popular among Republicans than Democrats.\nAnd now, there are growing signs that Kennedy and his fellow third-party candidates might not cost Biden after all. Indeed, they \u2014 and particularly Kennedy \u2014 could actually pull more from Trump.\nTwo new high-quality polls since Sunday bear this out.\nThe latest is from Marist College on Monday. It shows Biden at 51 percent and Trump at 48 percent in a national head-to-head contest. But when you factor in third-party candidates \u2014 Kennedy, Green Party candidate Jill Stein and independent Cornel West \u2014 Biden's lead goes to five percentage points, larger than the poll's 3.6-point margin of error.\nAdvertisement\nMarist has long been one of Biden's better polls. But that's his best showing in a high-quality poll for many months.\nAn NBC News poll Sunday showed a similar dynamic. While Biden trailed by two points head to head (44-46), he led by two points (39-37) when the question included the third-party candidates.\nBoth NBC results are within the margin of error, but the key here is the four-point shift toward Biden when you include third-party candidates. That's something we really haven't seen before.\nAnd a big reason for the shift is Kennedy. He takes twice as much of his support from voters who had previously picked Trump in the head-to-head question (15 percent of those voters) than those who had picked Biden (7 percent). Biden cedes more votes than Trump to Stein, but Kennedy is a larger factor given that he's been pulling more votes throughout the race.\nAdvertisement\n(That poll is also merely the latest to show Kennedy's image among right-leaning voters is vastly superior to his image among left-leaning ones. While Republicans like him 40 percent to 15 percent \u2014 a plus-25 split \u2014 Democrats dislike him 53-16 \u2014 a negative-37 split.)\ndislike him 53-16 \u2014 a negative-37 split.)\nThe Marist poll shows Kennedy pulling only slightly more from actual Republicans (10 percent) than Democrats (8 percent). But it suggests he's pulling more from Trump-leaning independents.\nWhile Biden and Trump are tied at 49 percent among independents in the head-to-head, Biden leads 34-30 among independents when you include third-party candidates.\nAs in the NBC poll, Kennedy pulls more from Trump head-to-head voters (17 percent) than Biden voters (11 percent).\nWhile these are perhaps the most compelling recent polls to suggest Kennedy and the broader third-party impact aren't hurting and could even help Biden, they're not the only ones:\nAdvertisement\nAll of it paints a picture of a dynamic situation with the third-party candidates.\nBiden has probably suffered more among them in the past because Democrats are less enthusiastic about his candidacy than Republicans are about Trump's. In addition, both Stein and West are clearly to Biden's political left, and Kennedy at the very least has a name that could resonate with more casual left-leaning independents.\nBut what generally happens as a general election proceeds is that voters gravitate toward the two major-party candidates because they actually have a shot at winning, and third-party candidates fade.\nPerhaps what we're starting to see is voters who don't like Trump migrating from flirting with third-party candidates to going for Biden. Perhaps Kennedy's far superior image among right-leaning voters or his tendency toward Republican-friendly conspiracy theories is starting to register. Or \u2014 though it's early to say this with any certainty \u2014 perhaps Trump's personal problems surrounding his first criminal trial are starting to have more of an effect.\nAdvertisement\nIt's a battle that is far from over, particularly given that both sides are likely to spend the next six-plus months trying to attach Kennedy to the other side's politics. Biden appeared last week with members of the Kennedy family who have distanced themselves from their relative's campaign. And at least some Republicans are starting to worry about the Kennedy impact and fight back, attacking the candidate they once boosted when Kennedy was challenging Biden for the Democratic nomination.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Staff Writer,Aaron Blake","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SYYVSPQY2B6S5DTB6RZEJSGTJI.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.453781,"_id":"5fbb2a771fb32e1e42e1de095a83c37a"},{"title":"In Pa., Biden's challenge is highlighted by protests from both sides","author":"Toluse Olorunnipa","published_date":"2024-04-20 12:00:20","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/20/biden-protests-pennsylvania-election","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Democrats are hopeful in the state, given recent Democratic wins.

That night, at his hotel, a group of similarly minded demonstrators banged drums, played loud music and used a loudspeaker until 12:15 a.m., yelling slogans including, 'Wake up, sleepy Joe!' and 'I am your nightmare, Biden!'\nAt a another site where Biden was speaking in Scranton, a very different group of demonstrators assembled, these backing Donald Trump. They held signs reading 'Joe Biden: You're Fired' and waved flags bearing the former president's name. Asked by a local news host about the proliferation of pro-Trump signs across Pennsylvania, Biden bristled: 'Well, you haven't been driving in the right places, pal. \u2026 He has no presence here.'\nHe has no presence here.'\nAt other times, Biden faced much friendlier terrain during his three - day swing through Pennsylvania, as large pro-Biden crowds materialized and supporters shouted, 'Four more years' or 'We love you, Joe.' One group held a sign reading 'Scranton Loves Joe!'\n-day swing through Pennsylvania, as large pro-Biden crowds materialized and supporters shouted, 'Four more years' or 'We love you, Joe.' One group held a sign reading 'Scranton Loves Joe!'\nAdvertisement\nThe question for Biden, as he throws himself in earnest into winning a state that means an enormous amount to him personally and politically, is how all these roiling sentiments will play out in November, in Pennsylvania and across the country. In many ways, Pennsylvania is a microcosm of the United States \u2014 a Democratic operative once famously described it as two metropolitan areas with Alabama in between \u2014 and strategists will be paying close attention to the state's Democratic and Republican primaries Tuesday for clues on which party has momentum.\n'Look, you're my ticket to the White House: you, Pennsylvania,' Biden told a group of campaign workers in Philadelphia on Thursday. 'No, it's not hyperbole. You're the ticket to the White House.'\nPolls show the race essentially tied between Biden and Trump, and both campaigns expect the state \u2014 which went for Trump by 0.72 percent in 2016 before swinging to Biden by 1.17 percent in 2020 \u2014 to come down to the wire in 2024.\nIn a recent memo on Pennsylvania, Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez stressed that Democrats have won statewide races there in 2018, 2020 and 2022, as voters turned sharply against Trump' policies from abortion to election denialism.\nAdvertisement\nBut Biden's visit highlighted his challenge as an incumbent at a time when many voters are worried about the economy and the country's direction, while others oppose his position on Gaza, and the nation overall is deeply polarized. Speaking to supporters in Scranton on Tuesday, Biden mused about the level of animus he has faced around the country.\n'I've never thought I'd see a time when I'm going through a neighborhood, or a rural town that's in the West, and see big signs that have a Trump sign in the middle that says \u2018F Biden,' and having a little kid standing with his middle finger \u2014 7 years old, 8 years old,' Biden said. 'Well, I promise, it happens all the time. It's not who we are.'\nDavid Urban, a Republican strategist who led Trump's successful effort to flip Pennsylvania in 2016, said his travels through the state have convinced him that Biden is struggling with its residents, many of whom blame him for the high cost of living and for policies they see as hostile to the local energy industry.\n'The current president is pushing a big rock up a hill, trying to convince people things aren't as bad as they are,' Urban said.\nLast week, Biden was pushing hard.\nAdvertisement\nHe unleashed a populist speech in Scranton. He embraced unions while addressing steelworkers in Pittsburgh. He made stops at Sheetz and Wawa, a nod to the hometown convenience stores whose respective merits are hotly debated, as well as to the kind of retail politicking aides say will be pivotal to helping the 81-year-old president connect with skeptical voters.\nAnd Biden ended his trip Thursday by visiting a majority-Black neighborhood in Philadelphia, where he accepted an endorsement from family members of his most prominent third-party rival, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nAs Biden's birthplace and the largest battleground state \u2014 home to a crucial 19 electoral college votes \u2014 Pennsylvania looms large in the president's personal and political backstory. It's a state both Democrats and Republicans view as crucial to victory, and it stands as a key a test of whether everyday Americans believe his performance as president warrants another term.\nAdvertisement\nThat's a big part of the reason Biden has spent so much time in Pennsylvania, which has the added benefit of being close to both Washington and his home state of Delaware.\nLike Biden, who has already traveled to the state a handful of times this year, Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has also prioritized Pennsylvania. His aides and allies see it as a central pillar in their push to knock down Democrats' venerated 'blue wall' of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2014 as Trump did in 2016 but not in 2020.\nWith a population of about 13 million consisting of large urban centers, fast-changing suburbs, millions of blue-collar workers and vast rural stretches, Pennsylvania reflects many of the trends upending the nation's political landscape. Since 1960, no Democrat has won the presidency without carrying the state.\nAdvertisement\nAt a recent rally ahead of his criminal trial in New York, Trump told a large crowd in Schnecksville, Pa., that Biden is responsible for high inflation, global instability and a general malaise hanging over the country.\n'All of America knows that the real blame for this nightmare lies with one person: Crooked Joe Biden,' Trump said. 'That's why the people of Pennsylvania are going to tell Crooked Joe, \u2018You're fired. Get out. You're fired.''\nBiden's swing through the state offered a glimpse at how he will respond to such attacks, as aides noted that he made a point of addressing several constituencies that helped propel him to the White House in 2020.\nOn Tuesday, the president visited his childhood home after giving a speech contrasting his view on taxes with that of Trump, saying he represents the scrappy values of Scranton while Trump reflects the money-focused morals of Mar-a-Lago in Florida. His pitch to the United Steelworkers union Wednesday featured a populist pledge to protect American industry from unfair foreign competition, including by tripling tariffs on Chinese-made steel if necessary. He also took a jab at Trump, joking that the former president \u2014 who was in New York facing a court trial \u2014 was 'busy right now.'\nAdvertisement\nHis speech at the Martin Luther King Jr. Recreation Center in Philadelphia on Thursday targeted the city's large population of Black voters. John White Jr., a former state representative and civil rights leader, introduced Biden by praising his record of boosting 'Black livelihoods,' and the president was accompanied around town by Mayor Cherelle Parker (D).\nThroughout the trip, Biden played up his personal connection to the state, where first lady Jill Biden grew up \u2014 she often mentions her attachment to Philadelphia sports teams \u2014 and where the Bidens had their first date. He talked about launching his 2020 campaign in Pittsburgh and turning to Philadelphians to bolster his Senate campaigns over the years. He said he had been dubbed Pennsylvania's 'third senator' because of how often he was on the news in Philadelphia, which shares a media market with his hometown of Wilmington.\nAt the same time, the Biden campaign unleashed a blitz of advertising targeting key groups in the state, including Black residents and Hispanic voters from Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, as well as a ramped-up ground operation aimed in part at holding down Trump's margins in rural and exurban parts of the state. The Trump campaign's on-the-ground presence is more limited than Biden's effort, which now includes more than a dozen offices and a mix of paid staff and volunteers.\nAdvertisement\nThat advantage in fundraising and campaign infrastructure will pay dividends for Biden down the road, said Brendan McPhillips, a senior campaign adviser who managed Biden's 2020 race in Pennsylvania and the successful campaign of Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) in 2022.\n'The gap is huge between what the president's campaign has been doing and is doing right now, versus Trump, who has come into the state once or twice for very brief visits,' McPhillips said, adding that the Biden campaign plans to open another dozen Pennsylvania offices, including in some Trump-friendly areas, in the coming months.\nBut for Trump's allies, the negative emotions sparked by Biden during his visit suggest he will struggle to hit his marks in the parts of the state where he needs a strong turnout to overcome Republicans' dominance in rural counties.\nAdvertisement\n'This '24 race feels way more like '16 than '20,' Urban said. 'The antipathy toward Biden \u2014 I won't say it's the same as it was toward Clinton, but it's definitely present. The chants of \u2018FJB' are louder than they've ever been.'\nLike Hillary Clinton, Biden has faced public blowback from progressive voters. His support for Israel's military campaign in Gaza, in particular, has cost him support from key voting groups, including many young people, Arab Americans and some Black voters.\nIn Pennsylvania, organizers are aiming to convince some 40,000 voters to write in 'uncommitted' rather than voting for Biden during Tuesday's primary. Given Pennsylvania's tight margins, even a small number of defections in November could tip the race.\nBiden's team hopes the state's voters are listening more to other voices, like those of the Kennedy family members who gathered to support him in Philadelphia on Thursday.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Toluse Olorunnipa","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SAKBL7A7CWJBO5JFLP37P52ZXE.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.4512496,"_id":"26c70ae879cc8db458c83472f5090344"},{"title":"Trump's court conduct gives Democrats a \u2018Sleepy Joe' retort","author":"Patrick Svitek","published_date":"2024-04-19 19:29:53","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/19/biden-trump-court-sleeping","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Democrats, including President Biden's campaign, have been eager to promote reports that former president Donald Trump has apparently fallen asleep during his hush-money trial in New York.","summary":"Former president Donald Trump has long cast President Biden as 'Sleepy Joe,' accusing him of being too old and weak to do the job. Now Biden's campaign sees an opportunity to turn the tables.\nThe campaign has increasingly put a spotlight on reports that Trump has appeared to doze off during his hush-money trial in New York, which started this week.\n'A feeble and tired Donald Trump once again falls asleep in court,' the campaign said Friday on X, responding to a New York Times live blog entry saying Trump 'appears to have fallen asleep in court again.'\nThe dig is notable because Biden's campaign and the White House have otherwise avoided commenting on the trial itself. Trump has argued that the case is an attempt to interfere with the 2024 election, claiming without evidence that Biden has orchestrated it in the run-up to their November rematch.\nAdvertisement\nTrump's campaign fired back at the Biden campaign Friday, calling the Times report 'fake news from a reporter who wasn't even in the courtroom.'\n'Contrast that with Biden falling asleep constantly at meetings, and tripping and busting his ass while falling down numerous times,' Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement.\nThe Times reporter who wrote the blog post, Maggie Haberman, said in an email that she was watching from an overflow room outside the courtroom 'along with other reporters, could see [Trump's] entire face on a very large monitor through closed-circuit camera.'\nThe trial is the first of four that Trump faces with the 2024 election looming. In New York, he faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a 2016 hush money payment meant to keep an adult-film actress quiet about an alleged sexual tryst.\nAdvertisement\nTrump is required to attend every day of the trial, which started Monday with jury selection.\nIt is not entirely clear if Trump has fallen asleep in court. Washington Post reporters have been watching the trial from inside the courtroom \u2014 but seated behind Trump \u2014 and from the overflow room where there is a video feed. They have seen his eyes close multiple times this week.\nOn Tuesday, during questioning of the jurors, Trump closed his eyes and his head occasionally dipped down. In another moment, Trump leaned back and his eyes appeared to be closed as his head occasionally tilted.\nOn Thursday, Trump appeared to be resting his eyes while the judge, Juan Merchan, read extended jury instructions.\nWhen there were first reports that Trump was apparently dozing off in court \u2014 on the trial's Opening Day \u2014 the Biden campaign responded playfully, using it to highlight a top issue for Democrats this election cycle.\nAdvertisement\n'Wake Up Donald: After Stormy Abortion Ban Coverage, Trump Poll Memo Attempts to Hush Panic,' read the subject line of a Biden campaign news release.\nThe news release referred to a Trump campaign memo that downplayed the political potency of the issue of abortion in Arizona after a state Supreme Court upheld a near total abortion ban there last week.\nBiden's campaign told The Washington Post that it remained focused on issues beside Trump's trial.\n'Our campaign and the President are focused on the American people \u2014 not Donald Trump's trials and tribulations,' Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement. 'We're also not sleeping on the fact that campaigns are won by the candidate who remains focused on fighting for the American people \u2014 not distracted by their own grievances or pursuit of revenge and retribution.'\nAdvertisement\nStill, the criticism of Trump comes as part of a sustained effort by the Biden campaign to amplify examples of the former president mixing up people, misstating facts or slipping over his words, as Biden officials fight back against concerns about Biden's own mental fitness. Even though Biden, 81, is only a few years older than Trump, 77, polls show voters are more concerned about Biden's age.\nAt the White House, officials have repeatedly declined to comment on the case and suggested Biden is not paying close attention.\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday, the first day of the trial, that she expected Biden to 'get an update at some point today' but that he was focused on meetings with foreign leaders that day. Asked about the trial the next day, she said Biden was focused on a three-day tour of Pennsylvania that he was starting that day.\nJury selection in Trump's trial concluded Friday afternoon, and opening statements are expected Monday.\nThe trial, Trump said Friday afternoon on social media, 'is a Long, Rigged, Endurance Contest.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Patrick Svitek","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2RSPX5RAGN5I7RISW3LRG6BBOE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.386857,"_id":"6c9a2cafdc928863a785273d605c3927"},{"title":"Kennedy family will endorse Biden at Philadelphia event","author":"Cleve R.

Kennedy Jr., who is pursing the White House as an independent.","summary":"Several Kennedy family members plan to endorse President Biden for reelection at a campaign event in Philadelphia on Thursday, saying that Biden reflects the values and 'moral leadership' of their clan's most celebrated members, in a move intended in part to counter the independent campaign of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nMore than a dozen Kennedys \u2014 including siblings of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 will be on hand during Biden's remarks. The event comes at the end of the president's three-day sprint through the battleground state of Pennsylvania, where he has tried to paint himself as a champion of the American middle class in the Kennedy mold.\nThe endorsement from about a dozen members of America's most famous political family is intended to showcase Biden as the figurative torchbearer of the legacy of President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1963, and of Robert F. Kennedy, who was shot down as he sought the presidency in 1968. It is an unusually personal rebuke to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is portraying himself as the true heir to the Kennedy tradition, and reflects the Biden campaign's concern that he could siphon at least a small number of votes from the president.\nwho is portraying himself as the true heir to the Kennedy tradition, and reflects the Biden campaign's concern that he could siphon at least a small number of votes from the president.\nAdvertisement\n'A vote for Joe Biden is a vote to save our democracy and our decency,' Kerry Kennedy, the elder Robert F. Kennedy's daughter and the current candidate's sister, plans to say, according to remarks released by the campaign. 'It is a vote for what my father called, in his own presidential announcement in 1968 \u2026 \u2018our right to the moral leadership of this planet.''\nKerry Kennedy also plans to stress that Biden stands for the core values of her father and her family: 'Daddy stood for equal justice, human rights, and freedom from want and fear. Just as President Biden does today.'\nIt is not clear if any of the Kennedys will mention their family member's candidacy, and the endorsement is in line with the clan's long, if informal, support of Biden. On St. Patrick's Day, Kerry Kennedy posted a picture on X, formerly Twitter, showing Biden surrounded by a sea of Kennedys.\nBiden was a senior in high school when John F. Kennedy became president, and he sometimes traces his interest in politics to the former president.\nAdvertisement\nJohn F. Kennedy was the nation's first Irish Catholic president; Biden is the second. And both contended with questions about how their faith would inform their role as commander in chief. Kennedy was asked whether he felt he would answer to the pope, while Biden faced questions about where his political views veered away from Catholic doctrine, particularly on abortion.\nBiden also had a long friendship with the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), John F. Kennedy's younger brother. The two served together for decades in the Senate, including on the high-profile Judiciary Committee. Years later, as Biden sought the presidency in 2020, he modeled his effort to eradicate cancer on President Kennedy's push to put Americans on the moon.\nBiden's campaign hopes Thursday's endorsement gives the president a boost in Pennsylvania \u2014 a state he sorely needs to win in November \u2014 and beyond.\nAdvertisement\nThe candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has thrown an unexpected twist into this year's presidential battle. He is the son and namesake of a legendary figure in the Democratic Party, one who spoke passionately about injustice, was brother to an idealized president and was martyred by an assassin's bullet.\nHis ultimate effect on the presidential race remains unclear, including whether he will draw more votes from Biden or former president Donald Trump, but his candidacy makes many Biden supporters nervous. He has embraced unorthodox and even conspiratorial ideas \u2014 for example, questioning the efficacy of vaccines and the role of those involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol \u2014 but he seems to draw some support from older Democrats nostalgic about the Kennedy era.\nIn addition, some Democrats have a deep-seated fear of third-party campaigns. Some in the party believe that Green Party candidate Ralph Nader cost Al Gore the presidency in 2000, and that Green Party candidate Jill Stein cost Hillary Clinton the White House in 2016. This year, Biden faces not only Kennedy and Stein, but also Cornel West, a scholar and activist.\nAdvertisement\nThe Kennedys, however, do not appear likely to focus on the dissenting member of their family Thursday, but instead will aim their fire at Trump, who Kerry Kennedy plans to say is 'attacking the most basic rights and freedoms that are core to who we are as Americans.'\n'attacking the most basic rights and freedoms that are core to who we are as Americans.'\n'I can only imagine how Donald Trump's outrageous lies and behavior would have horrified my father, Robert F. Kennedy, who proudly served as attorney general of the United States and honored his pledge to uphold the law and protect the country,' she will say, according to the prepared remarks.\nAmong those expected to attend Thursday's event are Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a former lieutenant governor of Maryland; Rory Kennedy, a documentary filmmaker; and former congressman Joseph P. Kennedy II (D-Mass.) \u2014 all children of the elder Robert F. Kennedy and siblings of the current candidate.

But if we accept that Biden is having trouble figuring out what message resonates with voters under 30, we should probably also accept that clunky, dishonest, obviously pandering appeals from Trump (like Monday's 'Crooked Joe Biden is responsible for banning TikTok' riff) aren't a major driver.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nOften, analyses of Biden's relatively poor performance among young voters center on his support for Israel's response to the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas. Younger voters are demonstrably more sympathetic to the Palestinians in Gaza than are older Americans, and many see Biden's loyalty to Israel as a moral failure. Democratic concerns about how Arab Americans would view Biden in November have expanded to younger Americans more broadly.\nAdvertisement\nThese analyses, though, overlook an important point: Biden has had trouble with younger voters for years.\nIn April 2022 \u2014 two years ago \u2014 I looked at the decline in Biden's approval rating since his inauguration, noting that it was sharpest among the youngest Americans. At the time, I chalked it up in part to the overlap of young voters and nonpartisans, among whom Biden's approval had also fallen sharply. In part, it was also because he had further to fall with those voters.\nIn YouGov polling since Biden took office, you can see a lot of volatility in how younger voters view the sitting president. The lines below show the average of YouGov approval polls over the preceding 30 days (with individual polls shown as dots). You can see that faster-than-voters-overall plunge throughout 2021 \u2014 and then a resurgence among younger Americans into 2023. Then, in spring 2023, a big drop followed by a slow climb and then, recently, another drop.\n(The Oct. 7 attack is shown with a vertical dashed line for reference.)\nAdvertisement\nThe resurgence was also seen among independents, but otherwise, the under-30 polling has been much more volatile. This isn't surprising by itself. The subgroup of respondents under 30 is relatively small compared with other groups and that lends itself to more volatility and bigger swings in opinion.\nIf we compare polling among those under 30, independents and those 65 and older to the overall approval rating Biden has seen, we see that the period coming into 2022 was the only time in which his approval among younger Americans was lower than his overall approval. The recent drop threatens to have the same effect, but he's not there yet.\nThe point here isn't that we know why those numbers are going up and down. It's that they are consistently volatile and not newly low relative to Biden's overall approval numbers.\nGallup polling offers a different perspective on younger Americans. In February, we reported on Gallup data showing that younger Americans had shifted to the right since 2020. That's probably in part because Gallup is looking at all adults, not just registered voters (which is the group included in YouGov's data). But notice how Gallup's assessments of Biden's approval differs since 2021: younger Americans are consistently less approving of Biden than Americans overall.\nOr, shown in the same manner as the YouGov data, you can see that the orange line is fairly consistently under the midpoint here, meaning that in most months Biden has lower approval from young Americans than from Americans overall. The opposite is true among older Americans.\nThe Gallup data are monthly, and only through the end of March. There may be a further decline in the April numbers mirroring the recent YouGov drop. But the point remains: lower-than-overall approval isn't itself new.\nAdvertisement\nThe difference between the YouGov and Gallup data and who is included in their measures is important for thinking about November, as we wrote on Monday morning. But the point here is different: it's to note that Biden's approval among younger Americans \u2014 and even the recent drop seen in YouGov's data \u2014 are not a new development.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"National Columnist,Philip Bump","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LD4WITOEXIXHRAZ6XYGELFREE4_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.373068,"_id":"c3073095957584d901e4d8a6bf90de4c"},{"title":"How Biden's abortion stance has shifted over the years","author":"Amy B Wang","published_date":"2024-04-17 15:23:02","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/17/biden-abortion-stances","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Watch how Biden has shifted his views on abortion over the years.","summary":"Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

At the same, he will portray Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee and a billionaire himself, as a tool of wealthy interests.\nIt's all aimed at reframing the conversation around the economy, which has left many Americans feeling sour about their financial situations at a time of stubborn inflation and elevated interest rates despite low unemployment.\nAdvertisement\nBiden plans to spend Tuesday night in Scranton before continuing to Pittsburgh on Wednesday morning. He then goes back to the White House, only to return to Pennsylvania on Thursday, this time visiting Philadelphia.\nBy the time the week is over, Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris will have visited the state eight times this year, reflecting its importance to Biden's hopes for a second term.\n'It's hard to draw paths to Biden winning the White House that don't involve Pennsylvania,' said Daniel Hopkins, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania. No Democrat has become president without winning the state since Harry Truman in 1948.\nScranton, the president's first destination, will blend the personal and the political for Biden. He grew up in a three-story colonial home in the Green Ridge neighborhood until his father struggled to find work and moved the family to Delaware when the future president was 10.\nAdvertisement\nAlthough Delaware eventually became the launching pad for Biden's political career, he often returned to Scranton and grounded his autobiography in the city. He visited so often, he was sometimes called 'Pennsylvania's third senator.'\nIn 2020, Biden described the presidential campaign as 'Scranton versus Park Avenue,\" and his reelection team is framing this year's race in a similar way.\n'You've got Joe Biden, who sees the world from the kitchen table where he grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Donald Trump, who sees the world from his country club down in Mar-a-Lago,' said Michael Tyler, the campaign's communications director.\nChristopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, described Scranton as a 'mythical place in political culture,' and it will provide a test for Biden's political appeal.\nAdvertisement\n'It's an area that, on paper, aligns perfectly with the populist gains of the Republican Party during the Trump era,' Borick said.\nHowever, Biden won the city and the surrounding county in 2020. If he's able to carry Scranton and similar places again this year, as well as limit Trump's winning margins in rural areas, Biden may be able to secure another victory in Pennsylvania.\n'Everything is on the margin. Everything that we talk about are small shifts,' Borick said.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBiden's pitch on taxes is a key part of his effort to blunt Trump's populist allure.\nWhen Trump was president, he signed into law a series of tax breaks in 2017 that disproportionately benefit the rich. Many of the cuts expire at the end of 2025, and Biden wants to keep a majority of them to fulfill his promise that no one earning less than $400,000 will pay more taxes.\nAdvertisement\nHowever, he also wants to raise $4.9 trillion in revenue over 10 years with higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations. His platform includes a 'billionaire's tax,' which would set a minimum rate of 25% on the income of the richest Americans.\nBiden's travels in Pennsylvania overlap with the start of Trump's first criminal trial, presenting an opportunity and a challenge for the president's campaign.\nTrump is defending himself against criminal charges for a scheme to suppress allegations of affairs with a porn actress and a Playboy model. Biden's team has quietly embraced the contrast of the former president sequestered in a courtroom while the current president has free rein to focus on economic issues that are top of mind for voters.\nHowever, the juxtaposition becomes less helpful if Trump soaks up the country's attention during the first-ever criminal trial of a former president.\nAdvertisement\nBiden campaign officials said they weren't worried about the trial.\n'No matter where Donald Trump is, whether it's in Mar-a-Lago or a courtroom or anywhere else, he'll be focused on himself, his toxic agenda, his campaign of revenge and retribution,' Tyler said. 'That's going to be a continuation of the contrast the American people have been able to see since this campaign began.'\nSam DeMarco, chair of the Republican Party in Allegheny County, where Pittsburgh is located, said Democrats' message is that 'the economy is good, we're just not smart enough to realize it.'\nHowever, DeMarco said, 'across the board, it costs more to live today than it did when Joe Biden came to office.'\n'These are the things that families feel,' he said. 'And a scripted appearance by the president is not going to change that.'\nAdvertisement\nTrump was last in Pennsylvania on Saturday night in Schnecksville, where he described Biden as a 'demented tyrant' and blamed him for all of the country's problems, in addition to his own legal woes.\n'All of America knows that the real blame for this nightmare lies with one person, Crooked Joe Biden,' Trump said.\nHe attacked Biden's tax plans, falsely claiming that 'they're going to raise your taxes by four times.'\nTrump also went on an extended riff about the Civil War battle in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, calling it 'so vicious and horrible, and so beautiful in so many different ways,' and suggesting that the Confederate General Robert E.

Kennedy Jr.\nKerry Kennedy, a daughter of former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, niece of former President John F. Kennedy and sister of the current presidential contender, will deliver the endorsements of Biden, his campaign announced.\nThe decision to highlight the Kennedy family endorsement more than six months from Election Day is an indication of how seriously Biden's team is taking the threat of the long shot bid potentially using his last name's lingering Democratic magic to siphon off support from the president.\nBoth Democrats and Republicans worry that Kennedy's candidacy could spoil their respective presumptive nominee's campaigns. Biden was using the event, which caps a three-day campaign swing in a battleground state critical to his reelection effort, to also sustain the pressure on Trump.\nAdvertisement\n'I can only imagine how Donald Trump's outrageous lies and behavior would have horrified my father, Robert F. Kennedy, who proudly served as Attorney General of the United States, and honored his pledge to uphold the law and protect the country,' Kerry Kennedy will say, according to prepared remarks. 'Daddy stood for equal justice, human rights and freedom from want and fear. Just as President Biden does today.'\nThe endorsement was hardly a surprise, as the prominent Democratic family has been vocal that they don't see eye to eye politically with Robert Kennedy Jr., who started as a protest primary challenger to Biden in the Democratic party and now is running as an independent. Biden last month hosted more than 30 members of Kennedy's extended family at the White House for St. Patrick's Day, with family members posing with the president in the Rose Garden and Oval Office.\nAfter the formal endorsement, Biden and members of the Kennedy family were set to meet with supporters at a campaign event, and members of the Kennedy clan were planning to make calls to voters and knock on doors on Biden's behalf.\nAdvertisement\nSeveral notable members of the family were not endorsing, including U.S. Ambassador to Australia Caroline Kennedy and nonprofit leader Maria Shriver, which the Biden campaign said was due to their nonpolitical professional roles.\nRobert Kennedy Jr. has spoken publicly in the past about disagreeing with his family on many issues, but maintains it can be done in 'friendly' ways. After a Super PAC supporting his campaign produced a TV ad during the Super Bowl that relied heavily on imagery from John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential run, Robert Kennedy Jr. apologized to his relatives on the X social media platform, saying he was sorry if the spot 'caused anyone in my family pain.'\nThe Democratic National Committee has separately hired a communications team to combat the appeal of third-party candidates, Kennedy first among them. The DNC also filed a recent Federal Election Commission complaint against Kennedy's campaign, charging that it coordinated too closely with an affiliated Super PAC to get his name on the presidential ballot in some states.\nAdvertisement\nKennedy is also viewed warily by the Trump campaign, which is fearful that he could also pull the GOP voters they need to defeat Biden in November. While Trump has released a recent video saying, 'If I were a Democrat, I'd vote for RFK Jr. every single time over Biden,' he has also sometimes criticized Kennedy, including suggesting that he is more 'radical left' than the incumbent president.\nThe Kennedy family endorsement is a capstone on three days of campaigning in Pennsylvania.\nIt was an opportunity for Biden to reconnect with his roots, starting on Tuesday in Scranton, where he lived until he was 10 years old. He swung by his childhood home, a three-story colonial that his family rented, and reminisced about attending Mass at St. Paul's.\nHe seemed reluctant to leave town the next day, stopping for coffee before heading to the airport. 'It's good to be back in Scranton,' the president said when a customer welcomed him.\nBiden's next stop was Pittsburgh, where he called for higher tariffs on steel and aluminum from China to protect U.S. industry from what he called unfair competition.\nBut even that event involved some nostalgia, as Biden recalled an endorsement from the steelworkers when he was 'a 29-year-old kid' from Delaware running for U.S. Senate.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Zeke Miller,Will Weissert,Chris Megerian","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/62QA5EX5CYI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.3276677,"_id":"4ca8206b1c86dc8f90eb7f510e598fcf"},{"title":"Garland defends Biden's mental fitness at a hearing and says he has 'complete confidence' in him","author":"Associated Press","published_date":"2024-04-16 17:31:09","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/16/garland-biden-mental-fitness-classified-documents-hur/1c72a888-fc17-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Attorney General Merrick Garland has told lawmakers President Joe Biden has shown no signs of cognitive impairment while defending Biden's ability to serve as commander in chief","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General Merrick Garland told lawmakers on Tuesday that President Joe Biden has shown no signs of cognitive impairment while defending Biden's ability to serve as commander in chief.\nGarland, appearing before a House committee overseeing funding for the Justice Department, was answering questions on the report from special counsel Robert Hur about Biden's handling of classified material.

Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nIn 2020, Joe Biden won voters under the age of 30 by 24 points, according to Pew Research Center's comparison of polls to voter records. In the latest Times-Siena poll, though, voters under 30 prefer Biden by only 1 point. That the race is close is a function of older voters \u2014 those 65 and up \u2014 backing Biden by 9 points, despite preferring Trump by 4 points four years ago.\nSo what gives? Has there been a huge shift over the past four years? Is this a function of a very weird, repeat election?\nAdvertisement\nMaybe and maybe. But part of it probably comes down to who Siena's pollsters think are likely to vote.\nLet's first point out that this is one poll. Different polls conducted recently \u2014 including ones from YouGov (conducted for The Economist) and Ipsos (conducted for Reuters) \u2014 offer different assessments of these same groups. YouGov's poll, for example, also shows Trump with a 1-point lead, but gives Biden a wide advantage among younger voters and Trump a big advantage among older ones.\nThe results from the Ipsos poll, meanwhile, shows little variation. A slight Biden lead among registered voters at the younger end of the spectrum; a slight Biden lead at the older one.\nIpsos was generous to provide a number of different divisions of their results by age, one of which was particularly noteworthy. If we divvy up their respondent pool into three groups \u2014 under 35, 35 to 54 and 55 and up \u2014 we find that the Biden-Trump margin between the two is essentially equal. But the levels of support for each candidate increase as the age of the respondent pool increases. Among those under 35, Trump and Biden each get about 30 percent. For those 55 and up, they each get about 40 percent.\nsupport for each candidate increase as the age of the respondent pool increases. Among those under 35, Trump and Biden each get about 30 percent. For those 55 and up, they each get about 40 percent.\nThe difference comes in the percentage of each group that says they would vote for a different candidate or, more often, wouldn't vote at all. Within the youngest group, a fifth say they wouldn't vote for Biden or Trump. Within the oldest group, only 7 percent do.\nAdvertisement\nWriting for 538 last week, University of Pennsylvania political scientist Dan Hopkins pointed to research included in a recent Associated Press poll conducted by NORC. That poll found that support for Trump and Biden varied widely depending on how often respondents voted in recent elections. Among those who didn't vote in any of the last three federal elections \u2014 2018, 2020 and 2022 \u2014 Trump led by 18 points. Among those voted in all three, Biden led by 11 points.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThat pattern held among Black and White respondents, too, with only the most frequent Hispanic voters diverging in favor of Biden.\nThis is a good point at which to note that several of these characteristics overlap. Younger Americans are more likely to be Asian, Black or Hispanic than are older Americans. Young people are also more likely to be political independents, a group that generally votes less often and follows political news less closely.\nAdvertisement\nThe divide between politically active and non-politically active young people is, for example, probably one reason why recent Pew Research Center data looking at voter registration continues to show a broad Democratic advantage among young people while Gallup, looking at self-reported identity , sees a shrinking one. Which group better represents the November electorate?\nidentity, sees a shrinking one. Which group better represents the November electorate?\nThe Times-Siena results include both overall results and results among voters more likely to cast a vote. They didn't find much difference between the two groups by age; the margins among likely voters only shifted by a point or two. But it also depends on how the pollster identifies who's likely to vote. The importance of how pollsters look at the electorate was made obvious in a useful 2016 experiment \u2014 by the Times \u2014 where different pollsters offered different estimates of the presidential vote using the same pool of responses.\nIt's early. It's a weird election. There's a lot of hostility to Biden on the left, particularly among those only loosely tied to the Democratic Party. This probably makes it unusually hard to know which of those younger not-likely-to-vote voters actually won't and which might grudgingly (or even eventually excitedly) commit to one candidate or the other. Different pollsters will come to different conclusions about who might vote, and the results within age groups will differ accordingly. In each of the polls presented in this article, it's worth noting, the Biden-Trump contest is within the margin of error.\nAdvertisement\nBest to close with a reminder: The polls will remain close until Election Day, and small fluctuations probably tell us less than we might think. Big fluctuations, meanwhile, will probably prove to be smaller than anticipated.\nThe Times-Siena poll also triggered some discussion about generational divides in support for Trump and Biden. From the data shared by Ipsos, we offer this graph as a point of discussion and debate \u2014 and offer no further thoughts beyond those above.\nThe Times-Siena poll also triggered some discussion about generational divides in support for Trump and Biden.

He leaned into populist anger against the rich and worries of a world weighted against the middle class as he sought to draw distinctions between himself and his likely Republican opponent in November, Donald Trump.\nAdvertisement\n'All I knew about people like Trump is that they looked down on us,' Biden told the crowd in his childhood town, contrasting his upbringing with Trump's frequent visits to his resort in Palm Beach, Fla. 'They wouldn't let us into their homes and their country clubs. When I look at the economy, I look at it through the eyes of Scranton, not through the eyes of Mar-a-Lago.'\nBiden will further stress that contrast Wednesday when he travels to Pittsburgh to address the United Steelworkers and unveil a raft of new trade protections for the steel industry. The president will call for a tripling of the 7.5 percent tariff on Chinese steel imports, as well as increased pressure to prevent China from shipping steel to America through Mexican ports.\nBiden will also call for an investigation of Chinese subsidies for its shipbuilding industry, following a petition from the United Steelworkers and four other unions last month.\nAdvertisement\nThe actions are just the latest sign of the president's determination to be seen as a defender of American workers like those in the steel industry, whose employees are spread across states in the industrial Midwest, the so-called 'blue wall' that could decide Biden's political fate in November.\nIn making the argument, he has leaned into his middle-class upbringing, including the years he spent in Scranton, which he portrays as a scrappy, working-class town. He argues that Trump, on the other hand, is a billionaire who lives in a gilded club in Florida and would bolster other billionaires, the very people who have had an unfair advantage for too long.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nHoning that point, Biden stressed that the richest Americans, and the companies they own, pay little or no taxes.\n'No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher,' he said, citing Trump as part of the problem.\nAdvertisement\nBiden in recent months has struck a populist tone in other ways. He has criticized big corporations for raising prices and imposing what he calls 'junk fees' \u2014 hidden costs that companies like banks and airlines tuck into their consumer prices.\nTrump and his supporters respond that Trump was by far the better president for working-class Americans and would be again \u2014 one who boosts the economy, fights illegal immigration, cuts taxes and slashes regulation. But the battle is also over who is more emotionally aligned with workers, as Trump stresses his cultural conservatism and Biden emphasizes his modest upbringing and ties to unions.\nPennsylvania, which is central to these battles, is a pivotal swing state that is expected to see frequent visits from both Trump and Biden before November's election. Trump won the state in 2016 but lost it by some 80,000 votes to Biden in 2020. After Biden's stop in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, he will travel to Philadelphia on Thursday.\nAdvertisement\nTrump is courting the same middle-class voters with his own brand of economic nationalism. The Republican has said that, if elected, he would impose an across-the-board tariff of 10 percent on all foreign products and a 60 percent levy on Chinese imports. Many economists say the move would stoke inflation.\nWhile Biden will talk international economic policy on Wednesday, Tuesday was about linking his biography to his politics.\n'We know that the best way to build an economy is from the middle out and the bottom up. \u2026 It's a stark contrast to my opponent,' Biden said in Scranton. 'He looks at the economy from Mar-a-Lago where he and his rich friends embraced trickle-down economics that have failed working families for more than 40 years. Scranton values and Mar-a-Lago values \u2014 these are the competing visions for our economy.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Cleve R.

Last year, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit concluded that the Biden administration had overstepped and said its rule constituted 'unlawful agency action.'\nSolicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar asked the Supreme Court to hear its appeal of the decision, saying the lower court's conclusions were incorrect and that leaving them in place would imperil public safety. Challengers to the Biden administration's regulation \u2014 a group that includes companies that make or sell such kits, along with a gun-rights organization \u2014 disagreed, saying the circuit court's conclusions were correct and should be upheld.\nAdvertisement\nBoth the Biden administration and opponents of its rule did agree on one thing, however: They wanted the Supreme Court to take up this case and decide the issue.\nThis case marks the latest gun-related debate the justices have agreed to consider. In recent months, the court has heard arguments about a federal law prohibiting people under domestic-violence restraining orders from having guns and about the federal ban of bump-stock devices.\nThe justices have also addressed the Biden administration's rule involving ghost guns before. Last year, the Supreme Court allowed these regulations to remain in place amid numerous challenges.\nA federal judge in Texas had ruled that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) exceeded its authority by regulating these kits under the Gun Control Act of 1968. The Supreme Court reinstated the Biden administration's rule last summer while other legal challenges continued around the country, then did that again weeks later following more lower court rulings.\nAdvertisement\nThe two sides in this case disagree on whether the kits count as firearms under the 1968 act. The Biden administration says they fall 'within the plain meaning of the act's definition of \u2018firearm.' ' Opponents say the 2022 rule 'expanded the regulatory definition of \u2018firearm' beyond the Gun Control Act's bounds.'\nThe 5th Circuit panel said in November that weapons parts kits are not 'firearms' under the 1968 act, and the judges concluded that the ATF had acted improperly.\n'Because Congress has neither authorized the expansion of firearm regulation nor permitted the criminalization of previously lawful conduct,' the panel wrote, 'the proposed rule constitutes unlawful agency action, in direct contravention of the legislature's will.'\nIn asking the Supreme Court to hear this case, Prelogar wrote that the 5th Circuit panel had 'declared invalid key provisions of an important regulation and adopted an interpretation of the act that would effectively nullify its central provisions.'\nAdvertisement\nPrelogar wrote that the panel's decision would allow 'a flood of untraceable ghost guns' nationwide, creating danger for the public and difficulties for law-enforcement officials seeking to solve crimes.\nIn a brief supporting Prelogar's petition, attorneys general for more than a dozen states and Washington, D.C., defended what they called 'a common-sense regulation.' They said individual states have tried to fight gun violence, but cited 'a natural limit to states' abilities to combat a nationwide problem that crosses state borders.' The federal rule, they said, helps by trying 'to keep ghost guns out of the hands of violent criminals.'\nChallengers to the federal rule say the Biden administration's directive is unlawful and that ATF 'overreached by effectively attempting to amend the [Gun Control Act] itself.'\nAdvertisement\nThe federal rule 'upsets the delicate balance struck by Congress between the commercial production and sale of firearms and the noncommercial making of firearms by law-abiding citizens,' wrote the challengers.\nIn addition to the businesses and gun-rights group, the challengers also include two people \u2014 Jennifer VanDerStok and Michael Andren \u2014 who own items impacted by the rule and wish to buy more, according to court papers.\nThe challengers also note that there has been clear confusion in lower courts about the way the Biden administration rule coexists with the Gun Control Act, saying the justices needed to weigh in to help resolve this.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Mark Berman","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ESFMHSS2LYI6VDX5B6IEXXMAK4.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.221353,"_id":"c4c557b1a4d2fff9691f4982396028bb"},{"title":"Biden hosts Czech leader at White House to promote Ukraine aid amid holdup in Congress","author":"Associated Press","published_date":"2024-04-15 20:24:15","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/15/biden-ukraine-czech-republic-russia-congress/210db06a-fb66-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"President Joe Biden called on the House to immediately take up the Senate-passed supplemental legislation for Ukraine and Israel funding on Monday as he hosted Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala in the\u2026","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden urged the U.S. House to immediately take up Senate-passed supplemental funding for Ukraine and Israel on Monday as he hosted Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala in the Oval Office.\nThe visit came as Biden aimed to highlight the efforts other nations are making to support Ukraine.

Ambrose J. Finnegan Jr., aiming to draw a contrast with reports that Trump, while president, had called fallen service members 'suckers' and 'losers.'\nFinnegan, the brother of Biden's mother, 'got shot down in New Guinea,' Biden said. The president said Finnegan's body was never recovered and 'there used to be a lot of cannibals' in the area. Biden, who also relayed a version of the story earlier in the day after stopping by the memorial in Scranton, was off on the particulars.\nThe U.S. government's record of missing service members does not attribute Finnegan's death to hostile action or indicate cannibals were any factor.\nAdvertisement\n'We have a tradition in my family my grandfather started,' said Biden, a toddler at the time of his uncle's death in 1944. 'When you visit a gravesite of a family member \u2014 it's going to sound strange to you \u2014 but you say three Hail Marys. And that's what I was doing at the site.'\nReferring to Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, Biden said, 'That man doesn't deserve to have been the commander in chief for my son, my uncle.'\nBiden's elder son, Beau, died in 2015 of brain cancer, which the president has stated he believes was linked to his son's yearlong deployment in Iraq, where the military used burn pits to dispose of waste.\nSome former Trump officials have claimed the then-president disparaged fallen service members as 'suckers' and 'losers' when, they said, he did not want to travel in 2018 to a cemetery for American war dead in France. Trump denied the allegation, saying, 'What animal would say such a thing?'\nAdvertisement\nAccording to the Pentagon's Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, Biden's uncle, known by the family as 'Bosie,' died on May 14, 1944, while a passenger on an Army Air Forces plane that, 'for unknown reasons,' was forced to ditch in the Pacific Ocean off the northern coast of New Guinea. 'Both engines failed at low altitude, and the aircraft's nose hit the water hard,' the agency states in its listing of Finnegan. 'Three men failed to emerge from the sinking wreck and were lost in the crash.'\nThe agency said Finnegan was a passenger on the plane when it was lost. 'He has not been associated with any remains recovered from the area after the war and is still unaccounted-for,' according to the agency.\nThe White House did not immediately comment on the discrepancy between the agency's records and Biden's account.\nAdvertisement\nThe Democratic president also misstated when uncles enlisted in the military, saying they joined 'when D-Day occurred, the next day,' in June 1944, when they actually joined weeks after the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor.\nAfter Finnegan's death, a local newspaper published a telegram from Gen. Douglas MacArthur expressing condolences to Finnegan's family:\n'Dear Mr. Finnegan: In the death of your son, Second Lieutenant Ambrose J.

Politicians sometimes acknowledge that they raise prices and kill jobs. But they seem to realize this only when the other team proposes them.\nother team proposes them. On Wednesday, President Biden called for tripling the tariffs on steel and aluminum from China, an announcement he coincidentally made while visiting the United Steelworkers union headquarters in Pittsburgh. This isn't pandering ahead of an election, the White House insists; it's about protecting U.S. manufacturing from 'unfair trade practices' overseas.\nBecause it apparently bears repeating: No, steel and aluminum tariffs are not good for the U.S. manufacturing sector or its workers. That's because many fewer workers are employed by firms that make these metals than they are by firms that use these metals as a product input (e.g., for cars or kitchen appliances). The ratio of steel-using jobs to steelmaking jobs is about 75 or 80 to 1.\nmake these metals than they are by firms that use these metals as a product input (e.g., for cars or kitchen appliances). The ratio of steel-using jobs to steelmaking jobs is about 75 or 80 to 1.\nAdvertisement\nRaising input costs puts those downstream firms and workers at a competitive disadvantage. We saw this happen when then-President Donald Trump imposed worldwide steel tariffs in 2018. U.S. prices for steel predictably rocketed upward, far above prices in other countries. Within two years, these tariffs resulted in about 75,000 fewer jobs across downstream manufacturers, according to calculations from researchers Kadee Russ and Lydia Cox. And by the way, that number doesn't even include the additional job losses among U.S. exporters that faced painful counter-tariffs levied by other countries.\nthe additional job losses among U.S. exporters that faced painful counter-tariffs levied by other countries.\nThe metal duties weren't the only Trump-era tariffs that economically backfired. As I've noted before, at least four separate studies found that the costs of Trump's various import duties (on Chinese goods, washing machines, solar panels, etc.) were borne mostly or entirely by Americans, in the form of higher prices.\nThis proved useful for some of Trump's political rivals. In campaign ads and speeches, Democrats sometimes (correctly) accused Trump of raising the costs of back-to-school shopping or Christmas gifts. Among the more high-profile critics was then-presidential candidate Joe Biden.\nAdvertisement\n'President Trump may think he's being tough on China,' Biden said in 2019 of Trump's China tariffs. 'All that he's delivered as a consequence of that is American farmers, manufacturers and consumers losing and paying more.' Biden's 2020 campaign site likewise argued that Trump's 'tariff war' had cost hundreds of thousands of jobs.\nFollow this author Catherine Rampell 's opinions\nFollow this author\nCatherine Rampell\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nAdvertisement\nBiden has, rightly, pointed out the folly of these plans: Mere days ago, the White House warned in a statement about the catastrophically inflationary effects of Trump's proposed tariffs. Then, in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, Biden promptly forgot his own warning. In fact, in addition to his plans to increase tariffs on Chinese steel, he also signaled support for new tariffs on China's shipbuilding sector.\nAfter all, the U.S. shipbuilding industry is struggling. That's partly because of high input costs, including for materials such as \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 steel .\n.\nThe best thing you can say about Biden's proposed tripling of tariffs on Chinese metals is that it might be toothless. Why? We've already levied so many different kinds of tariffs on Chinese metals \u2014 under both Trump and earlier presidential administrations \u2014 that China doesn't sell much steel here anymore anyway. Chinese-made steel accounted for just about 2 percent of U.S. steel imports in 2023, so raising the price of Chinese-made steel might not move overall market prices much. ('Biden's basically putting Chinese steel on double-secret probation,' said Cato Institute trade researcher Scott Lincicome.)\nAdvertisement\nEven so, Biden's tariff actions are hardly benign. A White House news release hints of ongoing union pressures to also limit steel imported from Mexico, which actually is one of our top sources of steel imports. Meanwhile the Biden administration is vigorously defending his predecessor's tariffs in court. If successful, these efforts would make Trump's next round of tariffs \u2014 or Biden's, for that matter \u2014 even easier to implement, regardless of Biden's on-again-off-again warnings about their costs.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Catherine Rampell","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RAMXWBBT6K6TGIUXQS5VIXHX2Y_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.1710305,"_id":"12801d2cdaec39d1968812d7f36f625d"},{"title":"Biden avoids a further Mideast spiral as Israel and Iran show restraint.

All are testing the proposition he made to voters during his 2020 campaign that a Biden White House would bring a measure of calm and renewed respect for the United States on the world stage.\nForeign policy matters are not typically the top issue for American voters. This November is expected to be no different, with the economy and border security carrying greater resonance.\nBut public polling suggests that overseas concerns could have more relevance with voters than in any U.S. election since 2006, when voter dissatisfaction over the Iraq War was a major factor in the Republican Party losing 30 House and six Senate seats.\n'We see this issue rising in saliency, and at the same time we're seeing voter appraisals of President Biden's handling of foreign affairs being quite negative,' said Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. 'That combination is not a great one for Biden.'\nAdvertisement\nBiden has staked enormous political capital on his response to the Israel-Hamas war as well as his administration's backing of Ukraine as it fends off a Russian invasion.\nThe apparent de-escalation of tensions between Israel and Iran also comes as Congress moves closer to approving $95 billion in wartime aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, a measure that Biden has pushed for as Ukrainian forces run desperately short on arms.\nAfter months of delay in the face of the threat of ouster by his party's right flank, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pushed the package forward and final House passage was expected this weekend. That prospect \u2014 and a surge of weaponry to the front lines \u2014 is giving the White House renewed hope that Ukraine can right the ship after months of setbacks in the war.\nBiden also has made bolstering relations in the Indo-Pacific a central focus of his foreign policy agenda, looking to win allies and build ties as China becomes a more formidable economic and military competitor.\nAdvertisement\nBut Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have an argument to make that Biden's policies have contributed to U.S. dealing with myriad global quandaries, said Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at the Washington think tank Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.\nRepublicans have criticized Biden's unsuccessful efforts earlier in his term to revive a nuclear deal with Iran brokered by the Obama administration and abandoned by Trump, saying that would embolden Tehran. The agreement had provided Iran with billions in sanctions relief in exchange for the country agreeing to roll back its nuclear program.\nGOP critics have sought to connect Russia's invasion of Ukraine to Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan and they blame the Obama administration for not offering a strong enough response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's 2014 seizure of Crimea.\nAdvertisement\n'You can make an intellectual case, a policy case of how we got from Point A to B to C to D and ended up in a world on fire,' said Goldberg, a national security official in the Trump administration. 'People may not care about how we got here, but they do care that we are here.'\nPolling suggests Americans' concerns about foreign policy issues are growing, and there are mixed signs of whether Biden's pitch as a steady foreign policy hand is resonating with voters.\nAbout 4 in 10 U.S. adults named foreign policy topics in an open-ended question that asked people to share up to five issues for the government to work on in 2024, according to The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll published in January. That's about twice as many as mentioned the topic in an AP- NORC poll conducted in the previous year.\nAdvertisement\nFurther, about 47% of Americans said they believe Biden has hurt relations with other countries, according to an AP-NORC poll published this month. Similarly, 47% said the same about Trump.\nBiden was flying high in the first six months of his presidency, with the American electorate largely approving of his performance and giving him high marks for his handling of the economy and the coronavirus pandemic. But the president saw his approval ratings tank in the aftermath of the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in August 2021 and they never fully recovered.\nNow, Biden finds himself dealing with uncertainty of two wars. Both could shadow him right up to Election Day.\nWith the Israel-Hamas war, Republicans pillory him as being not being adequately supportive of Israel, and the left wing of his party harshly criticize the president, who has shown displeasure with Netanyahu's prosecution of the war, for not doing more to force the Israelis to safeguard Palestinian lives.\nAdvertisement\nAfter Israel's carefully calibrated strikes on Iran, Middle East tensions have entered a 'gray area' that all parties must navigate carefully, said Aaron David Miller, an adviser on Middle East issues in Republican and Democratic administrations.\n'Does what has occurred over the last 10 days strengthen each sides' risk-readiness or has it made them drop back from the brink and revert into risk aversion?' Miller said. 'Israel and Iran got away with striking each other's territory without a major escalation. What conclusions do they draw from that? Is the conclusion that we might be able to do this again? Or is it we really dodged a bullet here and we have to be exceedingly careful.'\nIsrael and Hamas appear far away from an agreement on a temporary cease-fire that would facilitate the release of remaining hostages in Hamas-controlled Gaza and help get aid into the territory.

In each case, partisans were significantly more likely to view the other party's candidate unfavorably than they were to view O.J. Simpson \u2014 a man accused (and acquitted) of nearly decapitating his ex-wife, among other things \u2014 very unfavorably.\nBesides the Simpson component, this two-unpopular-candidates scenario is no longer novel. It was similarly the case in 2016 and, like then, it means that some portion of each candidate's support includes people who incongruously view their preferred candidate unfavorably.\nCurious about the extent of that incongruity, I reached out to YouGov for their polling in the past three presidential contests, each of which has featured Trump. In April 2020, the then-sitting Republican president was viewed quite positively by his own supporters, in part because he was seeing an approval boost from his initial response to the coronavirus pandemic. (That's obvious from the 'very favorable' percentage he enjoyed from his supporters at that point, too.) Other than that, at least 1 in 10 supporters of each major-party candidate has said in April that they viewed their own candidate unfavorably.\nThe extent to which Trump and Biden are viewed unfavorably by their own supporters in 2024 is more modest than was the case for Trump and Hillary Clinton in April 2016. Then, nearly a fifth of each candidate's support viewed them unfavorably. Relatedly, supporters of Trump and Biden are now also a bit more likely to view the other party's presumptive nominee very unfavorably \u2014 in part because the major-party candidates have established track records as president.\nThis prompts an obvious question, though: Why would you vote for a candidate you view unfavorably? The answer, in many cases, is simply that the voter dislikes the other candidate more . YouGov's most recent data shows that a third of those who say they plan to vote for Trump are doing so mostly as a vote against Biden's candidacy. A majority of Biden's supporters say their vote is meant to block Trump.\nmore.

Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nConsider, for example, new polling from the Harvard Institute of Politics that considers only the views of adults 18-29. Overall, Biden leads former president Donald Trump by eight points, 45 percent to 37 percent. Among registered voters, though, he's up 13 points \u2014 50 percent to 37 percent. And among those who say they're most likely to vote, he's up 19 points. Biden has 56 percent of support and Trump, again, 37 percent.\nThat Trump doesn't gain ground as the pool of respondents is narrowed is important. It suggests that indifference to the candidates and voter apathy are linked \u2014 and that there's potentially an opportunity for Biden if his campaign can compel more young Americans to vote.\nAdvertisement\nThis comes back to the initial question: What's the pitch?\nRecent YouGov polling conducted for the Economist included a battery of issues on which respondents were asked to offer their opinions. This allows us to see where Americans stand on the election and also how younger (those under 30) voters differ from older ones.\nWhat we find is that there are only a handful of issues to which younger voters ascribe more importance than older ones, whether we're considering issues respondents identify as the most important (red, below), very important (purple) or at least somewhat important (orange). Younger Americans are more likely to point to jobs and abortion as the most important issue to them, but the gap between younger voters and voters overall is wider when describing climate change or civil rights as very important issues.\nThe issue that scored the highest in importance to younger Americans? Inflation, same as everyone else.\nThat holds in the Harvard Youth Poll as well. Its methodology was different, presenting respondents with two options from a lengthy list and asking them to identify which was more important. The issue that was most commonly selected as most important relative to alternatives was, once again, inflation.\nBy virtue of focusing on younger respondents, the Harvard poll allows a breakdown by gender. You can see that, on several issues, there's a substantial difference in the views of young men and women, like reproductive rights. The three issues on which there's the widest difference by gender are three of the most commonly associated with liberal politics: reproductive rights, climate change and gun violence. Young women were at least 10 points more likely to identify those issues as important than were young men.\nA key finding in the Harvard poll centers on the divide by gender. Support for Biden is higher among likely voters than among young people overall \u2014 but among young men who are likely to vote his advantage is only six points compared with a 33-point advantage with young women who are likely to vote.\nSince 2020, the Harvard Youth Poll has seen the partisan advantage for Democrats evaporate among young men. In 2020, men and women were about 20 points more likely to identify as Democrats than as Republicans. Now, women are 26 points more likely to, while among men, there's virtually no difference.\n(It's worth noting that Gallup polling of partisan identity shows a rightward shift among young voters that comports with the data above.)\nAdvertisement\nOn the issue importance question, the views of young women correlate strongly to the views of young Democrats. The views of young men correlate slightly less strongly to the views of young Republicans.\nThe question of how Biden appeals to these voters, though, remains unanswered. He's put a big focus on student loan relief, as you're probably aware, and it's the issue on which Harvard found the highest level of approval for Biden from younger Americans. It is also the issue that was least likely to be identified as important in Harvard's battery. On inflation and gun violence, issues seen as more important, his approval rating was around 25 percent. On the issue of Israel \u2014 which was also surprisingly low on the importance list \u2014 his approval was under 20 percent.\nYouGov found that younger Americans were more critical of Biden across the board than Americans overall, including on education and civil rights, issues that they were more likely to identify as important.\nThe situation, then, is that the issues important to young people and those important to Americans overall don't differ that much as Biden's party has lost ground with young men. (A plurality of young men in the poll identified as independent.) Analysis from Pew Research Center found that voters under 30 backed Biden by a 26-point margin in 2020, down from the 30-point margin Hillary Clinton enjoyed four years before. If the margin had instead matched that seen in this poll \u2014 19 points \u2014 it would have meant a shift of more than 4 million votes from Biden to Trump.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Philip Bump,National Columnist","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YZD4S2OB6U42ABXDGOJVIQ3EGQ.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.1330414,"_id":"43fd5ebf9c823bb38ddb321b04f104fd"},{"title":"Kennedy says he loves his family 'either way' after relatives endorse Biden's campaign over his","author":"Meg Kinnard","published_date":"2024-04-22 02:39:09","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/21/robert-f-kennedy-jr-biden/7edaef24-0051-11ef-8eac-39c6dcb59eb5_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Independent candidate Robert F","summary":"ROYAL OAK, Mich. \u2014 Independent candidate Robert F.

Is there a candidate that you would suggest that we vote for? Because I don't know any Muslim that could vote for Biden,' said Islam, who is Black and a lifelong Philadelphia resident. 'Who should we vote for? I'm just very disappointed.'\nIslam, who has lived in Philadelphia since the 1970s, has voted in every election since she was 18, almost always for Democrats. She picked President Biden over former president Donald Trump in 2020, and even volunteered at a polling place. But she said she cannot fathom punching a ballot for Biden again, not with more than 33,000 dead in Gaza, many of them fellow Muslims.\nAdvertisement\n'The economy, the crime rate. I want to cry every time I go to the gas station,' Islam said in an interview, ticking off the things that are on her mind as she mulls voting in November. 'It's just a whole bunch of stuff that's going on. It's disappointing. But of course, this war is at the top of my list.'\nAs the Gaza war enters its seventh month, some Black Americans say Biden's handling of the conflict makes them question whether he deserves a second term, according to interviews with nearly two dozen voters, opinion leaders and activists working through a political and moral conundrum in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.\nFor some, the conflagration 6,000 miles away has already changed their vote, edging out domestic concerns such as the economy, inflation and crime. Others say the war in the Middle East, which has already cost thousands of lives and has a region on the brink of famine, mirrors other tragedies afflicting people of color \u2014 and that Biden's support for what they see as a moral disaster should have consequences at the ballot box.\nshould have consequences at the ballot box.\nAdvertisement\nStill others see the biggest threat as something else entirely: another Trump presidency.\nWhere these voters ultimately land could play an outsize role in who occupies the White House next year. Pennsylvania is one of a handful of battleground states that both Republicans and Democrats see as pivotal to winning the presidency. In 2020, Biden won the state by just over 80,000 votes, including a 4-to-1 margin in heavily Black Philadelphia. But there are signs that the coalition that elected him is fragmenting.\nIn a nod to the importance of the state and its largest, most diverse city, Biden has been to Philadelphia more than 20 times as president \u2014 more than anywhere else except his hometown of Wilmington. Biden is spending most of this week in Pennsylvania: two days in Scranton, where he was partially raised, a day in Pittsburgh and Thursday in Philadelphia.\nAdvertisement\nBut even while he visits their city, some Black Philadelphians are focused on how his policies are playing out half a world away.\n'I want the president to get it right because it's right. That's the first reason, but beyond that, there is a political ramification if he does not get it right,' said Rev. Mark Tyler, the senior pastor of Mother Bethel AME Church, who is planning to attend the Democratic National Convention this summer. He said he's lost count of the number of conversations he's had with parishioners about the Middle East conflict.\n'And to think that this (conflict) is not going to have an impact on Black voters in particular, who connect with this story in a way that maybe other Americans cannot \u2014 it would be a mistake to think that it won't be a problem going into November,' Tyler said.\nAdvertisement\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza after Hamas militants rampaged through the Israel-Gaza border fence and killed 1,200 people, many of them civilians, and took 250 others hostage. In response, Israel has commenced a military campaign that has devastated much of the enclave while severely restricting humanitarian aid.\nComplicating matters, last weekend Iran launched a salvo of rockets and drones into Israel in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian consulate in Syria. Most of the weapons were shot down by Israel and its allies, but the episode has raised fears of a broader conflict.\nSupporters of Israel reject the notion that its incursion into Gaza is racist or mirrors American racial dynamics. Rather, they say, the 150-year-old Arab-Israeli conflict is rooted in a territorial dispute between two groups with historical ties to the same land. The country's backers also note that Jews themselves have been victims through history, and giving them a safe haven is a central reason for Israel's existence.\nAdvertisement\nBut as the Gaza war has raged on, Biden and other Democrats have faced protesters at virtually all of their public events, over the Palestinian death toll. In Scranton on Tuesday, after Biden gave a campaign speech on tax policy, the president's motorcade was met by protesters chanting, 'Biden Biden, you can't hide. We charge you with genocide,' and 'Welcome home, Scranton Joe \u2014 make sure Gazans have a home also.' Demonstrators also shouted at Biden as he visited his childhood home.\nIn several states, Muslims and Arab Americans have organized movements urging members of their communities \u2014 as well as people of color, liberals and others dissatisfied with Biden's support of Israel \u2014 to choose 'uncommitted' in Democratic primaries, an effort that notched more than 100,000 votes in Michigan.\nFor seven months, organizers in Philadelphia have been stoking a similar movement in advance of Pennsylvania's April 23 Democratic primary. They contend that Israel's military onslaught resembles other racist oppression that called for a global moral response: Jim Crow in the American South, or apartheid in South Africa.\nAdvertisement\nThat sentiment has resulted in a growing link between Black and Arab American activists.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBlack Americans 'have been struggling through this for many, many years,' said Osama Al-Qasem, who directs the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. 'They understand what we're going through, and therefore they empathize and sympathize and support our struggle, as well. So the built-in relationship becomes a hub we leverage.'\nBiden has made racial justice a central tenet of his administration, and as his reelection campaign intensifies he has highlighted the strides Black Americans have made during his presidency. Putting Trump back in the White House, he and his surrogates argue, would stymie that progress.\nBiden has stressed that he needs Black voters to help put him in the White House again. but recent polls have shown declining support among the demographic, particularly in battleground states that will probably swing the election.\nSome 92 percent of Black voters picked Biden over Trump in 2020. A Wall Street Journal poll of swing states, however, found that 57 percent of Black men planned to vote for Biden in the 2024 election, while 30 percent said they were likely to vote for Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.\nAdvertisement\nSimilarly, 11 percent of Black women in the 2020 poll said they would 'definitely' or 'probably' vote for Trump, compared to 6 percent of Black women who voted for him in 2020.\nBiden's campaign announced in August that it was spending $25 million to reach key voters in battleground states, including what it called the largest and earliest investment in Black media for a reelection campaign in history. Those ads highlight Biden's efforts to close the racial wealth gap and note that he has presided over the lowest Black unemployment rate in history.\nIn addition Biden launched a pair of ads last month aimed at Black voters in battleground states, touting his administration's pandemic relief checks and its successful effort to cap the price of insulin at $35 a month.\n'At both the national and state level, this campaign is committed to engaging with Black voters earlier and more often than any other campaign to date,' Kellan White, a senior adviser in Pennsylvania for Biden-Harris 2024 and a Philadelphia native, said in a statement.\nBiden's defenders say critics have a dangerously myopic view of the conflict in the Middle East, and that efforts to turn Black voters away from Biden will play directly into the hands of Trump, who would be far worse for both Black Americans and Palestinians.\nAdvertisement\nBiden is handling the Gaza war as best he can, they add. 'You can't solve the problem of the Middle East as a purist or idealist,' said Marshall Mitchell, a pastor at Salem Baptist Church of Abington, a Black church in Montgomery County, Pa. 'They don't understand the power of quiet diplomacy. And they're going to force a hand, and then you won't be able to turn Pennsylvania back.'\nAt the mosque and community center where Islam voiced her electoral concerns, many who came to learn about the Palestinian cause acknowledged that it was just one of the issues that would affect Black voters' decisions.\nSalima Suswell, leader of the Black Muslim Leadership Council and one of the organizers of the cross-cultural event, said she feels a connection to the suffering of those in Gaza who share her faith. But she said she also understands that it may be difficult for people to sublimate their own self-interest to make a political point, even on such a searing issue.\n'Some folks feel that there are domestic issues that require priority, like gun violence in a city like Philadelphia, where Black Muslim children are being murdered,' Suswell said. 'So many people feel like we need a cease-fire right here in our city. And to some level, there is some frustration also with people who feel that Trump is a huge threat to our community.'\nSuswell was one of a handful of Muslim leaders invited to the White House this month to discuss the war in Gaza and other issues. She has also hosted events in her hometown aimed at helping Black Philadelphians understand the plight of Palestinians and what the community can do to influence U.S. policy.\nOthers are disenchanted with the notion that they must choose between two parties whose policies toward Israel may not be substantively different.\n'I think there's a recognition that neither the Democrats nor Republicans are really representing our interests. They're not representing Black interests. They're not representing the interests of poor and working-class folks,' said Melina Abdullah, who recently became the running mate of third-party presidential candidate Cornel West.\nIn 2015, she and other founding members of Black Lives Matter issued a statement of solidarity with Palestinians. 'We don't have to take a lesser-of-two-evils approach,' Abdullah said. 'Lesser of two evils is still evil.'\nIn contrast, Rahima Abdullah, 67, a lifelong Philadelphia resident, said the events of the past six months have not deterred her desire to vote for Biden.

Kennedy Jr. in the mix.","summary":"President Biden and former president Donald Trump are acutely and obviously aware that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presence in the presidential race is not ideal for their candidacies.\nOn Thursday, Biden appeared at an event with a bevy of other Kennedys, ones who supported him and not the family member. Trump, meanwhile, has been railing against how liberal Kennedy purportedly is, making not subtle suggestions to Democrats (a group with whom he admittedly has limited sway) that they back Kennedy rather than Biden.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nThat's the obvious point: the major-party candidates fear Kennedy will pull away voters they need to eke out a majority in a state. Each man won the presidency thanks to narrow margins in a handful of states, after all, so the prospect of seeing a swing state swing in the other direction because of Kennedy is particularly unappealing.\nAdvertisement\nNew data from Fox News's well-respected polling arm offers insight into how real that threat is. The verdict?\nMaybe? Sort of. Kind of?\nThe poll was conducted in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, four states that flipped from backing Trump in 2016 to preferring Biden in 2020. (The Michigan results weren't really that close last time, but whatever.) In every state except Georgia \u2014 where Trump has a stronger lead \u2014 the results in a head-to-head contest between the major-party candidates show a functionally tied race. When Kennedy is added to the mix? The results in every state except Georgia show a functionally tied race.\nYou can see the shifts below. On the outside of each graph are the results of the poll when Biden and Trump are the only offered options; the center three columns show the results when Kennedy is in the mix. At the top of each Biden and Trump column in the middle is the percentage-point drop the candidates experience when thrown into the larger field.\nPennsylvania and Wisconsin go from tied to one candidate having a two-point lead when the field is larger, but 'a two-point lead' and 'tied' are functionally the same thing when you consider margins of error. In other words, there's no obvious effect on the outcome shown in the polls. But there would be some effect on Election Day \u2014 an uncertain one that both major-party candidates want to shape.\nAdvertisement\nThe Fox News poll asked about the full field before the head-to-head matchup in each state. Asking both questions allowed it to break down the head-to-head support for Trump and Biden relative to how those same respondents had answered the question about the full field.\nIn each state, about 9 in 10 of those who picked either Trump or Biden in the head-to-head question had also chosen that candidate when presented with the full field. But anywhere from about 5 to 10 percent of those candidates' head-to-head support came from people who picked Kennedy when given the choice.\nIn Michigan, for example, 1 in 10 respondents who picked Trump in the head-to-head contest had picked Kennedy when given the fuller field. If Kennedy didn't make the ballot in Michigan, that would be better news for the former president. Unfortunately for Trump, he did.\nAdvertisement\nWe can summarize these findings accurately and unsatisfactorily. Kennedy's presence on the ballot in swing states would pull voters from both major-party candidates. The effect of doing so, however, is uncertain, and it's not clear that Kennedy would shift the winner in any state from Trump to Biden or vice versa. But, also? He might.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Philip Bump,National Columnist","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WYV262GUECERIM4KLNF7WZ7OUU_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.0963798,"_id":"f4572428350093ca6657ff2bdc0a7245"},{"title":"Election 2024 latest news Biden to campaign in Philadelphia with members of Kennedy family","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-18 11:06:05","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/18/election-2024-campaign-updates","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Live updates from the 2024 campaign trail with the latest news on presidential candidates, polls, primaries and more.","summary":"Election 2024\nGet the latest news on the 2024 election from our reporters on the campaign trail and in Washington.\nWho is running?

Biden endorsed the package and last month said he would sign an earlier version of the TikTok legislation that the House passed.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2020, Trump issued an executive order to ban TikTok if its parent company did not sell it within 45 days. The order was later blocked in court.\n'As far as TikTok is concerned, we're banning them from the United States,' Trump said in July 2020.\nBut Trump's public stance on the social media app swung in the other direction in recent months, with the former president arguing in March that a TikTok ban would only empower Facebook, which he has called 'an enemy of the people.' Trump's post on Monday appeared to be the first time he explicitly referenced Biden while railing against proposals to force a TikTok sale.\nAsked for comment on Trump's post, Biden's reelection campaign referred to the White House, which denied it was working to shut down TikTok.\n'We've been clear: we do not want to ban apps like TikTok,' White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said in a statement. 'What we want \u2014 and what the legislation we support would do \u2014 is ensure that TikTok becomes owned by an American company so that our and our children's sensitive personal data stays here instead of going to China and so that Americans' understandings and views can't be manipulated by algorithms potentially controlled by the [People's Republic of China].'\nAdvertisement\nTrump accused Biden of wanting to shut down TikTok to 'help his friends over at Facebook' become more powerful and 'be able to continue to fight, perhaps illegally, the Republican Party.' Under the bill passed on a 360-58 vote by the House Saturday, TikTok's owner would have up to 360 days to divest, meaning any ban is not likely to happen until after Election Day.\nThe chamber in March passed an earlier version of the bill trying to force a TikTok sale on a shorter timeline, but it has languished in the Senate. The latest proposal's attachment to the foreign aid package could boost its chances in the upper chamber.\nTrump's reversal on TikTok raised questions about his relationship with Jeff Yass, a Republican megadonor from Pennsylvania who is also a TikTok investor. Trump, who is working to cultivate more heavyweight GOP donors as Biden builds a large fundraising advantage, met earlier this year with Yass but said afterward that they did not discuss TikTok.\nAdvertisement\nA former top aide in Trump's White House, Kellyanne Conway, is advocating for TikTok in Congress and has spoken to Trump about the importance of defending the application, The Washington Post reported last month. Conway is being paid by the Club for Growth, the conservative group that counts Yass as one of its biggest donors.\nTrump has called TikTok a national security threat but also touted its popularity, saying in a March interview with CNBC that there is 'a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok.'\n'As you know, I was at a point where I could have gotten it done if I wanted to,' Trump said, suggesting he ultimately wanted to leave the matter to Congress. 'I sort of said, \u2018You guys decide, you make that decision,' because it's a tough decision to make. Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Patrick Svitek","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4C5JJT7HLI2E5DL5MSNO5CGQUI_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.0376105,"_id":"e1e587ec6ac0052af84253b0b3f420c0"},{"title":"Biden sees a $35 price cap for insulin as a pivotal campaign issue.

His reelection team has flooded swing-state airwaves with ads mentioning it, in English and Spanish.\nAll that would seemingly add up to a sweeping political and economic impact. The reality is more complicated.\nAs his campaign tries to emphasize what it sees as an advantage over presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, Biden often overstates what those people who are eligible for the price cap once paid for insulin. It's also not clear whether the number of Americans being helped will be enough to help sway November's election, even in the most closely contested states that could come down to a few thousand votes.\nAdvertisement\n'It is about political signaling in a campaign much more than it is about demonstrating for people that they benefit from the insulin cap,' said Drew Altman, president and CEO of KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues. 'It is a way to make concrete the fact that you are the health care candidate.'\nMany who are benefiting from the price cap were already getting insulin at reduced prices, were already Biden supporters, or both. Others who need reduced-price insulin, meanwhile, cannot get it because they do not have Medicare or private health insurance.\nBiden's campaign is emphasizing the president's successful efforts to reduce insulin prices and contrasting that with Trump, who first ran for president promising to lower drug prices but took limited action in office.\n'It's a powerful and tangible contrast,' said Biden campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak. 'And it's one we are campaigning on early, aggressively, and across our coalition.'\nPRICE REDUCTIONS ACROSS THE BOARD\nRoughly 8.4 million people in the United States control their blood sugar levels with insulin, and more than 1 million have Type 1 diabetes and could die without regular access to it. The White House says nearly 4 million older people qualify for the new, lower price.\nAdvertisement\nThe price cap for Medicare recipients was part of the Inflation Reduction Act, which originally sought to cap insulin at $35 for all those with health insurance. When it passed in 2022, it was scaled back by congressional Republicans to apply only to older adults.\nThe Biden administration has also announced agreements with drugmakers Sanofi, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, to cap insulin co-payments at $35 for those with private insurance. They account for more than 90% of the U.S. insulin market.\nBut Biden says constantly that many people used to pay up to $400 monthly, which is an overstatement. A Department of Health and Human Services study released in December 2022 found that people with diabetes who were enrolled in Medicare or had private insurance paid an average of $452 annually, not monthly.\nAdvertisement\nThe high prices the president cites mostly affected people without health insurance. But the rates of the uninsured have fallen to record lows because of the Obama administration's signature health care law and the Biden White House's aggressive efforts to ensure those eligible to enroll are doing so more frequently.\nSo, in effect, one of the administration's policy initiatives is undermining the economic argument for another.\nThat effort has not reached everyone, though.\nYanet Martinez who lives in Phoenix and supports Biden. She does not work or have health insurance, but gets insulin for around $16 per month thanks to steep discounts at her local clinic.\nThe lower prices only apply if her husband, a landscaper, does not make enough to exceed the monthly income limit. If he does, her insulin can jump to $500-plus, she said.\nAdvertisement\n'I've heard people talk about the price of insulin going down. I've not seen it,' said Martinez, 42. 'It should be uniform. There are a lot of people who don't have any way to afford it and it makes things very difficult.'\nSen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., is sponsoring bipartisan legislation to make the $35 insulin cap universal, even for people without health insurance. In the meantime, he said, what's been accomplished with Medicare recipients and drugmakers agreeing to reduce their prices is 'literally saving lives and saving people money.'\n'This is good policy because it centers the people rather than the politics,' Warnock said. He said that as he travels Georgia, a pivotal swing state in November, people say 'thank you for doing this for me, or for someone in my family.'\nThat includes people like Tommy Marshall, a 56-year-old financial services consultant in Atlanta, who has health insurance. He was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 45 and injects fast-acting insulin several times daily.

I can just imagine there's probably two or three other issues that are in front of this one.'\n'Maybe someone sort of on-the-fence, he added 'this could maybe sway them.'\nONE OF BIDEN'S KEY ISSUES\nGeoff Garin, a pollster for Biden's reelection campaign, said the insulin cap is one of the president's highest performing issues. He said the data was 'clear, consistent and overwhelming.'\nRich Fiesta, executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans, which has endorsed Biden, called the insulin cap a strong issue for the president among older voters.\nAdvertisement\n'For the persuadables \u2014 and there are some still out there, believe it or not \u2014 drug costs are a very important factor,' said Fiesta, whose group has 4.4-million members and advocates for health and economic security for older people.\nTrump's campaign did not respond to questions. But Theo Merkel, senior fellow at the conservative Paragon Health Institute, countered that the insulin price cut an example of 'policies written to fit the talking points other than the other way around.'\nMerkel, who was a Trump White House adviser on health policy, said manufacturers that have long made insulin prefer caps on how much the insured pay because it gives them more leverage to secure higher prices from insurance companies.\nThe president's approval ratings on health care are among his highest on a range of issues, but still only 42% of U.S. adults approve of Biden's handling of health care while 55% disapprove, according to a February poll from The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\nKFF found in its own poll in December that that 59% of U.S. adults trust the Democratic Party to do a better job addressing health care affordability issues compared to 39% for Republicans, even if only 26% of respondents in the same poll said they knew about the insulin price cap.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Will Weissert","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G7TK2GX72QI65DVMHHDNZNM6WU_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.021176,"_id":"dfba2e553e3240cd18c74fda0fd23c26"},{"title":"Times polling deception is a disservice to the public","author":"Jennifer Rubin","published_date":"2024-04-16 11:45:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/16/polling-distortion-new-york-times","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Reporters and editors know better, but they can't resist.","summary":"By now, my readers know full well what I think of national polls taken nearly seven months before the election: They are worse than meaningless.

Consider the opening of a recent New York Times article. 'President Biden has nearly erased Donald J. Trump's early polling advantage, amid signs that the Democratic base has begun to coalesce behind the president despite lingering doubts about the direction of the country, the economy and his age, according to a new survey by the New York Times and Siena College,' writes Shane Goldmacher.\nAdvertisement\nThis is false .

However, too many people who will vote in seven months have yet to pay attention to the race. Moreover, too many events are still to happen between now and November to enable us to say the race then will look the way the polls do now . An infinite number of variables (e.g., Trump could be convicted, Trump could be acquitted, a wider Middle East war could break out, Biden could negotiate a Middle East peace deal) are at play.

Honestly, it is a cheaply obtained, lazy way to generate an audience.\nEarly polling rarely reflects the outcome. Too much (it's called 'the campaign') happens in the interim. That was true in 2020, 2016, 2012 and 2008. Pollsters struggle with extremely low response rates and uncertainty in determining who will vote months from now. But the problem is more basic.\nBrian Klaas, a political scientist and author of the fascinating book 'Fluke: Chance, Chaos, and Why Everything We Do Matters,' told an interviewer in January: 'I have no idea who's going to win the 2024 election. It's impossible to say, and that's because the world is going to change drastically in the next 10 months or so.' He adds that 'anyone who tells you, \u2018Oh, I know exactly what's going on,' they're just lying to you.' Maybe they are just desperately trying to sell newspapers, draw eyeballs and attract clicks.\nAdvertisement\nKlaas continued, 'We don't know what's going to happen. I wish that there was a bit more humility in forecasting and a bit more recognition that chaos theory tells us that the ability to predict the future is a pipe dream. We're not going to be in that world where we can imagine the future quite clearly.'\nPsychologists tell us we have an inherent bias (specifically, projection bias) that leads us to assume that the future ( Biden loses! ) will resemble the present ( Biden behind!) . And yet, in April 2008, few anticipated the financial collapse that essentially doomed John McCain's campaign; in April 2016, no one imagined that former FBI director James B. Comey would pipe up with 'new evidence' about Hillary Clinton's emails 11 days before the election. And the 'red wave' forecasters who spent months predicting a Democratic wipeout in 2022 never accounted for Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization .

This week, I look at President Biden's delicate diplomacy with Israel, pick the distinguished person of the week and share a fascinating book \u2014 on grammar, no less!\nWhat caught my eye\nPresident Biden has declared himself to be a Zionist \u2014 the first president, I believe, to express his support in this way for a permanent homeland for the Jewish people. His unwavering backing at the beginning of the Israel-Gaza war endeared him to the Israeli people. But, as a true friend of Israel, Biden knows that the Israel-U.S. relationship largely depends on democratic, shared values. Accordingly, he became increasingly critical as civilian casualties mounted and Israel failed to deliver sufficient humanitarian relief and protection for aid workers.\nAdvertisement\nIsrael cannot endure as a pariah on the world stage. Its long-term interests require it to prevent mass starvation in Gaza and minimize further civilian casualties. In the aftermath of the World Central Kitchen deaths, Biden's implicit threat to withdraw support if Israel did not adjust its conduct paid dividends. Israel increased aid delivery and instituted deconfliction procedures.\nThese steps, in the long run, benefit Israel . Middle East veteran negotiator Dennis A. Ross explained on X: 'Israel must be serious about permitting humanitarian assistance and ensuring the security of delivery. This is not just morally right; it is in Israel's strategic interest to gain the time needed to dismantle Hamas militarily.'\nIsrael. Middle East veteran negotiator Dennis A. Ross explained on X: 'Israel must be serious about permitting humanitarian assistance and ensuring the security of delivery. This is not just morally right; it is in Israel's strategic interest to gain the time needed to dismantle Hamas militarily.'\nWhen Iran launched hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel in an unprecedented onslaught, Biden maintained his solid support for Israel. The United States (plus Jordan and Saudi Arabia, in a head-snapping display of Israel's support within the Sunni Arab states) provided military and intelligence assistance. Biden then followed up with a show of unwavering support from the Group of Seven.\nAdvertisement\nBut once again, Biden's job as commander in chief and steward of the Israel-U.S. relationship does not include unconditionally cheerleading for the Israeli prime minister infamous for pursuing rash measures to satisfy his extremist coalition partners. Biden, therefore, mixed praise for Israel's defensive success with a reminder of the dangers of a regional war. The Times of Israel reported that Biden 'made clear publicly and privately in his call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he does not want to see a regional conflict.' White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Biden was 'certainly not looking for a war with Iran' and that he himself was 'confident that Prime Minister Netanyahu is aware of the president's concerns.'\nContrary to some right-wing commentators' complaints, Biden has not asked Israel to do nothing . He is urging Israel to select a response that does not set off a larger conflagration. The difference between knocking down Tehran's power grid for a day and pummeling the city with missiles, for example, may be the difference between Israel gaining points with the international community and Israel starting a regional war.\nnothing.

[The] question now is how to turn that into a strategic opportunity [without] courting regional war. No Israeli government can accept Iran's strike as new normal.'\nAdvertisement\nJust as Biden's warning seems to have prevented a civilian tragedy in Rafah, his latest admonition to calibrate Israel's response appears to be working. 'Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked the Israel Defense Forces to provide a target list, according to an official familiar with high-level discussions, who said Israel is mulling retaliation that would \u2018send a message' but not cause casualties,' The Post reported.\nShortsighted defenders of Israel bristle at any sign that Biden is urging Netanyahu to show restraint. That's foolish and contrary to the interests of the Israeli people who are demanding that Netanyahu prioritize the hostages' release. Vicious anti-Israel critics who mouth Hamas's chants (e.g., 'From the river to the sea!') and glorify violence want Biden to abandon our historical ally. Biden will take neither approach. Rather, his delicate intervention helps Israel maximize its own security without alienating critical Western allies.\nLess informed critics accuse Biden of inconsistency. They have it backward. He remains a true friend of Israel, the sort of friend who cautions against rash action that would boomerang; who demands that Israel look beyond the moment to its long-term survival; and who, in his bones, understands the Israeli people want both democracy and security.\nAdvertisement\nBoth countries should be grateful that a seasoned president is in the Oval Office.\nDistinguished person of the week\nDavid Hume Kennerly, President Gerald Ford's photographer, resigned from the foundation that bears his former boss's name. After the board repeatedly refused to give Liz Cheney its award for distinguished public service, Kennerly wrote:\nA key reason Liz's nomination was turned down was your agita about what might happen if the former president is reelected. Some of you raised the specter of being attacked by the Internal Revenue Service and losing the foundation's tax-exempt status as retribution for selecting Liz for the award. The historical irony was completely lost on you. Gerald Ford became president, in part, because Richard Nixon had ordered the development of an enemies list and demanded his underlings use the IRS against those listed. That's exactly what the executive committee fears will happen if there's a second coming of Donald Trump.\nHis caustic response to the board's appalling cowardice: 'I mistakenly thought we were better than that.' For good measure, he quoted the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ('In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends').\nKennerly's refusal to condone the actions of a board 'cowed by a demagogue creating and promulgating the greatest crisis our country has faced since the Civil War' stands in sharp contrast to the sniveling servitude of New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, widely ridiculed for refusing to pronounce Trump unfit. As ABC News's George Stephanopoulos put it in wrapping up Sununu's disastrous interview:\n\"Me and 51 percent of America,\" Sununu says, which mendaciously overstates America's support for Trump https://t.co/xkENXws85N\n\u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) April 14, 2024\nCheney and Kennerly refuse to condone the moral collapse of Republicans such as Sununu and the board of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation. If we had more of the former and fewer of the latter, the country would not be facing the prospect of a second Trump term \u2014 one far more dangerous than the first.\nSomething different\nTrust me: A book about grammar can be fun. Anne Curzan's 'Says Who? A Kinder, Funner Usage Guide for Everyone Who Cares About Words' certainly qualifies. The thin volume should appeal to writers, editors and readers \u2014 all of whom (she talks a lot about whom/who) have grown up with certain rules that parents and teachers have drilled into their heads. However (she discusses that word as well), what if those rules are not rules at all?\nAdvertisement\nThe University of Michigan linguistics professor explores how grammar (and spelling) developed, who creates grammar rules and, most important, how grammar changes over time. In her tour through the English language, Curzan suggest two ways of looking at grammar.\n'Grammandos' police grammar (especially other people's) but may misunderstand the grammar rule they are wielding. They wind up denying themselves and listeners/readers the vibrancy and variety of available word choices. 'Wordies' \u2014 whom she likens to birdwatchers \u2014 explore which rules may be akin to suggestions and which grammar choices one can select from. (Did you notice what I did? Sometimes you can end a sentence with a preposition.) Wordies do not lack standards; rather, their curiosity about words allows them to creatively deploy (splitting infinitives has a long and storied pedigree) them.\ncan end a sentence with a preposition.) Wordies do not lack standards; rather, their curiosity about words allows them to creatively deploy (splitting infinitives has a long and storied pedigree) them.\nCertainly, the book will delight word nerds. While her analysis might give you flashbacks, positive or otherwise, to that persnickety English teacher in high school, Curzan manages to sprinkle her guide with plenty of jokes. Along the way, she also makes the case (pun intended) that fights about language often amount to fights about power, race, inclusion and gender.\nI have taken to heart one of her favorite quotes from an article on scientific writing: 'Complexity of thought need not lead to impenetrability of expression.' Put differently, the purpose of writing is to communicate with clarity, precision and, occasionally, wit. Curzan does all three.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jennifer Rubin","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OLVEAP342JITIC52JWBAHEJPFY.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.013437,"_id":"81392a041f97ef7c2b3df866ee144a20"},{"title":"Biden is seeking higher tariffs on Chinese steel as he courts union voters","author":"Chris Megerian","published_date":"2024-04-17 09:03:16","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/17/biden-china-steel-tariffs-union-workers/53c9e120-fc99-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"President Joe Biden wants to triple U.S. tariffs on steel from China","summary":"SCRANTON, Pa. \u2014 President Joe Biden is calling for a tripling of tariffs on steel from China to protect American producers from a flood of cheap imports, an announcement he planned to roll out Wednesday in an address to steelworkers in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.\nThe move reflects the intersection of Biden's international trade policy with his efforts to court voters in a state that is likely to play a pivotal role in deciding November's election.\nThe White House insists, however, that it is more about shielding American manufacturing from unfair trade practices overseas than firing up a union audience.\nIn addition to boosting steel tariffs, Biden also will seek to triple levies on Chinese aluminum. The current rate is 7.5% for both metals. The administration also promised to pursue anti-dumping investigations against countries and importers that try to saturate existing markets with Chinese steel, and said it was working with Mexico to ensure that Chinese companies can't circumvent the tariffs by shipping steel there for subsequent export to the U.S.\nAdvertisement\n'The president understands we must invest in American manufacturing. But we also have to protect those investments and those workers from unfair exports associated with China's industrial overcapacity,' White House National Economic Adviser Lael Brainard said on a call with reporters.\nBiden was set to announce that he is asking the U.S. Trade Representative to consider tripling the tariffs during a visit to United Steelworkers union headquarters in Pittsburgh. The president is on a three-day Pennsylvania swing that began in Scranton on Tuesday and will include a visit to Philadelphia on Thursday.\nThe administration says China is distorting markets and eroding competition by unfairly flooding the market with below-market-cost steel.\n'China's policy-driven overcapacity poses a serious risk to the future of the American steel and aluminum industry,' Brainard said. Referencing China's economic downturn, she added that Beijing 'cannot export its way to recovery.'\nAdvertisement\n'China is simply too big to play by its own rules,' Brainard said.\nHigher tariffs can carry major economic risks. Steel and aluminum could become more expensive, possibly increasing the costs of cars, construction materials and other key goods for U.S. consumers.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nInflation has already been a drag on Biden's political fortunes, and his turn toward protectionism echoes the playbook of his predecessor and opponent in this fall's election, Donald Trump.\nThe former president imposed broader tariffs on Chinse goods during his administration, and has threatened to increase levies on Chinese goods unless they trade on his preferred terms as he campaigns for a second term. An outside analysis by the consultancy Oxford Economics has suggested that implementing the tariffs Trump has proposed could hurt the overall U.S. economy.\nAdvertisement\nSenior Biden administration officials said that, unlike the Trump administration, they were seeking a 'strategic and balanced' approach to new tariff rates. China produces around half of the world's steel, and is already making far more than its domestic market needs. It sells steel on the world market for less than half what U.S.-produced steel costs, the officials said.\nBiden's announcement follows his administration's efforts to provide up to $6.6 billion so that a Taiwanese semiconductor giant can expand facilities that it is already building in Arizona and better ensure that the world's most-advanced microchips are produced in the U.S. That move could be seen as working to better compete with China chip manufacturers.\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen, during a recent visit to China, warned against oversaturating the market with cheap goods, and said low-cost steel had 'decimated industries across the world and in the United States.' The Chinese, in turn, expressed grave concern over American trade and economic measures that restrict China, according to the China's official news agency. U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken also has an upcoming visit to China.\nAdvertisement\nAlso potentially shaking up the steel industry is Japanese Nippon Steel's proposed acquisition of Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel. Biden said last month that he opposed the move.\n'U.S. Steel has been an iconic American steel company for more than a century, and it is vital for it to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated,' Biden said then.\nAt a rally last weekend in Pennsylvania, Trump tore into Biden over Nippon Steel's efforts to buy U.S. Steel, ignoring the president's objections to the merger.\n'I would not let that deal go through,' Trump said.\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Chris Megerian,Will Weissert","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JMLEX7X4TEI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.980238,"_id":"f192c89e9bc2ad8453c04a869b6eb38a"},{"title":"Biden administration set to provide $6.1 billion to Micron Technology for chip plants in NY, Idaho","author":"Josh Boak","published_date":"2024-04-18 00:02:39","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/04/17/micron-biden-trump-schumer-chips-computer/f884c388-fd16-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The Biden administration has reached an agreement to provide $6.1 billion in government support for Micron Technology to produce advanced memory computer chips in New York and Idaho","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 The Biden administration has reached an agreement to provide $6.1 billion in government support for Micron Technology to produce advanced memory computer chips in New York and Idaho.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., personally courted Micron to build what would ultimately be a set of four chip factories in Syracuse \u2014 and noted in a Wednesday interview that the announcement was a sign to voters about how Democrats were reviving the manufacturing sector.\n'It will be the biggest memory chip plant in America,' said Schumer.

The occasion offers the former president a fresh chance to amplify claims that his multiple pending indictments are an establishment conspiracy to take him down \u2014 and, by extension, squelch the voters who first elected him eight years ago.\n'They want to keep me off the campaign trail,' Trump insisted earlier this week in Harlem, where he visited a neighborhood convenience store and addressed a throng of media outside. Rather than pursue violent criminals, he alleged, 'They go after Trump.'\nAdvertisement\nThe event Saturday also underscores the importance of North Carolina, a presidential battleground that Trump won by 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020. That was the closest margin of any state that Trump won. Saturday will be the second time in as many months that Trump has come to the state.\n'The presidential race is going to run through North Carolina,' said Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, in a recent interview.\nNorth Carolina is one of seven states that both the Trump and Biden campaigns have said they will dedicate significant campaign resources to winning. Trump has insisted he wants to widen the map, even into his native New York, which is heavily Democratic. Most Republicans, though, agree that Trump will have a difficult path to an Electoral College majority if Biden were to win North Carolina's 15 electoral votes. Trump tacitly acknowledged North Carolina's status by tapping then-state Republican Chairman Michael Whatley to lead his campaign's effective takeover of the Republican National Committee.\nAdvertisement\nThere is no precedent for the kind of campaign Trump now has to run \u2014 in North Carolina and nationally.\nWith opening arguments of his trial expected Monday, Trump will be confined to the courtroom for the foreseeable future, limiting his ability to see voters, fundraise and make calls. Biden, conversely, spent multiple days this week campaigning in Pennsylvania, another key battleground. Trump aides have promised weekend rallies and events on Wednesdays, the one weekday Trump's trial is expected to be in recess. The former president's campaign also has promised additional weeknight appearances around New York, as in Harlem.\nThat schedule adds pressure for Trump to maximize his limited opportunities to reach voters and command media attention beyond his indictments.\nIn North Carolina, Biden's campaign already has hired statewide leadership and field organizers for offices across the state.

Mercer said the GOP, from Trump to volunteers, will stress a family-first message around the economy and public safety.\nVoters, Mercer said, 'understand the importance of what those messages mean to them in their daily lives' and are 'fed up' with Biden, 'whether it's with sky high inflation, the open southern border or the migrant crime crisis.'\nAdvertisement\nTrump will be joined Saturday by North Carolina Republican gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson, whom Trump has endorsed and called 'Martin Luther King on steroids.'

What about you?' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) thundered before an electrified crowd of thousands. Alongside the family patriarch was his son Patrick (then a Democratic congressman from Rhode Island) and his niece Caroline, who the day before had declared in a New York Times op-ed that then-Sen. Barack Obama would be 'a president like my father.'\nThat January 2008 event consciously invoked the passing of the torch to a new generation, the metaphor made indelible in John F. Kennedy's 1961 inaugural address. And it gave a badly needed boost to Obama's prospects against the Democratic front-runner, Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.), herself part of a political dynasty in the making. Though Clinton had the backing of several lesser-known members of the extended Kennedy family, its star power was solidly behind Obama.\nAdvertisement\nThat day, as the only reporter allowed backstage, I had a close vantage for it all. It was hard not to think back on that moment on Thursday as Kennedys gathered on a stage in Philadelphia to formally announce their support for President Biden in an attempt to protect their family's legacy from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the crackpot conspiracy theorist running an independent presidential campaign.\nTake a moment to think about how much has changed for the family since 2008. What struck me most then was the sight of the preternaturally composed Obama, moments before the event, choking back his tears. His own father had come to this country from Kenya as part of a program assisted by the Kennedy family foundation.\n'I gotta admit, I had to clamp it down a little bit,' the future president acknowledged to me later, when I brought up the emotion I had witnessed. 'That was powerful stuff. When you see Ted, Caroline, Patrick together, and I think about the role they played in shaping my values and ideals and what I believe about America, the connection to my father traveling to Hawaii and meeting my mother. ... It brings things full circle.'\nAdvertisement\nWhat no one could know then was that this would be one of the final high points for the Kennedys' collective influence in modern electoral politics.\nFollow this author Karen Tumulty 's opinions\nFollow this author\nKaren Tumulty\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nTed Kennedy would live but another 19 months, struck down by brain cancer before he could see Obama deliver on his cherished goal of health-care reform. Patrick would leave Congress in 2011 to devote his energies to the cause of mental health. Caroline, who was briefly under consideration to be appointed to the U.S. Senate seat from New York that Clinton had vacated to become secretary of state, would instead later serve as Obama's ambassador to Japan.\nWith fewer and fewer Americans having any memory of the Camelot years, it should surprise no one that the Kennedy magic is not what it once was. But this election cycle brought a new and dark coda to the family.\nAdvertisement\nRFK Jr. has exploited the dimming Kennedy aura, frequently citing his slain father and uncle. His last name has taken him into the low double digits in the polls \u2014 not enough to win any electoral votes, much less win the election, but potentially enough to tip the balance to former president Donald Trump against Biden in some of the states that will matter most in November.\nThe prospect of a Kennedy helping to put Trump back in the White House has horrified his relatives, three of whom \u2014 including Caroline, currently ambassador to Australia \u2014 serve in the Biden administration.\nOnstage with Biden on Thursday were six of RFK's siblings. They never mentioned their brother directly at the Philadelphia gathering, but the target of the rebuke was clear.\n'President Biden has been a champion for all the rights and freedoms that my father and uncle stood for,\" younger sister Kerry Kennedy declared. 'That's why nearly every single grandchild of Joe and Rose Kennedy supports Joe Biden. That's right. ... The Kennedy family endorses Joe Biden for president.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Karen Tumulty,Associate Editor","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RQJOFYAWEVOSBEVUHNKPYBT6IY_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.9093847,"_id":"0561cb38356b012542618a74549c9d48"},{"title":"Biden administration announces new partnership with 50 countries to stifle future pandemics","author":"Amanda Seitz","published_date":"2024-04-16 11:01:07","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/16/biden-pandemics-virus-outbreak-mpox-global-worldwide/9fe5b6ce-fbe0-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"President Joe Biden's administration is launching a program that will help 50 countries identify and respond to infectious diseases, with the goal of preventing pandemics like the COVID-19 outbreak","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden's administration will help 50 countries identify and respond to infectious diseases, with the goal of preventing pandemics like the COVID-19 outbreak that suddenly halted normal life around the globe in 2020.\nU.S. government officials will work with the countries to develop better testing, surveillance, communication and preparedness for such outbreaks in those countries, according to a senior Biden administration official who briefed reporters Monday about the program on the condition of anonymity.

Alabama has one of the earliest candidate certification deadlines in the country which has caused difficulties for whichever political party has the later convention date that year.\n'We want to make sure every citizen in the state of Alabama has the opportunity to vote for the candidate of his or her choice,' Democratic Sen. Merika Coleman, the sponsor of the Senate bill, told the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nAdvertisement\nThe issue of Biden's ballot access has arisen in Alabama and Ohio as Republican secretaries of state warned that certification deadlines fall before the Democratic National Convention is set to begin on Aug. 19. The Biden campaign has asked the two states to accept provisional certification, arguing that has been done in past elections. The Republican election chiefs have refused, arguing they don't have authority, and will enforce the deadlines.\nDemocrats proposed the two Alabama bills, but the legislation moved out of committee with support from Republicans who hold a lopsided majority in the Alabama Legislature. The bills were approved with little discussion. However, two Republicans who spoke in favor of the bill called it an issue of fairness.\nRepublican Rep. Bob Fincher, chairman of the committee that heard the House bill, said this is 'not the first time we've run into this problem' and the state made allowances.\nAdvertisement\n'I'd like to think that if the shoe was on the other foot, that this would be taken care of. And I think that Alabamians have a deep sense of fairness when it comes to politics and elections,' Republican Sen. Sam Givhan said during the committee meeting.\nTrump faced the same issue in Alabama in 2020. The Republican-controlled Alabama Legislature in 2020 passed legislation to change the certification deadline for the 2020 election. The bill stated that the change was made 'to accommodate the dates of the 2020 Republican National Convention.' However, an attorney representing the Biden campaign and DNC, wrote in a letter to Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen that it was provisional certification that allowed Trump on the ballot in 2020, because there were still problems with the GOP date even with the new 2020 deadline.\nAllen has maintained he does not have the authority to accept provisional certification.\nAdvertisement\nSimilarly, in Ohio, Attorney General Dave Yost and Secretary of State Frank LaRose, both Republicans, rejected a request from Democrats to waive the state's ballot deadline administratively by accepting a 'provisional certification' for Biden.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIn a letter Monday, Yost's office told LaRose that Ohio law does not allow the procedure.

He had promised to dismantle rules created by former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who added new protections for students accused of sexual misconduct.\nNotably absent from Biden's policy, however, is any mention of transgender athletes.\nThe administration originally planned to include a new policy forbidding schools from enacting outright bans on transgender athletes, but that provision was put on hold. The delay is widely seen as a political maneuver during an election year in which Republicans have rallied around bans on transgender athletes in girls' sports.\nAdvertisement\nInstead, Biden is officially undoing sexual assault rules put in place by his predecessor and current election-year opponent, former President Donald Trump. The final policy drew praise from victims' advocates, while Republicans said it erodes the rights of accused students.\nThe new rule makes 'crystal clear that everyone can access schools that are safe, welcoming and that respect their rights,' Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said.\n'No one should face bullying or discrimination just because of who they are, who they love,' Cardona told reporters. 'Sadly, this happens all too often.'\nBiden's regulation is meant to clarify schools' obligations under Title IX, the 1972 women's rights law that outlaws discrimination based on sex in education. It applies to colleges and elementary and high schools that receive federal money. The update is to take effect in August.\nAdvertisement\nAmong the biggest changes is new recognition that Title IX protects LGBTQ+ students \u2014 a source of deep conflict with Republicans.\nThe 1972 law doesn't directly address the issue, but the new rules clarify that Title IX also forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. LGBTQ+ students who face discrimination will be entitled to a response from their school under Title IX, and those failed by their schools can seek recourse from the federal government.\nMany Republicans say Congress never intended such protections under Title IX. A federal judge previously blocked Biden administration guidance to the same effect after 20 Republican-led states challenged the policy.\nRep. Virginia Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina and chair of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, said the new regulation threatens decades of advancement for women and girls.\nAdvertisement\n'This final rule dumps kerosene on the already raging fire that is Democrats' contemptuous culture war that aims to radically redefine sex and gender,' Foxx said in a statement.\nThe revision was proposed nearly two years ago but has been slowed by a comment period that drew 240,000 responses, a record for the Education Department.\nMany of the changes are meant to ensure that schools and colleges respond to complaints of sexual misconduct. In general, the rules widen the type of misconduct that institutions are required to address, and it grants more protections to students who bring accusations.\nChief among the changes is a wider definition of sexual harassment. Schools now must address any unwelcome sex-based conduct that is so 'severe or pervasive' that it limits a student's equal access to an education.\nAdvertisement\nUnder the DeVos rules, conduct had to be 'severe, pervasive and objectively offensive,' a higher bar that pushed some types of misconduct outside the purview of Title IX.\nColleges will no longer be required to hold live hearings to allow students to cross-examine one another through representatives \u2014 a signature provision from the DeVos rules.\nLive hearings are allowed under the Biden rules, but they're optional and carry new limits. Students must be able to participate from hearings remotely, for example, and schools must bar questions that are 'unclear or harassing.'\nAs an alternative to live hearings, college officials can interview students separately, allowing each student to suggest questions and get a recording of the responses.\nThose hearings were a major point of contention with victims' advocates, who said it forced sexual assault survivors to face their attackers and discouraged people from reporting assaults. Supporters said it gave accused students a fair process to question their accusers, arguing that universities had become too quick to rule against accused students.\nAdvertisement\nVictims' advocates applauded the changes and urged colleges to implement them quickly.\n'After years of pressure from students and survivors of sexual violence, the Biden Administration's Title IX update will make schools safer and more accessible for young people, many of whom experienced irreparable harm while they fought for protection and support,' said Emma Grasso Levine, a senior manager at the group Know Your IX.\nDespite the focus on safeguards for victims, the new rules preserve certain protections for accused students.\nAll students must have equal access to present evidence and witnesses under the new policy, and all students must have equal access to evidence. All students will be allowed to bring an advisor to campus hearings, and colleges must have an appeals process.\nIn general, accused students won't be able to be disciplined until after they're found responsible for misconduct, although the regulation allows for 'emergency' removals if it's deemed a matter of campus safety.\nAdvertisement\nThe latest overhaul continues a back-and-forth political battle as presidential administrations repeatedly rewrite the rules around campus sexual misconduct.\nThe DeVos rules were themselves an overhaul of an Obama-era policy that was intended to force colleges to take accusations of campus sexual assault more seriously. Now, after years of nearly constant changes, some colleges have been pushing for a political middle ground to end the whiplash.\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Collin Binkley","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NYS3GEX6FMI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.6998825,"_id":"6295aa02ca506729ecadd79ead8e5d5b"},{"title":"Pro-Palestinian protests could foreshadow a summer of upheaval","author":"Tim Craig","published_date":"2024-04-16 23:11:39","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/04/16/pro-palestinian-protests-us-biden","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Recent pro-Palestinian protests pose a challenge for President Biden.

Some colleges, including the University of Michigan, are now expressly warning students they could face expulsion if they disrupt end-of-the-semester campus events.\nAt least so far, the pro-Palestinian protests have been relatively small compared to the Black Lives Matter demonstrations in 2020. Analysts also caution there are historical limits to how large a social movement can grow when the matter at hand is not taking place in the United States or directly involves American troops.\nBut with pro-Palestinian protest organizers vowing Monday's action was just the beginning of more direct engagement, analysts now believe that the demonstrations are almost certain to add even more unpredictability to this year's political calendar.\nAdvertisement\n'If this continues for another six months, I would expect that the types of tactics deployed do escalate and we do see more extreme protests,' said Omar Wasow, assistant professor in political science at the University of California, Berkeley, who has extensively studied protest movements since the civil rights era. 'There will become a more militant faction, that advocates for more extreme tactics.'\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, one organizer of Monday's demonstrations in California suggested just that.\n'Today is proof that people are going to fight and keep escalating until there is a permanent cease-fire,' said Sha Wiya Falcon, who participated in a demonstration that shut down a freeway in Oakland.\nAnalysts note that the pro-Palestinian movement is now a sprawling network of groups, many of which have different views about what tactics are acceptable or effective. Many of the groups also have a diffuse leadership structure \u2014 or no leader at all \u2014 and that can make it especially hard to predict the movement's next steps.

'The fact the protests will take place so close to a presidential election could imply that the administration will be more likely to pay attention.'\nWasow agrees, saying one lesson from the civil rights era is that protesters' 'more extreme tactics' tend to be more influential 'with the elites' who are trying to guard against upheaval.\n'When protesters use extreme tactics, they might lose the public but nevertheless they get to signal to leaders who then want to manage the issue,' Wasow said. 'So, in that way, more extreme tactics might hurt you at the ballot box, \u2026 but they also could help you get policy responses from leaders.'\nAdvertisement\nThe evolution of the pro-Palestinian protest is occurring as public opinion about the Israel-Palestinian conflict has shifted.\nIn late March, Gallup released a poll indicating 55 percent of Americans disapproved of Israel's military operation in Gaza, while 36 percent approved. Just 18 percent of Democrats now approve of the action, down from the 36 percent of Democrats who approved of it in November.\nBut analysts caution pro-Palestinian demonstrators may undermine popular opinion if the public feels that demonstrators are undertaking too radical of protest tactics.\nRobb Willer, a professor of psychology and sociology at Stanford University, has done research that shows 'extreme tactics reduce popular support for social movements.' Willer said public support begins shifting away from movements that engage in 'property destruction, physical harm to other people or major disruption to day-to-day life.'\nAdvertisement\nBlocking access to major airports or highways, as pro-Palestinian protesters did Monday, would generally fall into the category that could result in backlash from the public, Willer said. Those tactics, however, tend to increase media attention, so some activists consider the trade-off to be worth it.\n'We call it the activist dilemma,' Willer said. 'They are really good at getting you media attention \u2026 so different movements, at different stages of mobilization, may have a different calculus of whether the trade-off is worth it.'\nKhalil Abualya, a second-generation Palestinian American who has helped organize some low-profile demonstrations at the University of Mississippi, worries about internal disagreements within the pro-Palestinian movement.\ninternal disagreements within the pro-Palestinian movement.\nAbualya believes that over the past six months Americans have become more familiar and sympathetic with the Palestinian cause. His colleagues on campus, for example, no longer ask him if he's from Pakistan when tells them he's Palestinian.\nAdvertisement\nBut Abualya fears some of that progress he and other activists have made is at risk if other demonstrators 'are shutting down roads and shutting down bridges and hurting people.'\n'I feel it's a dangerous game to play because, in that moment, in that setting, we are the face of the problem,' Abualya said. 'There are real-life consequences to everything we do.'\nStill, Abualya sees some value in making Biden feel uncomfortable.

Does it matter?","summary":"Upon hearing that members of the Kennedy family would be appearing with President Biden at a campaign event on Thursday, my first thought went to another large family: the Gosars.\nYou are probably less familiar with the Gosar family, if you're familiar at all. Their imprint on American politics is necessarily more modest than the Kennedys', constituting one person who won election to the U.S. House. That person is Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.), and he won reelection to his seat despite six of his nine siblings endorsing his opponent in 2018.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nNot just endorsing, either. They appeared in an ad for Democrat David Brill, calling out Paul A. Gosar and asking voters in his House district to kick him out. The advertisement earned national headlines, as you might expect, and established Gosar as one of the most contentious candidates in American political history.\nAdvertisement\nOn Election Day, Democrats romped, regaining a majority in the House. But not Gosar's seat. He won by more than a 2-to-1 margin.\nSo, to recap: In a race where perhaps the only thing that people might have heard about Paul A. Gosar was that his family very much didn't want you to support him, Gosar still won handily in an election year that was a rough one for his party. And we're supposed to assume that a group of Kennedys endorsing Biden will cement support for the incumbent despite Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appearing on the ballot?\nIt is true that John F. Kennedy, RFK Jr.'s uncle, is one of the best-regarded presidents in American history. Last year, Gallup reported that 9 in 10 Americans viewed his presidency favorably, including 9 in 10 Republicans. That was 20 points higher than the next most popular president, Ronald Reagan.\nAdvertisement\nAs you might expect, older Americans were a bit more likely to view Kennedy's presidency favorably. Americans 55 and older viewed Kennedy's presidency with approval by an 88-point margin; Americans under 35 did so by a 76-point one. But even a 55-year-old wasn't someone that voted for Kennedy when he was on the ballot. They weren't born when Kennedy was president.\nThe youngest Americans who could have voted for Kennedy are now at least 84. Only about 2 percent of Americans are at least that old. But many of them probably didn't vote for him anyway. The American National Election Study from 1960 found that a quarter of those 25-34 in 1960 didn't vote; among younger voters, 40 percent didn't. And of those who voted, just under half voted for Richard M. Nixon.\ncould have voted for Kennedy are now at least 84. Only about 2 percent of Americans are at least that old. But many of them probably didn't vote for him anyway. The American National Election Study from 1960 found that a quarter of those 25-34 in 1960 didn't vote; among younger voters, 40 percent didn't. And of those who voted, just under half voted for Richard M. Nixon.\nThe theory of the Biden endorsement, it seems, is that some portion of RFK Jr.'s support is derived from the positive associations engendered by his name. A super PAC backing Kennedy seemed to think that was a safe bet, running an ad during the Super Bowl that explicitly evoked John F. Kennedy's 1960 campaign to promote his nephew's this year. (RFK Jr. embraced and then disavowed the ad; one of the major donors to the PAC was Nicole Shanahan, now Kennedy's running mate.)\nMembers of the Kennedy family endorsed President Biden's bid for re-election over sibling Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at a Philadelphia campaign event on April 18. (Video: The Washington Post)\nIf nostalgia is boosting Kennedy's campaign, it isn't boosting it much. A recent YouGov poll, conducted for the Economist, indicated that only 3 percent of Americans backed Kennedy's bid. There was not a significant difference in support by age.\nAdvertisement\nBeyond that there aren't a lot of 1960 Kennedy votes left, that election does offer another important lesson. It was a remarkably close race, one in which small margins in some states likely made the difference. And that's why it's useful for Biden to stand onstage with a phalanx of Kennedys: If he can keep a handful of votes from being wooed by the Kennedy name to back RFK Jr., those are votes that might just hold Wisconsin, Arizona or Michigan for the incumbent.\nthat's why it's useful for Biden to stand onstage with a phalanx of Kennedys: If he can keep a handful of votes from being wooed by the Kennedy name to back RFK Jr., those are votes that might just hold Wisconsin, Arizona or Michigan for the incumbent.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Philip Bump,National Columnist","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IP53NFRZMT6KT7BCAV5EUEU45M.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.655828,"_id":"e24bb4d8b49559cbdf1d961a25dbb8c3"},{"title":"Republicans' defense of the 'Biden 16' House districts starts with Pennsylvania's primary election","author":"Mike Catalini","published_date":"2024-04-20 13:44:07","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/20/pennsylvania-primary-biden-16-house-fitzpatrick-houck/0ee898f0-ff1c-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Mark Houck's campaign to unseat Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick in Pennsylvania's GOP primary could offer hints about swing-district party sentiment in a heated presidential election year","summary":"NEW HOPE, Pa. \u2014 Mark Houck makes a potent appeal to conservative Republicans in this corner of eastern Pennsylvania when he describes his arrest and subsequent acquittal on federal charges that he pushed a Planned Parenthood volunteer outside a Philadelphia abortion clinic.\nThe account has become a staple of Houck's first-time bid for the U.S. House in suburban Philadelphia, a central battleground of the 2024 election, from the presidency on down.\n'I'm telling you this because this is how I became a target of the federal government \u2014 the weaponization of the government,' he said at a meeting last week of the New Hope Solebury Republican Club.\nHouck's campaign to unseat fourth-term Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick in Tuesday's primary could offer hints about swing-district Republican sentiment in one of the most volatile White House races in years.\nAdvertisement\nWith few truly competitive House seats in play, the 1st Congressional District that Fitzpatrick represents is one of 16 districts nationwide that Democrat Joe Biden carried in the 2020 presidential election where voters also sent Republicans to Washington. By comparison, five seats won that year by Donald Trump, then the incumbent and now his party's presumptive 2024 nominee, are now held occupied by a Democrat.\nThe Republicans' House majority is so slim that Democrats need to flip just four seats in November to retake control. That makes the 'Biden 16' a significant group of competitive seats and they could go a long way in determining whether the next president has a friendly or hostile House next year.\nFifteen of those seats are in states that Biden won in 2020. The exception is Nebraska's 2nd District, represented by GOP Rep. Don Bacon. There are five seats in California, four in New York, two in Arizona and one apiece in New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia.\nAdvertisement\nSeveral of the 'Biden 16' are like Fitzgerald, winning year after year by tightrope-walking between challengers in primaries and general elections. Nine of them won a first term in in 2022, when Republicans took control of the House for the first time in four years.\nIn the fall, many will face the same Democrat they beat last time, sometimes narrowly.\nThe Fitzpatrick-Houck winner will face Democrat Ashley Ehasz, a former Army helicopter pilot who is uncontested in her primary. Fitzpatrick, a former FBI supervisory agent who beat Ehasz by 10 percentage points in 2022, is outraising Houck and Ehasz by millions of dollars, combined.\nBefore November, several others among the 'Biden 16' must beat back primary challenges from the conservative wing of the GOP.\nIn Nebraska, Bacon is facing perhaps his strongest primary test yet. If he wins, he will take on the same Democratic opponent, state Sen. Tony Vargas, whom he defeated two years ago by fewer than 3 percentage points.\nAdvertisement\nBacon has been a vocal supporter of sending more military aid to Ukraine, something opposed by his primary opponent, second-time congressional candidate Dan Frei.\nFrei, who contends the GOP base is fed up with Bacon, accuses the incumbent of flouting campaign promises by voting to increase spending and for bills that do nothing to stem the flow of immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.\nNearly all of the 16 races are considered toss-ups.\nRepublicans intend to hammer home a message about lax border security and high inflation under Biden. Democrats are warning that Republicans will pursue a national abortion ban as Democrats invoke an issue that has consistently worked in their favor at the ballot box since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022.\nAdvertisement\nNorth Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson, chair of the House Republicans' campaign arm, said the 'Biden 16' have formed strong identities in their districts and are emphasizing local issues.\nHudson said Biden's unpopularity and presidential turnout models are increasingly giving an edge to Republicans, with the GOP attracting more working-class voters who more likely to vote in presidential elections and help flip these districts to Trump.\n'The presidential turnout dynamics actually favor Republicans,' Hudson said in an interview. 'And then if you look, state by state, where our battlegrounds are, the presidential turnout is going to help us.'\nWashington Rep. Suzan DelBene, who leads the House Democrats' campaign arm, said Democrats will highlight what they say is the chaos at the highest levels of government when Republicans are charge of the House and Trump is in the White House. They will say Trump is a threat to democracy and Republicans are extremists and hypocrites who voted against major spending bills under Biden and then tried to take credit for the projects that landed in their districts.\nAdvertisement\nVoters 'want folks who are there to govern,' DelBene said in an interview. 'They're not looking for extremism. And so all we have to do is make sure that voters are aware of what they're doing. ... Holding them accountable for their actual votes, even though their rhetoric sometimes tries to be more moderate.'\nIn Pennsylvania, Houck's bid to unseat Fitzpatrick, who is backed by some labor unions and business groups, has a visceral feel that some Republicans say resonates with them.\nAt the Solebury Republicans' meeting on the grounds of a luxury hotel and wedding venue, Houck unwound the story of his arrest, describing federal agents with guns drawn as they descended on his Bucks County home in 2022.\nThey arrested him, in connection with the incident outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Philadelphia. Houck defended his actions, saying he acted to protect his 12-year-old son from abusive comments made by the clinic volunteer. The trial ended in an acquittal in 2023, and Houck, who runs a Catholic ministry group, said he began fielding requests to run for office.\nAdvertisement\nHouck's story struck a chord with Rose Cipriano, who came to hear him speak. Her husband picked up a Houck yard sign and Cipriano, who had previously supported Fitzpatrick, said Houck has changed her mind in the approaching primary.\n'I'm looking for fresh ideas, and I'm willing to take a chance and vote for him on Tuesday,' Cipriano said 'I've known his story since it happened, and I support him.'\nHouck's campaign echoes Trump's own defense against the criminal cases against him. It centers on the slogan 'Faith Family Freedom' while Houck talks about defunding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the federal departments of Agriculture, Education and Justice, calling them all unconstitutional.\nHouck has raised more campaign cash than any previous Fitzpatrick primary challenger. But he is well behind Fitzpatrick's fundraising and name recognition in a county where his brother previously held the congressional seat.\nAdvertisement\nFitzpatrick has the support of the county party and the backing of police and fire unions, whose large campaign signs endorsing him crop up every two years.\nBob Brooks, president of the Pennsylvania Professional Firefighters Association, said Fitzpatrick represents blue-collar workers like his union members.\n'And, if there was more blue-collar legislators, I think they would find more support from firefighters,' Brooks said in an interview. 'We support those who support us, and Brian has supported us on many levels.'\nRepublicans at the Solebury meeting encouraged Houck to stay involved in party politics.\nHouck said he will back Fitzpatrick in the general election if Fitzpatrick wins the primary but won't campaign for him, put off by what he said was Fitzpatrick failure to check on Houck's family after his arrest. Fitzpatrick didn't respond to interview requests.\nCipriano said she is disappointed in Fitzpatrick but said the stakes are too high for the party to be divided in November. She pledged to support Fitzpatrick should he win the primary.\n'I am behind the Republican Party 100%,' she said. 'So whoever's running, from the top down, gets my support.'\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Marc Levy,Mike Catalini","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BL5OW3H7DQI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.6547704,"_id":"bc3cc116dd966a745a3e21420062eaf8"},{"title":"How Trump has become angrier and more isolated on Truth Social","author":"Derek Hawkins","published_date":"2024-04-22 09:00:54","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2024/trump-truth-social-posts","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Here on his company's social network Trump is offering followers an intimate view of what his second term could look like: isolated, vitriolic and vengeful.","summary":"One of the worst Senators in the United States Senate is, without question, Bill Cassidy, A TOTAL FLAKE, Republican though he may be.

His media diet has become almost exclusively right-wing. And above all, he persists in spreading lies about his 2020 election loss, deep into his campaign for another term.\nhas become almost exclusively right-wing. And above all, he persists in spreading lies about his 2020 election loss, deep into his campaign for another term. Here on his company's social network, the former president's increasingly confrontational posting keeps his most ardent followers primed for action, helps him raise money and provides daily fodder for a media sphere that exists largely to amplify him. And he has reason to believe his efforts are paying off: Polling shows that Trump has convinced as many as 70 percent of Republicans that Biden won the 2020 election because of voter fraud.\nFew Americans hang out in this corner of the internet. Truth Social's most popular account, Trump's, has a fraction of the following he boasts on Twitter.\nTrump has about 6 million followers on Truth and 87 million on Twitter\nTWITTER\n87.3 million followers\nEach circle\nrepresents\n1 million\nfollowers\nTRUTH SOCIAL\n6.7 million\nData as of March 15\nTWITTER\nTRUTH SOCIAL\n87.3 million followers\n6.7 million\nEach circle represents\n1 million followers\nData as of March 15\nBut it's here that Trump \u2014 who reshaped campaigning and the presidency with his use of social media \u2014 offers an intimate view of what his second term could look like: isolated, vitriolic and vengeful.\nThe Washington Post analyzed all of Trump's online posts from the official launches of his presidential campaigns in 2016 and 2024 to show how his social media use has changed from his first presidential run.\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nMany of Trump's Truth Social posts in this story contain falsehoods, misleading statements or baseless claims.

Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung, in response to a request for comment from The Post, said that 'President Trump uses Truth Social \u2014 which is as hot as a pistol \u2014 to speak truth to power and get his message out unfiltered.'\nOn a typical day, Trump's feed is a flurry of polls and links interspersed with a drumbeat of attacks and dire warnings about the state of the country:\nA snapshot of Trump's Truth Social feed on April 2, 2024\nA snapshot of Trump's Truth Social feed on April 2, 2024\nDonald J.

I just posted a $175,000,000 Bond just for the right to Appeal this travesty of a case, which I won at the Appellate Division, but this Judge refuses to accept- A FIRST. He is a whacked out nut job who just made up a number out of thin air, just like he did on the value of Mar-a-Lago. Businesses won't enter New York because of this decision, and many are fleeing. Think of it - I had to pay an enormous sum for the right to Appeal the ridiculous decision of a CROOKED Judge and A.G.

It covers women who cross state lines to legally terminate a pregnancy and those who qualify for an exception to their state's abortion ban, such as in cases of rape, incest or a medical emergency.\nUnder previous rules, organizations were allowed to disclose private medical information to law enforcement in certain cases, such as a criminal investigation. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services said they had heard from patients and providers who were confused about their legal risks or had even deferred care amid GOP threats in the nearly two dozen states with abortion restrictions.\nAdvertisement\n'People feel scared to confide in their providers. People are worried in this new climate about how their medical information might be used,' said Melanie Fontes Rainer, director of the civil rights office at HHS, which revamped the rules. 'The goal here is to reinstate trust into the provider medical relationship. \u2026 The goal here is that people don't stay home if they're too scared to get care.'\nMonday's announcement is the latest effort by the Biden administration intended to safeguard reproductive health care, a central element of President Biden's reelection bid. However, the swell of criminal prosecutions that many abortion rights advocates and Democrats feared hasn't materialized since the Supreme Court's ruling nearly two years ago in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , which overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated the constitutional right to abortion. State abortion bans explicitly exempt those seeking abortions from prosecution.\nDobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated the constitutional right to abortion. State abortion bans explicitly exempt those seeking abortions from prosecution.\nBut doctors can face steep fines and jail time, and many health workers have said they are confused about the current legal landscape governing abortion access, such as whether a federal emergency care law takes priority over state abortion bans, as the Biden administration has argued. HHS and reproductive rights advocates have also cited cases such as the arrest of Brittany Watts as examples of the need for stronger privacy protections. Watts, an Ohio medical receptionist, has said she miscarried at home last year and told a nurse, who then reported the situation to police.\nAdvertisement\nSome GOP leaders have insisted they need access to patients' reproductive health information to ensure that their states' abortion restrictions are effective. Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita (R) this month said his state's terminated pregnancy reports, which offer some identifying information about individual abortions, should be released as public records.\nNineteen Republican attorneys general last year bashed the Biden administration's efforts to overhaul HIPAA as unnecessary and unconstitutional.\nBiden officials have 'pushed a false narrative that States are seeking to treat pregnant women as criminals or punish medical personnel who provide lifesaving care,' the attorneys general wrote in a June 2023 letter to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. 'Based on this lie, the Administration has sought to wrest control over abortion back from the people in defiance of the Constitution and Dobbs .'\nDobbs.'\nAdvertisement\nThe White House has countered that federal privacy laws were insufficient for a post- Roe world.\nRoe world.\nUnder new state abortion restrictions, 'it's going to be a crime, which means that it is very likely if law enforcement requests your personal and private medical records, they may be entitled to receive them,' Vice President Harris said at an administration meeting on reproductive health care last year. 'Part of the conversation that we are having today is what we can do \u2026 to reinforce protections for patients' privacy.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nFontes Rainer said the effort is personal to her. The HHS civil rights official said she was pregnant last year with twins before miscarrying and needing an abortion.\n'It is my absolute duty to share my story, and to do everything I can to [help] the millions of women across the country who don't have a voice,' Fontes Rainer said in an interview Sunday, adding that her office worked 'pretty quickly' to overhaul the federal health privacy rules.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Rachel Roubein,Dan Diamond","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/END5MU3TL6DRBH55YF2VLBTWWE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.564539,"_id":"a92ddc676dc20f90162680d356c80ea7"},{"title":"Climate change concerns grow, but few think Biden's climate law will help, AP-NORC poll finds","author":"Alexa St. John","published_date":"2024-04-18 04:03:44","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/18/america-ap-norc-poll-climate-change-election/a61393c8-fd38-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"A poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 45% of U.S. adults say they have become more concerned about climate change over the past year","summary":"Like many Americans, Ron Theusch is getting more worried about climate change.\nA resident of Alden, Minnesota, Theusch has noticed increasingly dry and mild winters punctuated by short periods of severe cold \u2014 symptoms of a warming planet.\nAs he thinks about that, future generations are on his mind. 'We have four children that are in their 20s,' the 56-year-old truck driver and moderate Democrat said. 'It's like, what's our grandkids' world going to be like?'\nA new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 45% of adults in the United States say they have become more concerned about climate change over the past year, including roughly 6 in 10 Democrats and one-quarter of Republicans.\nPresident Joe Biden's signature climate change policy, the Inflation Reduction Act, was intended to address some of those fears, investing billions in incentives for consumers and businesses to move toward clean energy sources. Biden has pointed to this climate agenda as a major presidential success during his run for reelection. But the poll suggests that although the law has already affected some Americans, it's not widely known among the general population \u2014 and may not be the electoral boost Biden is looking for.\nAdvertisement\nAbout one-quarter of Americans say tax credits for renewable energy projects such as wind power have benefited people like them so far, with similar numbers for incentives for companies to manufacture clean energy technologies in the U.S. rather than abroad, tax credits for individuals to add solar panels to their homes, or subsidies and tax credits for electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances like heat pumps. Those numbers are fairly substantial for a law that passed less than two years ago, where the benefits largely hinge on big-ticket purchases like cars or home improvements.\nPromoting electric vehicles has also been a major focus for the Biden administration, and 15% of U.S. adults say electric vehicles have had a good impact on them personally.\n'I totally agree with the act because it's done so many things for people,' said Charles Lopez, a 65-year-old liberal Democrat from the Florida Keys. 'They help everybody ... I'm not ready for a full electric, but I'll get there when there's enough charging stations.'\nAdvertisement\nBut the people who have benefited from the law are disproportionately Democrats. And while only about 1 in 10 U.S. adults think the individual tax credits and subsidies have hurt people like them, those provisions of the law aren't yet registering with the majority of Americans \u2014 roughly one-quarter say those credits haven't made a difference to people like them. Nearly 4 in 10 in each instance don't know enough to have an opinion about them.\n'I still think that, as much as we'd like for them to be implemented in a way that we can actually see results, it's not really happening in my eyes,' said Sandra Sherman, a 62-year-old resident of Vero Beach, Florida, who identifies as a liberal Democrat. 'With solar panels, although it seems like a really good idea, I see very few people in the area in Florida that I live in that actually have them.'\nGenerally, U.S. adults also aren't confident the IRA will have an impact even in more time. The poll found that only between 23% and 35% of U.S. adults say the law's key components will eventually help address climate change. About 2 in 10 think the main provisions of the law will make no difference in addressing climate change, and about one-third don't know enough to say.\nAdvertisement\n'A lot of the public feeling on it is, \u2018well something needs to be done,' but not necessarily knowing what needs to be done or not even necessarily having strong feelings about what needs to be done,' said David Weakliem, a University of Connecticut professor emeritus.\nBiden still has an advantage over his opponent, former President Donald Trump, when it comes to climate change generally. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults and two-thirds of Democrats have 'a lot' or 'some' trust in Biden on climate change. That includes 29-year-old Jaime Said, a moderate Republican.\nBiden has 'talked about it more and he has mentioned a few plans of things he wants to do. So even if he doesn't do them, at the very least he's thinking about them. That's kind of headed in the right direction,' Said, a medical student in Panama City, Florida, said.\nAdvertisement\n'I know already, right off the bat, (Trump is) not going to address it much,' Said added. 'That's why I don't have too much faith in him doing anything about it.'\nOnly about 3 in 10 say they have 'a lot' or 'some' trust in Trump with regard to addressing climate change.\nBut one of Biden's major pitches for the IRA \u2014 that it will help the American economy and U.S. workers \u2014 doesn't seem to be resonating. According to the poll, only about 2 in 10 Americans say the law has done more to help the U.S. economy, while about one-quarter think it's done more to hurt the economy, and about half think it either made no difference or don't know enough to say.\nAnd broadly, a majority of Americans say the federal government is currently doing 'too little' to address climate change. They generally agree it's important for the government to support climate solutions. About half say it's extremely or very important to limit the use of products and technologies that harm the environment, and nearly half say it's important for the government to pass stricter environmental laws and regulations. About 4 in 10 say it's important for the government to build a national network of public charging stations for electric vehicles, which is another Biden administration priority.\nAdvertisement\nMost say it's extremely or very important for the federal government to invest in new, environmentally friendly technologies, and most, like 38-year-old Julio Carmona, a health program associate who lives in Stratford, Connecticut, and identifies as a moderate Democrat, say the same about enforcing current environmental regulations.\n'We can all do our part when it comes to saving energy, recycling and all those other things,' said Carmona. 'But if the big corporations aren't doing it, I think that, for me, would be where the government should start.'\n___\nThe poll of 1,204 adults was conducted April 4-8, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

It underscores the challenges facing President Biden as he balances an ambitious climate agenda with the need to protect vulnerable communities and pristine wilderness.\nThe timing of the move, which was first reported by Politico, is still in flux, although it could come as soon as this week, according to the two people familiar with the matter. An Interior spokesman declined to comment.\nAdvertisement\nInterior is expected to find that there should be 'no action' on the federal land where the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (AIDEA) wants to build the 211-mile Ambler Road. That would prevent AIDEA from receiving a permit to build the road, and its would effectively block the mining venture Ambler Metals from accessing the planned open-pit mine.\nAIDEA had planned for Ambler Road to extend 211 miles, crossing 11 major rivers and breaking apart unspoiled tundra. Twenty-six of those miles would have carved through Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, sending giant trucks rumbling through wildlands where tens of thousands of caribou migrate.\nThe Trump administration approved a right-of-way permit for Ambler Road in 2020, saying it could provide access to significant copper and cobalt deposits. But after Biden took office, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland ordered a fresh review of the road, saying the prior administration had not adequately studied its environmental impact.\nAdvertisement\nIn an analysis released last year, Interior's Bureau of Land Management found that the road would threaten Alaska Natives and their lifestyles more than previously thought. The agency identified 66 communities whose hunting, fishing and other subsistence activities could be affected, up from 27 communities in a highly contested 2020 analysis completed during the Trump administration.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nInterior also warned that the road would alter the movement and migration of caribou and other animals, partly because of vehicle noise. With climate change and development already putting pressure on caribou herds, the road could reduce calving and survival rates, the analysis said.\nAmbler Metals has maintained that construction of the road would bring well-paying jobs to local communities, and that the project would bolster the U.S. supply chain for minerals used in clean-energy technologies. The mining venture wants to extract roughly $7.5 billion worth of copper, a crucial ingredient in solar panels, wind turbines, power cables and energy storage systems.\nAdvertisement\nKaleb Froehlich, managing director of Ambler Metals, said in a statement Tuesday that he was 'stunned' by media reports that Interior may block Ambler Road.\n'If true, this decision ignores the support of local communities for this project, while denying jobs for Alaskans and critical revenues for a region where youth are being forced to leave because of a lack of opportunity,\" Froehlich said.\nAIDEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Biden administration has thrown its weight behind other mines for critical minerals in recent months. The Energy Department last month announced a conditional $2.26 billion loan for the developer of the Thacker Pass lithium mine in northern Nevada. The site contains the largest proven reserves of lithium, a key ingredient in electric vehicle batteries, in North America.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Maxine Joselow","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YU4WBUTEC5EQRLGFF4D3MFHFL4_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.5354176,"_id":"bd6440ed7cf48d94c71ee511848c38dd"},{"title":"Biden administration agrees to provide $6.4 billion to Samsung for making computer chips in Texas","author":"Josh Boak","published_date":"2024-04-15 09:01:14","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/04/15/samsung-chips-computer-semiconductor/b66630ac-fb06-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The Biden administration has reached an agreement to provide up to $6.4 billion in direct funding for Samsung Electronics to develop a computer chip manufacturing and research cluster in Texas","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 The Biden administration has reached an agreement to provide up to $6.4 billion in direct funding for Samsung Electronics to develop a computer chip manufacturing and research cluster in Texas.\nThe funding announced Monday by the Commerce Department is part of a total investment in the cluster that, with private money, is expected to exceed $40 billion.

In reality, there are profoundly dissonant chords in the democracy chorus.\nStart with the seemingly good news: A New York Times/Sienna poll from fall 2022, for example, found that 71 percent of Americans agreed that 'democracy is currently under threat.' There was hardly a wisp of difference across party lines: 74 percent of Democrats agreed, but so did 72 percent of Republicans and 71 percent of independents. Kumbaya, my lord!\nSuch data has encouraged conservatives to dismiss the effort of Democrats, starting with President Biden, to insist that in the 2024 election, 'democracy is on the ballot.' The Wall Street Journal's Holman W. Jenkins Jr., for instance, recently referenced a February NBC News poll showing Biden and Donald Trump essentially tied on the issue of who would best protect democracy \u2014 43 percent of voters preferred Biden, 41 percent picked the former president. He concluded, 'pollsters find Trump voters every bit as concerned about democracy as Biden voters.'\nAdvertisement\nIf only that were true. In reality, only on one side of politics is democracy a voting issue, and the other would render our system less democratic by making it harder for voters to cast ballots.\nThat Times/Sienna poll was instructive here. It asked voters what concerned them more about elections: 'that some people will cast votes illegally' or that 'some eligible voters won't have a fair chance to vote.'\nThe country split right down the middle: 46 percent worried about illegal voting, 48 percent about voter suppression. That's because partisans were entirely at odds: 82 percent of Republicans were more concerned about voters casting illegal ballots while 76 percent of Democrats were more concerned about voters not getting a fair chance to vote.\nThis divide has led to radically different voting policies, state by state, depending on which party holds sway. The Post's Patrick Marley reported that in Michigan, controlled by Democrats, voting will be easier in 2024 than it was in 2020, whereas North Carolina, where Republicans hold a veto-proof legislative majority, has erected new barriers to the ballot box.\nAdvertisement\nAnd during his recent pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago to earn kudos from Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) pitched a federal bill to require proof of citizenship from those who would register to vote. Since Trump believes that any election he loses must have been rigged, Johnson's effort must have warmed the former president's heart.\nFollow this author E.J. Dionne Jr. 's opinions\nFollow this author\nE.J. Dionne Jr.\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nThis is not some honest disagreement about whether voting should be easier or harder. New barriers to voting and voter purges are being rationalized to solve problems that don't exist because there is no evidence \u2014 zip \u2014 that fraud is a problem in our system.\nNoncitizen voting in federal and state elections is already illegal everywhere, and studies by the Brennan Center for Justice concluded that 'votes by non-citizens account for between 0.0003 percent and 0.001 percent of all votes cast.' A separate Brennan Center report estimated incident rates for overall voter fraud between 0.0003 percent and 0.0025 percent.\nAdvertisement\nWhen someone offers policy changes based on claims devoid of any factual support, it's fair to suspect that something other than solving a real problem is motivating their proposals. On this, the Times/Sienna poll provided an important clue: It found that while 95 percent of Democrats said Biden was the 'legitimate winner' in 2020, only 31 percent of Republicans said this. Their objection is to the outcome, not the process.\nBear in mind that the voting changes introduced to make it easier to vote during the pandemic \u2014 simpler early and mail voting, widely available ballot drop boxes and the like \u2014 produced by far the largest numerical turnout in our history. Holding a successful election in a health crisis was a great victory for democracy and, by the way, the emergency reforms helped Trump get 11.2 million more votes in 2020 than he got in 2016. Yet Republicans seem eager to roll back participation.\nThe acid test of whether both sides are equally concerned about an issue is the degree to which it motivates their respective electoral coalitions. And here, the data is unambiguous: Democracy is a core concern for Democrats in a way it is not for Republicans. It's not even close.\nAdvertisement\nIn a March Quinnipiac poll, voters who listed preserving democracy as the most urgent issue facing the country favored Biden over Trump in a head-to-head matchup by 85 percent to 12 percent. That's because 32 percent of Democrats listed preserving democracy as the campaign's most important issue; only 5 percent of Republicans did.\nIn his book 'Democracy and Its Critics,' the legendary political scientist Robert A. Dahl argued that democracy was inspired by 'the vision of people governing themselves as political equals, and possessing all the resources and institutions necessary to do so.' Tearing down barriers to participation is more consistent with this goal than erecting them.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"E.J.

LOUIS \u2014 Republican attorneys general attacked the Biden administration's stated goal of pursuing environmental justice, calling it a form of 'racial engineering.\u2018'\nFlorida Attorney General Ashley Moody and 22 other GOP officials asked the EPA Tuesday to stop using civil rights laws to investigate actions and policies that result in harm to Black people or other minority groups \u2014 even unintentionally \u2014 more than white residents.\n'The EPA should be focusing on enforcing the environmental laws passed by Congress, not so called \u2018environmental justice,' which is a euphemism for Biden's extreme agenda,\u2018' Moody said. Their petition demands that the EPA change decades-old rules, though the civil rights law could still be used where discrimination was intentional.\nThe petition is unlikely to convince the Biden administration to back away from an issue EPA Administrator Michael Regan has taken pains to highlight. Regan, for example, went on a 'Journey to Justice' tour to places like the industrial stretch of Louisiana typically called Cancer Alley to show how majority-Black communities living near polluters were being hurt. To address such harms, the EPA has turned in part to a section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 called Title VI to open investigations and pressure states to make changes.\nAdvertisement\nThe petition in an election year is the latest in Republicans' expanding fight against federal policies aimed at addressing historic racial discrimination and they believe courts are on their side. They cited the recent Supreme Court decision that eliminated affirmative action in college admissions, arguing it shows the court is wary of race-conscious federal policies.\n'Because the EPA's regulations prohibit any action that results in racial disparities, a funding recipient must set demographic targets for their projects to maintain compliance,' the attorneys general wrote. 'This kind of allocation based on group membership is a constitutional nonstarter.'\nThe Florida attorney general's office, which took the lead on the petition, said the states would sue if the EPA does not amend its rules.\nAdvertisement\nEPA declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation around the issue.\nTitle VI aims to prevent discrimination in programs that receive federal funds. The agency can investigate allegations of discrimination, publish their findings and pressure states and local governments to agree to change policies. The federal government can yank funding if they find a Title VI violation.\nDebbie Chizewer, managing attorney in the Midwest office at the environmental group Earthjustice, said Title VI is part of the country's historic fight against discrimination and is still a critical tool. Elected officials across the county permitted numerous polluting factories, chemical plants and refineries near minority communities that now are burdened with the effects, including poorer health, lower property values and economic blight.\nAdvertisement\n'I think it is a perversion of our civil rights laws to say otherwise, to say that you can't account for these past harms by creating policies that protect communities that are disproportionately harmed,' she said.\nPreviously, Title VI has been a relatively weak environmental weapon, rarely resulting in significant changes to environmental policy. Under the Biden administration, however, environmental and civil rights groups were hopeful it could be used to do more.\nThose groups asked the EPA to investigate Louisiana's regulation of air pollution, arguing that it disproportionately hurt majority-Black communities near heavy industry. They highlighted the Denka Performance Elastomer plant that makes synthetic rubber and emits harmful chloroprene. It's located a half-mile from an elementary school. The agency agreed to investigate and released initial findings saying there was evidence of discrimination.\nAdvertisement\nBut before the state agreed to any changes, the EPA dropped its investigation. The end came soon after Louisiana sued the agency, arguing that focusing on policies that may harm one group more than another but weren't intentionally discriminatory went too far.\nThat lawsuit has so far seen success. In January, a federal judge in Louisiana put a temporary halt on the EPA's power to investigate discrimination that had a so-called 'disparate impact.' A final decision in the case hasn't come yet.\nEnvironmental groups have worried that the EPA's move in Louisiana amounts to a pullback on the Biden administration's commitment to fighting environmental discrimination.\nEPA officials are wary of unfavorable court rulings and a conservative Supreme Court that has already curtailed its regulatory power. The Supreme Court restricted the EPA's authority to fight air and water pollution \u2014 including a landmark 2022 ruling that limited the EPA's authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants that contribute to global warming.\nAdvertisement\nRegan said earlier this month that he believes strongly in using Title VI to fight environmental discrimination, but it's complicated.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'It is not just on this issue, we face headwinds in the courts on a lot of issues,' Regan said. He added that the EPA is trying to ensure every action it takes can withstand a court challenge.\nBut the agency has other options to hold polluters accountable, he said. Recently, for example, the EPA finalized new, tougher, emissions limits for more than 200 chemical plants, including the Denka facility under scrutiny in Louisiana.\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Michael Phillis","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.4882975,"_id":"9308b3418cf650ba1d959001db579742"},{"title":"Biden's options for retaliating against Iran risk antagonizing China","author":"Jeff Stein","published_date":"2024-04-16 10:00:45","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/04/16/sanctions-iran-biden-china","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The administration faces challenges enacting new economic penalties that are not purely symbolic, experts say.","summary":"President Biden's aides are preparing to hit Iran with economic sanctions over Tehran's attack on Israel, but experts say they face limited meaningful options for doing so without antagonizing China or risking a spike in the price of oil.\nIn retaliation for a strike against its consulate, Iran over the weekend sent more than 300 drones and missiles toward Israel. The unprecedented aerial barrage did not cause major damage or injuries, as U.S.-led forces intercepted most of the projectiles.\nStill, U.S. officials and their European allies are discussing potential economic responses to Iran, as leading Western officials converged Monday on Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Their options are limited because Iran is already one of the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world, with U.S. penalties in effect on its banking, manufacturing and energy sectors.\nAdvertisement\nAmong the most obvious remaining options is aggressively expanding sanctions on Chinese firms that have bought large quantities of Iranian crude oil exports, which have provided a financial lifeline for Tehran as it remains cut off from the West. The United States has over the last year imposed sanctions on some commercial links in the oil trade between China and Iran, but experts say the administration could go further by hitting many more Chinese refineries and banks with the restrictions.\nDoing so carries its own risks, however. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen and other administration officials have tried stabilizing relations with China in recent months, and a sudden blow to energy production could infuriate Beijing. Additionally, cutting off sales of Iranian crude could cause oil prices to spike globally amid tighter supply, potentially leading to higher gas prices ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n'There are not a lot of options that are game changers, because so much of Iran is already sanctioned,' said Rachel Ziemba, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a foreign policy think tank. 'But if you really want to cut off oil revenue for Iran, you have to go through China and Chinese institutions.'\nAdvertisement\nSanctioning Chinese banks for facilitating the purchase of Iranian oil could remove as many as 1.5 million barrels per day from global markets. That would send the price of oil above $100 per barrel, in what would be a political nightmare for the Biden administration, said Bob McNally, president of the Rapidan Energy Group, a consultancy.\n'The last thing Biden wants is higher gas prices, so he wants Iran selling its oil to China. He does not want that oil to be shut in. It's as simple as that; he can't afford to sanction Iran's oil,' McNally said. 'They could do some symbolic stuff, to go after a little trader here or there, but that's likely about it.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBiden has urged calm in the wake of Iran's attack. The United States has made clear it will not participate in any Israeli military attack against Iran, and senior officials have stressed that their aims are to 'de-escalate regional tensions' to prevent a broader conflagration. Israel's war cabinet met on Monday to deliberate potential responses.\nAdvertisement\nWhile the West is ruling out participating in a military response, an economic response to Iran's actions appears increasingly certain. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said officials in Brussels would discuss tougher sanctions against Iran. 'We will reflect on additional sanctions against Iran in close cooperation with our partners,\" she said in a statement.\nU.S. officials have, for instance, discussed tightening Iran's access to frozen funds earmarked for humanitarian relief, according to two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. They have also discussed imposing additional sanctions on Iranian officials and businesses. The first could prove largely symbolic: Iran is already hardly accessing these funds. It's also not clear how impactful sanctions on other firms, such as international suppliers of parts for Iranian drones, would prove.\nA Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment on ongoing deliberations, but Yellen is scheduled to address the media on Tuesday.\nAdvertisement\nThe Biden administration also faces pressure from Capitol Hill to act. The House overwhelmingly approved legislation on Monday aimed at cracking down Iranian oil sales to China. Critics have argued that Biden should have gone further to ensure Tehran is not able to reap billions from its oil exports.\n'In the wake of Iran's massive and disproportionate attack on Israel, and with an eye toward escalation, all nonmilitary measures must be on the table. This includes targeting Iran's ongoing oil sales,' said Matthew Levitt, director of the Jeanette and Eli Reinhard Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a D.C.-based think tank.\nStill, other experts say the challenge is that Washington has already been too aggressive in its posture toward Tehran. Iran has been under severe economic restrictions since the Trump administration abandoned the nuclear deal reached by President Barack Obama, and that gives policymakers little room to operate in the face of new emergencies.\nAdvertisement","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jeff Stein","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6VVAPG2JY3ERBZGMSS7OD6WXDQ.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.487724,"_id":"cf6f6c9441a392333eb06d55db53d868"},{"title":"Biden team greets limited scope of Israeli strike with cautious relief","author":"Yasmeen Abutaleb","published_date":"2024-04-19 20:47:41","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/19/us-greets-limited-israeli-strike-with-relief","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"White House had scrambled to avert a harsher Israeli attack on Iran that might have sparked a wider regional confrontation.","summary":"President Biden and his aides viewed Israel's strike on Iran on Friday as a relatively measured response to the barrage of missiles and drones Tehran launched toward Israel last weekend, and they are increasingly hopeful that the confrontation between the two states will not immediately spark a regional escalation, according to several people familiar with the White House's thinking, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe internal assessments.\nThe Biden administration had publicly urged Israel not to respond to the more than 300 missiles and drones Iran launched toward Israeli territory last weekend, about two weeks after an Israeli strike on an Iranian consulate in Syria killed a top general and several others.\nIsrael's strike was in a sense a rejection of Biden's request, but senior officials have concluded that its decision to aim at a remote part of Iran that did not appear to harm anyone \u2014 followed by a muted reaction by Iranian state media \u2014 makes it less likely that the tit-for-tat strikes will escalate into a broader war. An Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military matters, said the strike was intended mostly to signal to Iran that Israel has the ability to hit targets inside the country.\nAdvertisement\nThe White House declined to comment on the strike Friday. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he would not discuss whether Washington was warned about the strike, but he sought to distance the U.S. from Israel's action, saying that 'the United States has not been involved in any offensive operations.'\nThe developments came as a welcome change after six months in which it often seemed to White House officials that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took every opportunity to publicly rebuff any demand Biden made. Netanyahu's defiance came despite unwavering U.S. military and diplomatic support for Israel's military campaign in Gaza, which has isolated the country on the world stage.\nOn Sunday, the day after Iran's retaliatory barrage of missiles and drones, White House officials were deeply worried about how Netanyahu might respond, according to a person familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. But as the week unfolded and Biden officials had a better sense of the planned Israeli response, they became increasingly optimistic that the U.S. had been able to mitigate the escalatory risks, a senior official said.\nAdvertisement\nStill, deep disagreements remain between the U.S. and Israel that have yet to be resolved. Most immediately, American and Israeli officials are preparing to hold another high-level meeting about an impending Israeli operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where some 1.5 million Palestinians are sheltering after fleeing there under Israeli orders.\nU.S. officials have made it clear that they oppose a major military operation in Rafah without a 'credible' plan to protect the Palestinian civilians there \u2014 a task that some officials and experts have said is all but impossible. Israeli officials have said they still plan to go into the city to dismantle the remaining Hamas battalions there.\nEven as Biden and his top aides say U.S. support for Israel is 'ironclad' in the face of the Iranian threat, they remain firmly opposed to a Rafah operation that does not protect civilians, two people familiar with the discussions said.\nAdvertisement\nAnd even if a wider conflict does not immediately erupt, Middle East experts and analysts cautioned that the decades-long shadow war between Iran and Israel has now crossed an unprecedented threshold. The two countries have shown that they are willing to strike inside each other's territories, however carefully \u2014 a move both long avoided for fear of sparking a war that could become catastrophic.\n'We have not seen the conventional regional war that everyone fears, but at a moment's notice, anything could go wrong,' said Brian Katulis, vice president of policy at the Middle East Institute. 'It's not a sustainable situation when you look at the whole theater.'\nWhile Israel and Iran have been in a 'shadow conflict' for decades, Katulis said, their hostility has now become 'an open, low-grade direct military confrontation, and with that comes all sorts of risks.'\nAdvertisement\nBiden and his top aides expended significant energy this week to show Netanyahu that Iran would suffer nonmilitary consequences for its attack so Israel did not need to strike back, according to a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\nThose efforts included organizing the Group of 7 nations to issue a statement condemning Iran, as well as the U.S. imposing sanctions on Tehran. U.S. officials hoped that would persuade Israel that Iran was even more diplomatically isolated.\nBiden and his aides also tried to reassure Israelis that their ability \u2014 along with that of the United States and other partners \u2014 to strike down the vast majority of Iran's drones and missiles had reestablished deterrence, signaling to its neighbors that an attack on Israel would probably be fruitless. Several U.S. officials noted that Israeli leaders have feared looking weak since Oct. 7, when Hamas militants rampaged through the Israel-Gaza border fence and killed 1,200 people, many of them civilians, and took about 250 others hostage.\nAdvertisement\nIsrael responded with a punishing military campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, the majority of whom are women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel's siege of the enclave has created a humanitarian catastrophe as the health system has collapsed and more than 2 million Palestinians face famine.\nBut the war has spread beyond Gaza, and U.S. officials have long feared that it would escalate into a major regional conflagration that would further destabilize the Middle East. Israel is also fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon on its northern border, where rocket fire has killed and injured people on both sides of the border. Tens of thousands of Israelis have yet to return to their homes in the north because of the fighting.\nThe escalation with Iran has especially raised fears of how Hezbollah might react if tensions continue to rise. Hezbollah is Tehran's primary proxy group in the region and it has military capabilities far beyond those of Hamas.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Yasmeen Abutaleb","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E6LFWSYFXJHBEILKE4VKQGUWZA_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.482867,"_id":"48c9f1ed3a135bf8e895abe6207c4bf1"},{"title":"A flyer at a camp in Mexico urges US-bound migrants to vote for Biden.

Videos showed them on the interior walls of portable toilets at the center's shelter near Mexico's border with Texas.\nResource Center Matamoros founder Gaby Zavala told The Associated Press the organization doesn't know who made the flyers and said her group 'does not encourage immigrants to register to vote or cast ballots in the U.S.'\nAdvertisement\nThe provenance of the flyers was still unknown Wednesday. They contained errors in spelling and grammar, and appeared to include verbatim paragraphs from the organization's English-language website that were translated into Spanish using online translation software.\nDespite the flyers' uncertain origin, unverified claims about them have proliferated online this week and came up during a congressional hearing Tuesday, when House Republicans raised them in their questioning of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\nThe episode reflects how rapidly claims related to the migrant surge at the border can spread and influence the political debate as the presidential election approaches. Former President Donald Trump and his allies have used the surge to say, without evidence, that Democrats are allowing migrants into country as a way to boost Biden's re-election chances. Only U.S. citizens are permitted to vote in federal elections and historically the number of noncitizens caught attempting to cast a ballot illegally is extremely small.\nAdvertisement\nImages and videos of the flyers at the Matamoros center erupted online after the Heritage Foundation's oversight arm posted them on the social platform X on Monday evening.\nThe conservative think tank shared an image of one of the flyers, which was labeled as coming from Zavala and contained both the Resource Center Matamoros logo and another logo in Spanish reading, 'all with Biden.' It also shared a video that showed multiple flyers posted inside portable toilets where migrants might see them.\nThe letter misspelled the Spanish word for welcome, 'bienvenidos,' as 'bienvedinos.' It also contained minor grammatical errors in Spanish, including an incorrect tense ('mientras esperan' should be 'mientras esperen') and the United States in lower case ('estados unidos').\nThe text appeared to lift a paragraph from Resource Center Matamoros' English-language website, reciting the first two sentences verbatim, but translated to Spanish. The flyer added two sentences \u2014 which do not appear on the group's website \u2014 saying migrants need to vote for Biden.\nAdvertisement\n'This flyer obviously seeks to prey on unsophisticated illegals and encourages them to illegally vote,' the Heritage Foundation wrote on one of its social posts.\nHeritage also published a short audio clip of Zavala having a conversation with an unidentified male. After the male says he is trying to help as many people as possible before Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, gets re-elected, Zavala can be heard saying, 'Believe me, we're in the same boat.' The nine-second exchange did not include any further mention of voting or elections.\nZavala did not answer detailed questions about the exchange and told the AP that her organization does not support political campaigns for or against candidates. She said such activity would be 'outside the scope of our mission.'\nThe Heritage Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAdvertisement\nAs of Wednesday it was not clear when the video was shot, who created and posted the flyers, how long they remained inside the portable toilets or whether any migrants saw them. The think-tank credited the discovery of the flyers to a website that frequently posts about border issues, and whose founder regularly appears on streaming programs that promote conspiracy theories.\nThe claims that Resource Center Matamoros was behind the flyers were shared far and wide online, amassing millions of views across social media platforms. Threats appeared on a pro-Trump website, calling for Zavala's neck to be snapped and for members of her organization to be hanged.\nA flurry of partisan researchers online dug into the group's background, trying to identify potential links to a variety of U.S. and left-wing campaigns and causes. The flyers briefly mentioned the Jewish humanitarian organization HIAS, on whose board Mayorkas once sat. That connection drove additional claims that both HIAS and the Biden administration were using the flyers to try to rig the election.\nAdvertisement\nHIAS told AP it did not produce the flyers, does not support their message and has not rented space from or had any ties to Resource Center Matamoros since 2022.\n'These flyers are a clear attempt to spread misinformation about HIAS' work to support refugees,' its statement read.\nBiden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa called the flyers disinformation and said they should be labeled that way on social platforms and websites.\nRepublican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Dan Bishop of North Carolina brought up the flyers during a congressional hearing with Mayorkas on Tuesday, the same day as the House sent articles of impeachment against him to the Senate.\nGreene accused Mayorkas of 'aiding NGOs (non-governmental organizations) to steal our elections through your budget.' She didn't pause to allow him to respond.\nAdvertisement\nMayorkas didn't immediately respond on Wednesday to the AP's request for comment.\nThe claims exploded online as Trump and other Republicans are claiming that the surge of migrants at the country's southern border increases the risk that some of them living in the country without documentation will vote illegally.\nWhen people in the U.S. register to vote, they confirm under penalty of perjury that they are U.S. citizens. Several states also verify that registration against federal and state databases.\nWhile there have been anecdotal instances of noncitizens casting ballots, various states have examined their voter rolls and found no indication of significant numbers of noncitizens voting in federal elections. Studies also have shown the incidence is exceedingly rare.\n___\nAssociated Press immigration writer Elliot Spagat contributed to this report.\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Valerie Gonzalez,Ali Swenson","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PYEOOLX4EYI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.4818773,"_id":"599d7dbe7a88a81fbbc8e1082503ebef"},{"title":"Iran attack complicates Biden's push to change the course of Gaza war","author":"Yasmeen Abutaleb","published_date":"2024-04-15 23:03:27","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/15/biden-israel-iran-gaza","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"On Gaza, Biden is warning Israel to change its approach. On Iran, he is promising unconditional support.","summary":"Iran's recent attack on Israel has complicated President Biden's efforts to change Israel's course in Gaza and introduced a new, unpredictable element into his push to prevent the Israel-Gaza war from escalating into a broader conflict.\nJust days ago, Biden told Israel the U.S. would rethink its Gaza policy if Israel did not immediately address the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in the enclave, which is on the brink of famine due to an Israeli siege \u2014 a warning that many analysts took as a sign that the president would consider imposing conditions on military aid to the Jewish state.\nBut following Iran's attack on Sunday, Biden said America's commitment to Israel's defense is 'ironclad' in its conflict with Tehran, and he renewed his push for Congress to approve more military aid to Israel.\nAdvertisement\nWhile those two messages can coexist, they leave Biden telling Israel to change its course when it comes to one front of its conflict with its neighbors, while pledging unwavering support on another front.\n'The president publicly threatened to condition military assistance so we were about to get much tougher with the Israelis, then the attack by Iran comes along and everything gets swept to the side,' said Frank Lowenstein, a former State Department official who helped lead Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in 2014. 'Now we're back into lockstep on their big security issues.'\nLowenstein added: 'What's the impact on all the priorities we had before, including the cease-fire, humanitarian assistance and settler violence, going forward?'\nU.S. officials are urging Israel, in public and in private, to show restraint in response to the barrage of more than 300 drones and missiles that Iran sent toward Israeli territory overnight on Saturday. Officials have said 99 percent of the projectiles were intercepted and that the damage to Israel was minimal.\nAdvertisement\nBut Israeli officials said the unprecedented aerial attack could not go unanswered. They were deliberating Monday how best to respond without unduly angering their allies, whose support for Israel in the face of the Iranian assault is in sharp contrast to their criticism of the country's conduct of its scorched-earth military campaign in Gaza.\nOn Monday, the White House sought to cast Tehran's inability to cause significant damage or casualties as a resounding Israeli victory, seemingly in part to signal to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he does not need to respond. Washington has also emphasized that it will not participate in whatever military response Israel is planning.\nBiden noted to Netanyahu 'that this was an extraordinary success \u2026 and that that success alone \u2026 speaks volumes about Israel's standing in the region,' White House spokesman John Kirby said on Monday. 'The president urged the prime minister to think about what that success says all by itself to the rest of the region.'\nAdvertisement\nKirby argued that the Iranian attack strengthened Israel's strategic position and weakened Iran's, since it suggests Tehran has little ability to harm Israel. The White House appeared to be trying to reduce Israel's sense of vulnerability and isolation since Oct. 7, when Hamas militants rampaged easily through its defenses on the Gaza border and killed 1,200 people, many of them civilians, and took 253 hostage, according to Israeli authorities.\nIsrael's retaliatory assault in Gaza has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and prompted fierce international condemnation because of the high civilian death toll and Israel's refusal to allow a significant amount of aid to get into Gaza.\n'Much of the world is standing with Israel today,' Kirby said on Monday, adding, 'Unlike Iran, which is increasingly isolated on the world stage, Israel has friends.'\nAdvertisement\nThe Iranian action last weekend came in response to an Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria two weeks ago that killed two senior commanders. Iran said over the weekend that no additional military action was currently planned beyond the barrage of missiles and drones, but that any further Israeli action would be met with 'at least a tenfold response.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nSince the Oct. 7 attacks, Israel has sought to address an array of nearby threats with military force, arguing that it must reestablish deterrence in the region. Its adversaries include not only Hamas in Gaza, but also Hezbollah on Israel's northern border with Lebanon, where there has been an exchange of rocket fire for several months that has resulted in deaths in Lebanon. Tens of thousands of Israeli citizens have yet to return to their homes in the north because of the continued fighting.\nNow, American officials are increasingly concerned that Israel is looking to confront Iran directly, moving beyond the long-standing 'shadow war' between the two countries that has involved proxies and relatively limited strikes. Such a development would risk drawing in the United States, they fear, which is one reason they urged Israel so strongly on Monday not to escalate the conflict.\nAdvertisement\nDespite this, Israeli leaders are signaling that they believe they must respond to a barrage of weaponry fired directly at their soil.\n'One of the advantages of Israel not attacking is they can create a diplomatic effort to isolate Iran and it reduces public pressure on them on Gaza,' said Ron Halber, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington. 'The Israelis know this. The fact that they are willing to strain relations with the Biden administration over counterattacking ... shows the psychological impact of October 7th on Israel's psyche.'\nBiden officials' unease about the coming weeks is exacerbated by their concern over the mind-set of Netanyahu, who U.S. officials increasingly believe is prioritizing his own political survival above all else, potentially leading him to prolong the fighting on multiple fronts. Netanyahu is deeply unpopular among Israeli voters who blame him for the security failures that led to the Oct. 7 attacks and he faces multiple corruption charges, but it is harder for opponents to topple him in the midst of ongoing hostilities.\nAdvertisement\nMany U.S. officials worry that Netanyahu is far more focused on placating far-right members of his coalition \u2014 who favor resettling Gaza, arming Israeli settlers in the West Bank and fighting Iran directly \u2014 than on heeding Biden's pleas to de-escalate and provide more aid and protection to Palestinians. Netanyahu's repeated rejection of Biden's demands since Oct. 7 come despite the unwavering military and diplomatic support the United States has provided.\n'There's an awful lot of this Israeli government that wants a conflict with Iran, that sees this as their chance to perhaps get rid of the Iranian nuclear program or to get the United States involved,' said Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who worked on Middle East issues in the Clinton administration.\nNetanyahu 'is preoccupied with his political survival,' Riedel added. 'He knows if there is a cease-fire, an end to this conflict, the Israeli people are going to demand accountability and he's going to be out of office very quickly. Then he faces his corruption trials.'\nAdvertisement\nThe risk of escalation between Iran and Israel is also overshadowing the combustibility of the occupied West Bank. Israeli settlers in recent days went on a rampage against Palestinians there after the death of an Israeli teenager. A Palestinian was killed and dozens of others injured as settlers burned homes and cars.\nWhile the White House has sought to pressure Netanyahu to rein in Israeli settler violence \u2014 and has sanctioned a handful of settlers accused of violently attacking Palestinians \u2014 the conflict on the West Bank may be another issue that is harder for the administration to address as it works to head off further escalation in the broader Middle East.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Yasmeen Abutaleb","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JVTEH6ZWU2JGNO4KAUJTRDTXJA.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.4767466,"_id":"60b6429c1fea9b6a8fd4b2e7cba815bd"},{"title":"Biden limits oil drilling across 13 million acres of Alaskan Arctic","author":"Maxine Joselow","published_date":"2024-04-19 09:01:54","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/04/19/drilling-alaska-national-petroleum-reserve","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The Interior Department finalized a rule limiting future oil and gas development across 13 million acres of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.","summary":"Future oil and gas drilling will be limited across more than 13 million acres of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, the nation's largest expanse of public land, under a sweeping Biden administration plan aimed at protecting sensitive ecosystems and wildlife.\nThe Interior Department's final rule represents one of President Biden's most significant steps to curb fossil fuel development on federal lands. It could help the president's reelection campaign court young voters, a key Democratic constituency, after many youth climate activists criticized the administration's approval of a massive drilling project on Alaska's North Slope last year.\nIn a separate move, Interior announced Friday that it will block a controversial road crucial to operating a planned copper and zinc mine in northern Alaska, saying it would threaten Indigenous communities and fragment wildlife habitat. Together, the two decisions are aimed at safeguarding some of Alaska's last wild places from development.\nAdvertisement\nIn a statement, Biden said he was proud of his administration's efforts to protect the Arctic for current and future generations.\n'Alaska's majestic and rugged lands and waters are among the most remarkable and healthy landscapes in the world, sustaining a vibrant subsistence economy for Alaska Native communities,' Biden said. 'These natural wonders demand our protection.'\nBoth moves carry political and legal risks for the administration. In particular, the protections for the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska are expected to face lawsuits from fossil fuel companies and fierce opposition from Alaskan lawmakers, including Rep. Mary Peltola, a popular Democrat who faces a tough reelection contest.\nPeltola, whose race will help determine which party controls the House, wrote in a social media post last week that the administration was ignoring Alaskans' preferences for drilling in the reserve.\nAdvertisement\n'In the end it should be up to Alaskans to decide what they want developed in their regions,' Peltola wrote. 'I'm calling on the Biden Administration to rethink this misguided action that would only hurt Alaskans and our domestic energy production.'\nThe roughly 23 million-acre National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska is one of the most ecologically valuable tracts of federal land. It provides a critical refuge for tens of thousands of migrating caribou, as well as polar bears, grizzly bears, walruses and waterfowl.\nTeshekpuk Lake, in the eastern part of the reserve, is one of the most important places for waterfowl in the entire Arctic. Up to 100,000 geese converge on the area each summer, seeking safety from predators as they molt and become flightless. The adjacent wetlands serve as breeding grounds for several types of shorebirds, including dunlins, sandpipers and black-bellied plovers.\nYet the reserve, about the size of Indiana, is also one of the most promising onshore oil prospects in the country. Two weeks before leaving office, President Donald Trump sought to open up the reserve to oil and gas leasing, saying it would make the United States less dependent on foreign sources of energy.\nAdvertisement\nThe Biden administration has reversed course. In a proposed rule released last year, the Interior Department called for designating approximately 13 million acres of the reserve as 'special areas' where future oil and gas leasing would be limited. The agency also recommended an outright ban on new leasing across 10.6 million acres \u2014 more than 40 percent of the reserve.\nThe final rule closely resembles the proposed rule. Like the proposal, it would not affect ConocoPhillips's controversial Willow oil drilling project or other existing leases in the reserve. Willow alone could produce between 576 million and 614 million barrels of oil over the next 30 years.\n'The approval of Willow was certainly disappointing to many of us who recognize the climate impact of oil and gas development,' said Rachael Hamby, policy director at the Center for Western Priorities, a conservation group. 'With the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska rule, I think we see a more balanced approach to managing public lands for multiple uses, including conservation.'\nAdvertisement\nFossil fuel companies disagree. In public comments on the proposed rule, ConocoPhillips wrote that it could 'significantly and adversely affect future proposals for new activities and developments' in the reserve. Armstrong Oil & Gas, which has leases in the reserve spanning 1.1 million acres, said the proposal could prevent it from building the infrastructure needed to access those tracts.\nThe final rule drew a mixed reaction from Alaska Natives, who have lived on the North Slope for millennia and subsist on its caribou.\nDoreen Leavitt, director of natural resources for the I\u00f1upiat Community of the Arctic Slope, said the administration did not adequately consult Alaska Natives about the economic benefits of fossil fuel development in this remote region. Taxes on oil and gas infrastructure have funded local schools, police officers, firefighters and sanitation services.\nAdvertisement\n'We're barely 50 years away from getting indoor plumbing, and that was brought by oil and gas,' Leavitt said, adding, 'We feel that our voices haven't been listened to.'\nRosemary Ahtuangaruak, the former mayor of Nuiqsut, a town of roughly 500 people on the North Slope, said oil drilling has brought both prosperity and peril to her community. The region around Nuiqsut (pronounced noo-IK-sut) is one of the fastest-warming places on Earth. Its average temperature has risen 4 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels \u2014 more than three times the global average, according to a Washington Post analysis of temperature data.\nThe warmer climate has taken a toll on caribou populations near Nuiqsut, where residents get half their food through hunting. Warmer waters and less sea ice have also shifted the migration patterns of bowhead whales and derailed the fall whale hunt, an essential tradition for the Inupiat of the North Slope.\nAdvertisement\n'We want to protect our cultural traditions,' Ahtuangaruak said. 'And we want to give future generations hope that they won't be continually fighting to protect our way of life.'\nInterior's decision to block Ambler Road is intended to safeguard such lifestyles. In an analysis released Friday, the agency found that the road could threaten the subsistence activities of more than 60 Alaska Native communities, up from 27 communities in a highly contested 2020 analysis completed during the Trump administration. It also found that the road could cause irreparable harm to caribou and permafrost.\nAs a result, Interior recommended that there should be 'no action' on the federal land where the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (AIDEA) wants to build Ambler Road. If finalized, the decision will prevent AIDEA from receiving a permit to construct the road, and it will effectively block the mining venture Ambler Metals from accessing the planned open-pit mine. The company has yet to seek or obtain permits for the mine.\nAdvertisement\nAIDEA, the state's publicly owned development corporation, had planned for Ambler Road to extend 211 miles, crossing 11 major rivers and breaking apart unspoiled tundra. Twenty-six of those miles would have carved through Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, sending giant trucks rumbling through wild lands where tens of thousands of caribou migrate.\nThe Trump administration approved a right-of-way permit for Ambler Road in 2020, saying it could provide access to significant copper and cobalt deposits. But after Biden took office, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland ordered a fresh review of the road, saying the previous administration had not adequately studied its environmental impact.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Maxine Joselow","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T5HTZWDTHMI6ZCYKXT5LQAGEGA_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.4672832,"_id":"707c9213380426f154322c03b5eb2713"},{"title":"Biden's latest plan for student loan cancellation moves forward as a proposed regulation","author":"Collin Binkley","published_date":"2024-04-16 12:47:32","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/16/biden-student-loan-cancellation-forgiveness-college-debt/7dd108ae-fbef-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"President Joe Biden's latest plan for student loan cancellation is moving forward as a proposed regulation, offering him a fresh chance to deliver on a campaign promise and energize young voters ahead\u2026","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden's latest plan for student loan cancellation is moving forward as a proposed regulation, offering him a fresh chance to deliver on a campaign promise and energize young voters ahead of the November election.\nThe Education Department on Tuesday filed paperwork for a new regulation that would deliver the cancellation that Biden announced last week. It still has to go through a 30-day public comment period and another review before it can be finalized.\nIt's a more targeted proposal than the one the U.S. Supreme Court struck down last year. The new plan uses a different legal basis and seeks to cancel or reduce loans for more than 25 million Americans.\nConservative opponents, who see it as an unfair burden for taxpayers who didn't attend college, have threatened to challenge it in court.\nAdvertisement\nThe Democratic president highlighted the the plan during a trip to Wisconsin last week, saying it would provide 'life-changing' relief. He laid out five categories of people who would be eligible for help.\nThe new paperwork filed by the Education Department includes four of those categories, while a separate proposal will be filed later addressing how people facing various kinds of hardship can get relief.\nThe broadest forgiveness category would help borrowers who owe more than they originally borrowed because of runaway interest. It would eliminate up to $20,000 in interest for anyone in that situation, while those with annual incomes below $120,000 and enrolled in income-driven repayment plans would get all their interest erased with no maximum limit. It would be done automatically.\nAnother category would cancel loans for people who have been paying back their undergraduate student loans for at least 20 years, and those who have been paying graduate loans at last 25 years.\nAdvertisement\nIt would automatically cancel loans for those who went to colleges or programs considered to have low financial value. Borrowers would be eligible for cancellation if they attended a program that leave graduates with earnings no better than those with a high school diploma, for example, or programs that leave graduates with large shares of debt compared with their incomes.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBorrowers who are eligible for other federal forgiveness programs but haven't applied would also get loans erased. Federal education officials would use existing data to identify those people and offer relief. It's intended to reach those who don't know about other programs or have been deterred by complicated application processes.\nThe proposal was hashed out over the course of several hearings as part of a federal rules process that gathers advice from outside experts. The plan was drafted with the help of students, college officials, state officials, borrower advocates and loan servicers.\nAdvertisement\nDuring that process, advocates pushed for a fifth category of forgiveness for people who have different kinds of hardship that prevent them from being able to repay their loans. The Education Department said it's still working on the details of that rule, with a separate proposal to come 'in the coming months.'\nThe department said the hardship proposal will offer cancellation to borrowers who are at high risk of defaulting on their loans along with those who face other hardships, including high medical and caregiving expenses. That proposal will mirror one agreed upon by outside experts during the rulemaking process, the agency said.\nIt usually takes months for a proposed rule to be finalized, and months more before it can take effect. The Biden administration said it plans to start implementing some parts of the new proposal as soon as this fall, using the education secretary's authority to implement rules early in certain cases.\nAdvertisement\nRepublicans are staunchly opposed to any broad student loan cancellation, saying it's an unfair bailout for people who went to college. Two coalitions of Republican states have sued the Biden administration to block a separate repayment plan that offers an accelerated path to loan forgiveness.\nThe White House says it's confident the new plan is on solid legal ground, saying the Higher Education Act gives the education secretary the power to waive student loans in certain cases.\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Collin Binkley","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PDOWQEH354I65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.4373326,"_id":"8a4b4be87743b690a1f6987244205792"},{"title":"Today's Opinions: Trump fell asleep at trial.

The Biden campaign, meanwhile, had already begun to shift its online focus, rolling out a cadre of influencers and volunteers to spread their messages across private spaces on social networks.\nStill, in tight races across the country, neither Democrats nor Republicans can afford to ignore Facebook \u2014 the world's largest social media network. Political ad spending on social media is expected to almost double from $324 million in 2020 to $605 million in 2024, according to estimates from digital analytics firm EMARKETER.\n'There's no other platform that reaches as many voters at that scale,' said Eric Wilson, a managing partner at Republican campaign tech incubator Startup Caucus. 'So campaigns would be foolish to walk away from that.'\nAdvertisement\nMeta spokesperson Dani Lever argued that the changes are a response to user feedback. 'These changes are intended to impact what people see because that is what they told us they wanted \u2014 to see less political content and have more controls,' she said. 'This approach builds on years of work and is being applied to everyone.'\nMore than a decade ago, Silicon Valley courted the political world.\nZuckerberg moderated a 2011 town hall with President Barack Obama, broadcast live on Facebook. Presidential debates in the 2016 campaign streamed on Facebook Live. Advertising employees kept politicians and campaigns up to date on the company's latest tools, even embedding with the Trump team in 2016.\nBut following widespread outrage over attempts by Russian operatives to infiltrate social media to influence the 2016 presidential race, Meta \u2014 then known as Facebook \u2014 began rejiggering its strategy. The company scrapped commissions for its political ads sales reps and created a new site to promote its tools for politicians across the political spectrum.\nAdvertisement\nThe Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, which was partially organized on Facebook, sped this retreat. Soon after the siege, the company announced it would reduce the amount of political content appearing in users' news feeds.\n'People don't want politics and fighting to take over their experience on our services,' Zuckerberg told investors three weeks after the attack.\nIn February, Meta announced that it would stop recommending political content from accounts users don't follow on Instagram or its upstart text-based app Threads. Instagram head Adam Mosseri warned last year that Threads would not 'encourage' politics and 'hard news' on the platform because it wasn't worth the scrutiny.\nThe pullback has affected major news outlets, dramatically impacting engagement.\nThe 25 most-cited news organizations in the United States lost 75 percent of their total user engagement on Facebook and 58 percent of interactions on Instagram between the first quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2024, according to a data analysis by The Post. Right-leaning news outlets such as Newsmax, the Daily Wire, Fox News and Breitbart suffered bigger declines than their mainstream counterparts on Instagram, but no such partisan split occurred on Facebook, the analysis found.\n58 percent of interactions on Instagram between the first quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2024, according to a data analysis by The Post.

'There seems to be just a pattern away [from news and politics on social media], and it just makes me think: Where will people go for this information? Or will they just go without it?'\nResearch suggests that social media draws an 'inadvertent audience' to news about current events, increasing users' knowledge about politics. One 2020 study found that deactivating Facebook for the four weeks before the 2018 U.S. midterm election decreased users' factual understanding of the news and political polarization.\n'Most people don't care about politics that much, and so they're not going to go out and seek out information about politics,' said Joshua Tucker, a professor at New York University who studies social media and politics. 'Because people were on social media platforms for nonpolitical reasons, they got exposed to more political information.'\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, political campaigns are adjusting to this new reality. Biden appears to be countering the trend by posting more frequently on social media accounts \u2014 including from official White House pages \u2014 to drive engagement. Biden-linked Facebook posts increased from about 300 in March 2020 to more than 600 in March 2024, while Trump's posts dropped from more than 1,000 in March 2020 to about 200 in March 2024, the Post analysis found.\nWhile Trump dramatically increased posts to his own social network, Truth Social, he has refrained from publishing frequently Twitter, Facebook or YouTube. Top Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita likened Meta's push away from politics to a form of shadow banning, when tech companies allow users to post but secretly depress who sees the content.\n'People should be concerned, and Congress should have questions,' he said. 'I think Big Tech would be absurd if they think Republicans would not have a concern about them putting their finger on the scale of organic political speech.'\nAdvertisement\nBy contrast, the Biden campaign headed into the 2024 race with the understanding that it would be difficult to reach voters online. Instead, the campaign has been relying on digital advertising and volunteers to spread the word about the president in private digital spaces such as messages and social media groups.\nPolitical campaigns of all types have sought to overcome Meta's ad targeting limits by using their own data or publicly available information such as voter registrations to customize which ads are shown to certain audiences on Facebook. But trying to match voter files to individual users isn't always precise and doesn't completely replace the value that Meta's targeting options once offered campaigns, said Wilson, the conservative digital strategist.\n'Facebook knows a lot about its users,' Wilson said. 'It's some of the most valuable advertising data in the world \u2026 [but it's not available] for political campaigns.'\nAdvertisement\nStill, those campaign ads may become more critical in a world in which users are seeing less news and politics on their feeds.\n'How are voters supposed to learn about the issues that are at stake in an election?' Wilson asked. 'It's, I think, ultimately troubling for both sides \u2014 but really our democracy in general \u2014 that politics is being treated as, like, a four-letter word and pushed out of the public square.'\nMethodology: The Post analyzed Facebook and Instagram engagement for top news organizations as well as for the Trump and Biden campaigns using data from CrowdTangle.

That group also spent $400,000 on 'document hosting' fees that are often related to discovery in legal cases. Trump spent more than $55 million on legal fees in 2023, creating a strain on overall fundraising effort as he fights criminal charges in four cases.\nThe Biden campaign announced earlier this month that it raised more than $90 million in March and that broader Biden effort had about $192 million in cash at the end of the month \u2014 more than double what their rivals are holding in their war chest. Reports from some Biden committees, alongside Democratic super PACs, showed the generosity of top Democratic donors such as megadonor James Simons, who gave $2.5 million each to Future Forward super PAC and Senate Majority PAC in the first three months of the year. He was joined by businessman Fred Eychaner, Kenneth and Jennifer Duda, and others in writing seven-figure checks to Future Forward, which raised $20 million in the first quarter of the year and has promised to spend $250 million on ads supporting Biden.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nOne notable donor to Biden's effort was David Ellison, the CEO of Skydance Media, who gave the maximum of $929,600 to the Biden Victory Fund in the first quarter.

The Trump 47 committee collected checks totaling more than $800,000 from Robert Mercer, the billionaire hedge fund magnate; Linda McMahon, the former professional wrestling executive who served as Trump's head of the Small Business Association; Casino mogul Phil Ruffin; Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, and his wife Suzanne; and Joe Ricketts, who is the founder of TD Ameritrade.\nThe Trump 47 committee collected checks totaling more than $800,000 from Robert Mercer, the billionaire hedge fund magnate; Linda McMahon, the former professional wrestling executive who served as Trump's head of the Small Business Association; Casino mogul Phil Ruffin; Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, and his wife Suzanne; and Joe Ricketts, who is the founder of TD Ameritrade.\nSenate GOP self-funded candidates spend big\nThough some Democratic incumbents posted an impressive total in hotly contested Senate races, Republicans have fielded several wealthy candidates who can fund their own campaigns including Tim Sheehy in Montana and Eric Hovde in Wisconsin, both of whom are backed by Trump.\nAdvertisement\nHovde, a banking executive who is challenging Baldwin, reported Monday that he had raised $9 million in the first quarter of this year \u2014 including $8 million that he loaned to himself. At the end of March, he reported $5.35 million in cash to Baldwin's more than $10 million. Baldwin raised $5.4 million over the first three months of the year and spent $3.1 million.\nTim Sheehy, the former Navy SEAL challenging Tester in Montana, loaned another $500,000 to his Senate campaign \u2014 bringing the total that he has loaned to his campaign to $1.45 million so far this cycle. The Republican candidate, who owns an aerial firefighting business, has been at the center of controversy in the Montana race after The Washington Post detailed the inconsistent accounts he has given over the years about his war wounds.\nSheehy reported $1.9 million in cash on hand at the end of the third quarter after raising $3 million and spending about $2.4 million. The Montanans for Tester reported raising $8 million during the quarter; spending $6.4 million and ending the three month period with about $12.6 million in cash on hand.\nMegadonors make a play in key Senate races\nKen Griffin, one of the biggest donors to the Republican Party who ultimately put money behind the super PAC supporting Nikki Haley in her battle against Trump, is turning his attention to Senate and House races.\nAdvertisement\nGriffin donated $10 million to newly formed super PAC, Maryland's Future, at a moment when former governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, is making a play for the Senate seat in a blue state.\nHogan upended the race when he made a surprise entrance earlier this year, and a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released in March showed him leading his Democratic rivals by double-digits. Several Democrats \u2014 including Rep. David Trone (D-Md.) and Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks \u2014 (D) are facing off in the May 14 primary for the seat that is being vacated by retiring Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.). Trone loaned his campaign another $18.5 million in the first quarter and reported less than a $1 million in cash. Monday's reports show that Trone has now loaned more than $41.7 million to his campaign.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Clara Ence Morse,Maeve Reston","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/N7KT4W2KLJCZ6JOSKPA2OLRDXU_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.408955,"_id":"29dfa55fb9ba1b5adc4d07d7c148f6bc"},{"title":"Congress moving swiftly on bipartisan action to punish Iran after revenge attack on Israel","author":"Farnoush Amiri","published_date":"2024-04-18 04:18:22","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/18/iran-israel-strikes-congress-republican-mike-johnson/b16991c6-fd3a-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Iran's attack against Israel over the weekend has spurred a flurry of bipartisan legislative action in Congress","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Iran's attack against Israel over the weekend has spurred a flurry of bipartisan legislative action in Congress, uniting lawmakers against the country even as the risk of a larger regional war looms.\nSeveral measures introduced and passed in the House and Senate seek to both publicly condemn Iran and punish the Islamic Republic financially. Lawmakers have denounced Iran's actions, which came in response to a suspected Israeli strike weeks earlier on an Iranian consular building in Syria that killed two Iranian generals.\n'The world is on fire, and history will judge us for our action,' said Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, during a news conference Tuesday.\nThe swift, bipartisan condemnation of Iran has put on sharp display the durability of American support for Israel, even amid growing partisan division over how the country is handling its more than six-month war with Hamas.\nAdvertisement\nThe House passed nearly a dozen bills by Wednesday that would, among other things, issue a slate of new sanctions and other financial restrictions against Iran and its leaders. Other legislation looks to prevent current Iranian officials sanctioned from evading those penalties and urge the European Union to 'expeditiously' designate Iran's Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization as the U.S. has already done.\nOn the other side of the Capitol, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday advanced five bills, including ones that targeted Iran for its human rights record and would require sanctions on ports and refineries that receive and process Iranian oil.\n'Iran's direct attack on Israel this week underscores the need to further cut off the Iranian regime's key revenue streams,' Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire said in a statement. 'I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this bill \u2014 which has already passed the House \u2014 so that we can send it to President Biden's desk immediately.'\nAdvertisement\nA number of the bills had passed the House weeks before Hamas' deadly attack on Israel in October but have been stalled in the Senate committee. An Israeli offensive in Gaza has since caused widespread devastation and killed over 33,000 people, according to local health officials. Israel's conduct of the war has revealed the depth of unease among U.S. lawmakers as concerns over the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza have caused even some of President Joe Biden's closest allies to threaten conditioning future aid to Israel.\nCongressional Democrats have been reluctant to challenge Biden's handling of the ongoing conflict and related regional tensions that have taken shape, mindful that criticism could further weaken Biden in his reelection campaign against former President Donald Trump.\nBut the attack on Saturday has proven to consolidate public support for the Biden administration's quick response as it ordered U.S. forces to help Israel down 'nearly all' the 300 drones and missiles that were headed its way.\nAdvertisement\nIt also comes as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., released legislation Wednesday that would provide $95 billion in aid collectively to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan. The aid package had been held up for months over Republican opposition to continuing wartime funding for Ukraine as it battles Russia. Iran's attack on Israel added urgency to Johnson's plans to bring the issue to the floor for a vote.\nWhile the measures targeting Iran have received overwhelming support \u2014 with the series of House bills mostly passing with at least 300 votes \u2014 there has been a quiet but growing dissent among progressive Democratic lawmakers in both chambers, who warn that legislative efforts could risk further escalation in the Middle East.\n'Following last weekend's unprecedented response by Iran to Israel's attack on its consulate, the Republican Majority is explicitly leveraging a series of bills to further escalate tensions in the Middle East,' Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said in a statement Tuesday. 'This is a blatant attempt to distract from their own incompetence.'\nAdvertisement\nThe strike on Saturday marked the first time Iran has launched a direct military assault on Israel despite decades of enmity dating back to the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel has vowed to retaliate against Iran, risking further expanding the shadow war between the two foes into a direct conflict.\nSen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, condemned Iran's attack in a statement but called on his colleagues to respond cautiously. He warned that further U.S. action against Iran could lead to a dangerous escalation that could drag America into a war in the Middle East.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Farnoush Amiri","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.379771,"_id":"fd690e5ae1d44a3a0296ca13724727fd"},{"title":"Pennsylvania race previews Democrats' plan to focus campaign on democracy","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-22 10:00:06","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/22/scott-perry-democrats-pennsylvania-primary-democracy","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The bid to oust Republican Rep. Scott Perry has centered on his involvement in Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.","summary":"CAMP HILL, Pa. \u2014 Democratic congressional candidate Mike O'Brien had only been knocking on doors in a leafy suburban neighborhood here for about 20 minutes when he came upon a house with a sign featuring his opponent's face in the window. He smiled.\n'WANTED for crimes against the CONSTITUTION,' the sign read. 'Scott Perry for Prison. Traitor. Insurrectionist. Criminal.'\n'That's one of the reasons why I'm running,' O'Brien, one of six Democrats vying to unseat Perry, a GOP congressman, told the couple who answered the door. 'You can't let Trump and Perry overthrow democracy under the guise of patriotism anymore.'\nIt's a message that Democrats, including President Biden, hope will resonate in places like Camp Hill, a middle-class suburb outside Pennsylvania's capital, Harrisburg. The area was once a Republican stronghold but has become more politically independent in recent years due to population growth and moderate Republicans alienated by Trump's norm-busting behavior.\nAdvertisement\nThe competitive Democratic primary here Tuesday offers a preview of how Democrats intend to make democracy a central issue in competitive races for seats such as Perry's, which could help determine control of the narrowly divided U.S. House. It also provides a glimpse of the case Biden will make in battleground states like Pennsylvania.\nBiden has said his reelection is above all else about preserving democracy, which he warns is under threat if Trump wins a second term. In his first campaign speech of 2024, on the day before the anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, Biden stood less than 100 miles from here in Valley Forge.\n'Whether democracy is still America's sacred cause is the most urgent question of our time, and it's what the 2024 election is all about,' he said.\nIt remains unclear whether voters will see it that way. Beyond the defense of democracy, Americans will be asked to weigh more tangible issues, including inflation, immigration and abortion. The age of the candidates \u2014 Biden is 81 and Trump is 77 \u2014 will also loom large in a presidential rematch that polls show many Americans didn't want.\nAdvertisement\nBut there's also reason to believe democracy as an issue will carry more weight than it did four years ago. This is the first presidential vote since Trump and his allies spread false claims about the 2020 election results, a violent mob besieged the U.S. Capitol to stop the certification of Biden's victory and Trump declared that he would be a 'dictator' \u2014 if only on 'day one' of his second term.\nSince the 2020 vote, there has been additional evidence that campaigns built on the defense of democracy can resonate in the Trump era. In his campaign for governor in 2022, Democrat Josh Shapiro eviscerated Republican Doug Mastriano, who played a key role in the effort to challenge Biden's win in Pennsylvania and paid to bus Trump supporters to Washington for the 'Stop the Steal' rally on Jan. 6. Shapiro ultimately beat Mastriano by 15 percentage points.\nDemocrats say a similar pitch will work in the 10th Congressional District race against Perry, who was a key liaison between House Republicans and the White House in efforts to overturn the election.\nAdvertisement\nThe House select committee investigating Jan. 6 found that Perry took part in White House meetings where strategies to try to undermine the transfer of power were discussed. He also pressed the Justice Department to investigate wild and unfounded claims that military satellites had been used to flip votes from Trump to Biden. After Trump supporters attacked the Capitol, Perry formally objected to the counting of Pennsylvania's electoral votes.\nIn 2022, the FBI seized Perry's cellphone as part of its investigation into attempts to thwart certification of the 2020 election. The Jan. 6 committee subpoenaed the congressman to testify, but he refused. He later denied assertions by former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson that he had asked for a preemptive pardon.\nNationally, Democrats see Perry, who is running for his seventh term in Congress, as one of their best shots at toppling a prominent election denier and are expected to invest heavily in trying to flip the seat.\nAdvertisement\nWhile most Republicans who voted against certifying the 2020 results represent safe red districts, Perry's district is more of a bellwether. Under the boundaries of the 10th District, Trump would have won by four percentage points over Biden. Shapiro won the district by 12 percentage points in 2020, while Perry won reelection by eight points. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the district 'lean Republican.'\nDemocrats say they can beat Perry this time with a stronger candidate and a more targeted message tying the congressman to extremism and Jan. 6, as Shapiro successfully did against Mastriano. Perry's campaign said it sees that as a fantasy.\n'They say insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result. Democrats tried and failed to make the events that followed the 2020 election an issue in the 2022 midterm elections. Congressman Perry earned reelection in 2022 by an even larger margin than he did in 2020 because the voters of south-central Pennsylvania know he is fighting for them each and every day,' said Matt Beynon, spokesman for the Perry campaign.\nSome public polling suggests that Democrats are significantly more worried about threats to democracy than other voters. A USA Today-Suffolk poll conducted in March asked respondents to choose the issue most important to them in their presidential vote. Among Democrats, 44 percent said threats to democracy were their top issue versus 20 percent of independents and 6 percent of Republicans. For Democrats, no other issue came close.\nA Washington Post-Schar School poll also conducted in March found that a majority of Americans were very or extremely worried about threats to democracy in the United States, including 58 percent of Democrats and 47 percent of Republicans.\nAdvertisement\nStephen Medvic, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College, said democracy is clearly a factor for voters in the Democratic primary. But he said he's skeptical of its power to move swing voters in the general election against Perry.\nThe Democratic nominee, he said, will have to 'connect a bunch of dots that this candidate had a role, and that Jan. 6 was a real threat and going forward that Trump and Perry would continue to put democracy at risk.'\nDemocrats are getting some help on that front from anti-Trump Republicans. A new group, Republicans Against Perry, placed a billboard this month on a major interstate through the district. The ad shows photos of Mastriano and Perry, both with red Xs over their faces.\nCraig Snyder, who served as chief of staff to then-Republican Sen. Arlen Specter, started the group and said he's received thousands of inquires from people who want to be involved.\nAdvertisement\n'When you look at the responses we've had, the people wanting to come to events, it's enough Republicans in the district to form a pro-democracy coalition,' he said.\nFirst, Democrats need to pick a candidate to run against Perry.\nO'Brien, a 42-year-old retired TOPGUN fighter pilot, said voters are most enthusiastic when he alleges that Perry, who is also a veteran, violated his oath of office to uphold the Constitution by siding with Trump after the 2020 election.\nAs O'Brien knocked on doors in the district one recent day, a couple in their 80s told him that they were deciding between him and Janelle Stelson, a longtime local TV news anchor whose name recognition has made her the presumptive front-runner in the race. O'Brien told them that his message is 'very focused on democracy and making sure that Trump and Perry aren't in a position to overthrow it again.'\nAdvertisement\nThe couple said they had long been registered Republican but recently became Democrats because of their deep aversion to Trump. Electing him again, Kathy Vollmer, 83, said, 'would be like vindicating him.' Her husband, Phil Vollmer, 85, chimed in, saying, 'Perry's an idiot. Trump is dangerous.'\nStelson was also a longtime registered Republican but switched to become a Democrat in January 2023. If she can convince traditional Democrats to vote for her in the primary, she said she thinks her past political affiliation will help her win over the independents and Republicans needed to beat Perry.\nWalking through a suburban neighborhood in York County one recent day, Stelson said Perry's role in Jan. 6 is part of her message. 'He tried to overturn all of our votes,' she said.\nBut she's also focusing heavily on reproductive rights and Perry's support for legislation that would make it federal law that life begins at conception.\nAdvertisement\nHours before the last debate of the primary, O'Brien went to get a fade at the barbershop in Harrisburg he frequents. Inside, over the low hum of razors, he debated politics with owner Johnny Butler, a registered Democrat who said he has backed Trump because he finds the former president to be authentic \u2014 even if he's lying.\nButler said issues such as inflation are on his mind as he makes his choices for 2024. Asked if he was worried that Trump would attempt to subvert democracy, Butler said that 'it's impossible' because of the Constitution.\nLater that night, Butler was in the debate's audience to support O'Brien, who was the only candidate on the stage to mention democracy in his opening and closing remarks. In their questions, the moderators didn't bring it up.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RI55GNNQKO7TPZMXWE3PN6OTME_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.314785,"_id":"4f48d25ab8bbe695615cddb093db1856"},{"title":"Biden Title IX rules set to protect trans students, abuse survivors","author":"Laura Meckler","published_date":"2024-04-19 09:00:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/04/19/titleix-biden-transgender-sexual-assault","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The Biden administration finalized sweeping Title IX rules barring discrimination against transgender students and ordering a new system for sexual assault claims.","summary":"The Biden administration on Friday finalized sweeping new rules barring schools from discriminating against transgender students and ordering significant changes for how schools adjudicate claims of sexual harassment and assault on campus.\nThe provisions regarding gender identity are the most politically fraught, setting up an election-year culture clash with conservative states and school boards that have limited transgender rights in schools, banned discussion of gender identity in classrooms and removed books with LGBTQ+ themes. Mindful of the politics, the administration is delaying action on the contentious issue of whether transgender girls and women should be allowed to compete in women's and girls' sports.\nThe long-awaited regulation represents the administration's interpretation of Title IX, a 1972 law that bars sex discrimination in schools that receive federal funding. Title IX is best known for ushering in equal treatment for women in sports, but it also governs how schools handle complaints of sexual harassment and assault, a huge issue on many college campuses.\nAdvertisement\nNow the Biden administration is deploying the regulation to formalize its long-standing view that sex discrimination includes discrimination based on gender identity as well as sexual orientation, a direct challenge to conservative policies across the country.\nTen states, for instance, require transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their biological sex identified at birth, according to tracking by the Movement Advancement Project. Some school districts will not use the pronouns corresponding with a trans student's gender identity. Both situations might constitute violations of Title IX under the new regulation. In addition, if a school failed to properly address bullying based on gender identity or sexual orientation, that, too, could be a violation of federal law.\n'No one should face bullying or discrimination just because of who they are or who they love. Sadly, this happens all too often,' Education Secretary Miguel Cardona told reporters in a conference call.\nAdvertisement\nThe Education Department's Office for Civil Rights investigates allegations of sex discrimination, among other things, and schools that fail to come into compliance risk losing federal funding. A senior administration official said that the office could investigate cases where schools were potentially discriminating, even if they were following their own state's law.\nThe final regulation also includes provisions barring discrimination based on pregnancy, including childbirth, abortion and lactation. For instance, schools must accommodate students' need to attend medical appointments, as well as provide students and workers who are nursing a clean, private space to pump milk.\nThe combination of these two issues \u2014 sexual assault and transgender rights \u2014 drew enormous public interest, with some 240,000 public comments submitted in response to the proposed version published in 2022. The new rules take effect Aug. 1, in time for the start of next school year.\nAdvertisement\nThe final regulation unravels a Trump-era system for handling sexual assault complaints, discarding some of the rules that bolstered due process rights of the accused. Supporters said those rules were critical to ensuring that students had the opportunity to defend themselves; critics said they discouraged sexual assault survivors from reporting incidents and turned colleges into quasi-courtrooms.\nEducation Department officials said they had retained the elements that made sense but created a better overall framework that gave equal treatment and balanced the rights of all involved. 'A fair process will help ensure that investigations lead to accurate, reliable and effective resolution of sex discrimination complaints,' Cardona said.\nUnder the Trump administration's regulation, finalized in 2020, colleges were required to stage live hearings to adjudicate complaints, where the accused could cross-examine witnesses \u2014 including the students who were alleging assault. Supporters said that live hearings were critical to ascertaining what actually happened when facts are contested, but others argued cross-examination could retraumatize assault survivors.\nAdvertisement\nUnder the new Biden rules, colleges will have more flexibility. The investigator or person adjudicating the case may question witnesses in separate meetings or employ a live hearing.\nThe new rules also will allow schools to use a lower bar for adjudicating guilt. In weighing evidence, they are now directed to use a 'preponderance of the evidence' standard, though they may opt for a higher standard of 'clear and convincing evidence' if they use that standard in other similar proceedings. Under the Trump version, universities had a choice, but they were required to use the higher standard if they did so in other settings.\nThe proposal also expands the definition of what constitutes sexual harassment, discarding a narrower definition used under President Donald Trump, and broadens who on campus has a responsibility to respond to allegations.\nAdvertisement\nSome of the Trump provisions were retained. Schools, for instance, will continue to have the option to use informal resolution of discrimination complaints, unless the allegation involves an employee of a K-12 school.\nThe Biden administration's approach was welcomed by advocates for sexual assault survivors.\nThe rules 'will make schools safer and more accessible for young people, many of whom experienced irreparable harm while they fought for protection and support,' said Emma Grasso Levine, senior manager of Title IX policy and programs at Know Your IX, a project of the advocacy group Advocates for Youth.\n'Now, it's up to school administrators to act quickly to implement and enforce' the new rules, she added.\nSexual assault has been a serious issue on college campuses for years, and in releasing the regulation, the Biden administration said the rates were still 'unacceptably high.'\nAdvertisement\nBut the most controversial element of the regulation involves the rights of transgender students, and it came under immediate fire.\nAdministration officials point to a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that sex discrimination in employment includes gender identity and sexual orientation to bolster their interpretation of the law. But conservatives contend that Title IX does not include these elements and argue that accommodations for transgender students can create situations that put other students at risk. They object, for instance, to having a transgender woman \u2014 someone they refer to as a 'biological man' \u2014 using women's bathrooms or locker rooms.\nRep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), chairwoman of the House Education Committee, called the regulation an escalation of Democrats' 'contemptuous culture war that aims to radically redefine sex and gender.' The department, she said, has put decades of advancement for women and girls 'squarely on the chopping block.'\n'Evidently, the acceptance of biological reality, and the faithful implementation of the law, are just pills too big for the Department to swallow \u2014 and it shows,' she said in a statement.\nAdvertisement\nStill, the administration sidestepped the contentious issue of athletics, at least for now. A separate regulation governing how and when schools may exclude transgender students from women and girls teams remains under review, and administration officials offered no timetable for when it would be finalized. People familiar with their thinking said it was being delayed to avoid injecting the matter into the presidential campaign, where President Biden faces a close race against Trump.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nA senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in a briefing with reporters Thursday, declined to comment on the politics of this decision but noted that the athletics rule was proposed after the main Title IX regulation.\nPolling shows that clear majorities of Americans, including a sizable slice of Democrats, oppose allowing transgender athletes to compete on girls' and women's teams. Twenty-five states have statewide bans on their participation.\nAdvertisement\nThe proposed sports regulation disallows these statewide, blanket bans, but it allows school districts to restrict participation more narrowly defined \u2014 for instance on competitive high school or college teams. The main Title IX regulation does not address the issue, and an administration official said the status quo would remain. Still, some have argued that the new general ban on discrimination could apply to sports even though the administration does not intend it to.\nThe rules governing how campuses deal with harassment complaints have changed repeatedly in recent years.\nThe Obama administration issued detailed guidance in 2014 for schools in handling complaints, but that was later tossed out by Trump Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Her department went through its own laborious rulemaking process to put a new system in place.\nAs a candidate for president in 2020, Biden promised to put a 'quick end' to that version if elected, saying it gave colleges 'a green light to ignore sexual violence and strip survivors of their rights.' Friday's action makes good on his promise.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Laura Meckler","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NVFXSUWGEFVERF7YSNCTF53MOQ.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.3093367,"_id":"7226bd922d2e47cf22b62cd490a4c0ed"},{"title":"Dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters arrested at Yale","author":"Jonathan Edwards","published_date":"2024-04-22 13:32:10","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/04/22/yale-university-protest-arrests-israel-gaza-war","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The arrests at Yale come days after more than 100 people were arrested at protests on Columbia University's campus.","summary":"More than 40 pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested Monday morning at Yale University, according to student newspaper the Yale Daily News.\nThe action came days after the arrest of more than 100 people protesting the Israel-Gaza war on Columbia University's campus, which sparked solidarity protests at other colleges including Yale.\nAt Columbia, pro-Palestinian students criticized the administration, which last week asked the New York Police Department to enter campus and break up the encampment, a day after school leaders were questioned on Capitol Hill by lawmakers who claimed the protests were antisemitic.

And on Tuesday, he is scheduled to deliver a speech in Scranton, Pennsylvania, about why the wealthy should pay more in taxes to reduce the federal deficit and help fund programs for the poor and middle class.\nBiden is proud to say that he was largely without money for much of his decades-long career in public service, unlike Trump, who inherited hundreds of millions of dollars from his father and used his billionaire status to launch a TV show and later a presidential campaign.\nAdvertisement\n'For 36 years, I was listed as the poorest man in Congress,' Biden told donors in California in February. 'Not a joke.'\nIn 2015, Trump declared as part of his candidacy, 'I'm really rich.'\nThe Republican former president has argued that voters have no need to see his tax data and that past financial disclosures are more than sufficient. He maintains that keeping taxes low for the wealthy will supercharge investment and lead to more jobs, while tax hikes would crush an economy still recovering from inflation that hit a four-decade peak in 2022.\n'Biden wants to give the IRS even more cash by proposing the largest tax hike on the American people in history when they are already being robbed by his record-high inflation crisis,' said Karoline Leavitt, press secretary for the Trump campaign.\nThe split goes beyond an ideological difference to a very real challenge for whoever triumphs in the November election. At the end of 2025, many of the tax cuts that Trump signed into law in 2017 will expire \u2014 setting up an avalanche of choices about how much people across the income spectrum should pay as the national debt is expected to climb to unprecedented levels.\nAdvertisement\nIncluding interest costs, extending all the tax breaks could add another $3.8 trillion to the national debt through 2033, according to an analysis last year by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\nBiden would like to keep the majority of the tax breaks, based on his pledge that no one earning less than $400,000 will have to pay more. But he released a budget proposal this year with tax increases on the wealthy and corporations that would raise $4.9 trillion in revenues and trim forecasted deficits by $3.2 trillion over 10 years.\nStill, he's telling voters that he's all for letting the Trump-era tax cuts lapse.\n'Does anyone here think the tax code is fair? Raise your hand,' Biden said Tuesday at a speech in Washington's Union Station to a crowd predisposed to dislike Trump's broad tax cuts that helped many in the middle class but disproportionately favored wealthier households.\nAdvertisement\n'It added more to the national debt than any presidential term in history,' Biden continued. 'And it's due to expire next year. And guess what? I hope to be president because it expires \u2014 it's going to stay expired.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nTrump has called for higher tariffs on foreign-made goods, which are taxes that could hit consumers in the form of higher prices. But his campaign is committed to tax cuts while promising that a Trump presidency would reduce a national debt that has risen for decades, including during his Oval Office tenure.\n'When President Trump is back in the White House, he will advocate for more tax cuts for all Americans and reinvigorate America's energy industry to bring down inflation, lower the cost of living, and pay down our debt,' Leavitt said.\nMost economists say Trump's tax cuts could not generate enough growth to pay down the national debt. An analysis released Friday by Oxford Economics found that a 'full-blown Trump' policy with tax cuts, higher tariffs and blocking immigration would slow growth and increase inflation.\nAdvertisement\nAmong Biden's proposals is a 'billionaire minimum income tax' that would apply a minimum rate of 25% on households with a net worth of at least $100 million.\nThe tax would directly target billionaires such as Trump, who refused to release his personal taxes as presidents have traditionally done. But six years of his tax returns were released in 2022 by Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee.\nIn 2018, Trump earned more than $24 million and paid about 4% of that in federal income taxes. The congressional panel also found that the IRS delayed legally mandated audits of Trump during his presidency, with the panel concluding the audit process was ' dormant, at best.'\nBiden has publicly released more than two decades of his tax returns. In 2022, he and his wife, Jill, made $579,514 and paid nearly 24% of that in federal income taxes, more than double the rate paid by Trump.\nAdvertisement\nTrump has maintained that his tax records are complicated because of his use of various tax credits and past business losses, which in some cases have allowed him to avoid taxes. He also previously declined to release his tax returns under the claim that the IRS was auditing him for pre-presidential filings.\nHis finances recently received a boost from the stock market debut of Trump Media, which controls Trump's preferred social media outlet, Truth Social. Share prices initially surged, adding billions of dollars to Trump's net worth, but investors have since soured on the company and shares by Friday were down more than 50% from their peak.\nThe former president is also on the hook for $542 million due to legal judgments in a civil fraud case and penalties owed to the writer E. Jean Carroll because of statements made by Trump that damaged her reputation after she accused him of sexual assault.\nIn the civil fraud case, New York Judge Arthur Engoron looked at the financial records of the Trump Organization and concluded after looking at the inflated assets that 'the frauds found here leap off the page and shock the conscience.'\n__","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Josh Boak,Jill Colvin","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PMNPQ3H23UI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.286326,"_id":"4be3535a8ff227e0ae530bc02108c0ad"},{"title":"Trump's Mar-a-Lago fundraising pitch to oil executives: I will kill wind","author":"Maxine Joselow","published_date":"2024-04-17 10:00:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/04/17/trump-wind-power-oil-executives","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"'I hate wind,' the former president told oil industry officials at a recent Mar-a-Lago dinner, doubling down on promises to end this form of clean energy.","summary":"Former president Donald Trump repeatedly ranted about wind power during a fundraising dinner with oil and gas industry executives last week, falsely claiming that the renewable-energy source is unreliable, unattractive and bad for the environment.\ndinner with oil and gas industry executives last week, falsely claiming that the renewable-energy source is unreliable, unattractive and bad for the environment.\n'I hate wind,' Trump told the executives over a meal of chopped steak at his Mar-a-Lago Club and resort in Florida, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation.\nTrump's comments reveal how he is wooing potential donors with his long-standing hostility to wind farms and pledges to halt this form of renewable energy if he returns to office.

His stance poses a potential threat to one of the linchpins of America's clean energy transition, according to more than a dozen Trump allies, energy experts and offshore wind industry officials.\nAdvertisement\nEven if President Biden were to win reelection, experts say, opponents of offshore wind will remain emboldened by Trump's stance and well positioned to challenge a new generation of projects in federal waters.\nAnd if Trump were to return to the White House?\n'If I were in the offshore wind industry, I would probably be pretty, pretty nervous,' said a former Trump administration energy official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly.\nnot authorized to comment publicly.\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to specific questions for this story, and it has not elaborated on his energy policies, which he has often summarized as 'drill, baby, drill.' In an emailed statement, Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said the former president would 'make America energy dominant again.'\nAdvertisement\nEnergy analysts say they expect a second Trump administration would slow the pace of offshore wind lease sales and environmental reviews. These steps could undercut the industry at the very moment when it needs to accelerate to meet Biden's goal of 100 percent clean electricity by 2035, and to help New England reduce its deep dependence on imported gas and oil.\n'Project reviews and auction schedules could slow substantially, potentially to the point of a de facto pause,' analysts with ClearView Energy Partners wrote in a recent note to clients. 'In short: the regulatory uncertainty from the upcoming election could keep project developers on the sidelines.'\nA Trump Interior Department would also prioritize offshore oil and gas leasing in the Gulf of Mexico over offshore wind auctions, said William Perry Pendley, who served as acting director of Interior's Bureau of Land Management under Trump.\nAdvertisement\n'The priority has to be oil and gas,' Pendley said, adding, 'I don't think there's a reason to press forward on wind.'\nTrump told executives at the fundraising dinner he would open up the Gulf of Mexico to drilling, a person with knowledge of the meeting said, lift Biden's pause on new liquefied natural gas exports, speed up drilling permits, reverse regulations aimed at deploying electric vehicles and do what he could to help the oil and gas industry. He listened to each executive for about four or five minutes.\nPointing out the window to the Atlantic Ocean at one point, one attendee said, the former president claimed that offshore wind turbines break down when they are exposed to saltwater \u2014 though these projects are designed to resist saltwater corrosion.\nNear the end of the meeting, Trump told executives that they should contribute to his campaign \u2014 the leader of his main super PAC was in the room \u2014 because he was trailing Biden financially. His policies would be much better for the oil and gas industry than those of Biden, and he'd do much of what they wanted 'on Day 1,' he said.\nAdvertisement\nIn addition to political uncertainty, offshore wind developers face significant economic challenges. Rising interest rates and supply-chain bottlenecks have contributed to the demise of some projects, including two in New Jersey late last year.\noffshore wind developers face significant economic challenges. Rising interest rates and supply-chain bottlenecks have contributed to the demise of some projects, including two in New Jersey late last year.\nDemocrats are doing their best to lock in commercial-scale offshore wind projects before Trump has a chance to halt them. The Biden administration has already approved eight, including one that is up and running. Democratic governors in the Northeast have also reinforced their commitments to deploying more offshore wind energy, regardless of the balance of power in Washington.\nIf Biden were to win a second term, he would be in a position to accelerate offshore wind along the Gulf and West coasts, and add more capacity to the Atlantic. Once those steel turbines were anchored to the ocean floor, they would be hard to scuttle \u2014 once reason the stakes now are so high.\nA long battle\nTrump's crusade against wind power dates back to 2006, when he bought an 1,800-acre estate in Scotland near a planned wind farm that he warned would be 'monstrous' and 'really ugly.'\nAdvertisement\nThe Trump Organization sought to build a golf course there, and it sued to block the wind project, saying the turbines would ruin the view for golfers. In December 2015, less than a year before the U.S. election, judges on Britain's top court unanimously rejected that claim.\nBut the battle raged on. While in the White House, Trump frequently attacked the clean-energy source, suggesting without evidence that it causes cancer.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'If you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations your house just went down 75 percent in value,' Trump said in a 2020 speech. 'And they say the noise causes cancer. And of course it's like a graveyard for birds.'\nThere are no known instances of wind farms causing cancer. While turbines can kill birds, research suggests that house cats cause far more bird deaths in the United States each year, and that painting the turbine blades black can help reduce fatalities.\nAdvertisement\nYet taking a cue from Trump's anti-wind rhetoric, Interior delayed the approval of America's first major offshore wind farm in 2019. Then-Interior Secretary David Bernhardt extended the environmental review of Vineyard Wind, a proposed wind farm near Martha's Vineyard, Mass.\nThe decision pushed back the timeline for the project, which had planned to start operating in 2021. It also cast a pall of uncertainty over the entire offshore wind sector, as other developers worried about the administration potentially interfering in their own projects.\nBernhardt, who now chairs the Center for American Freedom at the America First Policy Institute, a pro-Trump think tank, did not respond to requests for comment. Bernhardt has been talking with energy executives and others in recent weeks about policies in a second Trump term, according to a person familiar with the outreach, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.\n\u2018A shot in the arm'\nToday, the forces opposing offshore wind have multiplied and become more powerful. Fossil fuel interests have worked with right-wing think tanks and community groups to block projects up and down the East Coast, according to a recent report by Brown University's Climate and Development Lab.\nAdvertisement\nSeveral of these groups have repeated Trump's false claims that wind turbines are killing whales and driving the marine mammals 'crazy.' Many are now feeling emboldened by the former president's rhetoric.\n'It's a shot in the arm to our movement,' said Robin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast New Jersey, which describes itself as a grass-roots group made up of 'residents, homeowners, business owners, fishermen and visitors.'\nTrump 'rightly sees offshore wind as a boondoggle,' said H. Sterling Burnett, director of the Arthur B. Robinson Center on Climate and Environmental Policy at the Heartland Institute, a conservative think tank that has called climate change a 'hoax' and has sued to stop an offshore wind project off Virginia.\nEarly on, Protect Our Coast received support from the Delaware-based Caesar Rodney Institute, a think tank that has been backed by fossil fuel interests such as the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers and the American Energy Alliance. The Heartland Institute received funding from oil giant ExxonMobil until 2008.\nForging ahead\nRegardless of the election, officials in the Biden administration and Northeast are forging ahead with ambitious offshore wind goals. And they are making union labor \u2014 a key Democratic constituency \u2014 central to this push.\nAdvertisement\nInterior this month approved the nation's eighth large offshore wind project south of Martha's Vineyard, Mass. Overall, the Biden administration has approved more than 10 gigawatts of clean energy from offshore wind projects \u2014 enough to power nearly 4 million homes.\nIn New England, which relies on natural gas to fuel nearly 43 percent of its power generation, Vineyard Wind is now delivering power to roughly 30,000 homes, despite the delay under Trump. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey (D), who has set a goal of 100 percent clean electricity by 2030, has praised the developers for agreeing to hire hundreds of union workers.\n'In a whole new industry like offshore wind, we're seeing the beginnings of workers coming together and collectively organizing,' said Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, the country's largest federation of labor unions. 'These are all things that would be at risk if there were a second Trump administration. So we think it couldn't be more dire.'\nYet Rebecca Tepper, secretary of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, said Trump's false claims about wind power won't stop the state's progress.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Josh Dawsey,Maxine Joselow","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7SPM5SHZULAYCB5HCCGSOGOV44.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.2818446,"_id":"504cdce022d14073d3894f41036e8bdf"},{"title":"Johnson's Chamberlain-or-Churchill moment","author":"Theodoric Meyer","published_date":"2024-04-18 10:17:33","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/18/johnsons-chamberlain-or-churchill-moment","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"In today's edition \u2026 Johnson's foreign aid gambit gets tested at the Rules Committee \u2026 Kennedy family will endorse Biden.","summary":"Good morning, Early Birds.

The visit has been thrust into the spotlight as tensions in the region escalate following the strike, which included drone and missile launches that overflew Iraqi airspace and others that were launched from Iraq by Iran-backed groups.\nMichigan holds one of the largest populations of Iraqis in the nation and many local Democrats have pushed back against U.S. support for Israel's war in Gaza following the Hamas attack on Oct. 7. The state holds the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the country.\nAdvertisement\nThe Iraqi prime minister is expected to land in the Detroit area Thursday evening and be met by local leaders, including Wayne County Executive Warren Evans and Assad I.

In Wayne County, home to the cities of Detroit and Dearborn, 7.8% of residents identified of Middle Eastern and North African ancestry, alone or in any combination, the highest percentage of any U.S. county.\nThe concentration of those residents in the outskirts of Detroit has led to multiple visits to the area from officials engaged in Middle Eastern relations.\nAdvertisement\nAmos Hochstein, a senior adviser to Biden, traveled to metro Detroit in March to meet with Lebanese Americans and discuss efforts to prevent the conflict from expanding along Israel's northern border, where Hezbollah operates.

Kyiv sees them as essential.","summary":"BRUSSELS \u2014 When Vice President Harris met privately with Volodymyr Zelensky at the Munich Security Conference in February, she told the Ukrainian leader something he didn't want to hear: Refrain from attacking Russian oil refineries, a tactic U.S. officials believed would raise global energy prices and invite more aggressive Russian retaliation inside Ukraine.\nThe request, according to officials familiar with the matter, irritated Zelensky and his top aides, who view Kyiv's string of drone strikes on Russian energy facilities as a rare bright spot in a grinding war with a bigger and better equipped foe.\nZelensky brushed off the recommendation, uncertain whether it reflected the consensus position of the Biden administration, these people said. But in subsequent weeks, Washington reinforced the warning in multiple conversations with Kyiv, including by national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who traveled to Ukraine's capital in March, and other senior U.S. defense and intelligence officials.\nInstead of acquiescing to the U.S. requests, however, Ukraine doubled down on the strategy, striking a range of Russian facilities, including an April 2 attack on Russia's third-largest refinery 800 miles from the font.\nThe incidents have exacerbated tensions in a strained relationship as Kyiv waits to learn whether Congress will pass a long-stalled $60 billion aid package while Russia's forces pierce Ukrainian positions across the front lines. The long-range Ukrainian strikes, which have hit more than a dozen refineries since January and disrupted at least 10 percent of Russian oil refinery capacity, come as President Biden ramps up his reelection campaign and global oil prices reach a six-month high.\nAdvertisement\nU.S., Ukrainian and European officials spoke about the diverging views between Washington and Kyiv on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive dispute. A spokesman for Zelensky declined to comment.\nDefenders of Ukraine's strategy accuse the White House of prioritizing domestic politics over Kyiv's military goals. 'It sounds to me that the Biden administration doesn't want gas prices to go up in an election year,' Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) told Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during a hearing last week.\n'While Russia is attacking Ukrainians' oil and gas and energy sector, why shouldn't the Ukrainians attack the Russian oil and gas and energy sector?' Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.) asked during a separate recent hearing.\nU.S. officials say the rationale behind their warnings is more nuanced than critics suggest.\nAdvertisement\nKeeping global energy markets supplied to help cool inflation is a priority for the administration, officials acknowledge. But it's also important for sustaining support for the Ukrainian war effort in Europe. 'An increase in energy prices risks dampening European support for Ukraine aid,' a senior U.S. official said.\nThe military benefit of Ukraine's bombing campaign is also of questionable value, U.S. officials say.\n'Ukraine is better served in going after tactical and operational targets that can directly influence the current fight,' Austin told lawmakers.\nThe concern among U.S. military planners is that the strikes do little to diminish Russia's war-fighting abilities and have resulted in a massive Russian counterattack on Ukraine's electricity grid that hurts Ukraine far more than the refinery attacks hurt Russia.\nAdvertisement\n'Drone attacks do not destroy entire refineries and usually do not even destroy individual units, but only damage them,' Sergey Vakulenko, an oil industry expert, wrote in an analysis for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'The Ust-Luga and Ryazan refineries were both back in operation a few weeks after being attacked.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIn recent weeks, Russia has unleashed a barrage of exploding drones and missiles on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, leaving millions without power and raising fears that the attacks could bring Ukraine's economy to a halt. The attacks destroyed a power plant in the Kyiv region and damaged Ukraine's biggest hydroelectric power plant and multiple thermal power plants.\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said the attacks were in direct response to Ukraine's drone strikes on refineries and other infrastructure deep within its territory.\nAdvertisement\nPreviously, the Kremlin had been focusing its attacks on Ukraine's industrial capacity, an effort that some U.S. officials say was having limited impact.\nNow Ukrainian officials are in desperate need to protect their cities, causing further strain over air defense resources between Kyiv and the West. Last week, Zelensky dispatched his top diplomat, Dmytro Kuleba, to Brussels, where NATO foreign ministers gathered to commemorate the military alliance's 75th anniversary. Kuleba's chief demand was for Western countries to donate more Patriot batteries, a U.S.-designed air defense system that costs more than $1 billion.\n'I'm sorry to spoil the birthday party, but who can believe that the mightiest military alliance in the world cannot find seven batteries of Patriots to provide them to the only country in the world that is fighting ballistic attacks every day?' Kuleba said he told his Western counterparts in an uncharacteristically harsh tone.\nAdvertisement\nU.S. opposition to the refinery attacks has angered officials in Kyiv, who view the strikes as fair game given Russia's relentless attacks inside Ukraine. They view the attacks as necessary to raising the cost of Russian aggression and reinforcing that Russian society won't be safe until the war ends.\nThey also view the attacks as necessary given their shrinking supply of artillery needed for challenging Russian positions on the front lines. The transfer of U.S. weaponry to Ukraine has slowed in recent months as the Biden administration pushes Congress to pass aid for Ukraine in a measure that remains unpopular among a key faction of Republicans in the House.\nOthers have said U.S. concerns about higher energy prices because of the refinery attacks are unfounded, noting that the latest increases are due to OPEC Plus production cuts and instability linked to Israel's war with Hamas. 'There is a small geopolitical premium on crude attached to Middle East violence,' said Tom Kloza, head of energy analysis at the petroleum price reporting company OPIS. 'Most of the move to higher prices can be attributed to OPEC Plus production cuts.'\nAdvertisement\nCritics say the Biden administration's public messaging on the attacks has been inconsistent, causing confusion among supporters of Ukraine in Congress and abroad.\nWhen asked about the refinery attacks this month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested that the Biden administration doesn't support Ukrainian strikes inside Russia regardless of the target. 'We have neither supported nor enabled strikes by Ukraine outside of its territory,' he said.\nAustin's response last week to lawmakers, however, expressed a preference for Ukraine to target Russian air bases and other military infrastructure inside Russia rather than oil refineries.\nMeanwhile, another senior Pentagon official, Celeste Wallander, suggested that the key distinction the Biden administration is concerned about is Ukraine hitting military versus civilian targets. 'The issue on attacking critical infrastructure is when those are civilian targets, we have concerns because Ukraine holds itself to the highest standards of observing the laws of armed conflict, and that's one of the elements of being a European democracy,' she told a House panel last week.\nAdvertisement\nThe U.S. positions all stand in contrast to Washington's allies in Europe, who have barely disguised their pleasure with the Ukrainian campaign. 'The Ukrainian people [are] acting in self-defense, and we consider that Russia is the aggressor,' French Foreign Minister St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 said when asked about the strikes during a news conference with Blinken. 'In such circumstances, there is hardly anything else to say.

But the choice was 'fundamentally based on the actions and non-actions of Venezuelan authorities,' one official said.\nThe decision to let the license lapse was made after the administration determined that Maduro 'did not fully comply with the spirit or the letter of the agreement,' said one of three officials who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the White House.\nAdvertisement\nAlthough Maduro's government 'upheld certain aspects' of the deal \u2014 including setting the date for the presidential vote and taking initial steps to allow international electoral observers \u2014 his government 'has not followed through on the most critical' parts, a second official said.\nChief among them is Maduro's disqualification of the leading opposition candidate, Maria Corina Machado, who a series of polls have indicated would easily beat Maduro, running for his third term as president. The government also refused to allow Machado's chosen substitute, 80-year-old philosophy professor Cornia Yoris, to register.\nMaduro has continued to authorize a wave of arrests against political opponents and members of civil society. Amnesty International this week condemned a 'spike in arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances, misuse of criminal law, violations of due process and fair trial guarantees, stigmatizing campaigns, and possible acts of torture against people perceived as critical of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government.'\nAdvertisement\nIn apparent violation of the Venezuelan constitution, the government has also placed restrictions on allowing absentee ballots for millions of Venezuelans living abroad, ruling that they must have permanent residency wherever they are living and a Venezuelan passport. Many of the migrants who have left the country for economic or political reasons in recent years have neither.\nU.S. officials and Maduro representatives met multiple times in recent days to find a path forward. In Mexico City last week, the Biden administration continued to demand that Machado, or at least Yoris, be allowed to run and that Maduro release political prisoners, as agreed in the October deal signed by his government and opposition leaders in Barbados.\nMaduro, in a national broadcast Monday night, accused the United States of failing to follow through on its commitments to lift all sanctions.\nAdvertisement\n'We are going to keep moving forward with a license or without a license,' Maduro said. 'We are not a gringo colony, we are not your colony.'\nThe opposition, meanwhile, is still scrambling to unite around a candidate who might be allowed to run against Maduro. Only three were allowed to register ahead of a deadline last month \u2014 Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, a former diplomat with minimal name recognition; Manuel Rosales, the 71-year-old governor of the state of Zulia; and Enrique M\u00e1rquez, a former electoral official.\nRosales, who is seen by some as close to 'chavismo' \u2014 the left-wing, populist ideology tied to former president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who died in office and was replaced by Maduro in 2013 \u2014 registered without opposition backing at the last minute. Since then, he has suggested that he would agree to step aside and offer his slot to a different candidate.\nAdvertisement\nThe fractious opposition parties have until Saturday, under election rules, to suggest a single substitute candidate on a unified platform.

It's been a long time coming.\nAnd while the early proceedings in Donald Trump's Manhattan 'hush money'/election-interference case have been somewhat sleepy \u2014 quite literally if you're Trump \u2014 the stage is being set for one of the most consequential legal clashes in American political history. As a quick reminder: The case has to do with hush money payments Trump's lawyer made to an adult-film actress to keep her quiet weeks ahead of the November 2016 election and whether he falsified business records to cover it up.\nAdvertisement\nYou can read the blow-by-blow of all the significant legal maneuverings during jury selection from Monday, Tuesday and Thursday.\nAs for the politics? Here are my early thoughts.\nTrump's antics threaten to boil over, with major political \u2014 and societal \u2014 implications.\nTrump's antics threaten to boil over, with major political \u2014 and societal \u2014 implications.\nThe verdict is obviously important, for reasons we'll get to. But how we get there could also reverberate greatly.\nThe trial is quickly shaping up to be the culmination of Trump's years-long assault on a justice system that has long scrutinized him. And there's increasing reason to believe the situation could get ugly:\nWe're already seeing how all of this could matter. A juror whose biographical details were aired by media outlets \u2014 and scrutinized by Watters \u2014 raised concerns Thursday, citing how people were able to identify her. (Jurors in the case are being kept anonymous.) She was dismissed from the panel.\nThe play here is obvious. Trump wants to make clear that he will make life hard for anybody who might help deliver an adverse verdict. And Trump will push limits in ways that leaves the judge in the case with some very difficult decisions; imagine a situation in which the judge feels compelled to actually jail Trump. (As has been noted, Trump's actions probably wouldn't be tolerated by basically any other defendant.)\nAdvertisement\nTo the extent this can be turned into a circus, perhaps people will dismiss it. Or perhaps it will draw even more interest and people will see in Trump's actions what they previously found unappealing in him.\nAmericans by and large don't buy into Trump's claims that this is a 'witch hunt,' as I wrote this week. But even some who don't believe that do harbor some concerns about the process, and this case in particular . Trump is now forcing the issue in a major way, and how Americans regard the legal process and his conduct could matter greatly.\neven some who don't believe that do harbor some concerns about the process, and this case in particular. Trump is now forcing the issue in a major way, and how Americans regard the legal process and his conduct could matter greatly.\nThis case is less of a threat than the others. But.\nThis case is less of a threat than the others. But.\nThis case is objectively the one that Americans are the least concerned about. A poll this week showed just one-third thought Trump had broken the law \u2014 double-digits less than in his other three indictments. And about the same number regard the charges as 'very serious.'\nAdvertisement\nBut voters are also being reminded about a situation they have overwhelmingly found to be unsavory. About 8 in 10 said Trump at least did something wrong when the 2016 hush money payments to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels were first in the news back in 2018. And polling has shown as many as 7 in 10 say it's a crime to pay someone to remain silent about an issue that could affect an election (which is basically the substance of the charges).\nAlso, even that Associated Press-NORC poll showed 50 percent of voters said a conviction in this case would render Trump unfit for office. Just 29 percent said it wouldn't matter.\nWe've also seen in polls that a potentially decisive number of Americans say they'd flip their votes if Trump is convicted of a crime. Whether that would hold \u2014 and on this case, specifically \u2014 is a huge question.\nAdvertisement\nDemocrats' hands-off approach could be tested.\nDemocrats' hands-off approach could be tested.\nThere is a remarkable asymmetry in the political debate over Trump's criminal trial. While Trump and his allies are all over it, Democrats and the Biden campaign are basically ignoring it.\nAbout the closest the Biden campaign has come to weighing in was a news release this week which slyly included the words 'stormy' and 'hush' and alluded to Trump nodding off. But it was about abortion.\nThis is all in keeping with Democrats' general approach to Trump's criminal cases. While Republicans have leaped to decry things such as Trump's indictments and the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago in August 2022 \u2014 often before they know much of anything about the situations \u2014 Democrats have generally been content to merely say that 'no one is above the law' and leave it at that.\nAdvertisement\nBut that's going to be tested moving forward. The legal system is limited in how it can defend itself, with litigators and judges generally letting their work and courtroom remarks speak for themselves. And at some point, you'd think Democrats would want to drive home Trump's behavior at the trial and how it's symptomatic of his chaotic presidency.\nOf course, they also might not want to bet too heavily on the outcome of a trial the American people haven't shown they're overly concerned about.\nA momentous \u2014 and somewhat counterintuitive \u2014 poll\nOne of the most consequential facets of the 2024 election is how Americans have warmed to Trump's first term. Call it 'amnesia' or anything else, but it's a significant factor. To the extent people continue to remember the grass being greener, that's likely to weigh significantly on who wins in November.\nAdvertisement\nBut it will apparently only take Trump so far.\nA new Yahoo News/YouGov poll provides some interesting findings on this front. It finds 49 percent of people retrospectively approve of Trump's presidency \u2014 higher than that number was at virtually any juncture of his actual presidency \u2014 and just 40 percent approve of President Biden's. Voters were more likely by double digits to say Trump accomplished things than that Biden did. And asked to choose directly whether they were better off under Trump or Biden, voters chose Trump 45 percent to 34 percent.\nAnd yet! The poll shows the race deadlocked \u2014 44-44 in a head-to-head, and 42-42 if you include third-party candidates.\nPart of that imbalance is probably polarization and Democrats not being enthusiastic about Biden's presidency \u2014 but still opposing Trump.

If you were born four years after that, your choices between the two major parties have only been Trump and Joe Biden.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nIt's a small sample size, certainly, but the point is useful to consider: For all of the buildup of presidential politics and the years-long conversation centered on the determination of the most powerful person in politics, that conversation has been awfully repetitive recently. And, as polling from NBC News suggests, Americans are not enthusiastic about engaging in it once again.\nOn Sunday, the network published the results of a national poll that asked respondents, among other things, to evaluate how interested they were in the election on a scale from 1 to 10. Fewer than 2 in 3 selected 9 or 10 \u2014 lower than any similar measurement by NBC's pollsters this late in a presidential election year since at least 2008.\nAmong Republicans, 70 percent indicated they were very interested in the election. Among Democrats, only 65 percent. Among independents? Fewer than half.\nThis isn't terribly surprising. It is consistently the case that independents \u2014 generally meaning independents who tend to vote for one party or the other and independents who don't \u2014 are less politically engaged and less likely to vote. Comparisons of national polling conducted by the Pew Research Center with Census Bureau estimates of the electorate show how much of the nonvoter pool in each recent election has been made up of independents.\nIn 2016 and 2020, at least two-thirds of partisans voted, according to this analysis. About 6 in 10 independents who lean toward a party did, while about half of non-leaning independents cast ballots.\nAdvertisement\nBut there's an important asterisk this year: Those less likely to vote are also much more likely to support Trump.\nYou can see it in the NBC News data. Biden leads by nine points with those who voted in 2020 and 2022. Among those who voted in neither of those elections? Trump leads by 22 points .\n22 points.\nIt shows up elsewhere, too. The Harvard Youth Poll released last week found a single-digit gap between Trump and Biden among all Americans under 30 \u2014 but a nearly 20-point lead for Biden among those most likely to vote.\nThe youth vote is interesting in part because it overlaps with independent voter identification. Lots of independent voters are young voters and vice versa, so apathy among independents correlates to apathy among younger voters. It's also interesting because \u2014 revisiting the point made at the start of this article \u2014 voters 29 and younger have never been able to vote for a non-Trump Republican for president.\nResearch by University of Pennsylvania political scientist Dan Hopkins published by 538 earlier this month used an Associated Press poll conducted by NORC, previously the National Opinion Research Center, to compare support in the general election with voting frequency. The same pattern prevailed: Those who vote less often are more likely to back Trump \u2014 including among the Black and Hispanic voter pools that have been a focus of attention since 2020.\nThis suggests that Gallup's finding that young and non-White voters were shifting right over the past few years might be a function of less politically engaged people.\nViewing the same point through a different lens: Pew's analysis of recent voting habits shows that Black and Hispanic voters are also more likely to have not voted in recent elections.\nThis sets up a weird dynamic. The Washington Post reported earlier this month that some Democratic groups were balking at registering younger voters \u2014 usually a solid party constituency \u2014 out of fears they might be adding Trump voters to the pool. The expected pattern in which Democrats benefited from higher turnout might, this year, be inverted.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Philip Bump,National Columnist","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/56CEQMK6ZTSGHBQSVCK32EHOTI.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.1645656,"_id":"a8659e8277d84b1d6f7ae52f70524e10"},{"title":"Biden reverses course on Hyde amendment","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-16 19:57:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/biden-reverses-course-on-hyde-amendment/2024/04/16/0bcb18aa-ae0c-464a-8fbf-8f0226107675_video.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Biden, then a presidential candidate, reversed his support for the Hyde Amendment in June 2019.","summary":"Politics\nBiden reverses course on Hyde amendment\nBiden, then a presidential candidate, reversed his support for the Hyde Amendment in June 2019.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https%3A%2F%2Fd1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net%2Fthumbnails%2F5cfa534dcff47e000911ff35%2F2019-06-07T114655Z_1_OVAICII8V_RTRMADC_0_USA-ELECTION-BIDEN-HYDE-ROUGH-CUT.jpg&w=1080","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.1641884,"_id":"8a3c8661ab64a75513210c923ca0754e"},{"title":"Biden wants to hike tariffs on Chinese steel as U.S. election looms","author":"David J.

The investigation is a response to a petition from the United Steelworkers and four other unions last month.\nAdvertisement\nThe actions are just the latest sign of the president's determination to be seen as a defender of the steel industry, whose workers are spread across states in the industrial Midwest that could decide the election. In March, the president made an unusually direct comment about a pending corporate acquisition, saying it was 'vital' that U.S. Steel remain American-owned.\nNippon Steel, a larger and more profitable Japanese company, has agreed to acquire the once-famed American steelmaker for $14.9 billion. The deal is being reviewed for potential national security issues by a Treasury Department-led committee.\nThe burst of industry-specific safeguards is likely to cheer the president's union audience Wednesday. But it could raise costs for industries that use steel, which employ far more workers.\nAdvertisement\nBiden's likely opponent this fall, former president Donald Trump, is courting the same voters with his own brand of economic nationalism. The Republican has said he will impose an across-the-board tariff of 10 percent on all foreign products and a 60 percent levy on Chinese imports, a move many economists say would stoke inflation.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe mix of tariffs and investigations also represent Biden's sharpest actions to date to prevent China from unleashing on global markets an avalanche of low-cost goods, at a time when demand in its domestic economy is weak.\nTreasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen recently returned from a visit to Beijing, where she warned Chinese officials that the United States would not accept a second 'China shock,' a reference to the impact of China's economic rise in the early 2000s on U.S. manufacturers. China's routine use of subsidies and other preferences for favored companies has resulted in excess capacity in traditional sectors like steelmaking and the emerging industries of clean energy.\nAdvertisement\n'China's policy-driven overcapacity poses a serious risk to the future of the American steel and aluminum industry. China cannot export its way to recovery. China is simply too big to play by its own rules. In manufacturing sectors like steel, China is already producing more than China or the world can easily absorb,' said Lael Brainard, director of the National Economic Council, who briefed reporters on the president's actions.\nChina's steel production is equal to roughly half of global demand for the industrial metal, and its export prices are about 40 percent lower than what U.S. steelmakers charge, according to the administration.\nStill, current Chinese imports amount to just 0.6 percent of total U.S. steel demand, according to a second White House official who spoke on background, under the administration's ground rules for such calls.\nAdvertisement\nThe 25 percent tariffs Biden wants on Chinese steel and aluminum would come after the U.S. Trade Representative concludes its long-running review of existing trade barriers on goods from China.\nThe administration expects the tariffs to have 'no inflationary' effect, since they apply to such a limited set of goods, the official added.\nBiden administration officials have been pressing Mexico for months to address a sharp increase in shipments of steel and aluminum to the United States. Tai has accused Mexico of violating a 2019 agreement that led to the removal of Trump's 25 percent tariff, imposed in 2018.\nU.S. officials have held several rounds of talks with their Mexican counterparts, including this week. Mexican officials have rejected claims that the shipments violate the vaguely worded agreement.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David J.

Wade, the Supreme Court decision that protected abortion rights nationwide.\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., the longshot independent hopeful with a famous family name whose candidacy has centered heavily on his skepticism of vaccines, barely mentions abortion. When he does, he often sends mixed signals.\nKennedy has said he believes the decision to seek an abortion should be left to women and their doctors. But he has held just one campaign event focused on abortion, an October visit to an Atlanta facility founded by Angela Stanton King \u2014 an anti-abortion and criminal justice reform activist and former Trump supporter whom the ex-president pardoned for her role in a car theft ring. In the months that followed Kennedy's appearance at Stanton King's facility, which aims to convince women to carry their pregnancies to term, he has repeated her false and inflammatory claims that abortion providers systematically target Black women.\nAdvertisement\nKennedy has avoided taking a concrete stance on the nation's patchwork of abortion bans and U.S. House Republicans' efforts to pass federal restrictions, calling abortion a 'culture war issue' used to divide people. He has said that 'every abortion is a tragedy,' but has few plans to take on the issue in the White House.\nKennedy mentioned abortion just twice in the 11 speeches and campaign events that appear on his YouTube page. He mentioned the word 'vaccine' 10 times. On X, formerly Twitter, he's mentioned the word 'abortion' five times since the start of last year. He posted the word 'vaccine' 64 times in the same period.\nTwitter, he's mentioned the word 'abortion' five times since the start of last year. He posted the word 'vaccine' 64 times in the same period.\n'He's trying to avoid what's probably the most salient issue right now,' Roy Behr, the author of 'Third Parties in America: Citizen Response to Major Party Failure.\"\nKennedy's ambiguity on abortion \u2014 an issue many voters say is a major motivator for them this race \u2014 may not hurt him in November. Kennedy, the nephew of a former president and son of a former U.S. attorney general, has appealed to a politically diverse group of supporters with nuanced views, including some who identify as conservative but weary of Trump and others who describe themselves as liberals unenthused with Biden. Outlining a clearer abortion position could hurt his standing with one or more of those groups.\nAdvertisement\nKennedy doesn't focus on abortion in speeches because it is a divisive issue, his campaign told The Washington Post.\n'Mr. Kennedy does not want to add fuel to the fire,' campaign spokeswoman Stefanie Spear wrote in an email, citing issues including chronic disease, infrastructure, disarmament and farming practices that protect the environment. 'These issues also have the potential to unify the country, unlike abortion, which is fundamentally divisive. So, Mr. Kennedy makes his position plain, but does not dwell on the subject.'\nSpear said Kennedy, who has not previously shared his thoughts on Arizona's state Supreme Court decision to revive a near-total ban on abortion earlier this month, opposes the ruling. She said he also disagreed with Trump's proposal to leave abortion restrictions up to the states.\nAdvertisement\nAfter The Post enquired about Kennedy's abortion position, the campaign added a new abortion policy page to its website, proposing 'a massive subsidized daycare initiative' paid for by funds Kennedy would reroute from Ukraine war aid. The page doesn't provide any more information about how Kennedy would respond to abortion bans in states.\nTwelve percent of voters, including two-thirds of Democrats, say abortion is the 'most important issue' in their 2024 vote, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll last month. Down the ballot, voters have signaled their disapproval of strict bans on abortion, supporting statewide referendums and candidates that would protect or expand abortion access.\nThis election marks the first time many voters will be able to weigh in post-Roe, and Kennedy's opponents could use his near-silence on abortion rights to cast doubt on his commitment to them, Democratic pollster Nancy Zdunkewicz said. New stories of women in dangerous, difficult circumstances who are unable to get abortions resonate with voters, she argued.\nAdvertisement\n'It's all way too real for people in a way that it just wasn't before,' Zdunkewicz said.\nKennedy is likely to attract voters who agree with him on vaccines and feel disaffected with the two major political parties, but will face more difficulty attracting people who aren't interested in one of his primary concerns such as vaccine safety, said Bernard Tamas, a political science professor at Valdosta State University and author of 'The Demise and Rebirth of American Third Parties.'\nvaccines and feel disaffected with the two major political parties, but will face more difficulty attracting people who aren't interested in one of his primary concerns such as vaccine safety, said Bernard Tamas, a political science professor at Valdosta State University and author of 'The Demise and Rebirth of American Third Parties.'\n'I don't think that very many people are going to make decisions for or against Kennedy based on abortion,' he said.\nKennedy's lone campaign stop focused on abortion was an October visit to Auntie Angie's House, a center for pregnant women in a Black community in Atlanta run by Stanton King. When Trump pardoned Stanton King, he cited her advocacy for people reentering society after being released from prison.\nAdvertisement\nKennedy's campaign says he 'misspoke' when he referred to the percent of Black women receiving abortions, but neither of the claims he repeated is correct according to multiple research studies.\nMore than 6 in 10 abortion clinics were located in predominantly White neighborhoods and about 1 in 10 clinics were in predominantly Black neighborhoods, according to a 2014 report from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy group that favors abortion rights. The group told The Post that post-Roe abortion bans in states with large Black populations have likely led to fewer clinics in Black neighborhoods since that analysis was completed.\nAdvertisement\nStanton King told The Post she did not ask Kennedy during his visit when he believes life begins, whether he would sign an abortion ban or his thoughts on the abortion restrictions passed in neighboring states. But Stanton King came away with the belief that Kennedy could do a better job than the major party candidates in bridging the partisan divide, and she later joined his campaign as an advisor. She said she appreciated Kennedy's promise to invest the same amount of federal resources that are committed to abortion services in social safety net programs for new mothers who need aid.\nMany of Kennedy's rare comments about abortion have come during media interviews, providing a patchy view of his policy and personal beliefs.\nAt the Iowa State Fair in August 2023, Kennedy said he would support a federal ban on abortion after 15 weeks of gestation, then said he would not 'personally' restrict abortion but added, 'I think the states have a right to protect a child once the child becomes viable, and that right, it increases.' (His campaign later clarified that he would not sign a ban.)\nIn an interview with PBS News in November, Kennedy said he didn't know what Biden could do to help protect women's access to abortions.\nAdvertisement\nIn a video released the same day as Biden's State of the Union address, in which the president called for Congress to restore Roe , Kennedy didn't mention abortion rights at all.\nRoe, Kennedy didn't mention abortion rights at all.\nBiden's allies have emphasized the president's efforts to expand access to contraception, abortion medication and emergency abortion care and point out the stark contrast with Trump's work to restrict abortion access. When Kerry Kennedy, Kennedy's sister, endorsed Biden along with more than a dozen other members of her family at a campaign rally Thursday, she cited Biden's support for abortion rights as one of the main reasons to back him.\nKennedy's running mate, Nicole Shanahan, funded research into the longevity of women's reproductive health and criticized in-vitro fertilization as 'one of the biggest lies that's being told about women's health today.' In a lengthy post on X on April 9, after Arizona's state Supreme Court decision, Shanahan wrote she 'can hold both beliefs,' suggesting bans are 'coercive' and 'wrong' but that women should carry pregnancies to term unless the mother or baby's health is at risk.\nMost voters who have already said they plan to vote for Kennedy said he talks about abortion enough.\nMike Roy, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel in Annapolis, Md., said he is voting for Kennedy because he believes the independent can keep America out of other countries' wars, close the Southern border and more aggressively regulate polluters. Abortion is not a top issue for the 46-year-old, but he agrees with Kennedy that women should have the right to choose the procedure. Still, he sees little point in Kennedy focusing on the topic.\nAdvertisement\n'I don't think he needs to talk about it more,' Roy said. 'It's such a polarizing issue and the theme of the campaign is to heal the divide.'\nLori Spencer, a Kennedy campaign volunteer in Oklahoma City who voted for the libertarian candidates in the last two presidential elections, disagrees. The 54-year-old was once a loyal Democratic voter but she left the party in 1996 after she felt like its leaders weren't keeping their promises, arguing Democrats could have protected Roe when they had the chance. Biden is no different, she believes.\nRoe when they had the chance. Biden is no different, she believes.\n'He talks the talk, but he doesn't walk the walk,' she said.\nSpencer said Kennedy might benefit from talking about abortion rights more and appealing more to voters like her who believe the government should not be involved in medical decisions.\n'I personally would like to see him be more vocal about his pro-choice beliefs,' Spencer said. 'But he'll talk about it when asked and he'll give you a clear answer. I don't think there's any ambiguity or misunderstanding of his position. He's very clear. So I'm happy enough with that.'\nKennedy's campaign has also used his abortion position to appeal to conservative voters. Rita Palma, who worked for Kennedy gathering ballot access signatures in New York, told voters in this month that the candidate's position was comparable to Trump's. Palma was later fired after being caught on video saying Kennedy could help Trump win.\n'Bobby believes and I heard this out of his own mouth: \u2018Every abortion is a tragedy,'' she said in the video. 'He's definitely not, you know, 100% pro-life. But none of the candidates are. Even Trump is saying that they have to find that, quote-unquote sweet spot in order to win elections.' Palma declined to comment for this story.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Meryl Kornfield","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DSBCT7QIG4OU74JJHQNZCX73RI_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.1234775,"_id":"e6624e58c5cb9a45658962484f67ec68"},{"title":"Senate advances renewal of key US surveillance program as detractors seek changes","author":"Farnoush Amiri","published_date":"2024-04-18 21:27:51","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/18/fisa-donald-trump-surveillance-congress-johnson/82a1c4b8-fdca-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The Senate has advanced legislation that would reauthorize a key U.S. surveillance tool as lawmakers and the Biden administration rushed to tamp down fresh concerns about the program violating\u2026","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate advanced legislation Thursday that would reauthorize a key U.S. surveillance tool as lawmakers and the Biden administration rushed to tamp down fresh concerns about the program violating Americans' civil liberties.\nThe bipartisan legislation would reform and extend a section of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act known as Section 702, which U.S. officials say is vital to preventing terrorism, catching spies and disrupting cyberattacks. A bill renewing the program passed the House last week after a dramatic showdown on the floor over whether the FBI should be restricted from using the program to search for Americans' data.\nBut the same concerns that nearly derailed the bill in the House are flaring again in the Senate, with both progressives and conservative lawmakers agitating for further changes. It's a dynamic that could ultimately jeopardize the bill's passage in the upper chamber, though supporters remain optimistic that the program will be reauthorized without much deal.\nAdvertisement\nThe Biden administration has spent the week on Capitol Hill providing classified briefings to senators on the crucial role they say the spy program plays in protecting national security. Officials warn that some of the changes being proposed to the tool could handicap the FBI's efforts to thwart threats to the U.S.\nOpponents remain unfazed and have demanded that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer allow votes on amendments to the legislation that would seek to address what they see as civil liberty loopholes in the bill.\n'The administration is making the case that if there's any changes, it's going to jeopardize the program,' Democratic Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont said Thursday. 'That's asking a lot of the Senate to basically abdicate its responsibility.'\nThe legislation in its current form has the backing of not only the Biden administration but also the leaders of the national security committees in Congress, who have urged detractors to accept the mild reforms to the program. Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that the changes being proposed by the various groups are 'unnecessary' and would 'destroy the purpose' of the program.\nAdvertisement\n'If certain amendments like that were to pass, the bill would go back to the House and I just don't know what posture the House is going to be in to be able to take up legislation because we've got so much going on,' Rubio said.\nThough the spy program is technically set to expire Friday, the Biden administration has said it expects its authority to collect intelligence to remain operational for at least another year, thanks to an opinion earlier this month from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which receives surveillance applications.\nStill, officials say that court approval shouldn't be a substitute for congressional authorization, especially since communications companies could cease cooperation with the government if the program is allowed to lapse.\nOverall skepticism of the government's spy powers has grown dramatically in recent years, particularly on the right. Republicans clashed for months over what a legislative overhaul of the FISA surveillance program should look like, creating divisions that spilled onto the House floor last week as 19 Republicans broke with their party to prevent the bill from coming up for a vote.\nAdvertisement\nIn the end, House Speaker Mike Johnson managed to appease some critics of the reauthorization bill by shortening the extension of the program from five years to two years.\nFirst authorized in 2008, the spy tool has been renewed several times since then as U.S. officials see it as crucial in disrupting terror attacks, cyber intrusions and foreign espionage. It has also produced intelligence that the U.S. has relied on for specific operations.\nBut the administration's efforts to secure reauthorization of the program have repeatedly encountered fierce, and bipartisan, pushback, with Democrats like Sen. Ron Wyden who have long championed civil liberties aligning with Republican supporters of former President Donald Trump, who in a post on Truth Social on Wednesday stated incorrectly that Section 702 had been used to spy on his presidential campaign.\nAdvertisement\nA specific area of concern for lawmakers is the FBI's use of the vast intelligence repository to search for information about Americans and others in the U.S. Though the surveillance program only targets non-Americans in other countries, it also collects communications of Americans when they are in contact with those targeted foreigners.\nIn the past year, U.S. officials have revealed a series of abuses and mistakes by FBI analysts in improperly querying the intelligence repository for information about Americans or others in the U.S., including about a member of Congress and participants in the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Farnoush Amiri","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QAYAARX5ZII65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.0926046,"_id":"846c0acb5174c1dd9d83fa24d85674f9"},{"title":"The South has few unionized auto plants.

Workers say this one could be next.\nCHATTANOOGA, Tenn. \u2014 Growing up in eastern Tennessee, Jeremy Collins didn't know many people with unionized jobs. But he remembers reading good things about unions fighting for the eight-hour work day and against child labor.\nThat's why Collins plans to vote yes when employees at his Volkswagen factory decide this week whether to join the United Auto Workers. And he thinks many of his co-workers will do the same \u2014 possibly making their factory one of the few auto plants in the South to unionize.\nAdvertisement\nOf 26 Volkswagen workers who stopped to talk to a Washington Post reporter outside the factory gates this month, more than two-thirds said they planned to vote yes in the historic ballot that will test the UAW's strategy of organizing a dozen automakers' southern factories. Six workers said they were undecided and two were opposed.\n'I'm pretty vocal about the union at work, and I usually ask a lot of people how they feel,' Collins said, en route to his shift building Atlas SUVs and electric ID.4 vehicles. 'And from all the people I talk to, I've only come across three people who are against it.'\nThose who spoke with The Post are a small fraction of the more than 4,000 workers eligible to vote in the ballot. And the UAW has failed in two previous efforts to organize the factory, in 2014 and 2019. But the union is expressing optimism this time around, saying that a supermajority of workers signed union authorization cards supporting UAW membership.\nVolkswagen Chattanooga would be the first auto plant in the South to unionize through an election since the 1940s, although there are other unionized auto factories in the South.\nThe union drive in Chattanooga is happening as both President Biden and former president Trump vie to make the case that they can deliver for blue-collar factory workers. A yes vote, even in red Tennessee, could help shore up Biden's support among union voters across the United States, including those still dubious about the improved economy. Biden's staunch support of union workers has earned him the UAW's endorsement and assistance on the campaign trail from its fiery president, Shawn Fain.\nTennessee Republicans have seized on that relationship in their efforts to thwart the unionization drive. In an impromptu news conference next to the factory this month, local Republicans warned that workers in this right-leaning county would be aligning themselves with the Democrats by voting yes.\n'I hope that the Tennessee workers will recognize that the UAW represents the party of President Joe Biden, and their values and political contributions, which are completely inconsistent with the people of southeast Tennessee,' state Sen. Bo Watson told attendees.\nAdvertisement\nThe conservative editorial page of the Chattanooga Times Free Press has carried similar messages, as has a mysterious website that workers say appeared recently, stillnouaw.com, which features photos of Biden and Fain and a social media post from former president Donald Trump attacking the UAW president. During a visit to Chattanooga last week, Republican Gov. Bill Lee cautioned that joining the union would be 'a big mistake.'\nSome conservative VW workers say they wish politicians would butt out.\n'I really don't appreciate what our local leaders have said about the UAW. I think they should have stayed out of it,' Ethan Triplett, a VW worker who votes Republican, said as he arrived for his shift. 'I've seen what the UAW can do for all the plants up north and everything. \u2026 And I feel like they can do some good down here.'\nTriplett and others said their main complaints include the factory's inflexible sick-day policies and its tendency to haul in workers for compulsory overtime shifts on Saturdays. They also want better retirement and health-care benefits.\nThe election stakes are high for the UAW and its new president. The union scored big contract wins after striking against Ford, General Motors and Stellantis last year, but union membership has fallen precipitously in recent decades and continued to drop by 3.3 percent last year, to 370,000 workers. A team of UAW staffers has decamped to Chattanooga to help run the election drive, working on laptops at the union hall of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), where the UAW is renting space.\nAlthough this would be the UAW's first foray in the South at a foreign auto plant, both GM and Ford have UAW factories in Kentucky, Tennessee and Texas. Those had an easier path to unionization through procedures included in the automakers' national agreements with the union.\nVW says it is remaining neutral on the unionization effort. The union has disputed that, accusing the company of destroying union materials in a factory break room and other union-busting behavior. The company refutes the allegations, saying it is standard VW procedure to clear break rooms of all stray materials every day.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe factory is VW's only plant worldwide that isn't represented by a union or a similar body that advocates for workers. 'We respect our employees' right to decide who represents them in the workplace and have throughout this process,' Volkswagen said in a statement about the Chattanooga vote, adding that it is proud of the working conditions and pay it offers.\nThe average production worker in Chattanooga will earn more than $60,000 this year before overtime and bonuses, with hourly wages ranging from $23.40 to $32.40, the company said. Skilled team leaders earn up to $42.25 an hour. Since 2009, VW has invested more than $4.3 billion in the factory, making it one of the biggest employers in this picturesque city on the Tennessee River, in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.\nCharles Wood, head of the local chamber of commerce, said he worries that unionization could cause VW to shift more investment to its factory in Puebla, Mexico. That plant is unionized, but its workers earn less, making it a cheaper place to produce.\n'The risk for Chattanooga is we become less competitive long-term,' he said, adding that VW has played a huge role in helping the region recover from factory closures and tough economic times that started in the 1960s.\nAdvertisement\nSarah Roberts, who works in the factory's logistics department, said she plans to vote no, because she developed negative views of unions while growing up in Michigan. Her father, an automotive engineer, worked stints in various auto factories, trying to improve their manufacturing processes, she said. 'Out of all the plants he's been in, every one that has been under the UAW for more than 10 years is now shut down,' she said.\nAmong some conservative workers, the UAW's endorsement of Biden is not helping the union's case.\nMembers of a worker committee helping organize the drive say some workers have bashed the Biden endorsement. Kelcey Smith, one of dozens on the committee, said he heard a colleague tell a union meeting a few months ago that some people on the factory floor were upset about it.\n'He believed that it was having an effect on some of the minds of some of the workers as far as voting for the union was concerned,' Smith said in an interview. UAW staffers at the meeting advised workers to reassure colleagues that they can vote for whomever they like.\nMost workers who spoke with The Post said they are focusing more on workplace issues than politics.\nThe union 'can support whoever they want,' said Krantzsy Boursiquot, a worker who described himself as apolitical and a nonvoter. Like others, he is most concerned about mandatory overtime on Saturdays, which the company sometimes calls with only two days' notice, and managers' refusal at times to approve sick days.\n'I feel like, as they're pushing for excellence every year, coming up with a new model every year, trying to increase profits for their shareholders, they should have that same energy when it comes down to their employees. And they don't,' Boursiquot said.\nVolkswagen spokesman Michael Lowder said the company has several channels for employee feedback and takes worker input seriously.\nGathering on a recent evening at the IBEW union hall, workers on the unionization organizing committee said they are pushing for stronger benefits.\nAdvertisement\nYolanda Peoples, who used to belong to the UAW when she worked at a now closed General Motors factory in Doraville, Ga., says she wants better health-care coverage that will reduce her out-of-pocket costs for medication. She would also like a defined-benefit pension instead of the 401(k) that VW provides.\n'The 401(k) is based on the stock market \u2026 and whether it's up or down,' she said. 'I want more stability.'\nVW contributes 4 percent of an employee's pay to the 401(k) if the worker contributes 5 percent, VW spokesman Lowder said. The company also contributes 5 percent of each employee's paycheck to a separate defined contribution plan, with no employee contribution required, he said.\nRobert Soderstrom, who builds car doors, hopes a union can help protect workers from having to do the jobs of two people when someone calls in sick. 'Oftentimes we won't have a full crew,' he said. 'If we're a man short, they'll be like, well, Robert, today you're working two [jobs] \u2026 they're not slowing the line down.'\nOutside the factory gates, Justin DeLong stopped briefly to voice his support for the UAW, saying that many of his relatives in Upstate New York are union workers.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jeanne Whalen","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NY2NZ6DP2K2JAY3JMGER3VDHO4_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.087016,"_id":"44ea004fc87818e8cee117be7f6781f2"},{"title":"U.S. sanctions target Iran's drone production after attack on Israel","author":"Jeff Stein","published_date":"2024-04-18 13:47:06","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/04/18/iran-treasury-drone-sanctions","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Treasury announces new sanctions on Tehran but seeks to contain broader conflict.","summary":"The Treasury Department on Thursday officially announced new sanctions on Iran in retaliation for its attack against Israel, as the Biden administration seeks an economic rather than military response to Tehran.\nTreasury Secretary Janet L.

Current law only requires that nursing homes have 'sufficient' staffing, leaving it up to states for interpretation.\nThe new rule would implement a minimum number of hours that staff spend with residents. It will also require a registered nurse to be available around the clock at the facilities, which are home to about 1.2 million people. Another rule would dictate that 80% of Medicaid payments for home care providers go to workers' wages.\nAdvertisement\nAllies of older adults have sought the regulation for decades, but the rules will most certainly draw pushback from the nursing home industry.\nThe event will mark Harris' third visit to the battleground state this year and is part of Biden's push to earn the support of union workers. Republican challenger Donald Trump made inroads with blue-collar workers in his 2016 victory. Biden regularly calls himself the ' most pro-union' president in history and has received endorsements from leading labor groups such as the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.\nHarris will gather nursing home care workers at an event Monday joined by Chiquita Brooks-Lasure, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and April Verrett, secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union.\nAdvertisement\nThe coronavirus pandemic, which claimed more than 167,000 nursing home residents in the U.S., exposed the poor staffing levels at the facilities, and led many workers to leave the industry. Advocates for the elderly and disabled reported residents who were neglected, going without meals and water or kept in soiled diapers for too long. Experts said staffing levels are the most important marker for quality of care.\nThe new rules call for staffing equivalent to 3.48 hours per resident per day, just over half an hour of it coming from registered nurses. The government said that means a facility with 100 residents would need two or three registered nurses and 10 or 11 nurse aides as well as two additional nurse staff per shift to meet the new standards.\nThe average U.S. nursing home already has overall caregiver staffing of about 3.6 hours per resident per day, including RN staffing just above the half-hour mark, but the government said a majority of the country's roughly 15,000 nursing homes would have to add staff under the new regulation.\nAdvertisement\nThe new thresholds are still lower than those that had long been eyed by advocates after a landmark 2001 study funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, recommended an average of 4.1 hours of nursing care per resident daily.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe government will allow the rules to be introduced in phases with longer timeframes for nursing homes in rural communities and temporary exemptions for places with workforce shortages.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Adriana Gomez Licon","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FATIQLQAQ4I67DVMHHDNZNM6WU_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.0750155,"_id":"9c5cb426bd355182745b9c88792d0de3"},{"title":"Convenience store chain where Biden bought snacks while campaigning hit with discrimination lawsuit","author":"Michael Rubinkam","published_date":"2024-04-18 18:11:06","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/18/sheetz-discrimination-suit-biden-campaign-visit/0617fffe-fdaf-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"A convenience store chain where President Joe Biden stopped for snacks this week while campaigning in Pennsylvania has been hit with a lawsuit by federal officials","summary":"A convenience store chain where President Joe Biden stopped for snacks this week while campaigning in Pennsylvania has been hit with a lawsuit by federal officials who allege the company discriminated against minority job applicants.\nSheetz Inc. which operates more than 700 stores in six states, discriminated against Black, Native American and multiracial job seekers by automatically weeding out applicants whom the company deemed to have failed a criminal background check, according to U.S. officials.\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed suit in Baltimore against Altoona, Pennsylvania-based Sheetz and two subsidary companies, alleging the chain's longstanding hiring practices have a disproportionate impact on minority applicants and thus run afoul of federal civil rights law.\nSheetz said Thursday it 'does not tolerate discrimination of any kind.'\nAdvertisement\n'Diversity and inclusion are essential parts of who we are.

But as the Israelis study lists of potential targets, they are looking for ways to deliver this hard-nosed message without escalating the crisis.\n'The story is not over,' said a senior Israeli source. 'Iran took this massive action to create new rules' by bombarding Israel directly as payback for its April 1 strike on Iranian operatives in Damascus, Syria. 'If we do nothing, it will strengthen this line of thinking in Iran,' the senior Israeli said, stressing: 'We do not seek to escalate this. We want to contain it.

Officials had hoped that neutering Iran's missile attack would be a sufficient show of strength and that a period of de-escalation in the broader Gaza conflict might follow. 'Slow things down, think through things,' President Biden advised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after the defeat of Iran's attack.\nBut like other American appeals to de-escalate, this one appears to have been rejected by Israeli leaders. They see their adversaries as having crossed previous 'red lines' in their willingness to slaughter Israelis \u2014 in Hamas's Oct. 7 terrorist attack and then in Iran's weekend bombardment, which U.S. and Israeli officials believe was intended to cause significant damage and loss of life.\nAdvertisement\nIsraeli officials also reject Iran's pretext for the attack \u2014 that in striking Quds Force commanders in Damascus, it hit a diplomatic facility that was, in effect, part of Iran's sovereign territory. Israelis contend that the facility they struck, though it might have had an Iranian flag outside, hadn't officially been designated a diplomatic compound.\nIranian arguments about the sanctity of diplomatic facilities are also unconvincing from a regime that condoned, and celebrates to this day, the 1979 seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran \u2014 and has allowed more recent attacks on British and other diplomatic facilities there.\nAs Israeli officials weigh their response to Iran's missile attack, they are confronting the perennial dilemma of deterrence: How can a country demonstrate its willingness to use force \u2014 and dominate the cycle of escalation \u2014 without creating precisely the crisis it seeks to avert? Israel's tough-minded approach to this question has deterred some conflicts, but it has arguably created some others.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David Ignatius","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3NKTWFCMXTWG3ELLKMVL6FESIQ.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.06009,"_id":"f2c09c70422428044987886b219dfa71"},{"title":"They didn't want Trump.

Last summer he wrote that he himself would not be running for president because 'beating Trump is more important.' In January, when he was stumping for Nikki Haley, he said that Trump 'can barely keep a cogent thought' without a teleprompter. At an event in February, he explained his belief that Trump wouldn't be the party's standard-bearer forever by saying that 'a--holes come and go.'\nAs he said all this, he added a caveat: He'd support the eventual GOP nominee, even if it was Trump.\nAnd now, at the Gridiron, Sununu was accepting the inevitable, because it's happening.\n'My focus isn't about Trump.

Jan. 6, 2021, had been a breaking point. He thought about not voting for president. Or writing someone in, as he'd done in 2016. Then, on March 25, the United States abstained from vetoing a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. Three days later, Levine was at his keyboard typing an email to 1,600 of his contacts.\nAdvertisement\nSubject line: 'NEVER SAY NEVER; WHY I WILL VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP.'\n'I remain concerned about Trump's relationship with the truth,' Levine wrote in the email. 'I continue to cringe every time he tells the lie about a stolen election. The thought that he did nothing while rioters ran through the Capitol chanting \u2018hang Mike Pence' still haunts me.'\nAnd yet \u2026\n'... The question becomes: as between the two, who will leave a better, safer, and more prosperous America for my grandchildren? Hands down, the answer is Trump.'\nIn an interview, Levine cited a laundry list of Biden's shortcomings, beyond the U.N. vote, to justify his support of Trump: the 'catastrophic' withdrawal from Afghanistan, 'the open border,' 'failed Bidenomics,' and a 'social justice agenda' that's 'particularly damaging to America's Jews.' And he was upset about how the Biden administration had been trying to use its influence to undermine Israel's military offensive in Gaza.

'And by doing that it created a situation where I think voters thought, \u2018Well, it must not be that he's that dangerous, because if he were, then you would have more people saying so.'' (McCarthy, who's also endorsed Trump, recently explained that visit by saying he just wanted to check up on Trump because 'when something bad happens in your life, everybody abandons you.')\nBut this all really may have started before Jan. 6, says Alyssa Farah Griffin, who worked in Trump's White House and later turned on him.\n'He was smart about consolidating power before he lost the election,' she says. 'He was so entrenched in the RNC, he was so entrenched in the party committees and at the state level, that I think for politicians who care first and foremost about self-preservation, it made it pretty much impossible to walk away from him.'\n'It used to be that Republicans fell in line with whoever the party chose,' Hemmer says. 'And now the party is following the base, and falls in line with whoever the base has fallen in love with.'\nIf Sununu wasn't in love before, he has fallen in line now.

But not everyone agrees on what it means to protect it.\nThe United States is conserving approximately one-third of the country's ocean areas, according to an early analysis released Friday by the Biden administration \u2014 suggesting the president is meeting a key environmental goal laid out at the beginning of his term.\nBut others say that's not the case.\nSome of those areas still allow for commercial fishing, advocates say, and fall short of protections needed to save marine ecosystems facing dire threats.\n'It's padding the numbers,' said Brad Sewell, oceans director at the Natural Resources Defense Council.\nThe disagreement comes as the White House on Friday outlined how much progress the country has made in achieving President Biden's ambitious goal of conserving at least 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030.\nAdvertisement\nThe White House's Council on Environmental Quality said its preliminary count \u2014 outlined in a newly released atlas \u2014 shows that approximately 'one-third of U.S. marine areas are currently conserved.'\n'We are making bold progress to conserve our ocean,' Rick Spinrad, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said in a statement.\nYet precisely what areas on the map should count as protected has been a subject of considerable debate.\nThe White House said a majority of that ocean expanse \u2014 26 percent of U.S. waters \u2014 is officially designated as 'marine protected areas,' where human activity is typically restricted to protect wildlife.\nBut that one-third tally also includes parts of the ocean where only a type of fishing called bottom trawling is banned to protect coral and other bottom-dwelling creatures from nets that scrape the seafloor. Other types of commercial fishing in those areas, which include swaths of ocean off New England and the Mid-Atlantic, are still allowed.\nAdvertisement\n'These are partial measures,' he added. 'We're at a point in time where the biodiversity crisis is crying out for not partial measures, but full, complete, adequate measures.'\nMatt Lee-Ashley, chief of staff for the Council on Environmental Quality, said the Biden administration is using a 'more inclusive definition of conservation than strictly looking at protected areas' but added the work is not yet complete and the administration is open to feedback. The White House said the current atlas is in 'a beta version.'\n'We have a lot of work yet to do to develop the data and information needed' for more precise estimates, Lee-Ashley said.\nSewell said he was grateful the administration is 'open to listening to our view that they need a more accurate protective number.'\nJohn Hocevar, oceans campaign director at Greenpeace USA, warned that claiming that a third of U.S. waters are already protected is 'a huge mistake because we are definitely not there.' He worries about the example the United States may set for other countries as they try to meet their own conservation goals.\nAdvertisement\nBiden's 30 percent conservation goal, dubbed '30x30,' comes in tandem with international efforts to protect nearly a third of land and oceans globally as a refuge for the planet's wild plants and animals in the face of a growing extinction crisis.\n'It's bad enough to mislead the United States public with creative accounting,' Hocevar said. 'But this also risks opening a door for other countries to try to get away with similar shenanigans.'\nMarine ecosystems upon which people depend on for food face a multitude of threats, including rising temperatures, acidifying waters and growing waves of plastic debris.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Dino Grandoni","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JD4BTNIM5XLMNBL5UTHT54UPJA.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.985431,"_id":"dafdd4d2f3615cf7536b127433198e56"},{"title":"Biden is marking Earth Day by announcing $7 billion in federal solar power grants","author":"Alexa St. John","published_date":"2024-04-22 09:06:10","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/04/22/biden-earth-day-solar-grants-epa-climate/8fb8ffee-0087-11ef-8eac-39c6dcb59eb5_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"President Joe Biden is marking Earth Day by announcing $7 billion in federal grants to provide residential solar projects serving 900,000-plus households in low- and middle-income communities","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden is marking Earth Day by announcing $7 billion in federal grants for residential solar projects serving 900,000-plus households in low- and middle-income communities. He also plans to expand his New Deal-style American Climate Corps green jobs training program.\nThe grants are being awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency, which unveiled the 60 recipients on Monday. The projects are expected to eventually reduce emissions by the equivalent of 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and save households $350 million annually, according to senior administration officials.\nBiden's latest environmental announcements come as he is working to energize young voters for his reelection campaign. Young people were a key part of a broad but potentially fragile coalition that helped him defeat then-President Donald Trump in 2020. Some have joined protests around the country of the administration's handling of Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\nAdvertisement\nSenior administration officials said young Americans are keenly invested in the Biden climate agenda and want to actually help enact it. The Climate Corps initiative is a way for them to do that, the officials said.\nSolar is gaining traction as a key renewable energy source that could reduce the nation's reliance on fossil fuels, which emit planet-warming greenhouse gases. Not only is it clean, but solar energy can also boost the reliability of the electric grid.\nBut solar energy can have high costs for initial installation, making it inaccessible for many Americans \u2014 and potentially meaning a mingling of environmental policy with election-year politics.\nForty-nine of the new grants are state-level awards, six serve Native American tribes and five are multi-state awards. They can be used for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens.\nAdvertisement\nBiden is making the announcement at northern Virginia's Prince William Forest Park, about 30 miles southwest of Washington. It was established in 1936 as a summer camp for underprivileged youth from Washington, part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps to help create jobs during the Great Depression.\nBiden used executive action last year to create the American Climate Corps modeled on Roosevelt's New Deal. He is announcing Monday that nearly 2,000 corps positions are being offered across 36 states, including jobs offered in partnership with the North American Building Trades Unions.\nBiden has often used Earth Day as a backdrop to further his administration's climate initiatives. Last year, he signed an executive order creating the White House Office of Environmental Justice, meant to help ensure that poverty, race and ethnic status do not lead to worse exposure to pollution and environmental harm.\nAdvertisement\nHe has tried to draw a contrast with GOP congressional leaders, who have called for less regulation of oil production to lower energy prices. Biden officials counter that GOP policies benefit highly profitable oil companies and could ultimately undermine U.S. efforts to compete with the Chinese in the renewable energy sector.\nBiden will use his Virginia visit to discuss how 'a climate crisis fully manifest to the American people in communities all across the country, is also an opportunity for us to come together,' said White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi.\nHe said the programs can 'unlock economic opportunity to create pathways to middle-class-supporting careers, to save people money and improve their quality of life.'\nThe awards came from the Solar for All program, part of the $27 billion 'green bank' created as part of a sweeping climate law passed in 2022. The bank is intended to reduce climate and air pollution and send money to neighborhoods most in need, especially disadvantaged and low-income communities disproportionately impacted by climate change.\nAdvertisement\nEPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe said she was 'looking forward to these funds getting out into the community, giving people skills, putting them to work in their local communities, and allowing people to save on their energy bills so that they can put those dollars to other needs.'\nAmong those receiving grants are state projects to provide solar-equipped roofs for homes, college residences and residential-serving community solar projects in West Virginia, a non-profit operating Mississippi solar lease program and solar workforce training initiatives in South Carolina.\nThe taxpayer-funded green bank has faced Republican opposition and concerns over accountability for how the money gets used. EPA previously disbursed the other $20 billion of the bank's funds to nonprofits and community development banks for clean energy projects such as residential heat pumps, additional energy-efficient home improvements and larger-scale projects like electric vehicle charging stations and community cooling centers.\nAdvertisement\n___\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nSt. John reported from Detroit.\n___\nAlexa St. John is an Associated Press climate solutions reporter.

Trump aides said the former president and current Republican nominee chose the store because it has been the site of a violent attack on an employee. He will also highlight consumer inflation under President Joe Biden, aides said.\nThe visit would be Trump's first campaign appearance since his criminal hush money trial began, making the presumptive GOP nominee the first former president in U.S. history to stand criminal trial.\nTrump will be confined to the courtroom on most days, dramatically limiting his movements and his ability to campaign, fundraise and make calls. Aides have been planning rallies and other political events on weekends and Wednesdays, the one weekday when court is not supposed to be in session. Plans also include local appearances Trump can make after court recesses each day.\nAdvertisement\nTrump's stop in Harlem demonstrates the former president's determination to amplify familiar campaign arguments even within the strictures of being a criminal defendant.\nIn July 2022, Jose Alba, a clerk at the store in Hamilton Heights, a heavily Hispanic section of Harlem, was attacked by 35-year-old Austin Simon. The resulting altercation, captured on surveillance video, ended with Alba fatally stabbing Simon. Alba was arrested and charged with murder but the Manhattan district attorney dropped the charges within weeks, saying they could not prove Alba had not acted in self-defense.\nOn another evening in August 2022, according to the New York Post, owner Osamah Aldhabyani was in the store when a customer entered and an altercation between the two ensued. The customer was arrested, the newspaper reported.\nAdvertisement\nBefore his arrival, Trump's campaign distributed materials to journalists criticizing Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for his handling of the stabbing case, including the weeks Alba spent jailed at Rikers Island without bail. Bragg oversees the office now prosecuting Trump.\nThe former president's local appearance also affirms his intentions to campaign in his home state, even though New York remains overwhelmingly Democratic. In 2020, Biden garnered more than 60% of the vote in the state and ran up even wider margins in New York City. Trump insists he can win New York in November anyway, and he has mused about holding rallies in the South Bronx and Queens, where the former president was born and grew up, and even Madison Square Garden.\n'I may rent Madison Square Garden,' he said in an interview with Breitbart News. 'That's the belly of the beast, right?'\nAdvertisement\nThat would be a prohibitively expensive proposition, particularly as his campaign has worked to save cash as it confronts a fundraising gap with Biden.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'You know, the president is very keen on New York,' Chris LaCivita, Trump senior campaign adviser, told The Associated Press last month as he talked up the campaign's efforts to put more states in play. Still, LaCivita laughed when asked whether he agrees. 'I don't get out in front of the boss. I do what the boss says. The boss drives,' he said.\nTrump has argued that the ongoing influx of migrants to the city, where he grew his real estate empire and became a tabloid fixture, has made New Yorkers more willing to vote for him since his 2020 loss to Biden. The city has struggled to house the new arrivals, putting many up in city hotels.\n'I think we have a chance. New York has changed a lot in the last two years,' he told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo. 'The people of New York are angry. People that would have never voted for me because I'm a Republican \u2014 I mean they're Democrats ... I think they're going to vote for me. So I think we're going to give New York a heavy shot.'\nAdvertisement\nTrump cited the 2022 New York governor's race, when Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul prevailed over Republican former Rep. Lee Zeldin \u2014 but by a much tighter margin than usual for her party's statewide nominees.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a top Trump ally, said Monday that Trump will be campaigning all over the state while he's forced to be on trial in New York.\n'He's going to make the best out of this,' she said, adding that 'Democrats in New York and the judge and everyone, they're really going to regret it.'\nAt the least, Trump, long a famous figure for New Yorkers, showed Tuesday that he can still turn heads in the city.\n'Papito Trump is coming. Yeah!' said one passerby ahead of the former president's arrival.\nLesandra Carrion, 47, who lives in the neighborhood, came out to see the former president when she heard he might be visiting.\nAdvertisement\nShe said she doesn't agree with everything Trump says or does but declared that 'he speaks the truth.' Carrion cited the rising migrant population and strained city resources. 'I think that he will make a difference,' she said of Trump.\nAs for his troubles at the courthouse at the south end of Manhattan, Carrion was dismissive. 'He's going to beat that,' she said. 'We all make mistakes at the end of the day. But he's the truth and light. I feel that God is in him.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jill Colvin","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZF3OAZH4GMI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.847152,"_id":"f2445798e971f21f400397bce6676918"},{"title":"Autoworkers union celebrates breakthrough win in Tennessee and takes aim at more plants in the South","author":"David Koenig","published_date":"2024-04-20 21:39:05","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/20/uaw-union-election-vw-chattanooga-tennessee-alabama/691ba28a-ff5e-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The United Auto Workers union is celebrating a huge win at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee, where workers will now be represented by the union","summary":"DALLAS \u2014 The United Auto Workers' overwhelming election victory at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee is giving the union hope that it can make broader inroads in the South, the least unionized part of the country.\nThe UAW won a stunning 73% of the vote at VW after losing elections in 2014 and 2019. It was the union's first win in a Southern assembly plant owned by a foreign automaker.\nUnion President Shawn Fain said the pundits all told him that the UAW couldn't win in the South.\n'But you all said, \u2018Watch this,' ' he told a cheering group of VW organizers at a union hall in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on Friday night, when the UAW victory was clear. 'You guys are leading the way. We're going to carry this fight on to Mercedes and everywhere else.'\nHowever, the UAW is likely to face a tougher test as it tries to represent workers at two Mercedes-Benz plants in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. A five-day election is scheduled to start May 13, where the union's campaign has already become heated.\nAdvertisement\nThe UAW has accused the German carmaker of violating U.S. and German labor laws with aggressive anti-union tactics, which the company denies.\n'They are going to have a much harder road in work sites where they are going to face aggressive management resistance and even community resistance than they faced in Chattanooga,' said Harry Katz, a labor-relations professor at Cornell University. 'VW management did not aggressively seek to avoid unionization. Mercedes is going to be a good test. It's the deeper South.'\nLate last year, the UAW announced a drive to represent nearly 150,000 workers at non-union factories largely in the South. The union is targeting U.S. plants run by Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, Subaru, Mazda, Volkswagen, Mercedes, BMW and Volvo, along with factories operated by electric-vehicle makers Tesla, Rivian and Lucid.\nAdvertisement\nMany of those companies raised pay after the UAW negotiated rich new contracts with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis after strikes at strategically chosen factories last year.\nBrooke Benoit, a VW worker who had seen the union voted down in Chattanooga twice before, said workers took notice.\n'I think what changed the most is everybody started seeing what we could get when the Big Three went on strike,' she said. 'They said, \u2018Wait, hold on. If they can get all this, we should too.' We do the same job, just in a different location.'\nThe union's last defeat at VW in Chattanooga came at a low-water mark \u2014 in the middle of a federal investigation into bribery and embezzlement under a previous president.\nMarick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University in Detroit who studies the UAW, said the union flipped the script by installing new leadership, touting the rich contracts it won last year from Detroit automakers after strikes at targeted factories, and exploiting a climate that is now more favorable to unions. He said the union was also adept at translating signed pro-union authorization cards into votes \u2014 partly by pushing for a quick election.\nAdvertisement\n'Now the public and media eyes are going to be on Chattanooga and how quickly the UAW can translate this into a contract,' he said. If the union can't quickly get a good contract, it risks losing some of the momentum it gained with Friday's election win, he said.\nUnions in other industries are already moving ahead with organizing campaigns in the South and trying to learn from the UAW's playbook.\nThe Association of Flight Attendants, which has tried and failed to win over cabin crews at Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, hopes to collect enough signatures to force another election at Delta by year end. The union's president, Sara Nelson, said she was not surprised at the UAW win after strikes that led to record contracts last year.\n'I've been talking about this for a long time \u2014 that strikes and taking on the boss is going to spur organizing, and that's exactly what we saw here,' Nelson said.\nAdvertisement\nNelson is trying to secure an industry-leading contract at United Airlines that she can use to court Delta crews. In the meantime, crews at startup Breeze Airways, many of whom live in the South, will vote next month whether to join her union.\nThe White House issued a statement from President Joe Biden congratulating the UAW. Biden \u2014 who joined a UAW picket line in Michigan during the union's strike against Ford, GM and Stellantis plants last year \u2014 praised the success of unions representing autoworkers, Hollywood actors and writers, health care workers and others in gaining better contracts.\n'Together, these union wins have helped raise wages and demonstrate once again that the middle-class built America and that unions are still building and expanding the middle class for all workers,' Biden said.\nAdvertisement\nBiden criticized six Southern Republican governors, including Bill Lee of Tennessee, who told autoworkers this week that voting for union representation would jeopardize jobs.\nSharon Block, a law professor at Harvard University who worked in the Biden Labor Department, said the governors' warning rang hollow after nonunion Tesla revealed that it plans to lay off 10% of its workers after disappointing sales results. She said VW workers saw the governors' open letter as 'an empty threat and a cynical ploy,' and they ignored it.\n'Workers for a long time have been told that you can't organize in the South. And many workers, even not in the South, may work in industries where they've been told for a long time you can't organize,' Block said. 'What the UAW showed last night is that we need to go and rethink all those negative statements.'\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David Koenig","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AA76YOH6YUI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.8387203,"_id":"152ee5343d687368cd5c1cd9cd82a9cb"},{"title":"Israeli intelligence head resigns over Oct. 7 Hamas attack","author":"Jennifer Hassan","published_date":"2024-04-22 08:33:21","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/22/israel-intelligence-haliva-hamas-failure","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Maj.

In 2020, Biden won the state by about 80,000 votes, but there are signs the coalition that put him in the White House has begun to fracture.\nLeaning into his middle-class upbringing also becomes a shorthand for what Biden has said is a clear difference in the values of the two presidential candidates.
