Six years of Trump's tax returns, including from his time as president, were released to the public by the House Ways and Means Committee at the end of 2022.\nThe bulk of the Bidens' income came from President Biden's congressionally mandated $400,000 salary, along with pensions. The first lady also earned $85,985 from her position as a teacher at Northern Virginia Community College.\nThe Bidens paid $146,629 in federal income tax in 2023, making their federal income tax rate 23.7%. They reported $20,477 worth of contributions to 17 different charities in 2023. They donated $5,000 to the Beau Biden Foundation, which works to protect children from abuse and is named after the president's late son, and smaller amounts to organizations including the Fraternal Order of Police, a Wilmington fire station and St. Joseph on the Brandywine.\nThe Bidens attend that church regularly and it is where Beau Biden is buried, along with Neilia Biden and Naomi Biden, the president's first wife and infant daughter who were killed in a 1972 car crash.\nHarris and Emhoff paid $88,570 in federal income tax, amounting to a 2023 rate of 19.7%. The pair contributed $23,026 to charity in 2023, including donations to the DC Central Kitchen, Howard University and the University of Southern California.\nThe Bidens have released 26 years of tax returns in total. Harris has released 20 years' worth.\nThe Bidens' 2023 income was an increase from the $579,514 the couple earned in 2022. The Bidens reported an income of $610,702 in 2021 and $607,336 in 2020.\nHarris and Emhoff reported an income of $456,918 in 2022 and $1.6 million in 2021 - the year they sold a house.\nThe current first couple restarted the tradition of the first family releasing their tax returns upon taking office in 2021.\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Michael Williams","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240111152450-24-week-in-photos-011124.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":7.5194745,"_id":"61ddd651ff12419d323639ebd57195ff"},{"title":"Promises Joe Biden has made so far in his campaign for a second term","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-20 13:13:05","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/04/politics/biden-campaign-promises-dg","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The president has made a number of promises on the campaign trail. Here are some of the policies Biden says he would enact if elected for a second term.","summary":"President Joe Biden's main pitch to voters ahead of November is simple: They should vote for him because he is not Donald Trump. In speeches and political events since his reelection campaign began in earnest earlier this year, Biden had said that his second term would essentially be a continuation of his first: 'Let's finish this job,' Biden said in a video announcing his reelection campaign last year. In making his case to voters, Biden has contrasted his own ideas of governance with Trump's stated plans to drastically alter how the federal government works, how executive power would be used and how America's role on the world stage will change if the former president wins a second term. Biden, meanwhile, has promised to protect American democracy, pass a federal law to codify the right to an abortion into law, preserve the country's international alliances and agreements and deliver on climate benchmarks. His ability to deliver on these promises even if he wins a second term, though, is not a certainty. Many of his more lofty ambitions would require congressional approval and action. In some of his most significant and enduring acts as president, Trump appointed three conservative nominees to the Supreme Court. The ensuing right-wing supermajority paved the way for the court's 2022 decision that overturned Roe. V Wade, which had enshrined the right to an abortion in federal law for nearly half a century. Biden has made the court's decision, and Trump's repeated promises to go further in restricting abortion access if he were to win in November, a centerpiece of his reelection campaign. 'Like most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right,' Biden said during his State of the Union address on March 7. '\u2026 But my predecessor came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned. He's the reason it was overturned \u2014 in fact, he brags about it.' 'Look at the chaos that has resulted,' Biden added. During the speech, Biden promised to codify the abortion-related protections enshrined in Roe v. Wade into federal law if he wins a second term, but he acknowledged that would require the cooperation of a Democratic-controlled Congress. 'If Americans send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you, I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again,' Biden said. Biden called for codifying Roe into law when he was running for president in 2020. While seeking office in 2020, Biden made ambitious climate-related promises, warning that climate change presents an existential threat to humanity. Some of those promises panned out: Biden's landmark legislative achievements, the bipartisan infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act, include hundreds of billions of dollars to encourage clean energy production and the manufacturing of electric vehicles. Pollution-falling emissions fell by 2% in the United States last year. Activists on Biden's left flank still think the president has not done enough \u2014 they want Biden to declare a climate emergency that would free up federal resources to confront climate change. Biden will need more time to fulfill some of his other pledges, including cutting emissions in half by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, and having a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. Biden said the 2020 race was a 'battle for the soul of the nation.' Now, he has made preserving democracy the focal point of his 2024 campaign \u2014 saying the value Americans place on a free and democratic society is the most important question of our country's time. He lays out the stakes in stark terms: If Trump wins a second term, the United States will face a crisis that could lead to the erosion of democratic norms. 'Not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault here at home as they are today,' Biden said during his State of the Union address last month. Today, he warned, there are 'forces taking us back in time.' Biden urged Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. The acts, which would have made Election Day a federal holiday, bolstered voting-related security measures, allowed all voters to request mail-in ballots and updated parts of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act, were blocked by Senate Republicans in 2021. 'Pass and send me the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act,' Biden told Congress during his address, 'and stop denying another core value of America \u2014 our diversity across American life.' Biden has criticized Republican-led drives to ban certain books from public schools. 'Banning books \u2013 it's wrong,' he said in his State of the Union address. The United States, he said, shouldn't be erasing history. In the same speech, Biden also called for expanded pre-kindergarten for 3- and 4-year-olds, along with raises for teachers in public schools. He said he wants to continue making college more affordable by expanding access to Pell grants for working-class families, renewing a 2020 promise he made to double the grants' value. 'To remain the strongest economy in the world,' Biden said, 'we need the best education system in the world.' In some of his first actions as president, Biden worked to return the United States to the presence it held on the world stage before Trump became president. As president, Trump denigrated alliances like NATO and withdrew the United States from crucial international agreements, including the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accords. While running in 2020, Biden promised to undo damage wreaked by Trump on America's international partnerships. Biden has said he will continue to repair relationships that have faltered under Trump's control \u2014 and uphold American commitments to NATO and Ukraine. Trump, meanwhile, has said he would encourage Russia to do 'whatever the hell they want' to NATO-member countries who don't fulfill certain funding obligations. Biden frequently refers to those comments while speaking with supporters. 'The rest of the world is wondering what in the hell is happening to us,' Biden said at a campaign event in New York last month. 'And they're relieved, not because I'm so special but that I'm not Trump.' In an earlier Dallas fundraiser, Biden said the United States' international reputation was 'crushed when (Trump) was president.' 'Imagine what will happen if he's reelected,' Biden said. In 2022, Biden signed the most comprehensive gun-reform legislation in nearly 30 years. The law, passed shortly after a White supremacist massacred 10 people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket, allocated more than $750 million to help states implement crisis-intervention programs, closed certain loopholes in existing gun-control legislation and required more thorough reviews for people aged 18 to 21 who wanted to buy firearms. Biden has said he wants to go further. 'I'm demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,' Biden said at his State of the Union address. 'Pass universal background checks. None of this violates the Second Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners.' He made a similar promise while running in 2020 but has not been able to get Congress' support. Biden has homed in on Trump's statements suggesting he would be open to cutting programs like Social Security and Medicare. In an interview with CNBC last month, Trump said: 'There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements,' Trump said on CNBC. Biden responded on X: 'Not on my watch.' He reiterated his vow to protect Social Security during his State of the Union address. 'Many of my Republican friends want to put Social Security on the chopping block,' Biden said 'If anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age I will stop them.' 'I will protect and strengthen Social Security and make the wealthy pay their fair share,' he added. ``\nPresident Joe Biden's main pitch to voters ahead of November is simple: They should vote for him because he is not Donald Trump.\nIn speeches and political events since his reelection campaign began in earnest earlier this year, Biden had said that his second term would essentially be a continuation of his first: 'Let's finish this job,' Biden said in a video announcing his reelection campaign last year.\nIn making his case to voters, Biden has contrasted his own ideas of governance with Trump's stated plans to drastically alter how the federal government works, how executive power would be used and how America's role on the world stage will change if the former president wins a second term.\nBiden, meanwhile, has promised to protect American democracy, pass a federal law to codify the right to an abortion into law, preserve the country's international alliances and agreements and deliver on climate benchmarks.\nHis ability to deliver on these promises even if he wins a second term, though, is not a certainty.

He littered his remarks with false and misleading claims on subjects ranging from his annual earnings to his cap on seniors' prescription drug spending to the demographics of China to the frequency of his past travel to Iraq and Afghanistan.\nAnd in Biden's most eyebrow-raising remarks of the campaign swing, he told and then retold a story in which he strongly suggested his late uncle, Ambrose Finnegan, was eaten by cannibals after his plane was shot down while he fought in World War II. Biden's dramatic details don't match the Defense Department's official account of the plane crash.\nHere is a fact check of eight of Biden's Pennsylvania remarks.\nIn the same Tuesday speech in Scranton, Biden repeated his regular promise that nobody making less than $400,000 per year will pay even a cent more in taxes under his proposals. He then added, 'I hope you're all able to make $400,000. I never did.'\nFacts First : Biden's 'I never did' claim is false. In fact, his presidential salary is $400,000 per year ; the joint tax filings of President Biden and first lady Jill Biden showed $619,976 in income last year , $579,514 in 2022 and $610,702 in 2021. In addition, Biden earned millions in 2017 and 2018, when, during his time as a private citizen following his vice presidency, he and Jill Biden signed a lucrative book deal and he delivered paid speeches . The Bidens' joint tax filings showed a total of about $11 million in 2017 income and about $4.6 million in 2018 income.\nFacts First: Biden's 'I never did' claim is false.

In addition, Biden earned millions in 2017 and 2018, when, during his time as a private citizen following his vice presidency, he and Jill Biden signed a lucrative book deal and he delivered paid speeches . The Bidens' joint tax filings showed a total of about $11 million in 2017 income and about $4.6 million in 2018 income. Biden, who was a US senator for 36 years prior to his vice presidency, did regularly earn less than $400,000 per year before 2017. As PolitiFact has previously noted, the Bidens' joint filings reported less than $400,000 in income in each year from 1998 through 2016 except for 2013, when they were just over $407,000.\nIn the same speech in Scranton, Biden touted provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act he signed in 2022. He said: 'For example, seniors, beginning in 2024, no matter how much their prescription drug costs are, they'll never have to pay more than $2,000 a year, no matter what.'\nFacts First : Biden's claim is false in two ways. First, the $2,000 cap on Medicare Part D enrollees' out-of-pocket prescription drug spending takes effect in 2025 , not 2024; there is a higher cap, more than $3,000, in place this year . (The White House corrected the official transcript of Biden's speech to make clear Biden should have said 2025 instead of 2024.) Second, it's not true that seniors will 'never' have to spend more than $2,000 per year on prescription drugs 'no matter what.' The cap is indexed to annual inflation in Part D costs , so it is highly likely to be set higher than $2,000 in future years. Also, the cap doesn't apply to out-of-pocket spending on Medicare Part B drugs like those administered at doctors' offices.\nFacts First: Biden's claim is false in two ways.

Also, the cap doesn't apply to out-of-pocket spending on Medicare Part B drugs like those administered at doctors' offices. Biden has correctly said on various previous occasions that the $2,000 cap takes effect in 2025, but he has also previously incorrectly said that the cap took effect in 2023 or 2024.\n- CNN's Tami Luhby contributed to this item.\n- CNN's Tami Luhby contributed to this item. In a Wednesday speech in Pittsburgh that was focused on US steel competition with China, Biden said, 'I always say to my colleagues \u2014 when I meet other world leaders, I say, \u2018Would you trade places with China? Would you trade places with their problems?' They've got a population that is more people in retirement than working.'\nFacts First : The claim that China has more retired people than working people is false. Fuxian Yi, a University of Wisconsin-Madison senior scientist who is an expert on Chinese demographics , called Biden's claim 'overstated and premature.'\nFacts First: The claim that China has more retired people than working people is false. Fuxian Yi, a University of Wisconsin-Madison senior scientist who is an expert on Chinese demographics , called Biden's claim 'overstated and premature.' China reported having more than 740 million employed people at the end of 2023, while it also reported having just shy of 297 million people age 60 or above that year. (Sixty is the normal retirement-benefits age for Chinese men; it's 50 to 55 for women depending on the nature of their jobs.) And some of the 60-plus population is still working .\nhaving more than 740 million employed people at the end of 2023, while it also reported having just shy of 297 million people age 60 or above that year.

Yi noted that China's ratio of working people to seniors is shrinking as the country's population ages. But Biden's claim that the number of retirees already exceeds the number of people working is clearly not correct, even if you apply the usual dose of skepticism to official Chinese data.\nratio of working people to seniors is shrinking as the country's population ages. But Biden's claim that the number of retirees already exceeds the number of people working is clearly not correct, even if you apply the usual dose of skepticism to official Chinese data. 'It's certainly the direction they're heading, but still an exaggeration,' Derek Scissors, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank who is an expert on the Chinese economy, said of Biden's claim.\nBiden made a similar claim in 2021, which CNN fact-checked as false at the time.\nAs he has on numerous previous occasions, Biden cited a 2021 report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy think tank that found that 55 of the country's largest corporations had made more than $40 billion in total profit in their previous fiscal year but not paid any federal corporate income taxes.\nBiden said in the same Tuesday speech in Scranton: 'When Trump was president in 2020, 55 of the largest corporations in America of the Fortune 500 made $40 billion in profit and paid zero \u2014 zero \u2014 in federal income taxes.' After someone in the audience called that 'sinful,' Biden continued, 'Well, guess what? I came along and took care of the sin. Not anymore. Thanks to the law that I wrote and signed, big corporations now have to pay a minimum \u2014 they should be paying more \u2014 a minimum of 15% tax.'\nFacts First : Biden's 'not anymore' claim is false \u2014 the same exaggeration he delivered in his State of the Union address in March . While the 15% corporate minimum tax he signed into law in the Inflation Reduction Act will reduce the number of big corporations that don't pay any federal taxes, it's not true that 'not anymore' will any big corporation \u2014 such as the ones on the list of 55 companies Biden mentioned \u2014 ever do so. That's because the minimum tax, on the 'book income' companies report to investors, only applies to companies with at least $1 billion in average annual income. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, only 14 of the companies on that 2021 list of 55 non-payers reported having US pre-tax income of at least $1 billion.\nFacts First: Biden's 'not anymore' claim is false \u2014 the same exaggeration he delivered in his State of the Union address in March .

According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, only 14 of the companies on that 2021 list of 55 non-payers reported having US pre-tax income of at least $1 billion. In other words, there will clearly still be some big and profitable corporations paying no federal income tax despite the existence of the new Biden tax. The exact number is not known.\nMatthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, told CNN in 2022 that the new tax is 'an important step forward from the status quo' and that it would raise substantial revenue, but he also said: 'I wouldn't want to assert that the minimum tax will end the phenomenon of zero-tax profitable corporations. A more accurate phrasing would be to say that the minimum tax will *help* ensure that *the most profitable* corporations pay at least some federal income tax.'\nThere are lots of nuances to the tax; you can read more specifics here. Asked for comment in early 2023, when Biden made a similar claim, a White House official told CNN: 'The Inflation Reduction Act ensures the wealthiest corporations pay a 15% minimum tax, precisely the corporations the President focused on during the campaign and in office.'\nBiden delivered another version of a claim he has regularly made about billionaires' tax rates. He said in the same Tuesday speech in Scranton: 'Do you know what the average federal tax rate for a billionaire is today in America? For real: 8.3%.' After some people in the audience laughed, Biden continued, 'That's how much federal ta- \u2014 no, I'm serious. Not a joke. Far less than the vast majority of Americans pay in federal taxes. No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a nurse, a sanitation worker.'\nFacts First : Biden's '8.3%' claim is misleading in the absence of any explanation of what this figure is. As in previous speeches , including the State of the Union address in March , Biden didn't explain that the figure is the product of an alternative calculation, from economists in his own administration, that factors in unrealized capital gains that are not treated as taxable income under federal law. In other words, while Biden made it sound like he was talking about a federal tax rate, he was actually citing a figure that is not based on the way the US tax system actually works at present.\nFacts First: Biden's '8.3%' claim is misleading in the absence of any explanation of what this figure is.

There's nothing inherently wrong with the alternative calculation itself; the administration economists who came up with it explained it in detail on the White House website in 2021. (They said the figure was 8.2%.) Biden, however, has tended to cite the figure without any context about what it is and isn't, leaving open the impression that he was talking about what these billionaire families pay under current law.\nSo what do billionaires actually pay under current law? The answer is not publicly known, but experts say it's clearly more than 8%.\n'Biden's numbers are way too low,' Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute think tank, told CNN in 2023. Gleckman said that in 2019, University of California, Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman 'estimated the top 400 households paid an average effective tax rate of about 23 percent in 2018. They got a lot of attention at the time because that rate was lower than the average rate of 24 percent for the bottom half of the income distribution. But it still was way more than 2 or 3,' numbers Biden has used in some previous speeches, 'or even 8 percent.'\nIn February 2024, Gleckman provided additional calculations from the Tax Policy Center. The center found that the top 0.1% of households paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 30.3% in 2020, including an average income tax rate of 24.3%.\nDuring the same Tuesday speech in Scranton, Biden repeated a familiar boast about his supposed impact on the federal budget deficit. He said, 'A lot more to do, but guess what? During the whole time, I've been able to cut the federal deficit at the same exact time by over $1 trillion \u2014 $1 trillion.'\nFacts First : Biden's claim leaves out such critical context that it is misleading. While the annual federal budget deficit was more than $1 trillion lower in the 2023 fiscal year than it was in both the 2020 fiscal year (under President Donald Trump) and the 2021 fiscal year (partially under Trump and partially under Biden), analysts have repeatedly noted that Biden's own actions, including laws he has signed and executive orders he has issued, have had the overall effect of worsening annual deficits, not reducing them. As in past remarks , Biden didn't explain that the primary reason the deficit fell by a record amount during his tenure was that it had skyrocketed to a record high at the end of Trump's term because of bipartisan emergency pandemic relief spending, then fell as expected when that spending expired as planned.\nFacts First: Biden's claim leaves out such critical context that it is misleading.

'The deficit is a trillion dollars lower, roughly, than when President Biden took office. That's true. But that's driven not because he \u2018reduced' the deficit by a trillion dollars, but because when he took office it was the middle of Covid and we had been temporarily injecting huge sums of money into the economy,' Marc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group that promotes deficit reduction and tracks the issue, said in a February interview.\nBiden can fairly say that his policies have contributed to a strong economic recovery that has boosted tax revenues and thus eaten into deficits. On the whole, though, Goldwein said deficits under Biden have been 'higher than they otherwise would have been because of legislation President Biden has signed into law and executive actions he's taken.'\nBiden made the same claim during his State of the Union address in March. You can read a more detailed fact check here.\nBiden claimed in another Tuesday speech in Scranton: 'I was in, I think, 36, 38 times in Iraq and Afghanistan as a senator and as a vice president.'\nFacts First : These figures are false, according to statistics previously released by Biden's own 2020 presidential campaign. The campaign said in 2019 that Biden had visited Iraq and Afghanistan on a total of 21 occasions, the Washington Post reported at the time .\nFacts First: These figures are false, according to statistics previously released by Biden's own 2020 presidential campaign. The campaign said in 2019 that Biden had visited Iraq and Afghanistan on a total of 21 occasions, the Washington Post reported at the time . Biden has delivered similar falsehoods about his travel to Iraq and Afghanistan on various previous occasions \u2014 including in the 2019 remarks that prompted his campaign to correct the record \u2014 and they have been previously fact-checked by media outlets including CNN.\nIn Scranton, where Biden was born, he visited a memorial that honors local residents who died in World War II, including his late uncle Ambrose Finnegan. Before Biden left the city on Wednesday, he told a dramatic story about Finnegan: 'He got shot down in an area where there were a lot of cannibals in New Guinea at the time. They never recovered his body.' He blamed cannibalism even more directly in his Pittsburgh speech later in the day, claiming Finnegan 'got shot down in New Guinea, and they never found the body because there used to be \u2014 there were a lot of cannibals, for real, in that part of New Guinea.'\nFacts First : Biden's claim differs from the account provided by the Defense Department, as CNN's Donald Judd reported Wednesday. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency's page on Finnegan says this about the 1944 incident: 'For unknown reasons, this plane was forced to ditch in the ocean off the north coast of New Guinea. Both engines failed at low altitude, and the aircraft's nose hit the water hard. Three men failed to emerge from the sinking wreck and were lost in the crash.' This official account, which notes that an additional crew member survived the crash, makes no mention of the plane being shot down or of possible cannibalism; while Biden said the crash happened 'in' New Guinea, where there was indeed some cannibalism at the time, the official account notes the men went down in the nearby ocean.\nFacts First : Biden's claim differs from the account provided by the Defense Department, as CNN's Donald Judd reported Wednesday.

Kennedy Jr.\nThe broader Kennedy family has mostly shunned RFK Jr.'s campaign, calling it 'dangerous,' even as the candidate himself looks to capitalize on his last name and family history.\nBut Thursday's event in Philadelphia nonetheless highlights the threat Kennedy poses to Biden as he seeks to win reelection in a race where even a low-performing third-party candidate could act as a spoiler.\nthe threat Kennedy poses to Biden as he seeks to win reelection in a race where even a low-performing third-party candidate could act as a spoiler. In a speech introducing Biden, Kerry Kennedy \u2014 one of RFK Jr.'s sisters who has helped lead her family's organizing efforts \u2014 will declare the president 'a champion for all the rights and freedoms that my father and uncles stood for' while also warning of threats posed by Donald Trump to \ufeffdemocracy and freedom.\n'Donald Trump is running to take us backwards, attacking the most basic rights and freedoms that are core to who we are as Americans,' she'll say, according to excerpts of her speech shared by the Biden campaign. 'He has said he will be a dictator on day one, even saying he wants to try to suspend the Constitution.'\n'I can only imagine how Donald Trump's outrageous lies and behavior would have horrified my father, Robert F. Kennedy, who proudly served as Attorney General of the United States, and honored his pledge to uphold the law and protect the country,' Kennedy plans to say.\nKennedy plans to say. Biden's reelection campaign, she'll say, should 'unite not only Democrats, but all Americans, including Republicans, and independents.'\nShe and Biden will be joined by John White Jr., a civil rights leader in Philadelphia, who will discuss how the Kennedy family affected his public service work.\nAfter the speech, the Kennedys will join Biden at a grassroots organizing event with campaign volunteers and local supporters, where he'll be introduced by Joe Kennedy III. Family members plan to make campaign phone calls and knock on doors afterward.\nIt's not the first time Biden has sought to emphasize his ties to the Kennedys. He has cited Robert F. Kennedy Sr. as a personal inspiration in his political career. A bust of the former attorney general and senator sits in the Oval Office.\nHe has appointed three family members to diplomatic posts in his administration: Caroline Kennedy as ambassador to Australia; Victoria Reggie Kennedy, the widow of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, as ambassador to Austria; and Joe Kennedy III as special envoy to Northern Ireland.\nOn St. Patrick's Day this year, the extended clan was invited for a reception at the White House and posed for photographs with Biden in the Rose Garden. And Biden invited Maria Shriver, a niece of John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy, to attend his State of the Union address to highlight her work on women's health.\nIn public statements, some members of the Kennedy family have already made clear they are backing Biden in November. Many have sought to distance themselves from RFK Jr.'s presidential bid.\nIn a CNN interview last month, another sister of RFK Jr., Rory Kennedy, said she's concerned he could undermine Biden's chances of defeating Trump.\n'I feel strongly that this is the most important election of our lifetime and there's so much at stake. And I do think it's gonna come down to a handful of votes in a handful of states, and I do worry that Bobby just taking some percentage of votes from Biden could shift the election and lead to Trump's election,' she said.\nRFK Jr. has sought to downplay an apparent family rift.\n'I have a big family, about 105 cousins on the last time we counted,' he told CNN's Erin Burnett earlier this month. 'I have a big family. I don't know anybody in America who's got a family who agrees with him on everything.'\nThe Kennedy family members attending Biden's event Thursday include Rory Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, Joe Kennedy II, Beth Kennedy, Joe Kennedy III, Christopher Kennedy, Maxwell Taylor Kennedy, Vicki Strauss Kennedy, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Kerry Kennedy Meltzer, Max Meltzer, Ted Kennedy Jr., Stephen Kennedy Smith, Peter McKelvy and Rebeca McKelvy.\nJoe Kennedy III, Christopher Kennedy, Maxwell Taylor Kennedy, Vicki Strauss Kennedy, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Kerry Kennedy Meltzer, Max Meltzer, Ted Kennedy Jr., Stephen Kennedy Smith, Peter McKelvy and Rebeca McKelvy.

America's shipbuilding industry lost its competitive advantage many years ago due to over-protection, it claimed, citing multiple US research reports.\nThe US effort is 'full of false accusations, misinterpreting normal trade and investment activities as harming US national security and corporate interests, and blaming China for its own industrial problems. This lacks factual basis and goes against economic common sense,' it said in a statement.\nNational Economic Council director Lael Brainard described Biden's call as 'strategic, balanced, and targeted,' saying it would safeguard the US from China's efforts to undercut domestic steel manufacturing.\n'The president understands we must invest in American manufacturing, but we also have to protect those investments and those workers from unfair exports associated with China's industrial overcapacity,' which, she said, 'poses a serious risk to the future of the American steel and aluminum industry.'\nBrainard said the approach was developed 'in close partnership with industry stakeholders and unions.'\nBiden also highlighted the Department of Commerce's efforts to crack down on China's attempts to 'flood the market with cheap products' through anti-dumping and countervailing duties, among other actions.\n'They're not competing \u2013 they're cheating,' Biden said of China.

The president and his allies nearly tripled his rival's network in ad spending over the past month and a half while Trump has had to devote millions of campaign funds to legal expenses.\nFrom March 6 \u2013 the day after Super Tuesday when Trump effectively secured the 2024 GOP presidential nomination \u2013 through Sunday, Biden's campaign and other Democratic advertisers spent $27.2 million on advertising for the presidential race, while the Trump campaign and GOP advertisers spent about $9.3 million, according to AdImpact data.\nThe Biden campaign's ad spending has included millions in key battleground states such as Michigan ($4.1 million), Pennsylvania ($3.9 million), Arizona ($2.5 million), Wisconsin ($2.2 million) and Georgia ($2.2 million). The Biden network has used its plentiful airtime to promote the administration's first-term record and to slam Trump, focusing on key issues such as the cost of living and abortion rights.\nFor example, Biden's campaign has spent over half a million dollars in just the past 10 days airing a new ad in Arizona, seizing on the high-profile fight over abortion rights there. 'Because of Donald Trump, millions of women lost the fundamental freedom to control their own bodies. And now women's lives are in danger because of that. The question is, if Donald Trump gets back in power, what freedom will you lose next?,' the ad says.\nMeanwhile, a pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., recently ramped up its advertising, booking over $1 million worth of airtime in Pennsylvania to coincide with Biden's recent campaign swing through the state last week.\n'Biden's open border puts us all at risk by releasing criminal illegals into our communities,' the MAGA Inc. spot says. Immigration and crime have been a key point of emphasis in Trump campaign messaging throughout his 2024 bid.\nTrump has also benefited since Super Tuesday from a nearly $3 million anti-Biden campaign from outside groups aligned with the oil and gas industries, which have been running ads in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, criticizing California fuel standards defended by the Biden administration.\nBut despite these signs of activity, Trump's network has been significantly outspent on the airwaves by Biden since becoming the presumptive nominee.\nTrump has also been forced off the campaign trail with the beginning of his criminal hush money trial in New York.\nBiden spent three days in Pennsylvania last week, meeting union voters, rallying with the Kennedys and slamming his predecessor's economic policies. At the same time, Trump was in court in New York, and the lone campaign event he had set for last week, a Saturday rally in North Carolina, was postponed due to bad weather.\nThe latest round of Federal Election Commission filings further show how Biden's fundraising edge is enabling his advertising advantage.\nEntering April, Biden's campaign reported $85.5 million in cash on hand, nearly doubling Trump's war chest of $45.1 million. A similar disparity exists between the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee, both poised to play key supporting roles in the election \u2013 the DNC reported $45.2 million on hand at March 31, while the RNC reported about $21.6 million.\nTrump's mounting legal expenses are exacerbating the gap. The former president's constellation of political committees has had to direct millions of dollars toward legal costs as several cases against the former president proceed; in March alone, a leadership PAC fronting most of Trump's legal fees spent about $3.7 million on legal-related expenses \u2013 nearly $3 out of every $4 it collected.\nThat leadership PAC, Save America, has spent more than $70 million on legal expenses since the start of 2021, FEC records show, a massive drain on funds that could otherwise be spent on efforts such as large ad campaigns.\nStill, polls continue to show a margin-of-error race between Biden and Trump. CNN's latest Poll of Polls average finds no clear leader, with each taking an average of 47% support among the potential electorate. That finding is effectively unchanged from averages from earlier this year.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David Wright,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2147885702-20240422195521771.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":7.264335,"_id":"53064ceb5071503154d63a183e5a336b"},{"title":"Biden says US \"committed\" to security of Israel and other regional partners","author":"Kathleen Magramo","published_date":"2024-04-15 04:00:21","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-04-15-24/h_f4e55d2d750cfb2f9f2321d7a7bfe3a5","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"US President Joe Biden addressed Iran's attack against Israel over the weekend for the first time publicly, saying he remains focused on Israel's security and reaching a ceasefire and hostage deal as\u2026","summary":"President Joe Biden speaks as he meets with Iraq's Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani in the Oval Office on Monday.

The ad also began airing the same day that the Senate will consider articles of impeachment against Biden's Homeland Security Secretary Alexander Mayorkas, whom they have blasted for his handling of the southern border.\nThe new ad from the pro-Trump super PAC spotlights the 2022 case of an undocumented immigrant who assaulted and murdered a 20-year-old autistic woman in Maryland and blames 'Biden's weak border policies.' The Republican-led House Judiciary Committee investigated the case last year, finding that the Biden administration 'insufficiently vetted' the perpetrator, who had entered the US.\nThe new ad opens, 'A defenseless young girl was brutally raped and killed by an illegal alien and known member of the violent MS 13 gang. It could have been prevented. The killer was detained at the border but released onto our streets by Biden's weak border policies.'\n'Biden's open border puts us all at risk by releasing criminal illegals into our communities,' it says. 'We have to stop Joe Biden to close our border.'\nThe high-profile case was one of several factors contributing to Republicans' push to impeach Mayorkas, which is set to proceed Wednesday as the Senate takes up the case, though the Democratic-controlled body is expected to move quickly to dismiss the charges even as Republicans insist on a full trial.\nMayorkas is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in almost 150 years. House Republicans voted to impeach Mayorkas in February over his handling of the southern border by a narrow margin after failing to do so on their first try.\nThe Biden administration has defended Mayorkas' record. In a statement following the House vote, the White House accused House Republicans of 'unconstitutional partisanship' and 'petty political games,' and said that Mayorkas 'has upheld the rule of law faithfully and has demonstrated a deep commitment to the values that make our nation great.'\nBut the administration has also hardened immigration policy in response to the blistering criticism from Republicans, embracing tougher border measures, including asylum restrictions and shutting down the US-Mexico border during migrant surges.\nThe new ad is the first that MAGA Inc. has launched since mid-March, and only the second the group has produced since Trump secured the GOP presidential nomination. It echoes the Trump team's consistent focus in its campaign messaging on immigration, which was among the top issues referenced in ads from his campaign and super PAC during the presidential primary.\nThe pro-Trump super PAC is also ramping its ad spending back up, having been mostly off the air since late January in the waning days of the nominating contest. MAGA Inc. has about $1.4 million worth of airtime booked for this week, nearly all of it targeting Pennsylvania \u2013 meaning the new ad will be airing at the same time that President Biden is there this week for a campaign swing. MAGA Inc. also has some small reservations in Wisconsin and Georgia this week. In total, MAGA Inc. has spent more than $42 million on advertising since the start of the 2024 presidential race.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David Wright,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2147786908.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":7.205321,"_id":"3d47feeeee9f9821f7a6c52171b1b278"},{"title":"Biden is launching a campaign swing this week in Pennsylvania as Trump faces New York trial","author":"Kara Scannell","published_date":"2024-04-15 11:58:49","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-04-15-24/h_ef5de829fe7663ddbf47430b75ff8562","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"President Joe Biden is preparing a campaign swing through battleground Pennsylvania this week, zeroing in on his plans to raise taxes for the wealthiest Americans and corporations as he looks to\u2026","summary":"President Joe Biden President Biden speaks to local supporters and volunteers at the office opening of the Wisconsin coordinated campaign headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on March 13. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images President Joe Biden is preparing a campaign swing through battleground Pennsylvania this week, zeroing in on his plans to raise taxes for the wealthiest Americans and corporations as he looks to present an economic contrast to former President Donald Trump.\nThe push will kick off Tuesday with a major address in Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, campaign officials told CNN, a site he's often turned to as the backdrop for making his economic populist pitch to voters.\n'The address will drive home a simple question: Do you think the tax code should work for rich people or for the middle class?' a campaign official told CNN. 'The president has made it clear what he thinks the answer is, and so has Donald Trump.' Biden then will travel to the Pittsburgh area on Wednesday and speak at a campaign event in Philadelphia on Thursday, officials said. The campaign also plans to hold events in other battleground states next week to push the economic case against Trump, who is required to be in a New York City courtroom for jury selection at his hush money trial.\nBiden's campaign swing, the first since his March barnstorm of battleground states that will effectively serve as counterprogramming to Trump's trial, comes as both men are trying to win over working-class voters. By focusing on taxes, the president also is attempting to break through on economic issues at a time when voters have maintained pessimistic views of their personal financial state and his handling of the economy, which has proven to be a vexing political issue in his reelection bid.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Elise Hammond,Aditi Sangal,CNN,Kaanita Iyer,Kara Scannell,Maureen Chowdhury,Jeremy Herb","media":"https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/5307583c-c0ad-42c5-828d-14979814deb8.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":7.191306,"_id":"96f0eb263113c06ef02d79ce3082b093"},{"title":"Biden pushes his economic populism in battleground Pennsylvania as Trump is stuck in a New York courtroom","author":"Arlette Saenz","published_date":"2024-04-16 13:23:51","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/joe-biden-scranton-pennsylvania-donald-trump/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"President Joe Biden is seeking to draw a sharp economic contrast with former President Donald Trump during a three-day swing through Pennsylvania with campaign officials framing the election as a\u2026","summary":"President Joe Biden is seeking to make a sharp economic argument against former President Donald Trump during a three-day swing through Pennsylvania with campaign officials framing the election as a debate between his 'kitchen table' Scranton outlook and Trump's 'Mar-a-Lago vision.'\nThe trip, which kicks off Tuesday in Biden's hometown of Scranton, also will set up a stark split screen as the president is on the campaign trail while Trump spends most of the week in a New York City courtroom for his criminal trial.\n'No matter where Donald Trump is, whether it's in Mar-a-Lago, a courtroom or anywhere else, he'll be focused on himself, his toxic agenda, his campaign of revenge and retribution.

'It's a stark contrast from my opponent. He looks at the economy from Mar-a-Lago where he and his rich friends embrace the failed trickle-down policies that have failed working families for more than forty years.' The trip, which kicks off a three-day swing through Pennsylvania, presented a stark split screen as the president is on the campaign trail while Trump spends most of the week in a New York City courtroom for his criminal trial.\n'Scranton values or Mar-a-Lago values.

At least since the New Deal 90 years ago, Republicans have been the party most likely to frame their agenda as advancing 'freedom' and 'liberty' while Democrats have more often emphasized ideas such as 'equality' and 'justice.'\nRepublicans haven't abandoned their rhetorical efforts to claim the terrain of freedom. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for instance, used the word almost as a mantra the past few years to denounce the restrictions many states imposed to fight the spread of Covid-19 and to attack what he calls the left's effort to impose 'woke ideology.' And Trump disparages Biden's agenda to promote the deployment of electric vehicles as an attempt to deny Americans' freedom to continue purchasing gas-powered cars and trucks.\nBut the GOP push at every level of government to roll back the 'rights revolution' of the past six decades \u2013 symbolized by the proliferation of red-state laws limiting access to abortion and potentially other reproductive health care such as IVF \u2013 has provided Democrats a historic opportunity to reverse the direction of this long-running debate, many analysts agree.\n'Historically, Republicans have rooted their philosophical world view in liberty: for them it's about freedom to own guns, to practice religion as they see fit' or reducing government taxes, spending and regulation, said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute, which studies the intersection of culture and politics. 'What's new is Democrats are using the term in ways to reimagine what freedom really means.'\nTransforming the debate over freedom may be especially crucial for Biden because polls consistently show Trump with a double-digit lead when voters are asked who they trust more to handle the economy. That means that to win the election Biden will need to convince a substantial number of voters who believe Trump is better for their bottom line to vote against him anyway. The interrelated issues revolving around rights, values and democracy likely offer the president his best chance to do so. 'If any issue' is going to flip voters who express more confidence in Trump on the economy, 'it is going to be social issues like abortion,' said Deckman.\nBiden signaled the central role freedom would play in his campaign messaging from the outset, in the video he released last year announcing his plan to seek reelection. As an ominous piano key trills behind images of the January 6, 2021, insurrection, abortion rights protesters and the White House, Biden opens the video with a stark declaration: 'Freedom. Personal freedom is fundamental to who we are as Americans. There's nothing more important. Nothing more sacred.' Later he says: 'The question we're facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer. I know what I want the answer to be, and I think you do too.'\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security.\nRoe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security. Harris, who has been the administration's point person in delivering the freedom message, has likewise cast an expansive net. When Harris delivered a Martin Luther King Day speech to the NAACP this year that summarized the administration's case for another term, she cited all the issues Biden did in the video and others, such as the restrictions several red states have imposed on the teaching of the nation's racial history and the right 'to live free from the horror of gun violence.'\nWay to Win, a liberal group that funds organizations and campaigns focusing on voters of color, has been pushing the party for several years to emphasize the freedom argument. Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, the group's vice president and chief strategy officer, says linking all these other issues to abortion is key to portraying Trump and his allies as a threat to freedom.\n'If [abortion] was the only thing, it would feel different than if you are able to tick off all these other things that they are doing and that they will do,' she said. 'We can even say it with other kinds of repro [rights]: We can say it with IVF, or now they are going to come for your contraception. Abortion is an entry point: because it is so visceral for people, it is a way to connect to a larger story about rights and freedoms.'\nLauren Hitt, a senior spokesperson for the Biden campaign, argued freedom will be a powerful message for the president because it resonates with a broad range of voters. 'It \u2026 speaks to the values of traditional Republican voters, [Nikki] Haley primary voters, and suburban voters \u2013 as well as to our base who believe deeply that the government shouldn't be making personal decisions for people,' she said. 'It's a uniquely powerful idea grounded in traditional democratic values that will be critical in winning the swing voters we need to win in November.'\nThe Trump campaign pushed back on Biden's ad asking which freedom Trump would take away next. 'Under Joe Biden, Americans are less free, less safe, and less prosperous,' Karoline Leavitt, the campaign's national spokesperson, said in a statement.\nDaniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that broad changes in societal attitudes have encouraged both parties to emphasize their commitments to personal freedom. 'Each side recognizes this is something people care about,' Cox said. 'It's effective language at a time when we are increasingly individualistic. We are not as inclined to be communitarian and oriented toward the concerns of others. So I think it's not a surprise that we're seeing both political parties try to employ this language to their advantage.'\nEven with all the increased Democratic emphasis on protecting rights, Cox said, the issue remains 'contested ground' that can favor either party depending on how it is framed. While Republicans have been 'on their heels' defending abortion restrictions such as last week's Arizona ruling, he said, the party has benefited in other races from positioning itself as defending 'parent's rights,' as Republican Glenn Youngkin did while winning the Virginia governorship in 2021. (It's notable that when abortion rights and parental rights collided in the 2023 Virginia state legislative elections, Democrats stressing the former won control of both chambers over Republicans emphasizing the latter.)\nPolling suggests the public remains split over which party it trusts to defend basic rights and freedoms. To begin with, Democrats and Republicans hold very different priorities over which rights are most important to protect, PRRI found in unpublished national polling shared exclusively with CNN. In that survey, conducted late last year, Republicans were most likely to say their freedom to own guns, to practice their religion and to speak their mind was growing more restricted; Democrats were most likely to say that they were losing the freedom to control their own body. 'The parties are talking past each other,' Deckman said. 'Freedom is a word that is quintessentially American, but it depends on what freedoms you are referring to in the first place.'\nThe public returned a similar split verdict last fall in an NBC poll that asked voters which party they trusted more to handle different issues. In the poll, Democrats held a commanding 18 percentage point advantage on dealing with abortion. But when asked which party they trusted more on 'protecting our constitutional rights,' voters preferred Republicans by a margin of 43% to 35%. Even White women, who strongly preferred Democrats on abortion, split evenly over which party they trusted on the broader question of preserving core constitutional rights.\nThat GOP advantage may reflect the traditional political dynamic that conservative voters have been more likely than liberals to believe their rights are under siege and to view government actions as a threat to their liberty. In 2022 polling by Penn State University's McCourtney Institute for Democracy, Republicans were twice as likely as Democrats to say that they had lost rights and freedoms over the past decade. Republicans were also considerably more likely, though not by as lopsided a margin, to predict that they would lose more rights than they gain over the next decade.\nThe real-world consequence of that imbalance was on display in the 2016 presidential campaign, when Democratic-leaning voters largely shrugged about Hillary Clinton's warnings that a Trump victory would allow him to move the Supreme Court to the right in a way that would threaten basic rights, like abortion.\nChris Wilson, a GOP pollster who worked for the super PAC supporting DeSantis in the 2024 campaign, said the Penn State polling suggests that Biden still will face difficulty mobilizing key elements of the Democratic coalition with a message about rights and freedoms. He noted that such groups as Generation Z, Blacks and Latinos were much less likely than college-educated Whites or Republicans to express fears in the poll that they would lose rights in the decade ahead.\n'To whatever extent the Democrats are trying to make a rights argument, it's not as worrying to the youth and to minorities as it is to Whites, people with college degrees, and Boomers,' Wilson said. 'Biden's \u2018rights' argument might be a big hit with his peers, but might be the wrong note to strike if he wants to hold onto the parts of the Democratic coalition that are starting to look shaky.'\nBut the Penn State polling was conducted before the Dobbs decision ended the nationwide right to abortion. And many analysts believe that seismic shift has increased the relevance of questions revolving around rights and freedoms to key groups that Democrats rely on \u2013 with younger women especially focused on these threats. While Republicans traditionally responded more to these arguments, Deckman said, 'These times certainly have made freedom a more accessible, even an existential, issue for people on the left.'\nFernandez Ancona agrees to an extent with both Wilson and Deckman. The 2022 elections, she said, demonstrated how strongly many people react to the risk of losing rights they believed had been settled. 'When these things you take for granted are taken away in this very stark way, it's incredibly motivating,' she said. But she also believes that Democrats need to tie their case about defending personal freedom into a broader message that portrays the 2024 election less as a personal choice between Trump and Biden than as a fundamental crossroads over America's future priorities that will shape not only personal liberties but also economic opportunity.\n'We have to get people to shift their thinking about how this is a choice between two different futures,' she said. 'It can get people out of this one-to-one candidate-to- candidate [comparison] and asking, \u2018what I like, what I don't like' about Trump or Biden.'\nFor libertarians, the escalating struggle between Biden and Republicans over the idea of freedom is a source of both bemusement and frustration. Libertarians take a purist position that advocates for minimal government intervention in both personal behavior and the economy; they usually find Republicans deficient on the first count, and Democrats on the second.\nDavid Boaz, a distinguished senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, sees those flaws in both Biden and Trump. The Biden administration, Boaz said, is 'very big on reproductive freedom, and very big on a lot of aspects of LGBTQ freedom, but beyond those things, where's the freedom in the Biden-Harris plan?' And while Trump talks about promoting economic freedom by cutting taxes and regulation, Boaz continued, Republicans have also undermined such freedom by promoting high tariffs and using government policy to punish companies they disfavor, as DeSantis did with Disney in Florida.\nBut while Boaz believes both Biden and Trump have imperfect records when it comes to promoting freedom, he thinks one issue breaks the tie between them: Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election. \ufeff'I have friends who say Biden is the biggest spender ever and he's regulating and he's woke and how can anyone consider voting for him over Trump?' Boaz said.\n'And I'll say that one reason is that Biden has not tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power. That's a very fundamental issue. You can add up all these [other] issues and weigh them. But the big freedom issue that Biden has over Trump,' Boaaz added, 'is that Trump tried to steal an election.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ronald Brownstein,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bc56ff7a-5e96-468d-93c1-418068e7e891.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":7.0807843,"_id":"29d5ef176fd69a8b984c85be46f5d200"},{"title":"Analysis: Why Biden and Democrats are talking so much about freedom","author":"Ronald Brownstein","published_date":"2024-04-17 04:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/abortion-democrats-freedom-messaging","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration:\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration: 'This fight is about freedom, and the freedom that is fundamental to the promise of America.'\nIn a new abortion-focused ad that the Biden campaign aired in Arizona last week, President Joe Biden somberly asks: 'If Donald Trump gets back in power, what freedom will you lose next?'\nFor Biden, Harris and other Democrats to lean so heavily on the word 'freedom' in this campaign is a historic reversal of roles.

But she also believes that Democrats need to tie their case about defending personal freedom into a broader message that portrays the 2024 election less as a personal choice between Trump and Biden than as a fundamental crossroads over America's future priorities that will shape not only personal liberties but also economic opportunity.\n'We have to get people to shift their thinking about how this is a choice between two different futures,' she said. 'It can get people out of this one-to-one candidate-to- candidate [comparison] and asking, \u2018what I like, what I don't like' about Trump or Biden.'\nFor libertarians, the escalating struggle between Biden and Republicans over the idea of freedom is a source of both bemusement and frustration. Libertarians take a purist position that advocates for minimal government intervention in both personal behavior and the economy; they usually find Republicans deficient on the first count, and Democrats on the second.\nDavid Boaz, a distinguished senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, sees those flaws in both Biden and Trump. The Biden administration, Boaz said, is 'very big on reproductive freedom, and very big on a lot of aspects of LGBTQ freedom, but beyond those things, where's the freedom in the Biden-Harris plan?' And while Trump talks about promoting economic freedom by cutting taxes and regulation, Boaz continued, Republicans have also undermined such freedom by promoting high tariffs and using government policy to punish companies they disfavor, as DeSantis did with Disney in Florida.\nBut while Boaz believes both Biden and Trump have imperfect records when it comes to promoting freedom, he thinks one issue breaks the tie between them: Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election. \ufeff'I have friends who say Biden is the biggest spender ever and he's regulating and he's woke and how can anyone consider voting for him over Trump?' Boaz said.\n'And I'll say that one reason is that Biden has not tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power. That's a very fundamental issue. You can add up all these [other] issues and weigh them. But the big freedom issue that Biden has over Trump,' Boaaz added, 'is that Trump tried to steal an election.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Ronald Brownstein","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bc56ff7a-5e96-468d-93c1-418068e7e891.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":7.0746837,"_id":"81dbae72a82253d6374c4fc6129317ab"},{"title":"Biden administration bans drilling in nearly half of Alaska petroleum reserve in sweeping win for climate advocates","author":"Ella Nilsen","published_date":"2024-04-19 09:00:26","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/19/climate/alaska-drilling-ban-biden-climate","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The Biden administration is banning drilling on nearly half of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 In a sweeping win for climate and environmental advocates, the Biden administration on Friday finalized a rule to ban fossil fuel drilling on nearly half of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, alongside other major conservation actions.\ndrilling on nearly half of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, alongside other major conservation actions. The Interior Department will block oil drilling on over 13 million acres in the Western Arctic, including about 40% of the land of the NPR-A \u2013 a remote area that is home to protected animal species including polar bears and caribou.\nThe reserve is more than 23 million acres of public land and an underground emergency oil supply for the US Navy that was designated in the early 1920s. More recently, it's become the site of the ConocoPhillips-owned Willow project, a controversial oil drilling venture in the Arctic.\npublic land and an underground emergency oil supply for the US Navy that was designated in the early 1920s. More recently, it's become the site of the ConocoPhillips-owned Willow project, a controversial oil drilling venture in the Arctic. When the Biden administration approved Willow in March 2023, it sparked intense backlash among young people on social media, as well as environmental and climate groups. Friday's action could improve President Joe Biden's approval among young voters.\n'These natural wonders demand our protection,' Biden said in a statement. Biden said he was 'proud' of his administration's move to conserve more than 13 million acres in the Western Arctic, but added, 'as the climate crisis imperils communities across the country, more must be done.'\nSome Alaska Natives are critical of the drilling ban across such a significant swath of the NPR-A. It has proved controversial with Alaska's bipartisan congressional delegation, as well as Alaska Native groups who say they depend on the tax revenue from oil drilling to fund schools and basic services.\nIt has proved controversial with Alaska's bipartisan congressional delegation, as well as Alaska Native groups who say they depend on the tax revenue from oil drilling to fund schools and basic services. The final rule 'does not reflect our communities' wishes,' said Voice of the Arctic I\u00f1upiat President Nagruk Harcharek, adding the move 'will hurt the very residents the federal government purports to help by rolling back years of progress, impoverishing our communities, and imperiling our I\u00f1upiaq culture.'\nThe ban will also open the president to attacks from Republicans that he is failing to prioritize American energy independence and is driving up the price of gasoline. But under Biden's tenure, the US is producing more oil than any country in history, CNN Business reported, and gas prices are down $1.35 from their all-time high in June 2022.\nIn addition to protecting a vast amount of the NPR-A on Friday, the Biden administration moved to block the Trump administration-approved Ambler road in the Alaskan wilderness. If built, the road would serve as the access point for a proposed copper mine. The administration signaled it wanted to take 'no action' on the mine, effectively blocking the road's access to federal land.\nIn a statement, Ambler Metals, the company seeking to mine copper in the region, said it was 'deeply disappointed' in Interior's decision. Ambler's managing director Kaleb Froehlich said the move would deprive local communities of jobs and tax revenue and prevent the US 'from developing a domestic supply of minerals that are critical for clean energy technology and national security.'\nThe Alaska announcements cap off a week that saw a flurry of actions from Biden's Interior Department. On Thursday, the department announced a new rule that elevated conservation to put it on equal footing as other public land uses like grazing, mining and other energy development. The new conservation rule covers 245 million acres largely in the Western United States \u2013 about a tenth of the land in the nation.\nNext week, Biden is poised to expand two national monuments in California, CNN previously reported, adding to the several he has already designated throughout his presidency.\nInterior Sec. Deb Haaland said the administration's Alaska conservation announcements 'underscore our commitment to ensure that places too special to develop remain intact for the communities and species that rely on them.'\nIn a statement, Haaland added the move would be big step to safeguard 'the way of life for the Indigenous people who have called this special place home since time immemorial.'\nEnvironmental groups and some indigenous groups applauded Biden's announcements on Alaska conservation as an 'important step.'\n'It's no secret that the Reserve \u2013 a vast region of tundra and wetlands teeming with wildlife \u2013 has frequently landed in the crosshairs of the insatiable fossil fuel industry,' said Earthjustice attorney Jeremy Lieb in a statement. 'We applaud this move and call for even bolder action to keep the fossil fuel industry out of the Arctic, for the sake of the climate and future generations.'\nRosemary Ahtuangaruak, the former mayor of the North Slope village of Nuiqsut, and a staunch opponent of Willow, called upon the Biden administration to build on the protections in a statement, saying it would help Alaska Natives 'continue to sustain and pass along the traditions and activities of our elders for years to come.'\nAhtuangaruak told CNN in a recent interview that construction of infrastructure and ice and gravel roads needed for the Willow project is well underway. Ahtuangaruak fears the project is already impacting an annual caribou migration that's an important source of food for locals.\n'The animals have already begun their migration; we also have animals that get impeded and get stuck on the ice road areas,' Ahtuangaruak told CNN. 'It's really tough to work through all these issues.'\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Ella Nilsen","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1487925780.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":7.062655,"_id":"f8be8f4b1eea28ff963d93d08f07bad7"},{"title":"Judge to potential jurors: \"You alone are responsible for deciding\" if Trump is guilty or not guilty","author":"Kara Scannell","published_date":"2024-04-15 11:58:49","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-04-15-24/h_fb7e1e5a983e9c7ce79adff7d9976377","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Judge Juan Merchan told the jury pool they alone are the judges of facts in this case.","summary":"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre speaks during a press briefing at the White House in Washington, DC, on April 15.

Kennedy Jr. officially qualified for the ballot in Michigan, a key battleground state that could prove pivotal in deciding the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.\nThe campaign announced on Thursday that Kennedy and his running mate Nicole Shanahan were nominated by the Natural Law Party, a minor party with ballot access in the state. Natural Law Party of Michigan chair Doug Dern told CNN the party nominated Kennedy in a convention on Wednesday. The Michigan Secretary of State's office confirmed to CNN the party's nomination has been approved and Kennedy will appear on the state's ballot.\nKennedy's presence on the ballot in Michigan could alter the electoral dynamic in a state heavily contested by both President Joe Biden, who won the state in 2020, and former President Donald Trump, who won the state in 2016. The outcome of the elections in Michigan in both 2020 and 2016 was decided by less than 1% of the vote.\nA Wall Street Journal poll released earlier this month found Kennedy polling at 12% among Michigan voters, trailing Trump at 39% and Biden at 37% in a hypothetical ballot featuring six total candidates. In a hypothetical head-to-head matchup between Trump and Biden, Trump earned 48% support from Michigan voters, while Biden earned 45% support.\nMichigan has backed the Democratic nominee in every presidential election dating back to 1992, except for Trump's victory in 2016, when he narrowly defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton by less than 11,000 votes in the state. In that same election, Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein received more than 220,000 votes combined in Michigan.\nThe 2016 results in states like Michigan are part of the reason why Democrats and Biden allies are pushing back sharply against Kennedy, the most prominent third-party candidate in the race. The Democratic National Committee has launched billboard ads outside Kennedy events across the country that attempt to link Kennedy to Trump through donations to Kennedy's super PAC from Timothy Mellon, a GOP megadonor who has also donated to Trump-aligned groups. Some of the DNC's first ads attacking Kennedy were placed on billboards in Grand Rapids, Michigan, outside a Kennedy campaign event in February.\nMichigan may be among the states most vulnerable to flipping against Biden due to having a substantial group of pro-Palestinian voters who have protested Biden's response to Israel's military operation in Gaza. A grassroots movement led by Arab and Muslim Americans in Michigan garnered enough support in the state's Democratic primary last month to earn more than 100,000 votes for the 'uncommitted' ballot line.\nMichigan is the second state where Kennedy has officially qualified for the ballot. He gained ballot access in Utah earlier this year, and his campaign has said it has collected enough signatures to appear on the ballot in New Hampshire, Hawaii, Nebraska, Idaho, North Carolina, Iowa and Nevada.\nAmerican Values 2024, a super PAC backing Kennedy's presidential bid, said it has gathered enough signatures to put Kennedy on the ballot in four states, including Michigan. The PAC's signature gathering effort is the subject of a complaint filed by the Democratic National Committee with the Federal Election Commission, alleging the PAC illegally coordinated with the Kennedy campaign.

They carry no serial numbers, do not require background checks and provide no transfer records for traceability. Critics say they are attractive to people who are otherwise legally prohibited from buying firearms.\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives approved a regulation in 2022 that required the manufacturers to have serial numbers on the kits and keep records of who purchased them. Advocacy groups and five companies that manufacture the kits sued, arguing the regulation wasn't permitted under law.\nThe rule does not prohibit the sale or possession of any ghost gun kit, nor does it block an individual from purchasing such a kit. Instead, it requires compliance with federal laws that impose conditions on the commercial sale of firearms.\nA US district court in Texas threw out the rule and the conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals mostly upheld that decision. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, has weighed into the case twice on its emergency docket, pausing lower court rulings that barred the regulation from taking effect.\nLast summer, a 5-4 court sided with the Biden administration in the first emergency request, allowing the regulations to remain in effect while legal challenges played out. At the time, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett sided with the liberal justices in the administration's favor.\nAfter the order was issued, the district court stepped in to block the regulations as applied to two manufacturers. The Supreme Court stepped in again last fall to allow the regulations to remain in effect.\nThe Biden administration said police departments have faced an 'explosion of crimes involving ghost guns' in recent years. In 2017, police submitted about 1,600 ghost guns for tracing. Four years later, the number had grown to more than 19,000.\nBoth sides \u2013 the administration and the manufacturers \u2013 asked the Supreme Court to take the case.\nThe kit makers said their product is intended to cater to 'law-abiding citizens making their own firearms' and accused the Biden administration of attempting to shut their companies down.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,John Fritze","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2147857583.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.8579664,"_id":"9f4768aa02fe83028ed59f1bd5dea923"},{"title":"Judge denies Trump team's challenge to dismiss potential juror","author":"'S Jeremy Herb","published_date":"2024-04-18 11:53:41","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-04-18-24/h_64528974abe764504d3e5b89aded822c","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Judge Juan Merchan denied the challenge for cause for the potential juror who Trump attorney Susan Necheles says once stayed at her house.","summary":"President Joe Biden warned that former President Donald Trump would pose a threat to democracy while touting his campaign's advantage over Trump's in Pennsylvania.\n'This really is about, our, democracy's really at risk, it's not a joke \u2013 I mean, I'm being deadly earnest, and this guy [Trump] means when he says, if we haven't learned that now, we're kidding ourselves,' Biden said during a grassroots organizing event with volunteers in Pennsylvania.

He called the climate crisis an 'existential threat' that requires 'full and clear action.'\n'As president, I've seen the devastating toll of climate firsthand,' Biden said, speaking of wildfires, extreme weather and deadly heat. 'Despite the overwhelming devastation in red and blue states, there are still those who deny the climate is in crisis. They want to take us backwards. I'm determined \u2013 absolutely determined [that] we move forward.'\nUnder the Environmental Protection Agency's Solar for All program, the administration announced funding awards to states territories, tribal governments, municipalities and nonprofits 'to develop long-lasting solar programs that are targeted towards the communities and people who need them most,' EPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe told reporters during a Friday call.\nPer McCabe, the funding will enable nearly one million households in low-income and disadvantaged communities to benefit from solar power, saving more than $350 million in electric costs annually and more than $8 billion over the life of the program for overburdened households.\nBiden also announced new action on the federal Climate Corps \u2013 a workforce training and service initiative aimed at preparing young Americans for jobs in clean energy and climate resilience. The government will ease Climate Corps members' transition to other federal jobs after they graduate from the program.\nBiden said service programs like the Climate Corps bring 'out the best in young people to do what's best for America.'\n'You'll get paid to fight climate change, learning how to install those solar panels, fight wildfires, rebuild wetlands, weatherize homes, and so much more,' Biden added.\nHe also announced a new partnership between the administration and TradesFutures, the non-profit arm of the North America's Building Trades Unions, allowing Climate Corps members to access some of the union's apprenticeship programs.\nHe also touted an announcement from three states \u2014 Vermont, New Mexico and Illinois \u2014 launching their own state-based climate corps. Climate corps programs will employ people doing conservation work, as well as work constructing renewable energy like wind and solar.\nBiden and other progressive lawmakers, including Sens.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, delivered remarks in Virginia's Prince William Forest Park, a site developed by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps, on which the American Climate Corps is modeled.\n'In the midst of a depression, President Roosevelt called on the American people to come together, to take on the challenge and unlock the opportunity that sat inside of that\u2013 the opportunity to heal, to lift folks up, and to move America forward,' White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi said Friday. 'President Biden will talk about how the United States, in the face of a climate crisis fully manifest to the American people in communities all across the country, is also an opportunity for us to come together.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Donald Judd,Ella Nilsen","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2148203597.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":6.7891464,"_id":"fadce571088ee8017c99eca2efc9d1d1"},{"title":"GOP Gov.

But she made sure everyone\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Kamala Harris hadn't even started building up to her ending when the crowd in Las Vegas \u2014 more fired up than any poll would suggest \u2014 started chanting, 'Four more years!' But she made sure everyone heard the line she's come up with: 'Trump abortion bans.'\nAnd not one pro-Palestinian protester interrupted her that day, or, for that matter, over her four-day campaign swing West.\nThe vice president is clearly feeling energized these days. She is more engaged. She is looser. Aides say she was the one who pushed to explicitly call out former President Donald Trump as responsible for every rollback in abortion rights, and she is clearly feeding on the old prosecutorial rush of tearing apart the opposition's argument.\nIn a conference room in the back of a campaign office in a Las Vegas strip mall, Harris said she is finding the last few months, on the attack and able to zero in on the contrast with Trump, 'very liberating.'\n'You can't forget that for the first probably year and a half, we were landlocked. It was basically me and Joe and a Zoom screen,' she told CNN, in an exclusive interview at the end of the multiday campaign swing, built in part around getting her to battlegrounds Arizona and Nevada, and around what staff has found to be helpful downtime back home in Los Angeles cooking Sunday dinner. 'Being out and being able to just have real conversations and not soundbites in an interview \u2014 it is liberating.'\nNo one in the vice president's orbit, including Harris herself, needs to be reminded how the disappointment and disenchantment from her first years on the job still hang over her, or how odd it is that some voters say in interviews with CNN and outside focus groups they are inclined toward Biden but are turned off by Harris.\nCNN's conversations with two dozen aides to the vice president, the reelection campaign and other top Democrats also show the paradox that even the most Biden-centric aides have been forced to grudgingly admit: There is another swath of voters turned off by the president \u2014 and their internal data shows Harris will be critical to getting them if Biden wants to win a second term.\nAfter years of being shunted to politically toxic and fruitless parts of the administration portfolio, such as overseeing migration negotiations with Central American leaders, or clearly junior varsity ones like chairing the National Space Council, these days are so full of plum assignments for Harris that her trip to Arizona was originally supposed to be to promote the latest round of student loan debt cancellation \u2014 only to get quickly changed when the state Supreme Court ruled that Arizona must adhere to its 1864 abortion ban.\n'She has been front and center on so many of the most politically potent issues right now,' said Julie Chavez Rodriguez, who was a top aide to Harris for years before becoming the Biden reelection campaign manager, calling these 'new opportunities to speak to the coalitions we know she already has a deep affinity to, but on issues that are top of mind for those voters.'\n'As a former prosecutor, she can prosecute the case on so much,' Rodriguez said.\nIt means getting to talk about gun control and reaching out to younger voters like the gym full of high schoolers in Vegas who cheered even more loudly for her than they did when Marvel actress Xochitl Gomez took the stage first. ('She's killing it!' an excited 15-year-old in a Barbie-pink denim jacket exclaimed after pushing up to take a photo with Harris as Aretha Franklin's 'Respect' played on the speakers.)\nWhile Biden talks about threats to democracy, Harris talks about 'freedom' under assault \u2014 a way of thinking that she said feels rooted in her life and in the lives of the voters she is after. It's the stories she used to tell about being taken to civil rights protests when she was in her stroller. It's showing up at the Cow Palace in San Francisco when she was district attorney to join the chants to close the 'gun show loophole' \u2014 as Biden did earlier this month in a new action to crack down on buyers at gun shows avoiding background checks.\n'I grew up the child of parents who fought for civil rights and freedoms,' she said, 'so this really does cut at the core for me around what's important about our country and what's at stake in the country.'\nMore often these days, she's invoking the 'prosecutor for president' framing that defined her own presidential campaign more than four years ago. She likes facts, she says. She likes using them to show she is right and has been right all along about what she says Trump is after.\n'The prosecutor approach is really about just deconstructing an issue,' she said. 'It's presenting and reminding folks about the empirical evidence that shows us exactly how we arrived at this point. \u2026 He can't hide from this stuff.'\nJust before coming on stage in Arizona, Harris and a few aides scrambled to add in a line to go right at what Trump had said minutes before \u2014 that the US Supreme Court's Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade is 'working the way it is supposed to.'\nDobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade is 'working the way it is supposed to.' 'Here's what a second Trump term looks like: More bans, more suffering and less freedom,' she told those gathered in Tucson, warning a national abortion ban and restrictions on abortion medications loom.\n'Shame! Shame! Shame!' the crowd started chanting.\nBy that evening, at a $1.5 million fundraiser in 'Family Guy' creator Seth MacFarlane's tree-filled living room in a Beverly Hills house with a 360-degree view of Los Angeles, and then in front of a luncheon for Black women in power the next day, she had started building that into a pursed lip, lowered voice Trump impression of her own, mocking the former president as saying, 'Well, you know, the states will do what they want to do.'\nDuring her own run for president, Harris was often derided as having no core and just chasing situational politics. By the end of the swing through Nevada, she was the one coming at Trump for being a weathervane on even the most fundamental issues of belief and politics.\n'It's not as though he has any real explanation. There's a lot of what he's doing that is just to suggest that he took a different tact,' she said of Trump's shifting arguments about whether and when to have abortion bans. 'There's a lot of benefit to being unburdened by ideology.'\nHarris' small staff has struggled since her inauguration to keep up with a scrutiny no previous vice president has faced, so even with the significantly stepped-up travel schedule these days, they have been grateful for help from new campaign hires in fielding press requests or just handling event logistics.\nFor the candidate herself, the shift has been more existential.\nBiden's personality fit the unstructured ambiguity of the modern vice presidency. He could be the presidential adviser, or the chummy cheerleader schmoozing hours after the conversations were scheduled to end.\nNot Harris. She likes a plan. She thrives with a goal. Left to her own, people who know her and were sometimes involved say she often let a small circle of friends and advisers into her head, getting into agonizing spirals of what else she should be doing, but also why she wasn't doing more, but also what would happen if she did try to do more.\nThree years of telling Harris she was supposed to establish herself led to more stress over what that could mean more than any actual progress.\n'It took me way longer than two years how to figure out how to be a good United States senator, and her job is a lot harder than mine,' said Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a longtime leader on the gun safety movement who has often talked about how engaged he has found Harris to be. 'There's no doubt she's better at the job today than she was in Year 1.'\nRunning for vice president has the definition that being vice president lacks. It's tactics, strategy, a target, a goal. Given a mission, aides have found Harris to be an extremely effective performance player, whether pressuring interest group leaders dragging their feet to support Biden or helping deliver the battlegrounds where she is shining more.\n'What business do we need to accomplish?' is a line Harris tends to use and that staff have learned to use themselves to prod her.\nWith Harris hyperaware of the filters she believes go over her every word and move, aides know better than to use the phrase 'attack dog' in a planning meeting with her. She won't risk being seen as an angry Black woman. She won't be the traditional running mate all-purpose battering ram.\nAt her first event in Las Vegas last week, Harris asked students to raise their hands if they were ever in an active shooter drill; dozens of hands went up. She told them about the blood stains on the floor and abandoned valentines still strewn around the preserved Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School she toured in Parkland, Florida, last month, and about a student from another school who confided that she didn't like going to fifth period because there was no closet in that room to hide in.\nHarris has a way of telling stories like these that spark audible reactions of shock and outrage from the crowd. She did it there, and again an hour later while talking about abortion, decrying how having no exception for rape is 'immoral,' resulting in a survivor of 'violence to their body \u2014 that they don't have the right to determine what happens to their body next.'\n'There's a certain level of authority that comes with having a uterus and being a woman,' said New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, praising how Harris has been leading the charge for the administration on reproductive rights.\n'They have the potential to tell a really interesting story and vision that connects with younger people, but there's a long way to go from here to there,' said John Della Volpe, a pollster who specializes in younger voters and is not affiliated with the reelection campaign. 'She can translate that in a more emotional and evocative way that resonates with young people.'\nFor Harris, it's at least the feeling, for the first time in a long time, of standing up and standing out on her own. These days, Trump campaign aides don't talk much about her, despite past Republicans' attempts to make her a liability for Biden. But she's eager to take on whoever Trump picks as his own running mate.\n'I am ready,' she threw down, 'for whoever has the, fill in the blank, to do it.'\nFor all the efforts, the campaign and Harris' own staff still aren't quite sure what people make of her. In the last few months, they invested in asking voters about her, including having the Democratic National Committee pay for focus groups in Milwaukee run by an operative who has long worked for her.\nThe bad news: Several people said Harris rubs them the wrong way, in all the ways that are familiar from criticism of her. A few specifically cited her laugh \u2014 a frequent target of Republican operatives who flood clips of it on social media, which defenders say plays into sexism.\nThe good news, as described to CNN by several people familiar with the findings: People said they would much rather hear from Harris than Biden on abortion, guns, student loans and Gaza.\nMultiple people asked said they didn't think Harris had been treated well. They questioned whether Biden actually likes her.\nHarris has internalized skepticism about campaign data \u2014 'I give polls only so much credit,' she said in the interview \u2014 but around her, the responses were validation of years of grumbling that Biden should have been better setting up his heir apparent, and that perhaps they are now both in danger of paying the price.\nYet the rivalry still bubbles up. Some Biden aides greeted the findings with frustration, annoyed by the suggestion that the president will need to lean on her more. Questions about where Harris is more resonant immediately lead Biden aides to stress that they are complementary components of the campaign, and that the president, not her, is the one who can do things like go to Pittsburgh to propose new tariffs on Chinese steel.\nHarris has integrated so much into the work of the administration that Air Force Two sat on the tarmac for an hour recently, delaying a campaign-geared trip to North Carolina as she listened in on Biden's call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which she has done without public announcement throughout the Israel-Hamas war.\nBut in a March speech in Alabama, Harris called for 'an immediate ceasefire,' waited for applause, and only then added, 'for at least the next six weeks' to get the Israeli hostages out of Gaza. West Wing aides fumed both at the noticeable pause \u2014 even though the position was the same as Biden's \u2014 and at hearing that Harris' aides had alerted reporters ahead of time that they should watch the speech.\nLikewise, when CNN reported in February that Harris had been holding private meetings with top Democratic officials to discuss campaign strategy, top Biden aides spread word to several who attended that they had not realized these were happening.\n'There's so many ways in which they are able to complement one another and speak to our core audiences from different perspectives that reinforce who we are as a campaign and as an administration at this unique moment in time,' said Rodriguez, the Biden campaign manager.\nThe solution for Harris, aides believe, is exposure. Though many leading Democrats think she'd have a hard path to a future presidential nomination, aides believe they can at least boost her numbers by getting her out more.\nBut the day job still gets in the way. A long-anticipated appearance on Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show was postponed last week, according to people familiar, rather than risking a setback to being taken seriously by laughing it up on a comedy show in the midst of a crisis.\nWith under 200 days until the election, they are not sure when she will get back.\nShe's already scripted some bits, though.\nWhen MacFarlane asked her at the fundraiser who her favorite Trump is, she knew the question was coming. No purposeful pause this time.\n'Alec Baldwin,' she shot back.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Edward-Isaac Dovere","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2147839782.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.685186,"_id":"b5307d80194ea2d7c06c3c8dd6dfd957"},{"title":"TikTok vows legal challenge to potential US app ban","author":"Brian Fung","published_date":"2024-04-22 15:20:32","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/22/tech/tiktok-vows-legal-challenge-to-potential-us-app-ban","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"TikTok plans to file a court challenge if the Senate passes, and President Joe Biden signs, a House-passed foreign aid package containing language that could lead to a nationwide TikTok ban, a top\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 TikTok will file a court challenge if Congress passes legislation paving the way to a nationwide ban of the app, a top executive told employees in an internal memo obtained by CNN.\nOn Saturday the House of Representatives passed a foreign aid package containing language that could lead to a ban of TikTok \u2014 and the bill could pass the Senate within days, Michael Beckerman, TikTok's head of public policy for the Americas, warned employees in the memo he sent the same day.\n'At the stage that the bill is signed [by President Joe Biden], we will move to the courts for a legal challenge,' Beckerman wrote to staff, describing the legislation as 'an unprecedented deal worked out between the Republican Speaker [Mike Johnson] and President Biden.'\n'This is the beginning, not the end of this long process,' Beckerman added.

Kennedy Jr.'s presidential bid and his environmental policy in new efforts on Friday, portraying him as a candidate who will increase the chances former President Donald Trump is reelected.\nThe Natural Resources Defense Council, a climate advocacy group where Kennedy previously served as senior attorney for 28 years, is planning to run a full-page advertisement in newspapers through its political arm in six battleground states on Sunday. According to a copy of the ad obtained by CNN, the group is calling on Kennedy to drop out of the race to prevent him from being a spoiler for Trump, who they call 'the single worst environmental president our country has ever had.'\n'We have spent our careers fighting to protect the planet and its people. As current and former leadership and board members of the NRDC Action Fund, as well as former colleagues of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., we have one message for him: Honor our planet, drop out,' the ad reads.\n'In nothing more than a vanity candidacy, RFK Jr. has chosen to play the role of election spoiler to the benefit of Donald Trump \u2013 the single worst environmental president our country has ever had,' the ad continues.\nThe ad is expected to run in newspapers in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina.\nIn a separate effort, a dozen environmental organizations have penned an open letter urging voters to reject Kennedy's climate proposals, attacking his views on climate and warning his candidacy could help Trump win re-election and lead to 'the complete erosion of vital environmental and social gains made to date.'\n'Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is not an environmentalist. He is a dangerous conspiracy theorist and science denier whose agenda would be a disaster for our communities and the planet,' the letter reads. 'He may have once been an environmental attorney, but now RFK Jr. is peddling the term \u2018climate change orthodoxy' and making empty promises to clean up our environment with superficial proposals. The truth is, by rejecting science, what he offers is no different than Donald Trump.'\nThe New York Times first reported the environmental groups' actions.\nKennedy has leaned on his previous work with the NRDC and other environmental groups throughout his presidential campaign and has pledged to be the 'best environmental president in American history.' He has opposed parts of the Inflation Reduction Act passed during the Biden administration and has criticized Trump for rolling back environmental regulations.\nIn an interview with the New York Times on Thursday, Kennedy said environmental organizations are 'making a mistake to settle for crumbs that have been given to us by the Biden administration.' He also pushed back on the argument his candidacy would help Trump defeat Biden.\n'President Biden does not need my help to lose to Donald Trump,' Kennedy said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Aaron Pellish,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2107857015.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.509687,"_id":"3124322a1ec32f35c25834925dd55963"},{"title":"Biden administration tightlipped on Israel strike as US looks to maintain distance from decision","author":"Kevin Liptak","published_date":"2024-04-19 13:41:01","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/19/politics/us-reaction-israel-iran-strike","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"As Israel struck Iran overnight in what appeared to be a limited retaliation for last weekend's attack, the Biden administration adopted a tightlipped approach that reflected US officials' desire to\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 The Biden administration on Friday adopted a tightlipped approach that reflected US officials' desire to keep a level of distance from Israel's decision to strike back against Iran in what appeared to be a limited retaliation for last weekend's attack.\nIsrael has not commented on the strike, which was reported after three explosions were heard close to a major military airbase near Isfahan, state media reported early Friday morning. Iranian officials have said air defenses intercepted three drones and there were no reports of a missile attack.\nAmerican officials, who said they received warning from Israel of their plans, neither endorsed nor condemned the counterstrike. Israel had told the US on Thursday that it would be retaliating against Iran in the coming days, a senior US official said, adding that the US 'didn't endorse the response.'\nInstead, the US sought to make clear the choice was Israel's alone.\n'We were not involved,' one official said.\nIsrael informed the US through a variety of different channels ahead of its counterstrike against Iran, a person familiar with the matter said, adding that the warning did not come far in advance but did not catch the US off-guard. Speaking at the G7 foreign ministers' summit in Capri, the Italian foreign minister said the US received word from Israel at the 'last minute' of its plans to retaliate. The person familiar said the heads-up came on Thursday.\nIn his first public remarks since the counterstrike, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken declined nearly all comment on the matter while speaking at a G7 meeting in Capri, Italy. But, he said, G7 countries were committed to Israel's security while seeking to avoid the conflict from further spiraling.\n'We're also committed to de-escalating \u2013 to trying to bring this tension to a close,' Blinken said during a news conference.\nHe also said the countries shared 'a commitment to hold Iran to account.'\nEven though President Joe Biden counseled restraint last weekend in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 suggesting to his counterpart that because of the successful interception of nearly all of Iran's missiles and drones, a counterattack might not be necessary \u2013 there were few inside the White House who believed Israel would do nothing.\nInstead, officials believed what Israel was planning would be limited in scope and designed to send Iran a message. Officials had asked Israel for advance warning of the plans.\nSenior US officials spent a good part of Thursday in virtual conversations with top Israeli officials to discuss, among other topics, the attack last weekend by Iran and efforts to boost Israeli security.\nThe talks, led by US national security adviser Jake Sullivan, included Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, a top confidante of Netanyahu, and Israeli National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi.\nBefore expanding to a larger group of senior officials, the US and Israeli sides discussed in a smaller format last weekend's attack, as well as Biden's decision to apply new sanctions on Iran.\nThe sanctions, applied in conjunction with other Western nations, appeared designed to send a message that retaliating against Iran didn't necessarily require a military component.\nIt's not clear how much the Israeli side briefed the American officials on the plans to respond to the Iran attack.\nThe larger meeting focused on another topic of disagreement between the Biden administration and the Israeli government: plans for a ground invasion of Rafah to go after Hamas. The White House said afterward that American officials 'expressed concerns with various courses of action in Rafah, and Israeli participants agreed to take these concerns into account.'\nThe disagreement was an indication even amid the back-and-forth with Iran that the war against Hamas in Gaza continues apace \u2013 with negotiations for a ceasefire stalled and with a humanitarian crisis worsening.\nThe latest counterstrike adds to increasing tensions in the Middle East following Iran's unprecedented strike against Israel last weekend, in which it lobbed more than 300 drones and cruise missiles toward Israel, nearly all of which were intercepted. That attack was retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on Iran's embassy compound in Syria earlier this month.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Shania Shelton,CNN,Kevin Liptak","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/f89e3c1c-c954-46f3-8013-68f69fab3509.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.506113,"_id":"b208b44acc03ccaf407c427dfecb45c1"},{"title":"RFK Jr.'s onetime allies in environmental advocacy call for him to drop out","author":"Aaron Pellish","published_date":"2024-04-19 15:24:54","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/19/politics/robert-kennedy-natural-resources-defense-council","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Environmental groups are condemning Robert F.

Kennedy Jr.'s presidential bid and his environmental policy in new efforts on Friday, portraying him as a candidate who will increase the chances former President Donald Trump is reelected.\nThe Natural Resources Defense Council, a climate advocacy group where Kennedy previously served as senior attorney for 28 years, is planning to run a full-page advertisement in newspapers through its political arm in six battleground states on Sunday. According to a copy of the ad obtained by CNN, the group is calling on Kennedy to drop out of the race to prevent him from being a spoiler for Trump, who they call 'the single worst environmental president our country has ever had.'\n'We have spent our careers fighting to protect the planet and its people. As current and former leadership and board members of the NRDC Action Fund, as well as former colleagues of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., we have one message for him: Honor our planet, drop out,' the ad reads.\n'In nothing more than a vanity candidacy, RFK Jr. has chosen to play the role of election spoiler to the benefit of Donald Trump \u2013 the single worst environmental president our country has ever had,' the ad continues.\nThe ad is expected to run in newspapers in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina.\nIn a separate effort, a dozen environmental organizations have penned an open letter urging voters to reject Kennedy's climate proposals, attacking his views on climate and warning his candidacy could help Trump win re-election and lead to 'the complete erosion of vital environmental and social gains made to date.'\n'Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is not an environmentalist. He is a dangerous conspiracy theorist and science denier whose agenda would be a disaster for our communities and the planet,' the letter reads. 'He may have once been an environmental attorney, but now RFK Jr. is peddling the term \u2018climate change orthodoxy' and making empty promises to clean up our environment with superficial proposals. The truth is, by rejecting science, what he offers is no different than Donald Trump.'\nThe New York Times first reported the environmental groups' actions.\nKennedy has leaned on his previous work with the NRDC and other environmental groups throughout his presidential campaign and has pledged to be the 'best environmental president in American history.' He has opposed parts of the Inflation Reduction Act passed during the Biden administration and has criticized Trump for rolling back environmental regulations.\nIn an interview with the New York Times on Thursday, Kennedy said environmental organizations are 'making a mistake to settle for crumbs that have been given to us by the Biden administration.' He also pushed back on the argument his candidacy would help Trump defeat Biden.\n'President Biden does not need my help to lose to Donald Trump,' Kennedy said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Aaron Pellish,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2107857015.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.504275,"_id":"db8c1708b9cba0d1869210bd95ee7dda"},{"title":"'We have our jury'","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-19 08:04:54","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/the-source-with-kaitlan-collins/episodes/9d261248-fdf8-11ee-8a5e-5b21d1ab37da","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"A rollercoaster day in court ends with a jury of peers now picked in the case of the people of the state of New York versus Donald Trump.

Read more CNN Opinion . CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Bill Maher recently said on his show that the 2024 election was going to be fought over two issues: immigration and abortion. The party that best navigates these cultural battlefields is likely to prevail in November.\nEach party has an advantage, the Democrats on abortion and the Republicans on immigration. Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, energized generations of conservative voters who felt deeply on the issue but were also outraged that courts had taken the question out of the democratic process.\nNow, it's abortion rights voters who are energized, fueled by states like Arizona that are putting in place draconian restrictions on abortion. With the margins small in many swing states, abortion could be the issue that brings out suburban women, who could tilt those states blue in November.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook On the other hand, the Republican Party is now led by former President Donald Trump, who \u2014 on this issue as on many others \u2014 is supremely opportunistic. Trump, of course, proudly supported abortion rights for years until he started flirting with a political career within the Republican Party, at which point he reversed course fully.\nNow that he sees it is politically problematic, he is shifting his stance once again. He has criticized Arizona's abortion ban and has pledged not to sign a national abortion ban if re-elected.\nIt might seem hard for him to backtrack; he has loudly taken credit for the repeal of Roe v. Wade and touted his anti-abortion credentials. But Trump seems able to say anything, and even do anything, without losing the cult-like following he has with Republican voters. He can appeal to the middle ground, certain that his base will stay with him.\nPresident Joe Biden, on the other hand, does not have the fanatical following that Trump does. He has constructed a coalition carefully appealing to different groups with specific policies. If he loses one of those groups, his team fears that the math will not add up come Election Day.\nBut he needs to risk it and get tougher on immigration. It has become a proxy for all kinds of issues where people feel that elites simply don't get the concerns of average people. And the concern is rooted in real facts on the ground.\nThe US has taken in huge numbers of immigrants over the last five decades. In 1970, foreign-born people made up 5.7% of the country. As of 2020, that number was 15.3%. And it's not just America. In Sweden, that number went from 6.6% in 1970 to 19.8% in 2020; in the UK, from 5.3% to 13.8%. As I note in my new book, 'Age of Revolutions,' the Western world has seen a wave of unprecedented migration. Considering the numbers and the cultural diversity of the immigrants, people have been remarkably tolerant.\nIn both the EU and the United States, gangs and cartels have recognized that they can game the asylum system by bringing in migrants who are moving for economic reasons but who apply for asylum, claiming that they are being persecuted at home \u2014 and thus get the right to stay, have legal hearings and eventually work. Last fiscal year, nearly a million people applied for asylum in the US. In the EU last year, that number was more than 1.1 million.\nThe waves of recent migrants have produced problems as anyone on the ground can confirm, from New York City to El Paso to Stockholm. Sweden today is home to one of the highest gun crime death rates in Europe. And it is not a coincidence that its second largest political party is one that traces its roots to World War II-era fascism.\nThe Biden administration has made the case that it has put in place a set of well-crafted policies to limit asylum-seekers, that it needs Congressional action to do more and that Republicans want this problem to fester so that they can reap its electoral benefits. (They even tried to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on utterly bogus charges. The Democratic-majority Senate quickly put a stop to that effort.) All true.\nBut Biden must show he can fight. He should declare a national security emergency, send the National Guard to the border, work with Congress to suspend the asylum process and propose a new one that basically makes it impossible to get asylum if you just show up at the border. Many will scream, and it will all be challenged in court. But it will signal that Biden is taking the problem seriously.\nBill Clinton often says that the American people don't always need you to succeed, but they want to catch you trying. Joe Biden needs to be caught trying to solve the immigration crisis.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Fareed Zakaria","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2147862639-20240419041936989.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@CNNOpinions","_score":6.497088,"_id":"33be269bd1502c81ff09c7985ae297d6"},{"title":"Trump trial judge: 'we now have our jury'","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-19 02:30:22","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/the-situation-room-with-wolf-blitzer/episodes/ac84cbe4-a9bb-11ee-bc19-47581541eab4","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"We take you inside the courtroom from gavel to gavel in the Trump hush money cover up case.

This time out, in her first House reelection bid, Republican megadonor Jeffrey Yass is bankrolling a super PAC attacking Lee and boosting her primary challenger, Edgewood Councilmember Bhavini Patel.\nIn an interview, Lee told CNN she had been 'bracing for this moment' since her last run and trusted that her consistency, as a candidate and on the major issues, would see her through to another term.\n'I put out there who I am because I am a very honest politician,' Lee said. 'I'm not obfuscating, I'm not obscuring parts of me. I'm not hiding one hand when I campaign. I'm telling people precisely what my values are.'\nLee is, indeed, widely considered the prohibitive favorite in Tuesday's Democratic primary. In addition to left-wing groups and leaders, such as New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who will campaign with her this weekend, Lee has the support of both commonwealth senators, Bob Casey, who's also up for reelection this year, and John Fetterman. Her top local allies include Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey and Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato, a friend who, like Lee, won her first race in 2018 for the state legislature against a well-known incumbent. The first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania, Lee has also cultivated a working relationship with the White House \u2013 President Joe Biden made a point of shouting her out last week during a campaign stop in Pittsburgh.\nBut the race for the Democratic nomination in Pennsylvania's 12th District is as notable for the people and groups that are largely sitting it out as those more deeply involved.\nIn 2022, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and its affiliated super PAC, United Democracy Project, along with Democratic Majority for Israel, spent remarkable sums \u2013 for a primary in a safe blue district \u2013 attempting to block Lee's path to what was an open seat. This time around, despite AIPAC and DMFI both promising to invest heavily in defeating candidates they deem insufficiently pro-Israel, the groups have been absent from the district's airwaves.\nTheir decision to effectively skip the contest, which many progressives expected to be a priority for pro-Israel groups, has frustrated some moderates upset by Lee's position on Israel's war in Gaza. (She called early on for a ceasefire and supports conditioning US military aid to Israel.) But pro-Israel political groups, according to multiple sources familiar with their thinking, ultimately backed off over concerns about Patel's low profile and Lee's strong polling. Lee's support for most of Biden's domestic agenda and willingness to occasionally work across party lines also played a role, they said, along with a grudging acknowledgement that she has proven sensitive to some of their concerns.\n'She's been forced to make some compromises. Certainly not as many as we would like, but some compromises with the pro-Israel community,' one pro-Israel strategist told CNN, noting Lee canceled an appearance at a fundraiser for the Council on American-Islamic Relations amid criticism of other scheduled speakers.\nAsked about their decision to stay on the sidelines in Pennsylvania, AIPAC spokesperson Marshall Wittmann did not specifically address the campaign in the 12th, though he promised robust involvement in other races. A United Democracy Project spokesperson declined to comment.\n'We are already involved in several races, and we will be engaged in additional campaigns where we can have the greatest impact,' Wittmann said. 'By the end of this election year, the voice of the pro-Israel movement will definitely be heard.'\nThe issue has particular resonance, though, in the Pittsburgh area, home to both a large Jewish community and the country's deadliest antisemitic attack, when a gunman in 2018 killed 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue. Those anxieties spiked again after Hamas' brutal October 7 raid into Israel. Patel criticized Lee's immediate response to the attack, accusing her opponent of going AWOL.\n'You know what I would be doing after October 7? I would've come straight back home; I would've been present in my community,' Patel said. 'There were rallies and visuals that were organized here at home. She was nowhere to be found.'\nLee called that claim an 'intentional mischaracterization' of her work.\n'There's a difference between campaigning and being actually present. And the reality is that she's campaigning right now,' Lee said of Patel. 'The assertion that we weren't present or that we did not do our due diligence to earnestly represent them is a mischaracterization. And she knows that we've done that.'\nMark Mellman, the founder of Democratic Majority for Israel, which spent big against Lee alongside AIPAC two years ago, doubled down on his past criticism, but also acknowledged Lee's strength as a candidate.\n'Summer Lee's always been a very talented politician, but she has clearly demonstrated herself to be opposed to a strong US-Israel relationship,' Mellman told CNN. 'There's no question about that either.'\nDespite some of the usual suspects choosing not to spend, Patel's campaign, which kicked off days before Hamas' October 7 attack, has not struggled for cash. She raised more than $300,000 in the last quarter of 2023 \u2013 a decent figure for such a little-known candidate. Lee pulled in roughly $1 million over the same period and nearly $2.3 million for the cycle. Patel's overall reported haul is about $600,000, though she entered the race with a shorter runway.\nBoth candidates are also enjoying significant air cover from outside groups \u2013 though the sources of those funds are very different. A coalition of progressive groups \u2013 led by the Working Families Party, along with Emgage PAC and Justice Democrats \u2013 have put more than $600,000 into the race on Lee's behalf. Patel's outside support has largely come from one very rich and, in most Democratic circles, unpopular individual: Yass, the GOP billionaire with close ties to former and potentially future President Donald Trump.\nThe Pennsylvania-based co-founder of Susquehanna International Group, Yass has already spent millions this election cycle. But his support for a Democrat, Patel, has garnered the most attention \u2013 at least for now \u2013 in large part because he effectively uses Moderate PAC, which has invested more than $600,000 in opposing Lee, to press his interests.\n'This being a \u2018D +8 district,' we saw the potential for a Republican to come steal the seat,' Moderate PAC President Ty Strong told CNN. 'So our calculus was trying to get a more moderate Democrat, that represents the district, in that seat before we lose the seat. And before she does any more things that go against the wishes and the outlook of the people she represents.'\nPatel has denounced Yass and Trump. In an interview with CNN, she insisted she has never sought Yass' support and, ultimately, believes it has benefited Lee.\n'I have zero control over outside spending in this race,' Patel said. 'And I think any sort of conversation that takes away from my opponent's voting record and her inability to actually represent the values of this region, I think, again, is just deflecting.'\nPatel's campaign enjoys a decent amount of local Democratic support, though none with the ability to make headlines \u2013 or provoke liberal anger \u2013 like Yass, whose involvement also soured some pro-Israel groups on the race.\n'To go in as a well-known, right-wing Republican billionaire with a personal PAC and try and affect this race, frankly, taints everybody who might be interested in helping Patel and defeating Summer Lee,' the pro-Israel strategist said.\nAsked why he thought the pro-Israel groups were not joining his cause, Strong, the Moderate PAC leader, said Patel's lack of name recognition and internal polling numbers 'scared a lot of people away,' particularly those who 'did not want to give (Lee) another feather in the cap.'\n'If someone had more name recognition or was a staffer in the White House or had a little bit more of a history in the Democratic Party, if there was a picture of Patel standing next to Joe Biden, I think she would've gotten a lot farther,' Strong said of the challenger, adding that the PAC was still able to 'move the needle' by criticizing Lee's record and offering an alternative.\nLee and her supporters view the story differently \u2013 and often argue that, even without spending big, the specter of AIPAC's involvement can change the fundamentals of a campaign.\n'Whether or not AIPAC or someone like them gets in your race, it's destabilizing,' Lee said. 'It makes candidates think differently about how they're going to run and who they're serving, whose values they're going to represent.'\nIn the final days of the race, Lee's campaign and its allies are trying to steer the focus to her performance on Capitol Hill, most notably the significant federal funds she's helped bring to the district.\n'Progressives are often accused of having these lofty values that they can't actualize. And I think Summer, along with the rest of \u2018The Squad,' has proven in this first race that they can do exactly that,' said Justice Democrats spokesperson Usamah Andrabi. 'A billion dollars in (to the district) in one Congress is an insane amount of money, and it's actually being delivered to the people and communities who need it.'\nProgressive leaders and other Lee allies are also keen to argue that, come November, it is Lee supporters Biden needs to turn out in big numbers to defeat Trump in this crucial, potentially decisive, battleground state.\n'President Biden needs to win Summer Lee voters. He needs to win progressives,' Andrabi said. 'And Western Pennsylvania is a progressive stronghold now.'\nPatel, for her part, argues that Lee is poised to be a drag on Biden in the general election. She pointed to what she described as Lee's 'performative obstructionism' in the House, where Lee has occasionally bucked Democratic leadership, and the congresswoman's support for an 'uncommitted' primary write-in campaign led by progressives critical of the administration's handling of Israel's war in Gaza \u2013 hoping to send a message to Biden that their votes should not be taken for granted.\n'When you look at the bigger picture and the alternative is Donald Trump, that's incredibly dangerous because our basic freedoms depend on getting President Biden reelected,' Patel said of Lee's alliance with the 'uncommitted' movement. 'If you claim to care about reproductive justice, LGBTQ rights, labor rights, then that means that you have to unequivocally be behind Biden because there is no other alternative to that.'\nModerate PAC echoed those criticisms in a recent television ad, which claimed that Lee 'is opposing President Biden' and, in a reprise of the 2022 campaign, highlighted a years-old tweet criticizing then-candidate Biden.\nFor her part, Lee insists she is confident the attacks will fall flat.\n'We're hearing (in the ads) from a very vocal minority,' she said, 'and we are representing a very resolute majority.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Gregory Krieg","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1255300017.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.4009304,"_id":"e10b15a86f22c0182e69208d3ddcdb1b"},{"title":"Trump eyes prospective jurors","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-16 17:25:32","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/inside-politics/episodes/4768c40a-a9a1-11ee-b3b9-976215a1b83e","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"First: Jury selection in the unprecedented criminal trial of former President Donald Trump continues.

We are committed to the security of our personnel and partners in the region. And we will not hesitate to take all necessary action to hold you accountable,' Biden said.\n'We're using Treasury's economic tools to degrade and disrupt key aspects of Iran's malign activity, including its (unmanned aerial vehicle) program and the revenue the regime generates to support its terrorism,' said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. 'We will continue to deploy our sanctions authority to counter Iran with further actions in the days and weeks ahead.'\n'Our actions make it harder and costlier at every turn for Iran to continue its destabilizing behavior,' she said.\nOver the weekend, Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones toward Israel in a retaliatory attack for an Israeli airstrike on a diplomatic compound in Damascus that killed senior Iranian military officials. Israel, with the help of the United States and other regional countries, intercepted most of the incoming fire.\nAfter the attack, Biden consulted with fellow Group of 7 leaders to condemn the attack and develop a diplomatic response, including developing new sanctions.\nBiden and other leaders have called on Israel to exercise restraint following the weekend attack, hoping to prevent a wider regional conflict. The US and other countries have said the successful interception of the Iranian barrage was ample demonstration of Israel's military superiority.\nIsrael, however, has not yet said how it will respond. The country's war cabinet has met periodically this week without announcing any definitive action.\nIn a phone call on Saturday evening, Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the US would not participate in offensive action against Iran. Instead, the White House has been clear it intended to take economic action against Tehran as punishment for the unprecedented attack on Israel.\nThursday's actions will augment what is already one of the most stringent regime of US sanctions. The US has long sought to squeeze Iranian officials and industries as a way to punish the regime for human rights abuses and to prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\nEarlier this week, Yellen did not rule out applying sanctions on Iranian oil exports. Doing so could risk the potential of higher gas prices and of angering China, a top buyer of Iranian oil.\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction.\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Kevin Liptak","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-04-13t233806z-760586938-rc2y57asx8kc-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-20240415194039062.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.3726306,"_id":"95054348c9326e1a9bbd55e4f6192a66"},{"title":"New: prosecutors unveil plan to cross-examine Trump","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-18 08:06:59","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/the-source-with-kaitlan-collins/episodes/30613060-fd31-11ee-a1a1-375738837a53","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Donald Trump's first criminal trial resumes in hours and CNN just got hold of new information dropped by the prosecution.

Kennedy Jr. are making an unusually strong showing in early polls of this fall's presidential race \u2013 a finding that not only highlights a strain of dissatisfaction with Joe Biden and Donald Trump but also adds further uncertainty to what is shaping up to be a close contest between them.\nAcross five national polls released in March and April \u2013 from Quinnipiac University, Fox News, Marquette Law School, NBC News and Marist College \u2013 Kennedy received an average of 13% support for his independent presidential bid when his name was explicitly included in the survey question, with independent candidate Cornel West and Green Party candidate Jill Stein taking an average of 3% each. Given the narrow margin between Trump and Biden, who are effectively deadlocked in many surveys, even a fraction of that support could prove crucial to the election's outcome.\nHistorical precedent, however, suggests that third-party and independent candidates' election performances rarely live up to their polling.\n'When people tell us that they're going to vote for a third-party candidate, they're actually telling us one of two things,' said Dan Cassino, the executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll, who has researched the overestimated support for such candidates in surveys. 'Some proportion are saying, \u2018I hate both of the major party candidates, and I'm going to illustrate that by saying that I'll vote for literally whoever you put in the third spot (whether I've heard of them or not).' Others are saying, \u2018I really like that third party candidate, and I'm going to vote for them!''\nGiven the relative unpopularity of this year's two major presidential candidates, Cassino noted, the first group \u2013 those who treat being polled as an opportunity to vent their discontent with the system \u2013 are likely to far outnumber those who are fully committed to backing a specific alternative. In a national CNN poll last year, 39% of voters who said they would support Kennedy for president also said, in a separate question, that they didn't know enough about the candidate to offer an opinion of him.\nBut finding the right questions to disentangle those sentiments is difficult, and past polling has frequently struggled to estimate the support for such challengers. In the 2014 midterms, most surveys overstated the eventual support for third-party candidates. But while pre-election polls that asked voters about third-party candidates by name tended to inflate their support, those that omitted them often underestimated it, according to data compiled by Joe Lenski, the executive vice president of Edison Research. Estimations of third-party support were less accurate further out from Election Day, the report also found.\nMore broadly, while the public have long expressed enthusiasm for new political alternatives as a concept, that fervor has rarely translated into traction for any specific movements. For more than a decade, Americans have told Gallup that the Republican and Democratic parties 'do such a poor job that a third major party is needed,' while continuing to vote overwhelmingly for major-party candidates in elections.\nEven in the 2008 president contest between two broadly liked candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, nearly half of registered voters said in Gallup's polling that they wished they had additional choices to pick from.\nPolling on third-party and independent candidates could be especially tricky to navigate this year, for a number of reasons:\nIn a recent Gallup poll, 29% of US adults said that neither Trump nor Biden would make a good president \u2013 still a distinct minority of the populace, but a slight uptick from 25% in the summer of 2020 \u2013 and significantly higher than the 8%-to-19% shares who said the same of the candidates in 2004, 2008 and 2012. (Gallup did not ask the question in 2016, another year that featured relatively unpopular major-party nominees in Trump and Hillary Clinton. Libertarian Gary Johnson took about 3% nationally in that contest, the best showing for a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1996).\nKennedy, who carries a storied surname, enjoys the sort of name recognition that most presidential challengers would envy. In the March Quinnipiac poll, 31% of registered voters said they hadn't heard enough about him to form an opinion, compared to 71% for West, and 69% for Stein. But other polling suggests a significant gap between awareness of his existence and deeper knowledge of his positions: In a December Monmouth poll, roughly half of registered voters said they hadn't heard anything about Kennedy's positions on public health issues such as Covid-19 and vaccines, with a similar share saying they weren't aware of Kennedy's support for unsupported 'claims that autism is linked to vaccines.'\nEach state has its own process for candidates hoping to appear on the ballot. While Kennedy has said he hopes to make the ballot across all 50 states and Washington, DC, it's possible that some voters now backing him or other independent candidates in national polls won't actually have the option to do so in their state this fall.\nFor decades, most public polling was conducted over the telephone by live interviewers. That gave respondents a chance to volunteer responses that weren't explicitly included by the pollsters \u2013 for instance, answering a question about their preference between two main candidates by offering up that they'd actually prefer a third one, or that they wouldn't vote at all.\nMany pollsters, however, have moved at least in part to conducting online surveys, making it more difficult to incorporate similarly off-the-cuff responses. Instead, pollsters generally have to make a clear-cut decision as to whether an option should be present or not. While neither mode of polling is inherently better or worse, the shift is a further complication in trying to compare current polling with what we've seen in the past.\nWhat's the best way of demonstrating this uncertainty? Cassino suggested starting with an experimental approach: asking half of a poll's respondents to choose between Biden, Trump and Kennedy, with the other half instead choosing between Biden, Trump and a different third-party candidate with little name recognition. The difference in support between the third options would then indicate the share of active support for Kennedy, rather than disgruntled respondents casting the equivalent of a protest vote.\nMany public pollsters, meanwhile, are currently asking two different questions about the general election \u2013 one naming just Biden and Trump, and another including additional candidates \u2013 and separately reporting the results of both. Polls are often described as providing snapshots in time of public sentiment. But even snapshots taken at identical moments can reveal different facets of their subjects, depending on the framing. That's a good reminder of the limits to how precisely polling can capture the current state of any race, let alone predict how it might evolve in the months to come.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Ariel Edwards-Levy","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2126505422-20240422202744911.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.257586,"_id":"7ef699294c871088a46fe5b97884398f"},{"title":"Senior White House official tapped to serve in important European ambassadorial role amid Ukraine concerns","author":"Priscilla Alvarez","published_date":"2024-04-18 20:21:50","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/18/politics/white-house-official-european-ambassadorial-role","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"President Joe Biden is tapping a senior White House official to serve as US ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a key body amid the ongoing war in Ukraine and at a\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 President Joe Biden is tapping a senior White House official to serve as US ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a key body amid the ongoing war in Ukraine and at a time when the US is seeking to project confidence about its support for Ukraine, according to an announcement from the White House.\nCurtis Ried, a longtime career foreign service officer who has served under two presidents at the White House, who currently serves as chief of staff and counselor of the White House National Security Council is being nominated for the post, CNN has learned.\nRied played a key role in resettling Afghans who worked for the federal government in the US following the withdrawal from Afghanistan, was involved in the administration's strategy related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine \u2014 and most recently, has taken the lead in shoring up humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Wade, the Supreme Court will scrutinize one of the marquee efforts by the Biden administration to preserve abortion access\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Two years after ending the national right to abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court will scrutinize one of the marquee efforts by the Biden administration to preserve abortion access in the post-Roe v. Wade era.\nIn a case being heard by the court Wednesday, the Biden administration is challenging Idaho's enforcement of its abortion ban in medical emergencies, putting a spotlight on what has been one of the most politically explosive flashpoints in the aftermath of Roe's demise.\nThe Justice Department maintains that federal law requires hospitals to offer abortions if necessary to stabilize the health of emergency room patients, even in states like Idaho that ban that procedure. At the time the lawsuit was filed, Attorney General Merrick Garland characterized the case as part of the department's promise to 'work tirelessly to protect and advance reproductive freedom' in the wake of Roe's reversal.\nThe lawsuit has proceeded somewhat under the radar and has been overshadowed by the other blockbuster abortion case at the Supreme Court this year, concerning the federal regulations for abortion pills. Yet, the Idaho case could yield the most significant ruling from the court on abortion since the 2022 Roe reversal and one that could further elevate an issue Democrats want front and center in the 2024 election this November.\nIdaho argues that the Biden administration is trying to retrofit the federal law known as EMTALA \u2013 or the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act \u2013 to 'create a nationwide abortion mandate in hospital emergency rooms.'\nIdaho's abortion law has a narrow exemption for abortions provided to save a pregnant woman's life. However, the Justice Department argues that federal law overrides state abortion bans that prohibit emergency room doctors from offering the procedure to women whose pregnancies are causing medical emergencies that are not yet life-threatening.\n'Many pregnancy complications do not pose a threat to the woman's life when she arrives at the emergency room \u2013 but delaying care until necessary to prevent her death could allow her condition to deteriorate, placing her at risk of acute and long-term complications,' the Justice Department told the high court in a brief.\nAnti-abortion advocates meanwhile hope the Supreme Court will use the case to rebuke what they say is an unlawful Biden administration effort to undermine its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson, the ruling that overturned Roe.\n'This is an opportunity for the Supreme Court to push back against the Biden administration's campaign of massive resistance to the Dobbs decision,' said Roger Severino, a vice president of domestic policy for the conservative Heritage Foundation.\nA bipartisan Congress enacted EMTALA in 1986 to address the issue of 'patient dumping,' the practice by hospitals to refuse emergency room care to patients, often uninsured, in order to save costs.\nThe Justice Department sued Idaho under the law just over a month after the Supreme Court's Dobbs ruling cleared the way for the state to enact a strict abortion ban, and within weeks the administration secured a lower court order blocking Idaho's abortion ban in scenarios of medical emergencies. Until the order was put on pause by higher courts, including the Supreme Court, it was the rare example of a successful action the Biden administration was able to take to try to mitigate the effects of Roe's reversal.\nIt is also a case that highlights what has been a particularly troubling narrative for the anti-abortion movement post-Dobbs: that abortion bans \u2013 even those with ostensible life-of-the-mother exemptions \u2013 are putting the health of pregnant women in jeopardy.\n'Those stories are hugely sympathetic to the public, to voters,' said Gretchen Borchelt, the vice president for reproductive rights and health at the National Women's Law Center, which is supporting the Biden administration in the case. 'I think that crystallizes for people the fallout of the Dobbs decision in a way that nothing else is.'\nAbortion on the ballot in AZ this November\n03:25 - Source: CNN\n03:25 - Source: CNN John Bursch, the vice president of appellate advocacy for the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, which is Idaho's co-counsel in the case, told CNN that it was a 'scare tactic' to claim that Idaho's ban did not adequately protect women facing complications from their pregnancy, as he sought to distance the case from abortion politics.\n'Protecting the mother's life is always possible when that's the only choice that you have,' he said. 'So, this case really isn't about that. And it's really not even about abortion, although the other side is trying to make it about that.'\n(Health care providers in Idaho have said that in the few months that the abortion ban has been in effect, it has prevented them from providing abortions to patients who were suffering pregnancy complications causing them organ failure and other severe conditions \u2013 including conditions that would threaten their future fertility.)\nBursch framed the case around the question of 'whether EMTALA was an intentional attempt by the federal government to take control of the state practice of medicine.'\n'And no one ever thought that before Dobbs,' he said.\nIn the other major abortion case on the docket this term, a challenge brought by anti-abortion doctors to how the federal government has regulated the abortion drug known as mifepristone, the justices in oral arguments indicated they were leaning towards rejecting the case because the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the suit.\n'Even if they kick out the mifepristone case on standing, to decide to make it harder for people get emergency abortion care is going to have huge ramifications for voters,' Borchelt said.\nIn a troubling sign for the administration in this case, the Supreme Court paused lower court rulings that partially blocked Idaho's abortion ban and agreed to take up the case before the lower courts had fully considered it on the merits. There were no public dissents to those moves.\nThe case could turn on how the justices read the term 'unborn child' in EMTALA. The term is referenced multiple times in the law, which includes scenarios in its definition of medical emergencies where the health of an unborn child is in serious jeopardy and transfers of patients in labor that would put the safety of their unborn child at risk are restricted.\nThe references to the 'unborn child' were added by Congress in 1989 to make clear the EMTALA's protections applied to women who showed up to hospitals because they were in labor or facing other pregnancy-related medical emergencies.\nSupreme Court briefs filed by Idaho point to the language to argue that EMTALA's 'text demands equal treatment for \u2018the unborn child.''\n'To say that a statute that requires the protection of the unborn somehow requires doctors to take their lives in emergency rooms, it's just nonsensical,' Bursch told CNN.\nThe Charlotte Lozier Institute, an anti-abortion think tank, said in a friend-of-the-court brief that EMTALA 'expressly protects the lives of unborn children' and that it requires hospitals 'to follow the two-patient paradigm to protect both the mother and her unborn child.'\n'The United States' attempt to diminish the \u2018unborn child's' life as secondary\u2014one that must be protected only if her mother's health is not threatened but loses all value if her mother's health is in jeopardy\u2014is atextual,' the brief said. 'Congress expected hospitals and physicians to preserve both lives wherever possible.'\nIdaho's opponents counter that the provisions in question were meant to ensure that ER patients whose pregnancies were in medical trouble would receive treatment for those complications, even if the women themselves did not face serious risks to their health or possible death.\n'I think it's incredibly dangerous, the implications of what the argument Idaho is trying to push, with respect to the term and the use of the unborn child in the statute,' said Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, the deputy director of the Reproductive Freedom Project of the ACLU, which filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case.\nAbortion rights advocates fear that, beyond just the dispute over Idaho's abortion ban, the conservative majority will issue a ruling that will encourage the anti-abortion movement to take more aggressive steps in their push towards fetal personhood.\n'We have this case for the court where they are going to be talking about what the term \u2018unborn child' means. And so even though it's going to be specific to EMTALA, and its definition there, what we're going to see is anti-abortion folks seize on that, policymakers seize on what the court says,' said Borchelt of the National Women's Law Center.\nBursch said it was 'laughable' to claim the case, depending on the court rules, could lay groundwork for fetal personhood and framed the case as being more about states' authority to regulate medicine within their borders.\n'This case is about whether EMTALA regulates that state's practice of medicine and overrides Idahoans' choice to preserve life,' Bursch said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Tierney Sneed","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-1405450341.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.147374,"_id":"5b35401823d797769dac2d604989b30d"},{"title":"Biden gives\u00a0Samsung\u00a0$6.4 billion in grants to boost Texas chip output","author":"Reuters","published_date":"2024-04-16 03:47:35","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/15/tech/us-southkorea-samsung-chips-hnk-intl/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The Biden administration will award up to $6.4 billion in grants to South Korea's Samsung Electronics to expand its chip production in central Texas as part of a broader effort to boost US chipmaking,\u2026","summary":"The Biden administration will award up to $6.4 billion in grants to South Korea's Samsung Electronics to expand its chip production in central Texas as part of a broader effort to boost US chipmaking, the Department of Commerce said on Monday.\nThe funding from the 2022 Chips and Science Act will support two chip production facilities, a research center and a packaging facility, in Taylor, Texas, the agency said, as previously reported by Reuters.\nIt will also enable Samsung to expand its Austin, Texas, semiconductor facility, Commerce Department Secretary Gina Raimondo added, while boosting chip output for the aerospace, defense and auto industries and bolstering national security, administration officials told reporters.\n'(These investments) will allow the US to once again lead the world, not just in semiconductor design, which is where we do now lead, but also in manufacturing, advanced packaging, and research and development,' Raimondo said.\nSamsung Electronics Co-CEO Kyung Kye Hyun said: 'To meet the expected surge in demand from US customers, for future products like AI chips, our fabs will be equipped for cutting-edge process technologies and help bring security to the US semiconductor supply chain.'\nSamsung said it expects to begin production in 2026.

The Biden appointee became the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.\nThere was less drama in the upper chamber, where the proceedings ended a few hours after they began following votes, mostly along party lines, to declare unconstitutional the two articles of impeachment against Mayorkas \u2013 one for 'willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law' and another for 'breach of public trust.' Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski was the lone Republican holdout, voting present on the first article.\nThe blink-and-you-missed it Senate trial marked the culmination of a mostly failed political gambit hatched by House Republicans seeking to cast the limelight on the Biden administration's handling of the southern border ahead of the general election. But the merits of the case they hoped to bring to the Senate were widely seen as lacking substance and, to some, a distraction from other election year messaging. House GOP claims that Mayorkas, the first Latino and immigrant to hold the job, committed high crimes and misdemeanors never passed muster with constitutional experts, who said the evidence against him failed to clear that high bar.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer opened the proceedings by offering a time agreement to Republicans that would have allowed a certain amount of floor debate and votes on trial resolutions and points of order before an eventual vote to dismiss the case.\nBut Republican Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri objected, saying he would not agree to a proposal that would have concluded the matter with the 'unprecedented' step of ending an impeachment case without a trial. Many Republicans wanted an agreement because it would have allowed them to make floor speeches targeting Democrats over the process and the situation at the border. Absent that, speeches would only have been allowed to those who got unanimous consent from their colleagues \u2013 an unlikely scenario given the political stakes of the moment.\nSchumer then made a motion to table, or kill, the first impeachment article because 'it does not allege conduct that rises to the level of a high crime or misdemeanor' as required in the Constitution. After several rounds of procedural votes, the Senate passed that motion 51-48 with one voting present, killing the first article of impeachment.\nAfter several more procedural votes, Schumer's motion to table the second article was also approved, killing the second article of impeachment by a party line vote of 51-49.\nThe House transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate on Tuesday and senators were sworn in as jurors Wednesday. It was highly doubtful that the chamber would vote to convict, which would require a two-thirds majority vote \u2013 an exceedingly high bar to clear.\nDemocrats had slammed the impeachment as a political stunt, saying that Republicans had no valid basis for the move and that policy disagreements were not a justification for the rarely used constitutional impeachment of a Cabinet official.\n'We want to address this issue as expeditiously as possible,' Schumer said in floor remarks on Tuesday. 'Impeachment should never be used to settle a policy disagreement.'\nHe added, 'Talk about awful precedents. This would set an awful precedent for Congress. Every time there's a policy agreement in the House, they send it over here and tie the Senate in knots to do an impeachment trial? That's absurd. That's an abuse of the process. That is more chaos.'\nA number of congressional Republicans, however, criticized the prospect of a quick dismissal or move to table.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that senators had a 'rare' and 'solemn' responsibility to consider the impeachment articles and said he would oppose any effort to table the articles.\n'As befits such a solemn and rare responsibility as convening a court of impeachment, I intend to give these charges my full and undivided attention,' he said.\nThe Kentucky Republican added, 'It would be beneath the Senate's dignity to shrug off our clear responsibility and fail to give the charges we'll hear today the thorough consideration they deserve. I will strenuously oppose any effort to table the articles of impeachment and avoid looking the Biden administration's border crisis squarely in the face.'\nAdditionally, some hard-right Republican senators were trying to find a way to force a full trial, but their efforts did not get enough traction to pass as procedural vote after procedural vote failed along party lines.\nRepublicans targeted Mayorkas as soon as they took control of the House, blaming the high number of border crossings on the Homeland Security secretary as the party faced pressure from its base to go after the Biden administration on a key campaign issue.\nMayorkas has pushed back against criticism of his leadership, and DHS has called the impeachment effort against him a baseless political attack.\nThe White House, for its part, had worked to flip the script, citing Republicans blocking a bipartisan border deal in the Senate as evidence that the party isn't serious about border security.\nWhite House and Homeland Security officials were in frequent communication over the course of the impeachment inquiry into Mayorkas, gaming out strategy and response as they publicly cast the trial as a political stunt. Since Republicans launched their effort to oust the Homeland Security secretary, Biden administration officials have maintained that Mayorkas planned to stay in the post, dismissing the GOP impeachment inquiry into the DHS chief as 'meritless.'\nInstead, White House and Homeland Security officials deployed a split-screen strategy, like casting the House majority's proceedings as a waste of time while Mayorkas worked with senators to strike a border deal.\nAfter months of negotiations, Senate Republicans earlier this year blocked that major bipartisan border deal that would have marked a tough change to immigration law and would have given the president far-reaching powers to restrict illegal migrant crossings at the southern border.\nThe deal faced a torrent of attacks from former President Donald Trump and top House Republicans.\nThe Department of Homeland Security and White House praised Senate Democrats for killing the impeachment proceedings.\n'Once and for all, the Senate has rightly voted down this baseless impeachment that even conservative legal scholars said was unconstitutional,' said Ian Sams, White House spokesperson for oversight and investigations. 'President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas will continue doing their jobs to keep America safe and pursue actual solutions at the border, and Congressional Republicans should join them, instead of wasting time on baseless political stunts while killing real bipartisan border security reforms.'\n'As he has done throughout more than 20 years of dedicated public service, Secretary Mayorkas will continue working every day to enforce our laws and protect our country,' added Mia Ehrenberg, a spokesperson for DHS. 'It's time for Congressional Republicans to support the Department's vital mission instead of wasting time playing political games and standing in the way of commonsense, bipartisan border reforms.'\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.

House Republicans voted to impeach Mayorkas in February over his handling of the southern border by a narrow margin after failing to do so on their first try.\n. House Republicans voted to impeach Mayorkas in February over his handling of the southern border by a narrow margin after failing to do so on their first try. Republicans targeted Mayorkas as soon as they took control of the House last year, blaming the high number of border crossings on the Homeland Security secretary as the party faced pressure from its base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue.\nMultiple constitutional experts, however, have said the evidence Republicans have put forward does not reach the high bar set by the US Constitution of high crimes and misdemeanors. Democrats have argued that the impeachment proceedings have been politically motivated and meritless.\nThe issue now moves to the Senate where Democratic senators \u2014 joined by some Republicans \u2014 have said they expect the chamber will move to dismiss the case before a full trial.\nSenators could be sworn in as jurors as soon as Wednesday if it does not get dismissed outright without holding a trial.\nThe tumultuous way the impeachment process against Mayorkas has played out has led many Republicans to grow even more skeptical about the prospects of impeaching Biden, arguably their top investigative target this Congress. House Republicans do not have the votes or concrete evidence to impeach Biden given their razor-thin majority, leaving that separate impeachment inquiry stalled.\nMayorkas has pushed back against criticism of his leadership, and DHS has called the impeachment effort against him a baseless political attack.\n'Despite warnings from fellow Republicans that this baseless impeachment effort \u2018distorts the Constitution,' House Republicans continue to ignore the facts and undermine the Constitution by wasting even more time on this sham impeachment in the Senate,' a DHS spokesperson said in a statement.\nRepublicans have targeted Mayorkas in an effort to attack Biden and his administration's handling of the southern border. With border crossings reaching record highs and US cities across the country struggling to manage the influx of migrants, immigration has been a political vulnerability for Biden .\n. But the White House is trying to flip the script, citing Republicans blocking a bipartisan border deal as evidence that the party isn't serious about border security.\nAfter months of negotiations, Senate Republicans blocked a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year that would have marked a tough change to immigration law and would have given the president far-reaching powers to restrict illegal migrant crossings at the southern border. The legislation was aimed at closing loopholes in the asylum process, limiting the use of parole for migrants and giving the president new authority to essentially shut down the border to migrants when attempted crossings got too high.\nThe deal faced relentless attacks from former President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, who said the bill would be dead on arrival in his chamber - if it ever made it out of the Senate. Trump, who has made immigration a key plank of his presidential campaign, suggested on Truth Social that approving additional resources for the border would make Republicans 'look bad.'\nReferring to the Mayorkas impeachment proceedings, White House counsel's office spokesman Ian Sams wrote in a memo, 'this effort is a complete waste of time that constitutional and legal experts have said is \u2018unconstitutional' and that even Senate Republicans have made clear they don't want to focus on.'\n'But the worst part is that extreme Republicans have promoted this silly, baseless stunt at the same time they have killed an actual bipartisan border security bill that would have addressed the challenges at the border and delivered needed resources to DHS,' he continued.\nWhen Johnson originally informed Schumer he would be sending the impeachment articles over to the Senate, he laid out why he believed a Mayorkas impeachment was justified. Johnson claimed that Mayorkas directed department employees to violate US immigration laws and argued that the administration's use of parole authority was unlawful.\nHouse Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green of Tennessee who led the House investigation into Mayorkas argued the secretary committed high crimes and misdemeanors that amount to impeachable offenses.\n'These articles lay out a clear, compelling, and irrefutable case for Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas' impeachment,' Green said in a statement provided to CNN. 'He has willfully and systemically refused to comply with immigration laws enacted by Congress. He has breached the public trust by knowingly making false statements to Congress and the American people, and obstructing congressional oversight of his department.'\nAnd he has cited Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, arguing that he has indicated Congress could 'employ the weapons of inter-branch warfare,' including impeachment, in light of a Supreme Court ruling that states could not challenge federal immigration law.\nDemocrats have slammed the impeachment effort, saying that policy disagreements are not a justification for the rarely used constitutional impeachment of a Cabinet official.\nLegal scholars have also poured cold water on the legal arguments Republicans are using to support their impeachment effort.\npoured cold water on the legal arguments Republicans are using to support their impeachment effort. Ross Garber, a Tulane University law professor who has represented many Republican officeholders as both the prosecution and defense in impeachment cases, told CNN that House Republicans have not presented evidence of impeachable offenses.\n'I think that what the House Republicans are asserting is that Secretary Mayorkas is guilty of maladministration,' Garber said. 'At least as framed right now, the charges don't rise to the level of a high crime or misdemeanor.'\nFormer DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff, who served under Republican President George W. Bush, wrote in an op-ed, 'as a former federal judge, U.S. attorney and assistant attorney general \u2014 I can say with confidence that, for all the investigating that the House Committee on Homeland Security has done, they have failed to put forth evidence that meets the bar.'\nConstitutional law expert Jonathan Turley, who has been called by Republicans to serve as a witness in hearings, said: 'There is no current evidence he is corrupt or committed an impeachable offense.' More than two dozen law professors wrote in an open letter that impeaching Mayorkas would be 'utterly unjustified as a matter of constitutional law.'\nQuestions remain over Senate trial The question now for Senate Democratic leadership is what a trial will look like and how exactly they will handle the impeachment articles.\nWhile Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has not specified exactly how he plans to handle the trial procedurally, the Senate could pass a motion to dismiss or table the articles on a simple majority vote on Thursday, the same day senators are sworn in. But some hard-right Republican senators are trying to find a way to force a full trial.\nSchumer has previously said that they will wrap up the impeachment trial 'as quickly as possible,' but he did not say if he will move to dismiss or table the articles.\nEven if the Senate does not vote to quickly dismiss, it is highly doubtful the chamber would vote to convict Mayorkas, which would require a two-thirds majority vote \u2013 an exceedingly high bar to clear.\nSenate Majority Whip Dick Durbin noted that he thinks it will be over 'quickly,' and that several Republicans have indicated to him that they don't support convicting Mayorkas.\n'I'm not sure how Chuck's going to approach it. There's two or three procedural opportunities,' he told CNN's Manu Raju. 'I think it will be done quickly. I've talked to some Republicans who candidly don't \u2013 they don't take it very seriously.'\nRepublican Whip John Thune said that Senate Democrats running for reelection in red states would be in a 'difficult position' if they vote to dismiss impeachment charges against Mayorkas when that trial gets underway.\nVoting to dismiss would make Democrats appear they are turning a 'deaf ear and blind eye' to the crisis at the border, he said.\nHe said he expects a 'large majority' of Republicans to vote to have a full trial. But he also acknowledged that it's unlikely all Republicans will vote together on that question and that some Republicans will join Democrats to dismiss the case.\nBut he also acknowledged that it's unlikely all Republicans will vote together on that question and that some Republicans will join Democrats to dismiss the case.

House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, said he thinks it was a transformative moment for Johnson as a leader, adding that the speaker's stock in the conference has gone up even as he faces the threat of an ouster from a minority of members. 'I have tremendous respect. ... He had a learning curve, but at the end of the day, he knew what the right thing to do was,' McCaul said. Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois was blunt when asked whether he had a new respect and view of the speaker than he did two weeks ago. 'I guess I do. The old adage is it's never too late to do the right thing. We tested that,' Quigley said. 'I think we build on this. ... We have a lot of challenges.

'Three of our primary adversaries, Russia, and Iran, and China, are working together and they're being aggressors around the globe,' Johnson said. 'They're a global threat to our prosperity and our security. Their advance threatens the free world, and it demands American leadership. We turn our backs right now, the consequences could be devastating.' 21 min ago From CNN's Priscilla Alvarez The White House on Saturday clinched urgent foreign aid after a monthslong saga that involved starts and stops in Congress and was momentarily upended by one of the most politically vulnerable issues for President Joe Biden: border security. The ask for additional aid to Ukraine, among other priorities, dates to October, when the White House put forward its national security supplemental funding request. Over the last several months, Biden has framed the need to provide additional funds to the war-torn country as a national security priority, warning that no ground should be ceded to Russia. More recently, US officials attributed losses on the battlefield in Ukraine to the lack of additional assistance from the United States. In February, for example, the White House laid the blame for Ukraine's withdrawal from the key town of Avdiivka squarely at the feet of Republicans in Congress. Funding for Ukraine was also a recurring topic of discussion between Biden and global leaders as the US sought to reaffirm its leadership on the world stage \u2014 a theme echoed in the president's statement Saturday. 'Today, members of both parties in the House voted to advance our national security interests and send a clear message about the power of American leadership on the world stage. At this critical inflection point, they came together to answer history's call, passing urgently-needed national security legislation that I have fought for months to secure,' Biden said. 32 min ago TikTok criticized the House's passage of a bill that could ban the app in the US. \"It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement Saturday. 41 min ago From CNN's Samantha Waldenberg President Joe Biden speaks at a campaign event in Philadelphia on Thursday. Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters/File President Joe Biden said in a statement Saturday that the House passage of foreign aid bills sends a 'clear message' about America's leadership to the globe. 'Today, members of both parties in the House voted to advance our national security interests and send a clear message about the power of American leadership on the world stage. At this critical inflection point, they came together to answer history's call, passing urgently-needed national security legislation that I have fought for months to secure,' Biden said. 'I urge the Senate to quickly send this package to my desk so that I can sign it into law and we can quickly send weapons and equipment to Ukraine to meet their urgent battlefield needs,' he added. 17 min ago From CNN's Tamar Michaelis in Jerusalem Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked the US House for passing the Israel aid bill. 'The US Congress just overwhelmingly passed a much appreciated aid bill that demonstrates strong bipartisan support for Israel and defends Western civilization. Thank you friends, thank you America!' Netanyahu said on social media. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz also thanked the House, saying he hopes the measure will pass in the US Senate soon 'with strong bipartisan support.' Posting on X, Katz said, 'Thank you @SpeakerJohnson for your leadership which led the efforts to pass the Israel aid package in the House of Representatives today. And thank you Minority Leader @RepJeffries for supporting it.The vote on the Israel aid package with an overwhelming bipartisan support proves the strong ties and strategic partnership between Israel and the U.S. and sends a strong message to our enemies.

On Wednesday morning, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee fired back on social media \u2014 in part by attacking Kimmel for something Kimmel didn't do.\nTrump, calling Kimmel 'stupid,' blasted the comedian for his general performance as host of the Academy Awards in March and specifically for having read aloud, from the stage, Trump's mid-show social media post criticizing how he was doing. Then Trump claimed that Kimmel had read out the post 'right before he stumbled through announcing the biggest award of all, \u2018Picture of the Year.''\nTrump continued: 'It was a CLASSIC CHOKE, one of the biggest ever in show business, and to top it off, he forgot to say the famous and mandatory line, \u2018AND THE WINNER IS.' Instead he stammered around as he opened the envelope.'\nFacts First : Trump's claim is false. Kimmel wasn't the person who delivered an unusual, abrupt performance in announcing the Best Picture award won by 'Oppenheimer '; that was actually legendary actor Al Pacino , whom Kimmel had introduced. And the current standard Oscars announcement phrase Pacino neglected to say is 'and the Oscar goes to,' not 'and the winner is' as was the standard prior to 1989.\nFacts First: Trump's claim is false.

Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, and Sen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, demanded to know why the VA has paused hiring and planned to cut 10,000 full-time jobs despite veterans across the nation experiencing long wait times for care.\nTheir letter, obtained by CNN, called VA's apparent 'zero growth' policy a 'drastic' and 'shortsighted' decision. Though the VA told the committee that critical staff and some others would be exempt, Tester and Moran wrote that has not been the case.\nThe letter, which noted that the VA last year underwent a hiring spree and had a record number of clinical appointments, stated that congressional staff has heard from VA employees and others that various VA locations have rescinded job offers for mental health providers and stalled hiring of housing case managers, among other issues.\n'They're cutting front-line people who see patients in the clinic,' a VA employee with knowledge of the situation who was not authorized to speak and feared retaliation told CNN. 'They refuse to put things in writing. \u2026 We have no idea why they are making this move.'\nThe VA Under Secretary for Health, Dr. Shereef Elnahal, responding to a question about staffing decisions at a news conference last month, said the VA's workforce could be cut by 10,000 positions through 'attrition and voluntary separation.' He added those cuts would primarily involve positions that 'are not directly veteran facing.'\n'So, we're talking about more managerial, programmatic individuals, supervisory roles that aren't necessarily over the point of care directly,' Elnahal said. 'And so, we think we have the room to do that.'\nAsked about the senators' letter, VA press secretary Terrence Hayes said in a statement that the VA continues to hire in key areas including mental health care, that there will be 'no hiring freeze or layoffs' and that the agency 'has the nationwide staffing we need to deliver world-class care.'\nBut the senators' letter stated that some veterans across the US continue to face long waits for care and that VA's own metrics show a pattern of 'meaningful decline' in average wait times for appointments, including primary, specialty and mental health care.\n'It is unclear how VA's \u2018zero growth' strategy comports with this reality,' wrote the senators, who expressed concern 'that such a significant shift in policy could not only have long-term impacts on the Department's ability to deliver timely, high-quality care but also negatively impact its ability to recruit and retain health care professionals.'\nHayes, the VA spokesperson, disputed that, saying average wait times are either stable or trending down for VA services nationwide.\nAsked about staffing issues at a congressional hearing last week, McDonough said the federal budget has forced 'difficult choices,' though he said the VA is 'well positioned to provide care.'\nThe VA has been touting in recent news releases greater access to care for veterans through night and weekend clinics as well as 'historic enrollment' in VA healthcare driven by the PACT Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022 and which expanded health care benefits for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.\nThe VA has long been plagued by delays in health care. A decade ago, the Obama administration's then-VA secretary, Eric Shinseki, resigned following revelations of sometimes deadly delays for veterans waiting for care at VA facilities.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Curt Devine","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-ap20233569193779.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":5.891895,"_id":"c7fe27567c46dd5de08d8e6b7423c484"},{"title":"Greene and Massie rail on Johnson, say more Republicans will join their effort to oust him after speaking to their constituents","author":"Kaanita Iyer","published_date":"2024-04-20 16:04:10","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/house-vote-ukraine-israel-taiwan-aid-04-20-24/h_512d7143707002a0ddf90223200bf038","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"GOP Reps.

Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie railed on House Speaker Mike Johnson and his handling of the foreign aid bills, despite deciding not to move to oust the speaker Saturday. Greene argued that more House Republicans will support their effort after going home over recess and speaking with their constituents. 'I'm actually gonna let my colleagues go home and hear from their constituents, because I think people have been too obsessed with voting for foreign wars and the murder industry here in America to actually understand how angry Americans are,' the Georgia Republican told CNN. Massie, a Kentucky Republican, added that they are giving Johnson the chance to resign, although the speaker has insisted he won't. Massie added he believes a motion to vacate \u2014 a rarely used procedural tool to remove the House speaker \u2014 will happen eventually. 'I'm pretty sure one will come to the floor, if he doesn't resign at some point, but we're trying to avoid that,' he said. Greene insisted their effort to oust Johnson is gaining momentum, adding that the speaker is \"a lame duck.\" Rep. Paul Gosar Friday signed on to the effort Friday, becoming the third member to do so. 'If we had the vote today in our conference, he would not be speaker today. He's already a lame duck, he can't raise money, everyone knows it,' Greene claimed. 3 hr 22 min ago From CNN's Morgan Rimmer House Speaker Mike Johnson talks to the press after the House passed four foreign aid bills at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on Saturday. Drew Angerer/AFP/Getty Images Several swing-district House Republicans praised Speaker Mike Johnson for pushing forward with the foreign aid bills and attacked his detractors. Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro, a vulnerable New York freshman lawmaker, told CNN's Manu Raju that after speaking with his constituents, 'It is clear to me that there are moments in time where we must do the right thing, and today we did that.' He defended Johnson for waiting for months to hold votes on aid for critical allies Israel and Ukraine, saying the speaker had to build bipartisan consensus in \"a very complicated Congress.\" Molinaro said he hoped Johnson's detractors do not attempt to oust him, warning them that Congress is not 'only supposed to do what they want.' Rep. Jen Kiggans, a vulnerable Republican from Virginia, also praised the speaker. 'I'm very proud of Mike Johnson. I know what he did today was difficult, but there was a lot of us standing by him, and you saw great bipartisan effort today. And that's what Americans want to see,' she said. Kiggans criticized the GOP hardliners who have pushed for Johnson's ouster over the foreign aid package, saying, \"It frustrates me when we have members of our conference who are isolationist; who don't believe in standing with our allies.' 3 hr 37 min ago From CNN's Morgan Rimmer Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer took procedural steps Saturday for the Senate to begin voting on the House-passed foreign aid package Tuesday afternoon. The chamber was supposed to be in recess next week, but it is coming back to pass this legislation. 3 hr 43 min ago From CNN's Michelle Shen Daniel Ingram protests outside the Capitol in Washington, DC, on Saturday. Michelle Shen/CNN As members of Congress streamed out of the Capitol after passing an aid bill to Israel, a crowd of protesters with loudspeakers shouted, \"Congress, Congress you can't hide, we charge you with genocide!\" The bill also includes aid to Gaza, but the protesters represent the divisive nature of providing support to Israel amid the humanitarian disaster in Gaza. Marione Ingram protests outside the Capitol. Michelle Shen/CNN Marione Ingram, 88, and her husband, Daniel Ingram, 93, were among the protesters. Marione is a survivor of the Holocaust and large-scale bombing operations in Germany during World War II. \"I am now reliving my childhood every time I see anything that's happening in Gaza. And for the last over six months, my husband and I and a few others have been at the White House every single day in the afternoon trying to get our government to stop fighting,\" she said. Pro-Palestinian protesters have been resorting to ever-louder tactics \u2013 such as shutting down the Golden Gate Bridge during Monday's morning commute \u2013 as they try to shake US support for Israel and draw attention to the crisis in Gaza, where more than 34,000 people have died since the war began, according to the Ministry of Health there. 4 hr ago From CNN's Lauren Fox and Alison Main A number of lawmakers who backed the aid packages today said their views on House Speaker Mike Johnson as a leader changed after the speaker put bills on the floor despite a threat against his job. House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, said he thinks it was a transformative moment for Johnson as a leader, adding that the speaker's stock in the conference has gone up even as he faces the threat of an ouster from a minority of members. 'I have tremendous respect. ... He had a learning curve, but at the end of the day, he knew what the right thing to do was,' McCaul said. Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois was blunt when asked whether he had a new respect and view of the speaker than he did two weeks ago. 'I guess I do. The old adage is it's never too late to do the right thing. We tested that,' Quigley said. 'I think we build on this. ... We have a lot of challenges. It's good news that today at a critical time, we did act cohesively as a legislature.' GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said he always thought Johnson would get there but a turning point came when the speaker was briefed that passing Ukraine aid by April was essential. 'He's always said he was for Ukraine, and I've always believed him,' Bacon said. 'I think he just came to the conclusion we couldn't wait any longer. He was briefed that we had to get this done in April or bad things were going to happen to Ukraine.\" 3 hr 31 min ago From CNN's Kit Maher House Speaker Mike Johnson talks to the press after the House passed four foreign aid bills at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on Saturday. Drew Angerer/AFP/Getty Images Moments after the House passed four foreign aid bills totaling $95 billion, Speaker Mike Johnson said he had not spoken to Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries about potentially saving his job if his hardline colleagues move to oust him. 'I don't walk around this building being worried about a motion to vacate,' Johnson said, referring to a procedural tool to remove the House speaker. 'I have to do my job. ... I've done here what I believe to be the right thing to allow the House to work its will. And as I've said, you do the right thing, and you let the chips fall where they may.' Walking toward his office, Johnson told reporters that he believes he will still be speaker in November and that he hasn't spoken to any of his detractors Saturday. Johnson said the 'world is destabilized' and 'a tinderbox,' stressing the importance of the bills' passage in a 'dangerous time.' 'Three of our primary adversaries, Russia, and Iran, and China, are working together and they're being aggressors around the globe,' Johnson said. 'They're a global threat to our prosperity and our security. Their advance threatens the free world, and it demands American leadership. We turn our backs right now, the consequences could be devastating.' 4 hr 20 min ago From CNN's Priscilla Alvarez The White House on Saturday clinched urgent foreign aid after a monthslong saga that involved starts and stops in Congress and was momentarily upended by one of the most politically vulnerable issues for President Joe Biden: border security. The ask for additional aid to Ukraine, among other priorities, dates to October, when the White House put forward its national security supplemental funding request. Over the last several months, Biden has framed the need to provide additional funds to the war-torn country as a national security priority, warning that no ground should be ceded to Russia. More recently, US officials attributed losses on the battlefield in Ukraine to the lack of additional assistance from the United States. In February, for example, the White House laid the blame for Ukraine's withdrawal from the key town of Avdiivka squarely at the feet of Republicans in Congress. Funding for Ukraine was also a recurring topic of discussion between Biden and global leaders as the US sought to reaffirm its leadership on the world stage \u2014 a theme echoed in the president's statement Saturday. 'Today, members of both parties in the House voted to advance our national security interests and send a clear message about the power of American leadership on the world stage. At this critical inflection point, they came together to answer history's call, passing urgently-needed national security legislation that I have fought for months to secure,' Biden said. 4 hr 31 min ago TikTok criticized the House's passage of a bill that could ban the app in the US. \"It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement Saturday. 4 hr 39 min ago From CNN's Samantha Waldenberg President Joe Biden speaks at a campaign event in Philadelphia on Thursday. Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters/File President Joe Biden said in a statement Saturday that the House passage of foreign aid bills sends a 'clear message' about America's leadership to the globe.

'I urge the Senate to quickly send this package to my desk so that I can sign it into law and we can quickly send weapons and equipment to Ukraine to meet their urgent battlefield needs,' he added.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Kaanita Iyer,Shania Shelton,Isabelle D'Antonio","media":"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/230118162135-01-us-capitol-0104-super-tease.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":5.888438,"_id":"ec39877dff05f3b1e3c295ae58d37a58"},{"title":"Pro-Trump network OAN and Smartmatic settle 2020 election defamation case","author":"Marshall Cohen","published_date":"2024-04-16 16:27:37","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/media/oan-smartmatic-settlement","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Voting technology company Smartmatic and the far-right network One America News said Tuesday they have reached a confidential settlement over a defamation lawsuit stemming from the outlet's lies about\u2026","summary":"Voting technology company Smartmatic and the far-right network One America News said Tuesday that they had settled a defamation lawsuit stemming from the outlet's lies about the 2020 election.\n'The case has been resolved pursuant to a confidential agreement,' OAN attorney Chip Babcock told CNN.\nBoth parties declined to share details about the settlement.\nThe case against OAN was one of a spate of lawsuits filed against right-wing outlets in the aftermath of the election. In the wake of the 2020 presidential contest, pro-Donald Trump outlets spread lies wrongfully suggesting President Joe Biden had not been legitimately elected president.\nSmartmatic filed its lawsuit against OAN in 2021, alleging that the right-wing conspiracy network 'victimized' the company and spread lies about its role in the 2020 election to 'increase viewership and revenue.'\nThe development comes one year after Fox News reached a massive settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, another voting technology company that was similarly smeared in 2020. Fox News paid more than $787 million to end that lawsuit, becoming the largest publicly known defamation settlement in US history.\nSmartmatic still has pending lawsuit against Fox News, the smaller conservative channel Newsmax, and several pro-Trump figures who also pushed lies about the election.\nOAN has established itself as perhaps the most extreme of the pro-Trump cable news outlets. And its reporters have sometimes crossed the line into right-wing politicking.\nThe little-watched network has regularly given airtime to baseless conspiracy theories that support Trump, most prominently about the 2020 election.\nThe channel worked closely with Russian operatives on a propaganda-style documentary during Trump's first impeachment in 2019 over allegations he pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. One of its correspondents, who is also an attorney, even worked with Trump's legal team to subvert the 2020 election results.\nOAN settled a defamation suit in September with former Dominion executive Eric Coomer, whose case revealed how the network worked with former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell and others to lie about the election.\nDirecTV dropped the far-right network from its lineup in 2022, dealing a significant blow to the outlet, hitting the network's viewership and revenue.\nIn its lawsuit, Smartmatic alleged OAN hosts and guests made dozens of false claims about the company's role in the 2020 election. Personalities on the network repeatedly said Smartmatic software was used in voting machines 'in 30 states,' including battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. In reality, Smartmatic software was only used in one California county.\nOthers on OAN claimed that Smartmatic's software was 'used to switch votes from President Trump to Joe Biden,' and said the company was engaged in digital 'ballot-stuffing' to help Biden win. OAN personalities also stretched the truth about Smartmatic's past ties to Venezuela to weave a baseless narrative that, 'Maduro allies were meddling in the latest US election through a company called Smartmatic.'\nThe case was still in the discovery phase when the settlement was reached.\nDepositions were scheduled to take place Tuesday, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The person said depositions were scheduled soon for OAN owner Robert Herring, a wealthy California businessman, and his son Charles Herring, the network's president \u2014 but those won't happen now that the case has concluded.\nBoth Herrings were also entangled in a scandal within the lawsuit. Smartmatic claimed in court filings that the pair may have 'engaged in criminal activities' by obtaining and sharing internal passwords of Smartmatic employees. OAN denied the allegations, and there was never a judicial finding of wrongdoing against the Herrings.\nWhile the Smartmatic case is over, OAN still faces a separate defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion over its promotion of 2020 election lies.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Oliver Darcy,Marshall Cohen","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1228712427.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNbusiness","_score":5.8338394,"_id":"d566f7f8cf3ffc095831a806ca7fba51"},{"title":"Opinion: The FAFSA fiasco is a huge problem for students and colleges","author":"David M.

Academic success in high school, compelling extracurriculars, a strong essay, good scores on standardized tests, learning how to learn \u2014 these are where the challenges ought to lie. But instead in America, the hardest thing about getting into college tends to be figuring out how to pay for it.\nThe challenge is not just the cost of tuition these days, though recent headlines reveal some schools to be pushing $100,000 a year. But even when the means exist to defray that cost, applicants and families have to fight their way through endless bureaucracy to find out the actual price (colleges have a sticker price, but most charge a discount rate).\nThen they need to sort out what kind of aid is available. And that's when would-be college students encounter the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, better known as the FAFSA.\nBefore 2024, the FAFSA was a Frankenstein's monster, with all kinds of different forms grafted together to create a confusing and demoralizing process that left far too many eligible students unable to access their aid. This year, the Department of Education rolled out major revisions that are, in fact, much better \u2014 but only if they work. Right now, they don't.\nThanks to a late release and numerous technical errors, submissions are about half a million students, or 27%, lower than last year. It's a crisis for colleges and universities staring down the barrel at much smaller class sizes next fall. It's a disaster for kids who just want to go to college.\nRelated article Why students are freaking out about the FAFSA this year\nRelated article Why students are freaking out about the FAFSA this year Some history: Federal financial aid in the United States dates back to 1965, but for decades standards varied widely, with individual institutions determining eligibility in a hodgepodge of ways, and often requiring applicants pay an application fee to each institution. A series of reforms in the 1980s and 1990s resulted in a set of national standards for determining eligibility for grants and loans. The FAFSA, a single free form that every school accepted, was released in 1992.\nThat was a great idea, but over time, the FAFSA morphed into a monstrous document, 108 questions long, many of them difficult to answer without research and some are not even relevant for determining eligibility.\nIt took hours to fill out and for many students \u2014 especially those from marginalized backgrounds, the very people who needed aid the most \u2014 required professional help from school college counselors or other mentors. The FAFSA Simplification Act, passed with broad bipartisan support, cut the maximum number of questions from 108 to 36 but gave the Department of Education until 2024 to implement the changes. Which is to say, right now.\nIt's been, to put it gently, a fiasco. Normally the FAFSA comes out in October of the previous year; this time students couldn't access it until December 30, and even then it's been plagued with technical bugs. The Biden administration blames the problems on changes to the financial aid formula, the complexity of changing a system based on millions of lines of computer code more than forty years old and missed deadlines with the outside vendor, General Dynamics, responsible for operating the new system. Lawmakers from both parties have condemned the delays and the Government Accounting Office has launched two separate investigations.\nThere are two big problems that result from this delay. First, students can't make decisions about which college to attend without the full financial picture and they can't get that picture until their FAFSA is fully processed.\nMeanwhile, deadlines for admissions decisions are here; most schools' dates are April 15 or May 1. Colleges can push back those deadlines, though that will make it extremely difficult to forecast budgets for the fall.\nAnd even though the new form is in fact much easier and faster than the old one, taking successful users about 15 minutes once they have their tax information assembled and if they don't encounter technical errors, many of the students who need aid the most are about to graduate and lose the support structure provided by schools. Sure, students can get help in the summers, but many won't, and doors of opportunity will close.\nSo even if next year seems likely to be better, there's no denying that this new FAFSA rollout has been a disaster. But that poses to all of us involved in higher education a bigger question. Why do we do it this way?\nThe answer is complicated. One of the hallmarks of the Biden administration's approach to college affordability has been to implement technical and organizational improvements. That's largely because, blocked by the six Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices and Republican attorneys general from around the country, Biden hasn't been able to make any sweeping changes in how people pay for college or how much it costs. Instead, his administration has found ways to optimize existing programs, whether forgiving $153 billion in debt or reworking the FAFSA.\nYes, the FAFSA update was mandated by Congress, but the debt-forgiveness programs were too, yet languished under a Trump Administration that seemed disinterested in good governance. So the Biden approach has been refreshing, except that incremental changes are only good if they make people's lives easier incrementally. This year, the Department of Education's failure to upgrade FAFSA smoothly has made things harder.\nThe story of how we ended up here isn't just about partisan politics, though \u2014 it's also structural. Need-based programs like financial aid (but also Medicaid, disability support and other social supports) are designed around what I call a bureaucracy-of-suspicion. The assumption built into these programs is that people will seek benefits for which they don't qualify, and that it's better to deny 100 eligible users rather than to give a single extra penny to someone who might be ineligible. So we get means testing. We get administrative burdens. We get Frankenstein's bureaucratic monsters that keep eligible people from getting the resources they need, all so that, in theory, no one gets away with an extra dollar or two for education.\nWhen it comes to college costs, there could be a better way. Public higher education could, and should, offer a high quality and low or no cost pathway to a college degree. This used to be true. Many red, blue and purple states currently offer free college to some or all residents \u2014 albeit usually after filling out a FAFSA.\nWe should applaud the successful Biden administration initiatives to incrementally ease the financial burdens of higher education and hold them accountable, demand better, when they fail. But we don't have to think incrementally. Instead, we must work towards universal systems for all.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook Because the hardest thing about getting into college should be getting into college. And the hardest things about college should be doing the academic work: picking a major, thriving in your classes, making sure you don't oversleep when you have an early morning exam. We've got to get the financial stress, and especially the bureaucracy, out of the public university. So that then the hardest thing about college will just be college, not paying the bill.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David M.

And the committee ended this month with an additional $886,000 in outstanding legal bills \u2013 most of which were owed to Robert & Robert, the firm that has represented Trump and his family in a business fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James. That case ended in February with a staggering $355 million judgment against him, not counting interest.\nOpening arguments are slated to begin Monday in a separate case, the criminal hush money trial that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has brought against Trump \u2013 the first former president to face criminal prosecution. Save America paid a combined $1.14 million in March to Blanche Law and NechelesLaw LLP, whose principals have flanked Trump in court during jury selection in recent days.\nSaturday's filings underscore how much financial ground Trump must make up as the general election campaign heats up. President Joe Biden and the Democratic National Committee expanded their cash advantage over Trump and the GOP in March.\nBiden's principal campaign committee entered April with $85.5 million stockpiled in its war chest, while Trump's main campaign account had $45.1 million.\nThe money Save America spent just on legal expenses last month rivals the $3.7 million Trump's campaign committee spent altogether in March as he pursues a third bid for the White House. That marked a significantly slower pace of campaign spending for the former president.\nBy contrast, Biden's campaign \u2013 flush with money \u2013 reported more than $29 million in expenditures last month. It plowed nearly $22 million into producing and placing campaign ads.\nSave America has relied on tens of millions of dollars it has clawed back from a Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., to help keep it afloat. The new filings show the super PAC sent another $5 million back to Save America in March \u2013 bringing its total refunds to $57.25 million.\nBut this source of money will soon run dry. The leadership PAC had donated a total of $60 million to MAGA Inc., and cannot seek more than that in refunds.\nTrump's political team will tap another cash pipeline in the quest to replenish that dwindling resource. Under a recently inked joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee and dozens of state parties, Save America is slated to get a $5,000 slice of money collected from each individual donor who participates in high-dollar fundraising. And the agreement prioritizes payments to Save America ahead of contributions to the RNC, according to the fine print of an invitation obtained by CNN.\nThe first big event under the umbrella of the new fundraising committee \u2013 a dinner at the Florida home of a billionaire investor \u2013 raised a record $50.5 million, according to the Trump campaign.\nThis week's filings also pointed to the financial boon that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s vice presidential pick represents for his independent bid for the White House. His campaign received a $2 million contribution from Nicole Shanahan in March and raised more than $3 million more that month, campaign filings show.\nKennedy also burned through cash in March, spending $4.5 million, as the campaign spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on consulting, events, advertising and payroll, up from February, when the campaign spent about $2.9 million. Kennedy's campaign ended March with about $6 million in cash on hand.\nShanahan is an independently wealthy tech executive and the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin. Politicians can contribute unlimited amounts of their own money to benefit their campaigns.\nCNN's Aaron Pellish contributed to this report.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Alex,Alex  Leeds Matthews,Leeds Matthews,David Wright,Fredreka Schouten","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20240414-split-joe-biden-donald-trump.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":5.7527843,"_id":"c6db0e085cb89185fef38c03bd45113e"},{"title":"Senators blast Biden administration's staffing plans for veterans' healthcare","author":"Curt Devine","published_date":"2024-04-18 17:56:39","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/18/politics/senators-va-healthcare-staffing-invs","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The top two senators on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs called the Biden administration's plan to reduce veterans' healthcare staffing a 'mess' that could undercut the timing and quality of care.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN\n\u2014\nThe top two senators on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs called the Biden administration's plan to reduce veterans' health care staffing a 'mess' that could undercut the timing and quality of care.\nIn a letter sent to Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough Monday, Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, and Sen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, demanded to know why the VA has paused hiring and planned to cut 10,000 full-time jobs despite veterans across the nation experiencing long wait times for care.\nTheir letter, obtained by CNN, called VA's apparent 'zero growth' policy a 'drastic' and 'shortsighted' decision. Though the VA told the committee that critical staff and some others would be exempt, Tester and Moran wrote that has not been the case.\nThe letter, which noted that the VA last year underwent a hiring spree and had a record number of clinical appointments, stated that congressional staff has heard from VA employees and others that various VA locations have rescinded job offers for mental health providers and stalled hiring of housing case managers, among other issues.\n'They're cutting front-line people who see patients in the clinic,' a VA employee with knowledge of the situation who was not authorized to speak and feared retaliation told CNN. 'They refuse to put things in writing. \u2026 We have no idea why they are making this move.'\nThe VA Under Secretary for Health, Dr. Shereef Elnahal, responding to a question about staffing decisions at a news conference last month, said the VA's workforce could be cut by 10,000 positions through 'attrition and voluntary separation.' He added those cuts would primarily involve positions that 'are not directly veteran facing.'\nDr. Shereef Elnahal, VA Under Secretary for Health, left, with Rep.

Richardson/The'So, we're talking about more managerial, programmatic individuals, supervisory roles that aren't necessarily over the point of care directly,' Elnahal said. 'And so, we think we have the room to do that.'\nAsked about the senators' letter, VA press secretary Terrence Hayes said in a statement that the VA continues to hire in key areas including mental health care, that there will be 'no hiring freeze or layoffs' and that the agency 'has the nationwide staffing we need to deliver world-class care.'\nBut the senators' letter stated that some veterans across the US continue to face long waits for care and that VA's own metrics show a pattern of 'meaningful decline' in average wait times for appointments, including primary, specialty and mental health care.\n'It is unclear how VA's \u2018zero growth' strategy comports with this reality,' wrote the senators, who expressed concern 'that such a significant shift in policy could not only have long-term impacts on the Department's ability to deliver timely, high-quality care but also negatively impact its ability to recruit and retain health care professionals.'\nHayes, the VA spokesperson, disputed that, saying average wait times are either stable or trending down for VA services nationwide.\nAsked about staffing issues at a congressional hearing last week, McDonough said the federal budget has forced 'difficult choices,' though he said the VA is 'well positioned to provide care.'\nThe VA has been touting in recent news releases greater access to care for veterans through night and weekend clinics as well as 'historic enrollment' in VA healthcare driven by the PACT Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022 and which expanded health care benefits for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.\nThe VA has long been plagued by delays in health care.

Every year, TIME Magazine has an answer.\nTIME released its list of the 100 Most Influential People for 2024 on Wednesday. The annual list, which asks cultural and political icons to highlight the changemakers of the past year, features dozens of athletes, entertainers, artists and politicians.\nSome names are not surprising. Former baseball star Alex Rodriguez wrote about quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Comedian Amy Poehler wrote about Maya Rudolph. Transgender activist Raquel Willis wrote about actor Elliot Page. Beninese music legend Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo wrote about Nigerian artist Burna Boy, who in turn wrote about rapper 21 Savage. Dua Lipa, Taraji P. Henson, and Coleman Domingo also all have a spot on the list.\nBut some names might be less familiar. Here's a look at some of the people you may not know.\nDuring last fall's auto workers strike, Shawn Fain, who had been sworn in as president of the United Auto Workers union less than six months prior, told his fellow auto workers something that stuck with President Joe Biden for months.\n'In this union, the members are the highest authority,' Fain said, according to Biden. 'In this country, the people are the highest authority.'\nFain, and all the work he did in winning historic wage increases for the UAW, represent the 'hard-won success' that unions had in 2023, Biden states.\nWith the UAW's lead, change has been made throughout the auto-maker industry. After the UAW's win, Toyota, Honda and Hyundai \u2014 non-union companies \u2014 also raised wages. But even with the strike over, the UAW and Fain are still fighting, aiming for a four-day, 32-hour workweek.\n'They remind us that when unions win, all workers benefit,' Biden says.\nAt just 25 years of age, Motaz Azaiza is the youngest person on this year's TIME list. For four months, the Palestinian photographer was 'the world's eyes and ears in his native Gaza,' posting pictures and chronicling the war to millions of followers on Instagram, writes TIME staff writer Yasmeen Serhan.\n'Families displaced from homes, women mourning loved ones, a man trapped beneath the rubble. His images offered a glimpse into Gaza that few in the international press\u2014which has been all but barred from accessing the Strip\u2014could rival,' Serhan writes.\nHe did so despite the great risks facing journalists in the area. Azaiza evacuated in January, but the war has not slowed. Last month, eyewitnesses said Israeli forces forced Palestinian journalists and health workers to strip down to their underwear. Just last week, several journalists \u2014 including one working for CNN \u2014 were injured in an attack on a refugee camp.\n'It's better for me not to process, because if I process what I experienced or what I've been through, believe me I will not feel OK,' Azaiza told CNN. 'I'm a man looking for a solution now. We need to stop this.'\nWhen Jenni Hermoso and the Spanish Women's National Team won the FIFA World Cup last summer, the last thing the forward expected was a kiss from her boss.\nAnd yet, that's what happened. As the world watched, Luis Rubiales, president of the Spanish soccer federation, grabbed Hermoso's face and kissed her \u2014 sparking a worldwide conversation about sexual harassment and consent. Rubiales was banned by FIFA for three years, and in January, Hermoso testified in a sexual assault probe against the former president.\nWriting for TIME, American soccer player Mana Shim praised Hermoso's bravery.\n'Hermoso courageously told her truth, over and over again, despite efforts to silence her,' Shim said.\nSakshi Malik is India's first and only female wrestler to win an Olympic medal \u2014 taking home the bronze at 2016's Olympics in Rio. But late last year, she quit the sport.\nMalik was part of an outspoken group demanding the arrest and resignation of Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, an important member of parliament and former chief of India's wrestling federation who had been accused of sexually harassing women athletes, explains Nisha Pahuja, a documentary filmmaker.\nThe women's fight lasted throughout 2023, eliciting attention from around the world.

Every year, TIME has an answer.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Who are the 100 most influential people in the world? Every year, TIME Magazine has an answer.\nTIME released its list of the 100 Most Influential People for 2024 on Wednesday. The annual list, which asks cultural and political icons to highlight the changemakers of the past year, features dozens of athletes, entertainers, artists and politicians.\nSome names are not surprising. Former baseball star Alex Rodriguez wrote about quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Comedian Amy Poehler wrote about Maya Rudolph. Transgender activist Raquel Willis wrote about actor Elliot Page. Beninese music legend Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo wrote about Nigerian artist Burna Boy, who in turn wrote about rapper 21 Savage. Dua Lipa, Taraji P. Henson, and Coleman Domingo also all have a spot on the list.\nBut some names might be less familiar. Here's a look at some of the people you may not know.\nDuring last fall's auto workers strike, Shawn Fain, who had been sworn in as president of the United Auto Workers union less than six months prior, told his fellow auto workers something that stuck with President Joe Biden for months.\n'In this union, the members are the highest authority,' Fain said, according to Biden. 'In this country, the people are the highest authority.'\nFain, and all the work he did in winning historic wage increases for the UAW, represent the 'hard-won success' that unions had in 2023, Biden states.\nWith the UAW's lead, change has been made throughout the auto-maker industry. After the UAW's win, Toyota, Honda and Hyundai \u2014 non-union companies \u2014 also raised wages. But even with the strike over, the UAW and Fain are still fighting, aiming for a four-day, 32-hour workweek.\n'They remind us that when unions win, all workers benefit,' Biden says.\nAt just 25 years of age, Motaz Azaiza is the youngest person on this year's TIME list. For four months, the Palestinian photographer was 'the world's eyes and ears in his native Gaza,' posting pictures and chronicling the war to millions of followers on Instagram, writes TIME staff writer Yasmeen Serhan.\n'Families displaced from homes, women mourning loved ones, a man trapped beneath the rubble. His images offered a glimpse into Gaza that few in the international press\u2014which has been all but barred from accessing the Strip\u2014could rival,' Serhan writes.\nHe did so despite the great risks facing journalists in the area. Azaiza evacuated in January, but the war has not slowed. Last month, eyewitnesses said Israeli forces forced Palestinian journalists and health workers to strip down to their underwear. Just last week, several journalists \u2014 including one working for CNN \u2014 were injured in an attack on a refugee camp.\n'It's better for me not to process, because if I process what I experienced or what I've been through, believe me I will not feel OK,' Azaiza told CNN. 'I'm a man looking for a solution now. We need to stop this.'\nWhen Jenni Hermoso and the Spanish Women's National Team won the FIFA World Cup last summer, the last thing the forward expected was a kiss from her boss.\nAnd yet, that's what happened. As the world watched, Luis Rubiales, president of the Spanish soccer federation, grabbed Hermoso's face and kissed her \u2014 sparking a worldwide conversation about sexual harassment and consent. Rubiales was banned by FIFA for three years, and in January, Hermoso testified in a sexual assault probe against the former president.\nWriting for TIME, American soccer player Mana Shim praised Hermoso's bravery.\n'Hermoso courageously told her truth, over and over again, despite efforts to silence her,' Shim said.\nSakshi Malik is India's first and only female wrestler to win an Olympic medal \u2014 taking home the bronze at 2016's Olympics in Rio. But late last year, she quit the sport.\nMalik was part of an outspoken group demanding the arrest and resignation of Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, an important member of parliament and former chief of India's wrestling federation who had been accused of sexually harassing women athletes, explains Nisha Pahuja, a documentary filmmaker.\nThe women's fight lasted throughout 2023, eliciting attention from around the world. Finally, Singh was charged by Delhi police with assault, stalking and sexual harassment, all of which he denied. Though he was removed as the chief of the wrestling foundation, Singh was replaced by his close ally and business partner late last year, only reigniting the controversy.\n'Upcoming female wrestlers will also face exploitation,' Malik said, in a press conference in December, following the replacement announcement. 'If (Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh's) business partner and a close aide is elected as the new president, I quit wrestling.'\nThe moment was an 'emotional, public, and very brave act of defiance,' writes Pahuja.\n'She did not, however, quit the battle,' she wrote.

It was a week of unexpected developments in an unpredictable but consequential election year.\nHere are the surprise developments and what they could mean for the future:\nUnless you've been stranded off the grid in Antarctica, you know that former President Donald Trump is on trial in New York on charges of falsifying business records related to hush money payments made before the 2016 election. This overriding lead story was the subject of blanket TV coverage and banner headlines.\nThe surprise is that a jury selection process predicted to take weeks was over in days. Twelve jurors and six alternates will sit in judgment of the former president.\nThere were multiple hiccups, such as when one juror reconsidered her ability to remain impartial or when a self-immolation created a scene outside the courthouse.\nBut the end result is the most important thing. The first of four potential criminal trials of Trump is happening. Opening arguments get underway next week.\nWe can't say exactly who will testify because the prosecution won't tell Trump's team which witnesses they will call first. They anticipate Trump will violate a gag order and trash talk whoever takes the stand.\nWhat we do know is that Trump has already tried to seed a conspiracy theory that the jury is somehow biased against him. This despite the open process that led to the seating of the anonymous jury.\n'Help' is probably the wrong word. When 165 Democrats voted with 151 Republicans in favor of House Speaker Mike Johnson's plan to hold votes on aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, it ossified the aggravation at Johnson from the right wing of his party.\nThree Republicans \u2013 Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona \u2013 have said they will support a plan to oust Johnson from the speaker's chair.\nJohnson, meanwhile, refused to protect himself by changing House rules to make it harder to fire him. He has maintained the support of most Republicans and of Trump. At least for now.\nThe fault lines in the GOP, evident for years, are under immense stress. If Johnson is to keep his spot as speaker, he'll probably need help as soon as next week from Democrats for that too.\nIt would be something that looks like bipartisan or coalition governing, which would be music to any moderate American's ears. And if Johnson keeps his position as well as passes what most Americans and lawmakers want, his skill at leadership will deserve a reexamination. More to come next week.\nMost lawmakers in the House and Senate support giving more military aid to Ukraine as it fends off Russia's invasion. But the opposition of the right wing of the GOP has delayed the aid since the White House requested it in October.\nJohnson, although a bona fide conservative and a skeptic at times of Ukraine aid, is finally on the cusp of getting the vote done in the House. It's a major development.\nBut the fight over aid has also uncovered some uncomfortable truths, such as the prominence of the nationalist-veering GOP right wing, which is not afraid to say it doesn't put much stock in supporting democracies around the world.\nTit-for-tat strikes and responses between Israel and Iran in recent weeks have threatened to spark an all-out conflagration between the two countries.\nThis week, Iran responded to Israel's strike on a Syrian diplomatic facility with its own strikes, which Israel responded to on Friday with a strike on Iran. But the takeaway of many analysts was that might be it for a while.\nHere's Tamara Qiblawi in CNN's Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter:\nThis month's dramatic escalation, which kicked off with an apparent Israeli airstrike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, followed by a largely foiled Iranian attack of over 300 airborne weapons on Israel, seems to have given way to a rapid climbdown. Shortly after the Friday morning attack in Iran, a regional intelligence source told CNN's Nic Robertson that Iran was not expected to respond further, and that the direct state-to-state strikes between the two enemy states were over.

Read more from Qiblawi. With all the Trump trial coverage, you might have missed that President Joe Biden is running a spirited presidential campaign. While Trump is spending most days at his trial, Biden is going all over the map.\nThis week, he was in Philadelphia, where he went to a Wawa, and he was in Pittsburgh, where he went to a Sheetz. He was in Pennsylvania for a three-day swing to push his economic populism. If he can sustain the blue wall that wins Democrats their recent presidencies, it's this kind of tailored campaigning that will do it.\nAs Trump was spinning conspiracy theories outside his trial, Biden was adopting some of Trump's message on issues like tariffs, while drawing a bright line between the two of them on the key American issue of protecting democracy.\nAll of Biden's hard work won't quiet the critics who point to his age and wonder if he's up to the job, but it's impossible to argue the man is not trying very hard to convince people he wants to remain president.\nThe term 'Bidenomics' is either an insult or a brag, depending on the circumstances.\nBiden's economic pitch, as earnest as it was this week, might be a hard sell to Americans who still acutely feel the pinch of inflation and feel priced out of everything from the housing market to the restaurant scene.\nThe International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, is worried not about a US recession, but rather that the US economy is too hot compared with other countries, according to a report released this week. While Europe and other developed countries have yet to reach their pre-pandemic growth levels, the data suggests the US economy has blown past them.\n'Astonishingly, the US economy has already surged past its pre-pandemic (growth) trend,' IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in a blog post accompanying the agency's World Economic Outlook. That means any talk of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the near future is likely to end.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Zachary B.

That means a facility with 100 residents would need at least two or three registered nurses and at least 10 or 11 nurse aides, as well as two additional nurse staff, who could be registered nurses, licensed professional nurses or nurse aides, per shift, according to a White House fact sheet.\nPlus, nursing homes must have a registered nurse onsite at all times. The mandate will be phased in, with rural communities having longer timeframes, and temporary exemptions will be available for facilities in areas with workforce shortages that demonstrate a good faith effort to hire.\nThe rule, which was first proposed in September and initially called for at least three hours of daily nursing care per resident, is aimed at addressing nursing homes that are chronically understaffed, which can lead to sub-standard or unsafe care, the White House said.\n'When facilities are understaffed, residents may go without basic necessities like baths, trips to the bathroom, and meals \u2013 and it is less safe when residents have a medical emergency,' the fact sheet said, noting that it will also 'ensure that workers aren't stretched too thin by having inadequate staff on site.'\nNursing home operators strongly objected to the minimum staffing proposal in September, saying they already struggle to fill open positions. Such a requirement could force some facilities to close.\nMeeting the proposed mandate would require nursing homes to hire more than 100,000 additional nurses and nurse aides at an annual cost of $6.8 billion, according to a September analysis released by the American Health Care Association, which represents more than 14,000 nursing homes and other long-term care facilities that provide care to approximately 5 million people annually.\nSome 94% of nursing homes were not meeting at least one of the proposed staffing requirements, the analysis found.\n'When nearly every nursing home in the country would be considered out of compliance if this went into effect today, it demonstrates how out of touch Washington bureaucrats are with reality,' Mark Parkinson, CEO of the American Health Care Association/National Center for Assisted Living, said in a statement at the time. 'We all want to grow the nursing home workforce, but this impossible policy is absolutely not the way to do it.'\nMeanwhile, some consumer advocates were also dissatisfied with the proposed rule, saying it doesn't go far enough.\n'The proposal flies in the face of decades of research demonstrating a need for a strong staffing standard that protects all nursing home residents from harm,' the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care said in a statement in September, noting that a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services study in 2001 found that nursing home residents need at least 4.1 hours of daily care.\nThe proposed staffing mandate has also split Congress, whose approval is not required. A bipartisan Senate bill and similar legislation introduced by House Republicans would prohibit the Department of Health and Human Services from finalizing the rule. Nearly a hundred House members from both parties wrote a letter to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra in October expressing their concerns with the proposed rule, particularly that it could lead to widespread nursing home closures.\nBut Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat of Massachusetts, has called for the administration to finalize the rule and strengthen it.\n'This would help improve the quality of care for residents at the same time that it's improving conditions for the staff who provide this long-term care,' she said at a hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging last week.\nAnd more than 50 organizations, including labor unions and consumer advocates, voiced support for the proposed mandate in a letter to Congress and an advertisement in the fall.\n'With this proposal, the Biden Administration sends a powerful message: All nursing homes must be held accountable to minimum staffing standards that will keep residents and workers safe, and ensure that public funding is spent in ways that allow caregivers to deliver the best care possible,' Mary Kay Henry, international president of SEIU, which represents nursing home workers, said in a statement in September.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Tami Luhby,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1239049094.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":5.728166,"_id":"a5d6e0ad9d0cdc10b12d9f750afb6351"},{"title":"Tensions simmer between Iran and Israel as war devastates Gaza","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-20 04:18:28","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-04-20-24/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Israel carried out a military strike on Iran early Friday, a US official told CNN, in a potentially dangerous escalation of a fast-widening Middle East conflict that Iranian officials have so far\u2026","summary":"Israel carried out a military strike on Iran early Friday, a US official told CNN, in a potentially dangerous escalation of a fast-widening Middle East conflict that Iranian officials have so far sought to play down.

Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto/Getty Images Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi made no mention of Israel's Friday (local time) strike on Iran, while publicly lauding the unprecedented Iranian military operation last weekend targeting the \"Israeli-occupied territories.\" Iran's April 13 retaliatory strikes, part of an operation named \"True Promise,\" were a display of Iran's military strength and a necessary act against what Raisi called the \"illegal regime,\" he said Friday. Raisi described the strikes as \"punitive reprisal\" by the Iranian Armed Forces, aimed at demonstrating Iran's power and the resolve of its people. Remember: The April 1 strikes on Iran's embassy compound in Damascus demolished a building and left several dead, including two high-ranking generals. Israel and the United States have said that Iran's lob of some 300 missiles had very little material impact and caused only one injury. 6 min ago From CNN's Aqeel Najim and Hamdi Alkhshali Flames from a large explosion near Babylon, Iraq, can be seen in an image taken from video obtained by CNN from social media. Obtained by CNN At least three people were wounded after five explosions rocked a military base belonging to an Iran-backed militia in Iraq, a local security official told CNN Saturday. The blasts happened at a site belonging to the Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), according to Muhannad al-Anazi, a member of the Security Committee in Babylon Governorate, south of the capital Baghdad. There was no immediate indication as to the cause. Israeli and US officials said neither was involved in the blast. Read the full story here Remember: The explosions near the Iraqi capital of Baghdad come one day after strikes against a military base in Isfahan, Iran. A US official told CNN that Israel was responsible for the strikes in Iran. 5 min ago From CNN's Oren Liebermann Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant (L) and US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Getty Images Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart on Friday, according to a readout from the Pentagon. This comes one day after Israel carried out strikes in Iran. The readout makes no mention of the Israeli strikes, and the Biden administration has been tight-lipped following the actions. Austin and Israel Defense Minister Yoav Gallant discussed 'regional stability,' as well as the ongoing war in Gaza, according to the Pentagon. Austin also spoke with Gallant on Thursday before the strikes took place. The readout of the earlier call had slightly more information, saying the two discussed 'Iran's destabilizing actions in the Middle East.' In a previous call, Austin had asked Gallant for Israel to notify the US before taking any action in retaliation for a massive Iranian barrage fired at Israel last weekend. 5 min ago Analysis from CNN's Tamara Qiblawi in Beirut, Lebanon The scope of Israel's military response to Iran's first-ever direct attack on the country remains murky. Israeli officials have yet to publicly acknowledge responsibility for reported overnight explosions in parts of Iran on Friday. Tehran has dismissed these as attacks by 'tiny drones' that were shot down by its air defense systems. Iran may be downplaying what was likely to have been a significant but limited Israeli attack, but that seems to be secondary to the larger forces at play. What is plain to see is that both Iran and Israel are keen to wrap up the most dangerous escalation between the two regional powerhouses to date. This month's dramatic escalation, which kicked off with an apparent Israeli airstrike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, followed by a largely foiled Iranian attack of over 300 airborne weapons on Israel, seems to have given way to a rapid climbdown. Shortly after the Friday morning attack in Iran, a regional intelligence source told CNN that Iran was not expected to respond further, and that the direct state-to-state strikes between the two enemy states were over. The latest flare-up brought the stakes into sharp focus, but it also exposed the limits of a direct confrontation between Iran and Israel. Remember: What happens between Iran and Israel rarely stays between Iran and Israel. The region is deeply intertwined. That heightens the risks of military action, but it also acts as guardrails against a potential conflagration. So when US officials said last weekend that Washington would not participate in an Israeli response to Iran's attack on Israel, that seemed to immediately take the wind out of the sails of a potential escalation. 5 min ago From CNN's Paul P. Murphy SAR data \u00a9 2024 Umbra Space, Inc. There does not appear to be any extensive damage at an air base purportedly targeted by an Israeli military strike, according to exclusive satellite images obtained by CNN from Umbra Space. The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images were taken around 10:18 a.m. local time. There does not appear to be any large craters in the ground and there are no apparent destroyed buildings. Additional visual satellite imagery will be needed to check for burn scars \u2013 which cannot be seen by SAR images -- around the complex. SAR images are not like normal satellite images. The SAR images are created by a satellite transmitting radar beams capable of passing through clouds, like the ones currently preventing satellites from imaging the area. Those radar beams bounce off objects on the ground, and echo back to the satellite. Iranian news agency FARS said that an army radar at the Isfahan province military base was one of the possible targets, and that the only damage from the attack was broken windows on several office buildings. The images also show that the Iranian F-14 Tomcats that have been stationed at the air base in the past are not there at the moment. Additional archival satellite imagery reviewed by CNN shows that those F-14 Tomcats have not been there for some time. 4 min ago Violence and uncertainty has gripped the Middle East since Hamas' October 7 attacks on Israel, and Israel's subsequent war in Gaza. The war has threatened on several occasions to spill over into an all-out regional conflict, and those concerns have intensified in recent weeks, as Israel and Iran traded missile strikes. Here's a look at where and how violence has spread. 4 min ago From CNN's Catherine Nicholls and Benjamin Brown in London The European Union imposed sanctions on 'extremist settlers in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem,' the European Council announced on Friday, listing four people and two entities. According to the statement, the entities Lehava, a 'radical right-wing Jewish supremacist group,' and Hilltop Youth, a 'radical youth group consisting of members known for violent acts against Palestinians and their villages in the West Bank,' were added to the EU sanctions regime alongside two leading figures of Hilltop Youth, Meir Ettinger and Elisha Yered. Neria Ben Pazi, who the EU's governing body said has been 'accused of repeatedly attacking Palestinians,' and Yinon Levi, who the council said has 'taken part in multiple violent acts against neighbouring villages,' were also added to the listing. The EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said in a post on X that 'the EU has decided to sanction extremist settlers in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem for serious human rights abuses against Palestinians. We strongly condemn extremist settler violence: perpetrators must be held to account.' Belgium's Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib said that she 'welcomes' the sanctions , adding that the 'recent escalation of violence against Palestinians in the West Bank must stop; these settlers must be held accountable.'

The two groups -- Mount Hebron Fund and Shlom Asiraich \u2013 established crowdfunding campaigns to raise thousands of dollars for Yinon Levi and David Chai Chasdai respectively. Both of those men were sanctioned by the US in February under a new executive order targeting those perpetrating violence in the West Bank.

Israeli officials have yet to publicly acknowledge responsibility for reported overnight explosions in parts of Iran on Friday. Tehran has dismissed these as attacks by 'tiny drones' that were shot down by its air defense systems.\nIran may be downplaying what was likely to have been a significant but limited Israeli attack, but that seems to be secondary to the larger forces at play. What is plain to see is that both Iran and Israel are keen to wrap up the most dangerous escalation between the two regional powerhouses to date.\nThis month's dramatic escalation, which kicked off with an apparent Israeli airstrike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, followed by a largely foiled Iranian attack of over 300 airborne weapons on Israel, seems to have given way to a rapid climbdown. Shortly after the Friday morning attack in Iran, a regional intelligence source told CNN that Iran was not expected to respond further, and that the direct state-to-state strikes between the two enemy states were over.\nThe latest flare-up brought the stakes into sharp focus, but it also exposed the limits of a direct confrontation between Iran and Israel.\nRemember: What happens between Iran and Israel rarely stays between Iran and Israel. The region is deeply intertwined. That heightens the risks of military action, but it also acts as guardrails against a potential conflagration. So when US officials said last weekend that Washington would not participate in an Israeli response to Iran's attack on Israel, that seemed to immediately take the wind out of the sails of a potential escalation.\nRemember: What happens between Iran and Israel rarely stays between Iran and Israel.

Getty Images Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart on Friday, according to a readout from the Pentagon.\nThis comes one day after Israel carried out strikes in Iran. The readout makes no mention of the Israeli strikes, and the Biden administration has been tight-lipped following the actions.\nAustin and Israel Defense Minister Yoav Gallant discussed 'regional stability,' as well as the ongoing war in Gaza, according to the Pentagon.\nAustin also spoke with Gallant on Thursday before the strikes took place. The readout of the earlier call had slightly more information, saying the two discussed 'Iran's destabilizing actions in the Middle East.'\nIn a previous call, Austin had asked Gallant for Israel to notify the US before taking any action in retaliation for a massive Iranian barrage fired at Israel last weekend.\n4 hr 6 min ago Analysis from CNN's Tamara Qiblawi in Beirut, Lebanon\nThe scope of Israel's military response to Iran's first-ever direct attack on the country remains murky. Israeli officials have yet to publicly acknowledge responsibility for reported overnight explosions in parts of Iran on Friday. Tehran has dismissed these as attacks by 'tiny drones' that were shot down by its air defense systems.\nIran may be downplaying what was likely to have been a significant but limited Israeli attack, but that seems to be secondary to the larger forces at play. What is plain to see is that both Iran and Israel are keen to wrap up the most dangerous escalation between the two regional powerhouses to date.\nThis month's dramatic escalation, which kicked off with an apparent Israeli airstrike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, followed by a largely foiled Iranian attack of over 300 airborne weapons on Israel, seems to have given way to a rapid climbdown. Shortly after the Friday morning attack in Iran, a regional intelligence source told CNN that Iran was not expected to respond further, and that the direct state-to-state strikes between the two enemy states were over.\nThe latest flare-up brought the stakes into sharp focus, but it also exposed the limits of a direct confrontation between Iran and Israel.\nRemember: What happens between Iran and Israel rarely stays between Iran and Israel. The region is deeply intertwined. That heightens the risks of military action, but it also acts as guardrails against a potential conflagration. So when US officials said last weekend that Washington would not participate in an Israeli response to Iran's attack on Israel, that seemed to immediately take the wind out of the sails of a potential escalation.\nRemember: What happens between Iran and Israel rarely stays between Iran and Israel.

The\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 The Biden administration is contemplating scrapping the most futuristic aspect of its highly anticipated and impactful power plant pollution rules, two sources familiar with the plan told CNN. The administration may also allow a slower phase-in for a portion of the rules, which are due to be finalized as soon as next week.\nThe potential change of plans comes as the administration faces fierce political headwinds, a conservative Supreme Court majority that has shown aggressive interest in curtailing the Environmental Protection Agency's authority and questions over how fast electric utilities can pivot to the most innovative climate solutions.\nThe EPA is considering eliminating a proposal for new natural gas plants to use hydrogen alongside natural gas to make electricity, the sources said. The expected changes mean both existing coal and new gas plants would primarily rely on carbon capture and storage to cut their climate pollution, rather than hydrogen fuels. Hydrogen, while in its infancy, is seen by scientists as the future of clean fuel.\nThe power plant rules are still under review and no final decisions on them have been made.\nEPA spokesperson Tim Carroll declined to comment, saying, 'The draft final rule is currently with the Office of Management and Budget under interagency review.' A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe EPA power plant rules are one of the most important and highly anticipated planks of President Joe Biden's climate agenda.\nThe potential change comes amid questions on how quickly the industry could scale up clean hydrogen, a relatively nascent technology derived both from fossil fuels such as natural gas, as well as cleaner hydrogen \u2013 which uses clean electricity to split water.\nA handful of projects have demonstrated the ability to burn hydrogen in a gas turbine, 'but it's not a widespread technology yet,' Mike O'Boyle, the senior director of electricity at nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation, told CNN.\nUtilities have proposed building more natural gas plants to keep electricity flowing onto a grid with increased demands from the growing number of electric vehicles and AI and data centers. Clean energy and climate groups have argued in favor of cleaner and cheaper sources of energy such as wind, solar and battery storage.\nThe possible move away from hydrogen could make it easier for the EPA to defend against potential court challenges to the plan.\nThe conservative Supreme Court and its 2022 ruling on West Virginia v. EPA has loomed large over how the agency has crafted its rules. The Supreme Court ruling significantly curtailed the EPA's ability to regulate carbon pollution at power plants by having utilities outfit their power plants with carbon capture, rather than requiring a shift from coal or natural gas-fired power to cheaper and cleaner sources like wind and solar.\nWest Virginia v. EPA has loomed large over how the agency has crafted its rules. The Supreme Court ruling significantly curtailed the EPA's ability to regulate carbon pollution at power plants by having utilities outfit their power plants with carbon capture, rather than requiring a shift from coal or natural gas-fired power to cheaper and cleaner sources like wind and solar. One of the thorny issues facing the EPA was how using hydrogen at natural gas plants would fall in the Supreme Court's narrow definition. And some environmental groups were concerned it would be tough for the federal government to ensure the hydrogen was clean, not more polluting.\nThe EPA is also considering pushing back its initial timeline requiring existing coal-fired power plants to cut or capture 90% of their planet-warming pollution using carbon capture and storage by two years to 2032, the sources said.\nThe EPA announced in February it would delay the rule-making process for carbon emissions from existing gas plants, which had initially been covered under the agency's proposal last year.\nO'Boyle said that, judging from the comments and wide disagreement from industry and environmental groups, it is very likely that EPA will face a lawsuit.\n'One thing we can all count on is that the EPA will be sued by an aggrieved party under this rule, no matter what,' O'Boyle said. 'There will be lawsuits.'\nVickie Patton, an attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund, told reporters on a Thursday call she believes the EPA's final rule will be on 'strong' legal footing.\n'They've really followed the law, and they have also a very rigorous record,' Patton said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Ella Nilsen","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1246984994.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":5.675346,"_id":"35c0431926c5858c9a6de967e57d29c5"},{"title":"Iran's attack on Israel and the potential for further escalation in the Middle East; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on her recent trip to Beijing; Ambassador Rahm Emanuel on US-Japan cooperation in the region","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-15 08:34:12","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/fareed-zakaria-gps/episodes/c9c0f8fe-9f75-11ee-a524-53f94bd96d33","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Today on the show, CNN's chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward joins from Tel Aviv to break down the calculations taking place within Netanyahu's government about how and if to respond.\u2026","summary":"Iran's attack on Israel and the potential for further escalation in the Middle East; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on her recent trip to Beijing; Ambassador Rahm Emanuel on US-Japan cooperation in the region Fareed Zakaria GPS 41 mins Today on the show, CNN's chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward joins from Tel Aviv to break down the calculations taking place within Netanyahu's government about how and if to respond.

She thinks the third vote taking place this week will be different.\n'It's a totally different ball game,' she said. 'The atmosphere is different. You see more pro-union than anti-union [workers]. A whole lot of people who were anti-union in the past have switched.'\nof people who were anti-union in the past have switched.' The union vote at the Volkswagen plant will mean more than whether the 4,300 hourly workers in Chattanooga are members of the UAW or not. It could be the start of a revolution in the US auto industry, which has not seen a new automaker unionize in nearly 50 years.\nToday the industry is split almost evenly between unionized and nonunion workers at US auto factories, and the unionization of a factory in Tennessee would give unions a high profile beachhead in the South, which has long been difficult territory for unions to organize.\nBecause the plant is in Tennessee, and not Michigan or Pennsylvania or some more unionized northern state, the results could be close, as they were in the two previous votes in 2014 and 2019 at the plant. The latest vote saw 52% decide against joining the union.\nagainst joining the union. The plant has more than doubled its workforce from the 1,600 eligible to vote in the 2019 election. Supporters of the union are hoping that many of the new, younger workers will be more union-friendly than the workers in 2019.\nOpponents of the union among rank-and-file are hoping the union will lose out again, although they admit they're not sure that will happen this time.\n'I don't know. It could go either way,' said Darrell Belcher, who also started work soon after the plant opened. 'The last time we were concerned it would swing [to the union]. I'm hearing people say there are more people against it than people think.'\nBut it's not just that there are more, and different workers at the Volkswagen plant than last time.\nPrevious votes were held after the union had negotiated concession contracts in which members at the unionized automakers had given up past gains, and in the wake of a corruption scandal that would land two former union presidents in prison.\nThis time the UAW is coming in a winner, after negotiating record wage increases at GM, Ford and Stellantis. The unprecedented simultaneous strike at all three automakers won immediate raises of at least 11% and pay increases of more than 30% over the life of the contract that runs through April 2028.\nEven though Volkswagen quickly matched the UAW's contracts with the Big Three with an 11% raise of its own, Berry said their contract in Chattanooga is still not as good as the UAW deals, and people know that.\n'It opened up a lot of people's eyes. That had a big impact,' Berry said.\n'People here were rooting for [the strikers],' said Kelcey Smith, another union supporter who has been at VW for about a year. 'It [the strike and the deal that followed] showed what you can achieve.'\nSmith said he has never had a union-represented job , and despite his support for the union effort, it doesn't mean that he holds anything against the company. 'I love my job. I enjoy being an employee here,' he said.\n, and despite his support for the union effort, it doesn't mean that he holds anything against the company. 'I love my job. I enjoy being an employee here,' he said. But he said he wants the better pay and benefits he sees workers at unionized auto plants are getting, in order to provide more for his family.\nVolkswagen said the average worker in its plant makes about $60,000 a year before bonuses and benefits. Production workers working under the recent UAW contract now make about $36 an hour, or about $75,000 a year before overtime, bonuses and benefits.\n'I want to be financially safe, to give them a cushion in life,' Smith said. 'I want to do what I can to make things better for them.'\nBut Belcher said he's worried what will happen to his job if the union were to win the pay its supporters at the plant are promising they'll achieve after a UAW win.\n'In my opinion, if Volkswagen were to agree to something like that, they'd pack up and be gone to Mexico,' he said.\nThe company said it is neutral in the election, only urging workers to vote however they want. That's relatively rare in union representation elections, where management often lobbies workers to vote no at mandatory meetings, and sometimes takes action against union organizers. Even union supporters acknowledge that hasn't happened in this case, however.\nOne thing helping the UAW is that unions have much more clout in Germany than in the United States, and the main Volkswagen union there has a seat on the company's board. This is also the only VW plant without union representation.\nThe vote is the first of an effort by the UAW to organize workers at 13 nonunion automakers spread across the country, mostly in the South .\n. Another vote, at a Mercedes plant just outside of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, is set to be completed by May 17. And efforts are underway to organize workers at the American plants of eight other foreign automakers beyond VW and Mercedes \u2013 BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota, and Volvo, as well as the plants of three US-based electric vehicle makers \u2013 Tesla, Rivian and Lucid.\nat a Mercedes plant just outside of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, is set to be completed by May 17.

Together the US plants of those companies have about 150,000 workers, roughly as many as the three unionized automakers whose workers went on strike last year.\nEven if the union wins in Chattanooga, it could be an uphill battle to win at the other companies, said Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University's Industrial and Labor Relations school. But it would be an important step in the broader organizing effort, he said. And that could change the dynamics in future auto contract negotiations.\n'It won't be like dominoes where the others all fall quickly,' he said. 'But it'll start to build momentum. As you get more plants organized, you have more leverage at the table and you can set an industry [contract] pattern.'\nBecause of the potential for organizing efforts to pick up steam once one plant joins the union, the vote is closely watched by people across the auto industry and the labor movements, as well as by politicians across the South, who have worked hard to attract manufacturers to their states with promises of a union-free work force.\n'The reality is companies have choices when it comes to where to invest and bring jobs and opportunity. We have worked tirelessly on behalf of our constituents to bring good-paying jobs to our states,' said a letter signed by this week by Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee and five other Southern governors \u2013 from Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas \u2013 who have nonunion auto plants in their states. 'Unionization would certainly put our states' jobs in jeopardy.'\nFewer than 5% of workers belong to unions in those six states, which is less than half the union representation in the seven more northern industrial states where the Big Three have most of their plants.\nIt's not just Republican governors who are weighing in on the vote. President Joe Biden, who became the first president to visit a picket line during the UAW strike last fall, and who has been endorsed by the UAW, congratulated the Volkswagen workers when they filed for the election last month. But Biden's ties to the union aren't playing particularly well among the rank-and-file who will be voting at the Chattanooga plant.\n'I know a lot of people on the pro side have switched over,' said Corey Linn, a 13-year employee and one of those working against the union. 'The biggest argument to make the switch is once they found out that Biden was backing the UAW. He's not very popular in Tennessee.'\nUnion supporters say they have also heard from co-workers who are afraid that their dues money would go to Biden, even though political donations from unions don't come from the dues money collected.\n'You hear all of that, \u2018Why are they supporting Biden?'' Berry said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Chris Isidore,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/large-17647-volkswagenchattanooga.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNbusiness","_score":5.66655,"_id":"a24a93be1e90d6e8fd420529f15477e6"},{"title":"Promises Donald Trump has made so far in his campaign for a second term","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-20 01:33:19","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/04/politics/trump-campaign-promises-dg","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The former president has made a number of promises on the campaign trail. Here are some of the policies Trump says he would enact if elected for a second term.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump, now the presumptive Republican nominee, has made a number of promises on the campaign trail, including rolling back car pollution rules, building 10 new cities and appointing a special prosecutor to investigate President Joe Biden and his family. While some of Trump's plans are lacking in detail, here are some of the policies he says he would enact if elected for a second term. Trump has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal last month and making a trip to the southern border on February 29, where he touted his previous hard-line immigration policies. In a Des Moines Register op-ed published roughly a week before winning the Iowa caucuses in January, Trump vowed to use the 'Alien Enemies Act to remove known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States.' 'We will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement \u2014 including parts of the DEA, ATF, FBI, and DHS,' he wrote. In a video posted on Truth Social in late February before his border visit, Trump also promised to 'carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.' After the Israel-Hamas war began last October, Trump also promised to terminate the visas of 'Hamas' sympathizers.' 'We'll get them off our college campuses, out of our cities and get them the hell out of our country, if that's OK with you,' he added. Trump announced plans in a September 2023 campaign video to close the Department of Education and send 'all education and education work and needs back to the states.' 'We want them to run the education of our children, because they'll do a much better job of it,' he added. The former president has also promised to 'put parents back in charge and give them the final say' in education. In a January 2023 campaign video, the former president said he would give funding preferences and 'favorable treatment' to schools that allow parents to elect principals, abolish teacher tenure for K-12 teachers, use merit pay to incentivize quality teaching and cut the number of school administrators, such as those overseeing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Trump also said in that campaign video that he would cut funding for schools that teach critical race theory and gender ideology. In a later speech, Trump said he would bring back the 1776 Commission, which was launched in his previous administration to 'teach our values and promote our history and our traditions to our children.' The former president said he would charge the Department of Justice and the Department of Education with investigating civil rights violations of race-based discrimination in schools while also removing 'Marxists' from the Department of Education. A second Trump administration would pursue violations in schools of both the Constitution's Establishment and Free Exercise clauses, which prohibit the government establishment of religion and protect a citizen's right to practice their own religion, he said. Last November, Trump promised to replace the Affordable Care Act, known colloquially as Obamacare, in a series of posts on Truth Social. A Trump-backed effort to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in 2017 after three Republicans senators joined with Democrats to vote against the bill. 'Getting much better Healthcare than Obamacare for the American people will be a priority of the Trump Administration,' he said. 'It is not a matter of cost, it is a matter of HEALTH. America will have one of the best Healthcare Plans anywhere in the world. Right now it has one of the WORST!,' he continued. He also doubled down on his vow during a speech in early January. Trump also vowed in a June 2023 campaign video to reinstate his previous executive order so that the US government would pay the same price for pharmaceuticals as other developed countries. Some of the former president's pharmaceutical policies were overturned by Biden. Trump has promised to use the Department of Justice to attack critics and former allies. In several videos and speeches, the former president also laid out plans to gut the current justice system by firing 'radical Marxist prosecutors that are destroying America.' 'I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,' Trump said in June 2023 remarks. 'I will totally obliterate the Deep State.' Trump said in a campaign video last year that he would reinstate a 2020 executive order to remove 'rogue' bureaucrats and propose a constitutional amendment for term limits on members of Congress. To address what he labeled the 'disturbing' relationship between technology platforms and the government, the former president said in a January 2023 video that he would enact a seven-year cooling off period before employees at agencies such as the FBI or CIA can work for platforms that oversee mass user data. Trump added in multiple campaign releases that he would task the Justice Department with investigating online censorship, ban federal agencies from 'colluding' to censor citizens and suspend federal money to universities participating in 'censorship-supporting activities.' In a September 2023 speech at the Family Research Council's Pray Vote Stand Summit in Washington, DC, Trump also touted plans to continue appointing conservative judges. 'I will once again appoint rock-solid conservative judges to do what they have to do in the mold of Justices Antonin Scalia; Samuel Alito, a great gentleman; and another great gentleman, Clarence Thomas,' he said. Trump has also pledged to 'appoint U.S. Attorneys who will be the polar opposite of the Soros District Attorneys and others that are being appointed throughout the United States.' In a September 2023 speech in Washington, DC, Trump also announced that he would appoint a task force to review the cases of people he claimed had been 'unjustly persecuted by the Biden administration.' Trump noted that he wanted to 'study the situation very quickly, and sign their pardons or commutations on day one.' It's a move that could lead to potential pardons of many rioters from the January 6, 2021, insurrection \u2013 which he suggested he would do at a CNN town hall in May 2023. * Only promises on judge appointments and congressional term limits are similar to prior campaigns Trump said in two February 2023 campaign videos that if 'Marxist' prosecutors refuse to charge crimes and surrender 'our cities to violent criminals,' he 'will not hesitate to send in federal law enforcement to restore peace and public safety.' Trump added that he would instruct the Department of Justice to open civil rights investigations into 'radical left' prosecutors' offices that engaged in racial enforcement of the law, encourage Congress to use their legal authority over Washington, DC, to restore 'law and order' and overhaul federal standards of disciplining minors to address rising crimes like carjackings. Addressing policies made in what Trump calls the 'Democrats' war on police,' the former president vowed in a campaign video that he would pass a 'record investment' to hire and retrain police, strengthen protections like qualified immunity, increase penalties for assaulting law enforcement officers and deploy the National Guard when local law enforcement 'refuses to act.' The former president added that he would require law enforcement agencies that receive money from his funding investment or the Department of Justice to use 'proven common sense' measures such as stop-and-frisk. Trump has continued his attacks against member countries of NATO, a European and North American defense alliance. At a South Carolina rally last month, Trump said he would not abide by the alliance's collective-defense clause and would encourage Russia to do 'whatever the hell they want' if a member country didn't meet spending guidelines. 'NATO was busted until I came along,' Trump said. 'I said, \u2018Everybody's gonna pay.' They said, \u2018Well, if we don't pay, are you still going to protect us?' I said, \u2018Absolutely not.' They couldn't believe the answer.' The former president has also previously pledged to end the war in Ukraine, though he's offered no details on how he would do so. 'Shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,' Trump said at a New Hampshire campaign event last year, adding in another speech that it would take him 'no longer than one day' to settle the war if elected. Trump further addressed his strategy of stopping the 'never-ending wars' by vowing to remove 'warmongers,' 'frauds' and 'failures in the senior ranks of our government,' and replace them with national security officials who would defend America's interests. The former president added in a campaign video that he would stop lobbyists and government contractors from pushing senior military officials toward war. In addition, Trump has said he would restore his 'wonderful' travel ban on individuals from several majority-Muslim countries to 'keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country' after Biden overturned the ban in 2021. Trump said in multiple campaign videos that he would spearhead an effort to build so-called 'Freedom Cities' to 'reopen the frontier, reignite American imagination, and give hundreds of thousands of young people and other people, all hardworking families, a new shot at home ownership and in fact, the American Dream.' In his plan, the federal government would charter 10 new cities on federal land, awarding them to areas with the best development proposals. The former president said in a campaign video that the Freedom Cities would bring the return of US manufacturing, economic opportunity, new industries and affordable living. In the March 2023 video, Trump added that the US under a second Trump administration would lead in efforts to 'develop vertical-takeoff-and-landing vehicles for families and individuals,' not letting China lead 'this revolution in air mobility.' The former president said these airborne vehicles would change commerce and bring wealth into rural communities. At the same rally in South Carolina, Trump pledged to impose 'stiff penalties on China and other trade abusers.' 'It's called you screw us, and we screw you,' Trump said. Under his proposed 'Trump Reciprocal Trade Act,' the former president said if other countries impose tariffs on the US, the country would impose 'a reciprocal, identical' tariff right back. It was the same pledge Trump made in a campaign video in 2023: to impose the same tariffs that other countries may impose on the US on those countries. The goal, the former president said then, is to get other countries to drop their tariffs. As part of a larger strategy to bring jobs back into the US, Trump also said he would implement his so-called 'America First' trade agenda if elected. By setting universal baseline tariffs on a majority of foreign goods, the former president said Americans would see taxes decrease as tariffs increase. His proposal also includes a four-year plan to phase out all Chinese imports of essential goods, as well as stopping China from buying up America and stopping the investment of US companies in China. Trump also said in February that he would consider imposing a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports if he's reelected. The former president has particularly focused on China, vowing in a January 2023 campaign video to restrict Chinese ownership of US infrastructure such as energy, technology, telecommunications and natural resources. Trump also said he would force the Chinese to sell current holdings that may put national security at risk. 'Economic security is national security,' he said. ``\nFormer President Donald Trump, now the presumptive Republican nominee, has made a number of promises on the campaign trail, including rolling back car pollution rules, building 10 new cities and appointing a special prosecutor to investigate President Joe Biden and his family.\nWhile some of Trump's plans are lacking in detail, here are some of the policies he says he would enact if elected for a second term.\nTrump has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal last month and making a trip to the southern border on February 29, where he touted his previous hard-line immigration policies.\nIn a Des Moines Register op-ed published roughly a week before winning the Iowa caucuses in January, Trump vowed to use the 'Alien Enemies Act to remove known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States.'\n'We will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement \u2014 including parts of the DEA, ATF, FBI, and DHS,' he wrote.\nIn a video posted on Truth Social in late February before his border visit, Trump also promised to 'carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.'\nAfter the Israel-Hamas war began last October, Trump also promised to terminate the visas of 'Hamas' sympathizers.'\n'We'll get them off our college campuses, out of our cities and get them the hell out of our country, if that's OK with you,' he added.\nTrump announced plans in a September 2023 campaign video to close the Department of Education and send 'all education and education work and needs back to the states.'\n'We want them to run the education of our children, because they'll do a much better job of it,' he added.\nThe former president has also promised to 'put parents back in charge and give them the final say' in education.

CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 It was a week of unexpected developments in an unpredictable but consequential election year.\nHere are the surprise developments and what they could mean for the future:\nUnless you've been stranded off the grid in Antarctica, you know that former President Donald Trump is on trial in New York on charges of falsifying business records related to hush money payments made before the 2016 election. This overriding lead story was the subject of blanket TV coverage and banner headlines.\nThe surprise is that a jury selection process predicted to take weeks was over in days. Twelve jurors and six alternates will sit in judgment of the former president.\nThere were multiple hiccups, such as when one juror reconsidered her ability to remain impartial or when a self-immolation created a scene outside the courthouse.\nRelated article How a trial works: Trump's first criminal case is in court\nRelated article How a trial works: Trump's first criminal case is in court But the end result is the most important thing. The first of four potential criminal trials of Trump is happening. Opening arguments get underway next week.\nWe can't say exactly who will testify because the prosecution won't tell Trump's team which witnesses they will call first. They anticipate Trump will violate a gag order and trash talk whoever takes the stand.\nWhat we do know is that Trump has already tried to seed a conspiracy theory that the jury is somehow biased against him. This despite the open process that led to the seating of the anonymous jury.\n'Help' is probably the wrong word. When 165 Democrats voted with 151 Republicans in favor of House Speaker Mike Johnson's plan to hold votes on aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, it ossified the aggravation at Johnson from the right wing of his party.\nThree Republicans \u2013 Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona \u2013 have said they will support a plan to oust Johnson from the speaker's chair.\nJohnson, meanwhile, refused to protect himself by changing House rules to make it harder to fire him. He has maintained the support of most Republicans and of Trump. At least for now.\nThe fault lines in the GOP, evident for years, are under immense stress. If Johnson is to keep his spot as speaker, he'll probably need help as soon as next week from Democrats for that too.\nIt would be something that looks like bipartisan or coalition governing, which would be music to any moderate American's ears. And if Johnson keeps his position as well as passes what most Americans and lawmakers want, his skill at leadership will deserve a reexamination. More to come next week.\nMost lawmakers in the House and Senate support giving more military aid to Ukraine as it fends off Russia's invasion. But the opposition of the right wing of the GOP has delayed the aid since the White House requested it in October.\nJohnson, although a bona fide conservative and a skeptic at times of Ukraine aid, is finally on the cusp of getting the vote done in the House. It's a major development.\nBut the fight over aid has also uncovered some uncomfortable truths, such as the prominence of the nationalist-veering GOP right wing, which is not afraid to say it doesn't put much stock in supporting democracies around the world.\nTit-for-tat strikes and responses between Israel and Iran in recent weeks have threatened to spark an all-out conflagration between the two countries.\nThis week, Iran responded to Israel's strike on a Syrian diplomatic facility with its own strikes, which Israel responded to on Friday with a strike on Iran. But the takeaway of many analysts was that might be it for a while.\nHere's Tamara Qiblawi in CNN's Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter:\nThis month's dramatic escalation, which kicked off with an apparent Israeli airstrike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, followed by a largely foiled Iranian attack of over 300 airborne weapons on Israel, seems to have given way to a rapid climbdown. Shortly after the Friday morning attack in Iran, a regional intelligence source told CNN's Nic Robertson that Iran was not expected to respond further, and that the direct state-to-state strikes between the two enemy states were over.

Read more from Qiblawi. With all the Trump trial coverage, you might have missed that President Joe Biden is running a spirited presidential campaign. While Trump is spending most days at his trial, Biden is going all over the map.\nThis week, he was in Philadelphia, where he went to a Wawa, and he was in Pittsburgh, where he went to a Sheetz. He was in Pennsylvania for a three-day swing to push his economic populism. If he can sustain the blue wall that wins Democrats their recent presidencies, it's this kind of tailored campaigning that will do it.\nAs Trump was spinning conspiracy theories outside his trial, Biden was adopting some of Trump's message on issues like tariffs, while drawing a bright line between the two of them on the key American issue of protecting democracy.\nAll of Biden's hard work won't quiet the critics who point to his age and wonder if he's up to the job, but it's impossible to argue the man is not trying very hard to convince people he wants to remain president.\nThe term 'Bidenomics' is either an insult or a brag, depending on the circumstances.\nBiden's economic pitch, as earnest as it was this week, might be a hard sell to Americans who still acutely feel the pinch of inflation and feel priced out of everything from the housing market to the restaurant scene.\nThe International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, is worried not about a US recession, but rather that the US economy is too hot compared with other countries, according to a report released this week.

She thinks the third vote taking place this week will be different.\n'It's a totally different ball game,' she said. 'The atmosphere is different. You see more pro-union than anti-union [workers]. A whole lot of people who were anti-union in the past have switched.'\nof people who were anti-union in the past have switched.' The union vote at the Volkswagen plant will mean more than whether the 4,300 hourly workers in Chattanooga are members of the UAW or not. It could be the start of a revolution in the US auto industry, which has not seen a new automaker unionize in nearly 50 years.\nToday the industry is split almost evenly between unionized and nonunion workers at US auto factories, and the unionization of a factory in Tennessee would give unions a high profile beachhead in the South, which has long been difficult territory for unions to organize.\nBecause the plant is in Tennessee, and not Michigan or Pennsylvania or some more unionized northern state, the results could be close, as they were in the two previous votes in 2014 and 2019 at the plant. The latest vote saw 52% decide against joining the union.\nagainst joining the union. The plant has more than doubled its workforce from the 1,600 eligible to vote in the 2019 election. Supporters of the union are hoping that many of the new, younger workers will be more union-friendly than the workers in 2019.\nOpponents of the union among rank-and-file are hoping the union will lose out again, although they admit they're not sure that will happen this time.\n'I don't know. It could go either way,' said Darrell Belcher, who also started work soon after the plant opened. 'The last time we were concerned it would swing [to the union]. I'm hearing people say there are more people against it than people think.'\nBut it's not just that there are more, and different workers at the Volkswagen plant than last time.\nPrevious votes were held after the union had negotiated concession contracts in which members at the unionized automakers had given up past gains, and in the wake of a corruption scandal that would land two former union presidents in prison.\nThis time the UAW is coming in a winner, after negotiating record wage increases at GM, Ford and Stellantis. The unprecedented simultaneous strike at all three automakers won immediate raises of at least 11% and pay increases of more than 30% over the life of the contract that runs through April 2028.\nEven though Volkswagen quickly matched the UAW's contracts with the Big Three with an 11% raise of its own, Berry said their contract in Chattanooga is still not as good as the UAW deals, and people know that.\n'It opened up a lot of people's eyes. That had a big impact,' Berry said.\n'People here were rooting for [the strikers],' said Kelcey Smith, another union supporter who has been at VW for about a year. 'It [the strike and the deal that followed] showed what you can achieve.'\nSmith said he has never had a union-represented job , and despite his support for the union effort, it doesn't mean that he holds anything against the company. 'I love my job. I enjoy being an employee here,' he said.\n, and despite his support for the union effort, it doesn't mean that he holds anything against the company. 'I love my job. I enjoy being an employee here,' he said. But he said he wants the better pay and benefits he sees workers at unionized auto plants are getting, in order to provide more for his family.\nVolkswagen said the average worker in its plant makes about $60,000 a year before bonuses and benefits. Production workers working under the recent UAW contract now make about $36 an hour, or about $75,000 a year before overtime, bonuses and benefits.\n'I want to be financially safe, to give them a cushion in life,' Smith said. 'I want to do what I can to make things better for them.'\nBut Belcher said he's worried what will happen to his job if the union were to win the pay its supporters at the plant are promising they'll achieve after a UAW win.\n'In my opinion, if Volkswagen were to agree to something like that, they'd pack up and be gone to Mexico,' he said.\nThe company said it is neutral in the election, only urging workers to vote however they want. That's relatively rare in union representation elections, where management often lobbies workers to vote no at mandatory meetings, and sometimes takes action against union organizers. Even union supporters acknowledge that hasn't happened in this case, however.\nOne thing helping the UAW is that unions have much more clout in Germany than in the United States, and the main Volkswagen union there has a seat on the company's board. This is also the only VW plant without union representation.\nThe vote is the first of an effort by the UAW to organize workers at 13 nonunion automakers spread across the country, mostly in the South .\n. Another vote, at a Mercedes plant just outside of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, is set to be completed by May 17. And efforts are underway to organize workers at the American plants of eight other foreign automakers beyond VW and Mercedes \u2013 BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota, and Volvo, as well as the plants of three US-based electric vehicle makers \u2013 Tesla, Rivian and Lucid.\nat a Mercedes plant just outside of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, is set to be completed by May 17. And efforts are underway to organize workers at the American plants of eight other foreign automakers beyond VW and Mercedes \u2013 BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota, and Volvo, as well as the plants of three US-based electric vehicle makers \u2013 Tesla, Rivian and Lucid.\nTogether the US plants of those companies have about 150,000 workers, roughly as many as the three unionized automakers whose workers went on strike last year.\nEven if the union wins in Chattanooga, it could be an uphill battle to win at the other companies, said Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University's Industrial and Labor Relations school. But it would be an important step in the broader organizing effort, he said. And that could change the dynamics in future auto contract negotiations.\n'It won't be like dominoes where the others all fall quickly,' he said. 'But it'll start to build momentum. As you get more plants organized, you have more leverage at the table and you can set an industry [contract] pattern.'\nBecause of the potential for organizing efforts to pick up steam once one plant joins the union, the vote is closely watched by people across the auto industry and the labor movements, as well as by politicians across the South, who have worked hard to attract manufacturers to their states with promises of a union-free work force.\n'The reality is companies have choices when it comes to where to invest and bring jobs and opportunity. We have worked tirelessly on behalf of our constituents to bring good-paying jobs to our states,' said a letter signed by this week by Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee and five other Southern governors \u2013 from Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas \u2013 who have nonunion auto plants in their states. 'Unionization would certainly put our states' jobs in jeopardy.'\nFewer than 5% of workers belong to unions in those six states, which is less than half the union representation in the seven more northern industrial states where the Big Three have most of their plants.\nIt's not just Republican governors who are weighing in on the vote. President Joe Biden, who became the first president to visit a picket line during the UAW strike last fall, and who has been endorsed by the UAW, congratulated the Volkswagen workers when they filed for the election last month. But Biden's ties to the union aren't playing particularly well among the rank-and-file who will be voting at the Chattanooga plant.\n'I know a lot of people on the pro side have switched over,' said Corey Linn, a 13-year employee and one of those working against the union. 'The biggest argument to make the switch is once they found out that Biden was backing the UAW. He's not very popular in Tennessee.'\nUnion supporters say they have also heard from co-workers who are afraid that their dues money would go to Biden, even though political donations from unions don't come from the dues money collected.\n'You hear all of that, \u2018Why are they supporting Biden?'' Berry said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"business","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Chris Isidore,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/large-17647-volkswagenchattanooga.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNbusiness","_score":5.597302,"_id":"76aed43773ecea7aa318116a8d23209c"},{"title":"Israeli and Iranian strikes transform\u00a0Middle East geopolitics","author":"Stephen Collinson","published_date":"2024-04-19 16:13:39","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/19/politics/israel-iran-strike-analysis","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Israel and Iran have now thrust the Middle East into a dangerous new era by erasing the taboo against overt military strikes on one another's territory.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Israel and Iran have now thrust the Middle East into a dangerous new era by erasing the taboo against overt military strikes on one another's territory.\nThe question now is whether each side's imperatives to demonstrate deterrence and to save face have been satisfied \u2013 or whether the enemies are destined to enter a new cycle of escalation that could make the crisis even more perilous.\nMost immediately, the ball is in Iran's court after Israel conducted strikes near the city of Isfahan early Friday.\nInitial reports suggest that the action was limited and, according to US officials, did not target Iranian nuclear sites in the area. Instead, it may have been intended to demonstrate Israeli capacity to penetrate deep into Iran following Iran's unprecedented missile and drone attack on Israel last weekend, which was largely thwarted.\nStill, the fact that Israel chose a target inside Iran rather than confining its response to Iranian proxies in Syria or Iraq, for instance, significantly ups the ante in the confrontation and raises the possibility that the showdown could quickly get out of control.\nThe Israeli action last weekend that was largely repulsed by Israeli, US and allied defensive systems followed an Israeli strike on Iranian consular buildings in Damascus, Syria, that killed two senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers.\nWith the latest twist of the crisis, Israel's strikes appeared to be trying to thread a needle in demonstrating that it can evade Iranian defenses at will \u2013 and in the vicinity of Iranian nuclear facilities \u2013 while not creating a situation that would oblige Iran to respond with another escalation that could push the rivals toward all-out war.\nThe risk in trying to navigate this narrow path is that the region is so on edge six months into Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza and the political tensions are so acute inside both countries that it is hard for each side to accurately assess exactly how the other might react.\nHours before the Israeli strikes, for instance, Iran had warned that any Israeli attack would be met with a robust response. Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told CNN that such action would be 'immediate and at a maximum level.'\nStill, early indications were on Friday that Iran is prepared to end this particular phase of escalation without stepping up another rung on the confrontational ladder and that Israel \u2013 while rebuffing international calls for restraint \u2013 may still have taken US and Western concerns about the possibility of sparking a major regional war into account.\nIranian official media and government officials were downplaying the attack on Friday. And a regional intelligence source with knowledge of Iran's potential reaction to Friday's strike said that direct state-to-state strikes between the two enemies were 'over.' The source, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told CNN that, to his knowledge, Iran was not expected to respond to the strikes \u2014 but did not give a reason.\nIf subsequent events bear this out, Israel may succeed in fulfilling a strategic maxim laid out by President John Kennedy in 1963 as he reflected upon the Cuban missile crisis the previous year when he said that statesmanship must aim to 'avert those confrontations which bring an adversary to a choice of either a humiliating retreat or a nuclear war.' The danger was not a nuclear war in this case but a tit-for-tat climb into a major conventional conflict that could have consumed the entire region and killed many Iranians, Israelis and people in neighboring countries. As it stands, neither Iran nor Israel have been forced into a humiliating retreat \u2013 and that may be the key to containing the situation.\nIsrael's attack on Iran also represents a rebuff by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of President Joe Biden's advice to treat the successful interception of nearly all the drones and missiles directed at Israel as a victory. The president had argued that the massive defensive operation proved Iran couldn't pose a threat to Israel's security and that further retaliation was not required.\nWhile there does seem to have been an effort by Israel to consider US and Western anxieties about a wider war, Netanyahu has repeatedly ignored Biden's entreaties \u2014 including months of US complaints about the Israeli conduct of the war in Gaza and its toll on Palestinian civilians following the October 7 Hamas terror attacks. The president, though getting increasingly frustrated with Netanyahu, has not been willing to lay down red lines for the Israeli prime minister or to condition the use of US arms shipments in Gaza.\nBut Biden also came up against the reality that Israel is a sovereign state, and while strongly reliant on the United States, was unlikely ever to allow a mass air attack directed at its territory to go unanswered. In the aftermath of latest developments, Washington is concentrating on a new effort to stop tensions from rising further while distancing itself from the Israeli action.\n'What we're focused on, what the G7 is focused on, and again, it's reflected in our statement and in our conversation, is our work to de-escalate tensions,' Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a conference of foreign ministers from industrialized nations in Italy.\nThe White House did make clear in recent days that it would not join any Israeli offensive actions against Iran. But US military forces will almost certainly be called upon to defend Israel again in the event of a major Iranian retaliation. Biden thus could get dragged ever deeper into a military conflict in the region that he has repeatedly tried and failed to stop. The political consequences would be grave for the president in November as presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump warns the world is spinning out of control on his watch. Biden has already paid a heavy price among progressive, young and Arab American voters over his support for Israel, which could have serious implications for his performance in swing states that will decide the presidential election. And any spike in oil prices caused by uncertainty in the Middle East ahead of the election could push up the cost of gasoline and exact a painful political price on the president.\nIsrael, for all its military prowess, is in a deeply vulnerable position. It is now effectively fighting on three fronts \u2014 against Hamas in Gaza; another Iranian proxy, Hezbollah, in a simmering conflict over the Lebanon border; and directly against Iran itself.\nThe threat from Hezbollah is especially acute since the radical group has tens of thousands of missiles that could cause carnage in Israeli cities far greater than the threat posed by Hamas rockets at the start of the Gaza war. A full-scale entry by Hezbollah into the conflict to support Iran would be certain to trigger a massive Israeli response. That would bring war back to Lebanon, a nation already cursed by a desperate modern history and home to the Iran-backed militia.\nEvents of the last few days mean that even if the region doesn't tip into a large-scale war immediately, previous assumptions that Iran would never openly attack Israel and Israel would not strike at Iranian soil have been shattered.\n'Even if you get through this phase without a major Iranian retaliation, the reality is that Israel and Iran are going to be locked in this competitive struggle,' Aaron David Miller, a veteran Middle East peace negotiator for Republicans and Democratic presidents, told CNN. 'There is no solution to the problem of Iranian proxies. There's no solution to the fact that Iran is a nuclear weapons threshold state. And this relationship is going to be hanging over the region and perhaps the international community like some sword of Damocles.'\nIsrael faced intense pressure to show restraint not just from the United States but also from European and Arab powers, several of which joined the US and Israeli operation to shoot down Iran's drones and missiles last weekend. While US support for Israel is assured, the reaction of those other countries will be critical now that Netanyahu decided to ignore advice from Israel's defenders. One argument for Israel not retaliating against Iran had been that it could benefit from a wave of sympathy and support and begin to repair ties with allies that fervently criticized its conduct of the war in Gaza. That opportunity might already have been squandered.\nIsrael, however, regards itself as locked in an existential battle with Iran, one that played out until now in covert and cyber-attacks on its nuclear program, scientists and military and intelligence infrastructure. History shows that when Israeli leaders feel their country's survival is threatened, they often act unilaterally even when the United States counsels restraint. Such a doctrine led to previous Israeli attacks on nuclear facilities in Iraq and Syria.\nBy striking back at Israel after the Damascus attack, Iran was making an implicit statement that Israel could not escape paying a price for such attacks anymore and that they'd be met by a direct response.\nFor Israel's war cabinet, which mulled for days its response to the airborne Iranian barrage, the idea that Iran enjoyed the advantage in their geopolitical game of chicken would have been untenable.\nMalcolm Davis, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told CNN's Michael Holmes that the latest actions did set the stage for a long-term escalatory cycle that generates from instability in the region. But the apparent Israeli capacity to elude Iran's air defenses may also reestablish Israel's strategic edge. 'I do think it sends a message to Tehran that really they are more vulnerable to Israeli strikes than they would like to admit,' Davis said.\nSome experts worry that the new reality of direct exchanges with Israel may prompt Iran \u2013 which is estimated by experts to be only weeks away from being able to produce its own nuclear weapon \u2013 to rush across the nuclear threshold. That would be a situation that neither Israel \u2013 nor probably the United States \u2013 could accept, so the rising danger of recent days may only be a taste of what is to come.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Stephen Collinson","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap24110402233044.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":5.594817,"_id":"8bae1511f60f2e8f2940089e128ff434"},{"title":"Analysis: Trump's first criminal trial is a historic and solemn moment for America","author":"Stephen Collinson","published_date":"2024-04-15 04:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/14/politics/trump-first-criminal-trial-analysis","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The United States will cross a historic threshold on Monday when for the first time a former president goes on criminal trial in a case laced with fateful significance because Donald Trump could be\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 The United States will cross a historic threshold on Monday when for the first time a former president goes on criminal trial in a case laced with fateful significance because Donald Trump could be back in the Oval Office next year.\nWhen the presumptive GOP nominee walks into court for the start of jury selection, he and the country will enter a new state of reality as legal and political worlds collide in a trial almost guaranteed to deepen Americans' bitter ideological estrangement.\nThe trial, related to hush money payments to an adult film actress before the 2016 election, will mark yet another extraordinary twist in the story of Trump, whose incessant testing of the limits of presidential decorum and the law has caused nearly nine years of political tumult and may still have years left to run. It raises the possibility that, depending on the jury's verdict, the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election could be a convicted felon. And given the case's subject matter \u2014 details about a payment to a woman who alleged that she had a sexual relationship with Trump, which he denies \u2014 it could reflect poorly on Trump's character and ethics as voters weigh their decisions in November.\nHush money payments are not illegal. Trump is accused of falsifying business records to keep unflattering information that could have hurt his campaign from the voters in an alleged early example of election interference. The fact that this case stems from alleged personal conduct means that it could have a lesser political impact than Trump's three other looming trials, which are rooted in greater constitutional and legal concerns pertinent to the powers of the presidency.\nThe fact that this case stems from alleged personal conduct means that it could have a lesser political impact than Trump's three other looming trials, which are rooted in greater constitutional and legal concerns pertinent to the powers of the presidency. But the success of the ex-president's legal delaying tactics in the other cases \u2014 related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election and hoarding of classified documents \u2014 means the hush money trial may be the only one to take place before the election. And Trump \u2014 though he is entitled to the presumption of innocence and the airing of evidence like any other defendant \u2014 is showing signs of increasing agitation at the prospect of the trial and the indignity it represents for someone who used to be the most powerful man in the world.\nStill, if he had to choose only one of the quartet of cases to reach a conclusion before the election, it would be this one.\nRelated article Your questions about Trump's trial, answered\nRelated article Your questions about Trump's trial, answered The United States, unlike democracies that have been historically less stable, is not a nation accustomed to seeing its former heads of state on trial. While the circumstances of this case and Trump's broader legal troubles are unique, this new precedent does open the possibility that it will be less of a leap for future presidents to be pursued by legal investigations. Indeed, Trump has already warned that if he wins in November, he will dedicate his second presidency to 'retribution' and will use the powers of the presidency to go after his foes, including the Biden family.\nNone of this is remotely normal. But it is all part of the extreme political, legal and constitutional challenges that Trump constantly poses to US institutions and that he is signaling would intensify if he wins a second term. The incessant cacophony stirred by his volcanic personality is by design \u2014 it makes it hard for Americans to process each distinct Rubicon that is crossed.\nThe former president has made fervent attempts to delegitimize the case, the judge and the legal system itself \u2014 partly to hedge against any future guilty verdicts. He has blasted Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat who is leading the prosecution, as politically biased. And Judge Juan Merchan expanded a gag order after Trump named his daughter, who has done work for Democrats, on social media.\nWhile the trial will not be televised, it is bound to be a national spectacle over the period of six weeks to two months that it is expected to last. In his previous civil trials, including a massive fraud case that went against him, Trump has used court breaks to stage free rolling and often angry televised news conferences, seeking to attack the probity of the court and to air issues in the case. He has often been an obstreperous defendant, infringing the behavioral codes of the courtroom and infuriating judges. At one point during the civil fraud trial, Judge Arthur Engoron admonished Trump for turning the courtroom into the campaign trail, and asked his attorney, 'Can you control your client?'\nFor all of Trump's claims of unfair treatment by the legal system, many other defendants would likely have faced far harsher treatment for their attacks on trials, prosecutors and court officers.\nWhile the Manhattan trial is in session four days a week, the ex-president will be required to attend \u2014 at a time when President Joe Biden will be free to blitz swing states. This is one reason why Trump's 2024 campaign is running as much through the courtrooms as according to the traditional rhythms of a White House bid.\nThe moment Trump shows up in the courtroom on Monday will be one of unfathomable drama and a test for members of the pool of citizens who will be vetted for service on a jury like none other in American history. 'He's the most famous person in the world. And when you've come face-to-face with somebody that's got that kind of charisma, that kind of power, it tends to be intimidating, it tends to be shocking, it tends to be exciting,' Robert Hirschhorn, a jury and trial consultant, said on CNN on Friday.\nThe task of finding jurors who lack strong opinions and prejudices against a defendant and the legal system , who can serve for a prolonged period and will make judgements solely based on the law and the evidence, is complex in any case. Because the accused is Trump, legal experts are predicting that jury selection could take as long as a week or more, which must conclude before prosecutors lay out their opening arguments against the former president.\n, who can serve for a prolonged period and will make judgements solely based on the law and the evidence, is complex in any case. Because the accused is Trump, legal experts are predicting that jury selection could take as long as a week or more, which must conclude before prosecutors lay out their opening arguments against the former president. But as he contemplates the beginning of his trial, Trump appears to be gleaning an understanding that his fate is now out of his hands and will be soon in those of 12 anonymous citizens whom he will not be allowed to bully, persuade or politicize. 'Jury selection is largely luck. It depends who you get. It's very unfair that I'm having a trial there,' Trump said on Friday, alluding to New York City's liberal lean.\nTrump is already seeking to turn the trial into a circus to further his merged legal defense and chief campaign argument that he's being persecuted by 'deranged prosecutors' trying to bar his return to the Oval Office. He branded himself as a 'proud political dissident' at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February and has compared himself to South African anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela and dead Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. On Saturday night in the swing state of Pennsylvania, Trump promised, 'I will be fighting for the freedom of 325 million Americans,' as he embarked on an unprecedented shuttle between a criminal trial and the campaign trail. On Sunday, he used his Truth Social network to blast 'a blatant and unprecedented attack' against his campaign and claimed that Biden coordinated with Bragg. There is no evidence that this is true.\nTrump's arguments are convincing to many Republican voters who embraced his narrative of persecution and made him their nominee in quick time this year. But will he be able to convince undecided general election voters that he's a victim, or will his first trial thicken a cloud of criminality that could doom his White House hopes and improve Biden's chances of landing a second term? Some polls have shown that a minority of Republican voters might have pause about voting for the ex-president if he is found guilty after a trial. But the circumstances are so unusual that it is impossible to predict how the politics of a conviction or an acquittal could play out.\nPolitical uncertainty over the case is being exacerbated by the charged backdrop. There is no clear leader in national polling in the race between Biden and Trump, which is likely to be decided by thousands of votes in a handful of battleground states. The president's prospects are being challenged by high interest rates and elevated prices that are causing pain for millions of Americans. Biden spent the weekend presiding over a successful defense of Israel after Iran sent hundreds of missiles and drones toward the Jewish state as fears of a wider Middle East war spiked. The deteriorating situation could bolster Trump's claims the world is spinning out of control under his successor's watch. That means that this and any future Trump trials \u2014 while a never-before-seen interruption to a presidential election campaign \u2014 may be only one factor that decides the destiny of the White House in November.\nTrump is charged in Manhattan with falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in what prosecutors said was an attempt to interfere in the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty and has denied having an affair with Daniels.\n'Manhattan is home to the country's most significant business market. We cannot allow New York businesses to manipulate their records to cover up criminal conduct,' Bragg wrote as he unveiled the indictment \u2014 Trump's first \u2014 in April 2023. 'The trail of money and lies exposes a pattern that, the People allege, violates one of New York's basic and fundamental business laws.'\nTrump's supporters claim that he's a victim of selective and politicized justice because he is being prosecuted over what they contend is a novel legal theory in a case stemming from personal embarrassments and campaign finance infringements. But Bragg's framing of the case identifies a common theme with Trump's other indictments: Is a president accountable to the same laws as every other citizen, or he is above the law?\n'This payment was made to deprive voters of essential information, which in turn was covered up with the intent to affect an election. \u2026 That's the allegation \u2013 deceiving voters to grasp power,' said Norm Eisen, a CNN legal analyst and author of the new book 'Trying Trump: A Guide to His First Election Interference Criminal Trial. '\n' Eisen added: ' Now , Alvin Bragg might not prove it \u2014 but that is why this is an alleged election interference case.'\n' Now , Alvin Bragg might not prove it \u2014 but that is why this is an alleged election interference case.' Trump's attorneys have argued that this trial should be delayed until the Supreme Court rules on his sweeping claims of presidential immunity arising from the federal election interference case brought by special counsel Jack Smith. While the initial conduct at issue in this case took place before Trump was president, prosecutors argue that he signed off on the alleged cover-up to reimburse his lawyer Michael Cohen for phony legal services while president.\nAs part of a desperate flurry of filings designed to postpone accountability in the hush money case, the former president has also been claiming that he cannot get a fair trial in New York \u2014 the city where he made his name but that has overwhelmingly voted against him. Merchan has declined efforts by the president's attorneys to get the trial relocated to a jurisdiction where voters may be more favorable to Trump.\nThe former president is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. If convicted, he could face probation or a maximum sentence of 1 1/3 to 4 years on each count in state prison. Many legal experts believe that, as a first offender, Trump would not face jail time, or that if he did, any custodial sentences would run concurrently.\nTrump's attorneys have not tipped their hand over possible defenses. But it's almost certain they will attack the credibility and personal testimony of both Cohen and Daniels. Cohen will face criticism for being an unreliable witness after spending time in prison after being convicted of tax offenses, of lying to Congress and other offenses.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Stephen Collinson","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap24095480999035.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":5.574749,"_id":"043f15ef41c735d3e099140e61125dce"},{"title":"CIA director warns Ukraine\u00a0could\u00a0lose war\u00a0with\u00a0Russia by the end of the year unless US sends more aid","author":"Katie Bo Lillis","published_date":"2024-04-18 19:12:57","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/18/politics/cia-director-ukraine-russia-warning","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"CIA Director Bill Burns on Thursday warned that unless US sends more military support, Ukraine could 'lose' the war against Russia by the end of the year.","summary":"CIA Director Bill Burns on Thursday warned that unless US sends more military support, Ukraine could 'lose' the war against Russia by the end of the year.\nHis comments mark one of the starkest warnings to date from the Biden administration on the stakes in Ukraine as Congress debates whether to approve a long-delayed aid package to Kyiv.\nJust a month ago, Burns had warned in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee that if Congress did not move to authorize additional support \u2014 long hampered by conservative opposition in the House of Representatives \u2014 'Ukraine is likely to lose ground and probably significant ground in 2024.'\nBut on Thursday during an appearance at the George W. Bush Center, he warned that Ukraine could be forced to capitulate entirely.\n'With the boost that would come from military assistance, both practically and psychologically, I think the Ukrainians are entirely capable of holding their own through 2024,' Burns said.\n'Without supplemental assistance, the picture is a lot more dire,' he continued. 'There is a very real risk that the Ukrainians could lose on the battlefield by the end of 2024, or at least put Putin in a position where he could dictate the terms of a political settlement.'\nThe warning comes as the Biden administration is trying to seize an unexpected political opportunity on Capitol Hill to push the House to pass the long-stalled aid package. The legislation also includes aid for Israel, and as a result, House Speaker Mike Johnson has been under pressure to move the package after the Iranian attack on Israel over the weekend. In an effort to satisfy divided factions of the GOP, some of whom support and some of whom oppose aid for Ukraine, he has split the legislation into separate bills and the Ukraine aid portion is expected to come up for a vote on Saturday night.\nBurns on Thursday did not detail further how he defined 'lose,' and one source familiar with Western intelligence noted to CNN that if the package doesn't pass, officials still believe Russia is unlikely to overrun Ukraine from coast to coast.\nBut Russia could retake significant additional territory then effectively freeze the battlelines in place in a de facto ceasefire, similar to what happened after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea in 2014. That would still be deemed 'a loss.'\nBurns detailed the dire need for basic ammunition that Ukraine faces on the battlefield. He recounted two battalions \u2014 2,000-plus man units \u2014 that had '15 artillery rounds per day' and 'a grand total of 42 mortar rounds,' respectively.\n'They were overwhelmed, and it wasn't for lack of bravery or determination on their part, and my worry is that we're going to see more Avdiivkas in the future without supplemental assistance,' Burns said, referring to a Ukrainian city recently lost to Russian advances.\nUkraine's shortage of ammunition and military equipment resulting from the US and its allies' struggle to resupply the country's military has had an increasingly dire effect on the battlefield, CNN has previously reported.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Katie Bo Lillis","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/570408b3-0268-4a0b-bccd-7d54134fa125.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":5.569479,"_id":"d2fdb5627625d074eb060fdfb613573d"},{"title":"On GPS: Michael Douglas on Biden's age and the stakes in November","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-21 16:35:47","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2024/04/21/gps-0421-michael-douglas-on-a-second-biden-term.cnn","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Actor Michael Douglas shares his thoughts on the prospect of a second Biden term and the upcoming US presidential election: 'This is probably the most important election of my lifetime.'","summary":"1.

If the House's gambit succeeds, TikTok could be forced to find a new owner or be banned from the United States entirely.\nHere's what we know, and how it could affect you.\nYes. In March, House lawmakers approved a bill that would give TikTok roughly six months to sell. Failure to do so would lead to significant consequences: The app would be prohibited from US app stores and from 'internet hosting services' that support it.\nA few things. For starters, there are some substantive changes. Instead of a six-month deadline, TikTok would have roughly nine months. And that deadline could be extended by the White House \u2014 for a period of 90 days \u2014 if President Joe Biden determines there's been progress toward a sale.\nGiving TikTok as long as a year to wrap up a forced sale appears to have changed the political calculus on Capitol Hill. Some key lawmakers who've previously expressed skepticism now say they support the bill. One of those lawmakers is Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, who chairs the powerful Senate Commerce Committee.\nAnother factor that's shaking things up is how House Republicans inserted the TikTok bill into a much larger foreign aid package. Rather than asking the Senate to vote on the TikTok bill in isolation, bundling the bill with foreign aid to Ukraine and Israel makes it much harder for lawmakers to oppose the TikTok measure.\nSenators could try to strip out the TikTok legislation, but policy analysts view it as unlikely. Quickly approving the foreign aid is a top congressional priority, and if the Senate were to pass the package without the TikTok bill, those changes would have to be approved by the House, further delaying matters.\nIt seems more likely for the Senate to consider the entire package in a single, up-or-down vote \u2014 which is precisely what House Republicans appear to have wanted. The odds of Senate passage are as high as 80%, according to Paul Gallant, a policy analyst at the market research firm Cowen, Inc.\nThe Senate could vote in as little as one to two weeks, Gallant added, though Senate leadership has expressed a desire to move even faster.\nIf the Senate votes to approve the TikTok legislation, it heads to President Joe Biden's desk. Biden endorsed the prior version of the TikTok bill, which suggests he may quickly sign any foreign aid package that includes similar language targeting TikTok.\nIn theory, that would start the 270-day clock for TikTok to find a buyer. If it can't separate from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, then users could be cut off. But that is still a big 'if.' So for now, TikTok fans can continue using the app as before, though they might begin to see more creators \u2014 or the company itself \u2014 speaking out in the app to oppose the legislation.\nIn addition to complying with the legislation, TikTok could challenge it in court and has made no secret that it might do so. Its CEO, Shou Chew, vowed in March to continue fighting, 'including (by) exercising our legal rights.'\nTikTok and a slew of civil society groups have blasted the House legislation as unconstitutional, arguing that it violates TikTok users' First Amendment rights to access lawful information.\nFirst Amendment experts say a bill that has the ultimate effect of censoring TikTok users could be shot down by the courts. It's unclear whether the recent updates to the bill may help it survive constitutional scrutiny.\n'Longstanding Supreme Court precedent protects Americans' First Amendment right to access information, ideas, and media from abroad,' said Nadine Farid Johnson, policy director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. 'By banning TikTok, the bill would infringe on this right, and with no real pay-off. China and other foreign adversaries could still purchase Americans' sensitive data from data brokers on the open market.'\nA court challenge could lead to the measure being temporarily blocked while the litigation plays out, likely over multiple years.\nBut if a court declines to grant a temporary injunction, TikTok could have to scramble to comply with the law.\nThe trouble is that TikTok's parent is subject to Chinese law, and the Chinese government is on record opposing a sale.\nIn recent years, China has implemented export controls governing algorithms, a policy that would seem to cover the incredibly successful algorithm that powers TikTok's recommendation engine.\nIf the Chinese government doesn't want to let ByteDance relinquish TikTok's algorithm, the thinking goes, it could block the sale outright. Alternatively, it may allow TikTok to be sold but without the lucrative algorithm that forms the basis for its popularity.\nCan TikTok still succeed without its algorithm? That would be the difficult question facing the company in the event of a forced sale. Without the secret sauce that has propelled the app to 170 million US users, the app could be as good as dead.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"tech","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brian Fung,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-03-13t160217z-999331478-rc22l6abx549-rtrmadp-3-usa-tiktok-copy.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNbusiness","_score":5.5390825,"_id":"cbc9b20510d5509f9a6e51742681c6b3"},{"title":"Student debt is haunting Americans from graduation to retirement","author":"Allison Morrow","published_date":"2024-04-17 04:00:26","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/economy/student-debt-gallup-poll/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Going to college is supposed to be the path to a more prosperous life.

But the cost of getting a degree has become a financial albatross, weighing down borrowers from the day they graduate to the day they retire \u2014 if retirement is even possible.\nStudent loan debt is a burden that nearly 3 out of 4 American borrowers say has forced them to delay a major life event \u2014 whether that's buying a house, having kids or getting married, according to the latest Gallup Lumina Foundation Cost of College report.\n'I've had to just put all of my dreams aside and focus on surviving day to day,' Jes Evans, 35, told CNN. She earned a master's in religious studies in 2017, with dreams of teaching at a college. But she couldn't find any jobs in her field when she graduated and struggled to find jobs in other areas where she lacked experience.\nEvans, who now works as a director of youth programs and communications at a church north of Pittsburgh, feels trapped by her debt, for which she pays $940 a month.\n'It just feels like you're treading water your whole life \u2026 I can't travel, I couldn't really have a family because I couldn't afford it. It's just a slog.'\nEvans is far from alone.\nDozens of people who responded to a CNN prompt on social media this week said their student debt has hammered their credit score and drained their income. Many who responded said they were nearing retirement age but couldn't imagine being able to stop working, saying they would take their debt to their grave.\n'Cost is the No. 1 issue when people say they're not going to pursue postsecondary education,' said Courtney Brown, who has been leading the Gallup Lumina study for the past four years.\n'When people have this debt, not only are they not having children, they're not buying homes, they're also not starting their own businesses,' Brown said in an interview. 'And that will be a problem \u2014 we need our local businesses, we need innovation, and that's another thing that's going to hurt us.'\nOne in 3 students in the United States currently enrolled in college or other post-high-school program say they have considered stopping their coursework over the past six months, the Gallup Lumina poll found. Among those, 31% blame the cost \u2014 the third-most cited factor behind emotional stress and personal mental health reasons.\n'People want to get a degree \u2014 it's not that they don't value it,' said Brown, the vice president of impact and planning for the Lumina Foundation, a nonprofit that aims to increase participation in education beyond high school. 'I think they're increasingly frustrated, not only because it costs so much but it's confusing to understand how much it costs.'\nonly because it costs so much but it's confusing to understand how much it costs.' Spiraling tuition costs have begun to change the narrative around the value of a college degree. In 2015, more than half \u2014 57% \u2014 of Americans had 'a great deal' or 'quite a lot' of confidence in higher education, according to a separate Gallup study. Last year, that figure hit a new low of 36%. That Gallup study didn't focus on the cause of the eroding confidence, but it said that rising costs 'likely play a significant role.'\nPart of the problem is the scale of the higher education system in the US, where hundreds of nonprofit colleges are competing for enrollment and talent, and a large proportion of upper- and middle-class parents are willing to pay top dollar \u2014 or even go into debt themselves \u2014 to give their kids the best education possible.\nSome critics of the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness plans say that wiping out the debt doesn't fix the root cause \u2014 and in fact could encourage universities to raise tuition even further.\nThe White House has forgiven a staggering $153 billion in federal student loan debt, giving a financial lifeline to millions of borrowers.\nWhen Josh, who lives in Oregon and asked CNN not to publish his last name, received an email from the Department of Education last week, he said his first reaction was, 'What the heck do they want now?'\nBut he soon learned there was good news: He'd qualified for loan forgiveness.\n'To read the words that I now qualified, having reached the number of monthly payments \u2026 I was just blown away,' he said. 'I can't begin to describe how it feels to have this glimmer of hope that 24 years of struggle is possibly coming to an end.'\nJosh says he's not allowing himself to get his hopes up just yet, noting that there are already two lawsuits challenging Biden's SAVE plan. But in moments when he lets himself imagine his life without debt, he dreams of finally buying a home with his husband.\nAs striking as Biden's $153 billion in forgiven debt is, it is less than 10% of the trillion-plus dollars in outstanding federal debt.\nSince 2007, borrowers who work for the government or a nonprofit have been able to lighten their debt load through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. But not all public sector workers are eligible.\nworkers are eligible. Amy Coody, a social worker at a maximum-security women's prison in Wetumpka, Alabama, says she is ineligible for the PSLF program because she's employed through a third-party contractor rather than directly by the state.\n'Even though I'm in the prison and dealing with the inmates, they said that that's not public service,' she said in an interview. 'I've been paying on my loans for 21 years, and I'm never going to be able to retire at this rate.'\nBorrowers who took private loans or moved their debt to private lenders to consolidate it also aren't eligible for loan forgiveness.\nThat's an acute frustration for Ralph Davis, a 64-year-old chiropractor from Savannah, Georgia. Davis said he doesn't begrudge anyone lucky enough to have their debt wiped away. But he can't help see 'sort of an essential unfairness' within the Biden programs.\nDavis graduated from chiropractic college in 1986, with about $30,000 in debt from federal student loans. At the time, he was advised to consolidate those debts through a private lender. He later amassed $40,000 in debt trying to get an additional degree through a for-profit college, though he eventually gave up on the degree when the college kept changing the curriculum to move the finish line forward.\nBut because Davis consolidated his debt through a private lender, he's not eligible for federal forgiveness programs.\nHe isn't bitter about it, and he's not counting on a magic wand to come and zap his debt away. But he conscious of being left out, resigned to the reality that it may take nine more years before he can finally pay off his loans.\nfinally pay off his loans. 'I did freely enter into these arrangements in order to advance my career \u2014 nobody tied my hands and said, \u2018sign here,' he told CNN. 'And I have faithfully from the day I graduated my doctoral program in '86, through the additional education \u2026 even during the pandemic.'\nBut over the past four decades 'basically, every dime I've paid has gone to interest,' Davis said. 'And of course, that does tend to put retirement ideas a little bit on hold.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Allison Morrow","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1151696021.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNbusiness","_score":5.528031,"_id":"123c31b2673ec122594642b8c22c91b0"},{"title":"CNN fact-checks Biden's misleading claims from the campaign trail","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-20 03:15:37","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2024/04/20/biden-fact-check-phillip-newsnight-digvid.cnn","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"CNN's Abby Phillip fact-checks false and misleading claims President Biden has made on the campaign trail.","summary":"1.

The Democratic-controlled Senate is expected to move quickly to dismiss the charges, while Republicans insist there must be a full trial.

But this time, senators will provide as jurors in the least legitimate, least substantive and most politicized impeachment trial ever in the history of the United States,\" he said. Schumer went on to say that the charges brought against Mayorkas failed to meet standard of high crimes and misdemeanors. \"To validate this gross abuse by the House would be a grave mistake and could set a dangerous precedent for the future. For the sake of the Senate's integrity, and to protect impeachment for those rare cases we truly need it, senators should dismiss today's charges,\" he said. Before this speech, Schumer had not publicly said they would vote to dismiss the case, only saying they would deal with it \"expeditiously.\" Although a quick dismissal has been anticipated for weeks. In response, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said it would be a mistake for Senators not to carry out their constitutional duties and have a full trial. 14 min ago From CNN's Manu Raju and Haley Talbot Rep.

An angry GOP Rep. Chip Roy railed against Johnson, saying he is 'very disappointed' in the speaker, and he is 'past the point of giving grace.' Pressed if Roy has confidence in Johnson, he said 'it's not good.\" Roy was spotted walking into Johnson's office with GOP Rep. Thomas Massie and told said he needs \"time for conversations.\" Firebrand GOP Rep.

I will encourage others that hold a similar view,' he said. Gaetz did not reply when asked if he still has confidence in the speaker. Arizona conservative GOP Rep. Eli Crane echoed the frustration, and told CNN he is \"disappointed\" by Johnson's decision, but \"not surprised.\" He added, 'It's completely detached from what our base wants what our what our voters want.\" He kept the door open to voting against the rule.

CNN's Lauren Fox contributed reporting to this post. 1 hr 46 min ago From CNN's Annie Grayer, Clare Foran and Kristin Wilson The House of Representatives, by an extremely narrow margin, voted on February 13 to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in almost 150 years. The result came one week after the stunning loss House Republicans suffered when they last tried to impeach Mayorkas and GOP defections and an absence sank the initial floor vote, a move Republicans had hoped to use to spotlight the Biden administration's handling of the southern border. The impeachment also came as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold President Joe Biden and his departments and agencies accountable over immigration and border security policies. House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar. Only one Cabinet official has previously been impeached in American history: Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876. The House impeachment vote was 214 to 213. Three Republicans \u2013 Ken Buck of Colorado, Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, and Tom McClintock of California \u2013 voted with Democrats against the measure. The Department of Homeland Security said that House Republicans 'will be remembered by history for trampling on the Constitution' following the vote to impeach.

J. Scott Applewhite/AP After facing significant pressure from GOP hardliners, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced this morning that he is sticking with his plan to put a series of foreign aid bills on the floor, including funding for Ukraine. The Republican from Louisiana said they will vote on these bills Saturday evening. Johnson also said he will bring forward an immigration bill. A number of far-right House Republicans were quick to shoot down the immigration legislation, dispelling any hope that the border provisions would placate Johnson's right flank. Here is the note Johnson sent to members moments ago: 'After significant Member feedback and discussion, the House Rules Committee will be posting soon today the text of three bills that will fund America's national security interests and allies in Israel, the Indo-Pacific, and Ukraine, including a loan structure for aid, and enhanced strategy and accountability.\nThese will be brought to the floor under a structured rule that will allow for an amendment process, alongside a fourth bill that includes the REPO Act, TikTok bill, sanctions and other measures to confront Russia, China, and Iran.\nThe Rules Committee will also be posting text on a border security bill that includes the core components of H.R.2, under a separate rule that will allow for amendments.\nText of the first three bills will be posted shortly, while the fourth bill under the same rule will be posted later today. The border security bill will also be posted later today.\nBy posting text of these bills as soon as they are completed, we will ensure time for a robust amendment process. We expect the vote on final passage on these bills to be on Saturday evening.\nThank you all for your feedback and support. I value every Member of this conference and look forward to continuing our work together.' CNN's Annie Grayer contributed reporting to this post. 1 hr 54 min ago From CNN's Clare Foran, Ted Barrett, Annie Grayer and Morgan Rimmer A number of congressional Republicans have criticized the prospect of a quick dismissal or move to table in the impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell that senators have a unique responsibility to consider the impeachment articles and said he would oppose any effort to table the articles. \"As befits such a solemn and rare responsibility as convening a court of impeachment, I intend to give these charges my full and undivided attention,' he said Tuesday. The Kentucky Republican added: 'It would be beneath the Senate's dignity to shrug off our clear responsibility and fail to give the charges we'll hear today the thorough consideration they deserve. I will strenuously oppose any effort to table the articles of impeachment and avoid looking the Biden administration's border crisis squarely in the face.' Additionally, some hard-right Republican senators are trying to find a way to force a full trial, but their efforts are not expected to get enough traction to pass, according to senators and aides from both parties. CNN's Manu Raju contributed to this report. 1 hr 58 min ago From CNN's Priscilla Alvarez White House and Homeland Security officials have been in frequent communication over the course of the impeachment inquiry into Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. They are gaming out a strategy and response as they publicly cast the trial as a political stunt. Mayorkas emerged as a top target of Republicans over the Biden administration's border policies early on. Since Republicans launched their effort to oust the Homeland Security secretary, Biden administration officials have maintained that Mayorkas planned to stay in the post, dismissing the GOP impeachment inquiry into the DHS chief as 'meritless.' Instead, White House and Homeland Security officials deployed a split-screen strategy, including casting the House majority's proceedings as a waste of time while Mayorkas worked with senators to strike a border deal. \"This effort is a complete waste of time that constitutional and legal experts have said is \u2018unconstitutional' and that even Senate Republicans have made clear they don't want to focus on,\" Ian Sams, the spokesperson of the White House counsel's office, wrote in a memo in relation to the Mayorkas impeachment proceedings. What Mayorkas is doing today: As senators plot their next steps Wednesday, Mayorkas will be in New York City for a nationwide awareness campaign to combat online child exploitation and abuse. Mayorkas has maintained that his focus is on the department's work, including pointing to recent testimony on the Hill to shore up additional funds for DHS. 1 hr 39 min ago From CNN's Clare Foran, Ted Barrett, Annie Grayer and Morgan Rimmer House Republican impeachment managers walk to the Senate as they deliver the articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on Tuesday, April 16. J. Scott Applewhite/AP Republicans targeted Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas as soon as they took control of the House, blaming the high number of border crossings on the official as the party faced pressure from its base to go after the Biden administration on a key campaign issue. Multiple constitutional experts, however, have said the evidence Republicans have put forward for impeachment does not reach the high bar of high crimes and misdemeanors set by the US Constitution. Mayorkas has pushed back against criticism of his leadership, and the Department of Homeland Security has called the impeachment effort against him a baseless political attack. The White House, for its part, has worked to flip the script, citing Republicans blocking a bipartisan border deal in the Senate as evidence that the party isn't serious about border security. After months of negotiations, Senate Republicans blocked a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year that would have marked a tough change to immigration law and would have given the president far-reaching powers to restrict illegal migrant crossings at the southern border. The deal faced a torrent of attacks from former President Donald Trump and top House Republicans. CNN's Manu Raju contributed reporting to this post. 2 hr 21 min ago From CNN's Avery Lotz Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas testifies before the House Homeland Security Committee about the Biden Administration's FY2025 budget request in the Cannon House Office Building on Capitol Hill on April 16, in Washington, DC.Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas called on Congress to pass bipartisan border reform legislation Wednesday as the Senate prepares to consider articles of impeachment brought against him by the House. 'As they work on impeachment, I work in advancing the mission of the Department of Homeland Security \u2013 that's what I've done throughout this process,' Mayorkas said on 'CBS Mornings.' 'We need Congress to pass the bipartisan legislation that a group of Senators worked on. That is the enduring solution.' 'We cannot resource ourselves \u2013 we need Congress to do so,' Mayorkas continued on Wednesday. 'We cannot change a broken immigration system, only Congress can do so.' Senate Republicans derailed a bipartisan border deal crafted in part by their colleague, Sen. James Lankford, in February, that would have expanded the powers of the federal government to address the influx of migrants entering the country. The White House has considered executive action to enact tougher border policies reminiscent of the toppled Senate legislation. Pushed by CBS's Tony Dokoupil on whether President Joe Biden would issue an executive order to taper the growing crisis at the southern border, Mayorkas affirmed, 'We explore options every single day \u2013 that's the responsibility of good government.'\nSenate showdown: Senators are expected to be sworn in as jurors Wednesday afternoon in the impeachment trial against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
