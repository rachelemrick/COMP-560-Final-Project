A jury of seven men and five women, plus six alternates, was picked last week.\nThe trial centers on allegations the former president falsified his company's internal records to obscure the true nature of reimbursement payments to his former fixer and lawyer Michael Cohen, who arranged hush money payments to bury negative stories about him during his 2016 presidential race.\nThe witnesses include a porn actor, a former tabloid publisher and Cohen, who went to federal prison for his role in the hush money matter and for other crimes, including lying to Congress. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass forewarned prospective jurors that they have 'what you might consider to be some baggage.'\nAdvertisement\nHere's a look at the key players in the historic first criminal trial of a former U.S. president:\nDEFENDANT\nDONALD TRUMP \u2014 The former president of the United States and the presumptive Republican nominee, who parlayed his success as reality television star and celebrity businessman and won the presidential election in 2016, becoming America's 45th president. The trial involves allegations that he falsified his company's records to hide the true nature of payments to Cohen, who helped bury negative stories about him during the 2016 presidential campaign. He's pleaded not guilty.\nWITNESSES\nMICHAEL COHEN \u2014 Trump's former lawyer and fixer. He was once a fierce Trump ally, but now he's a key prosecution witness against his former boss. Cohen worked for the Trump Organization from 2006 to 2017. He later went to federal prison after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations relating to the hush money arrangements and other, unrelated crimes.\nAdvertisement\nSTORMY DANIELS \u2014 The porn actor who received a $130,000 payment from Cohen as part of his hush-money efforts. Cohen paid Daniels to keep quiet about what she says was a sexual encounter with Trump years earlier. Trump denies having sex with Daniels.\nKAREN MCDOUGAL \u2014 A former Playboy model who said she had a 10-month affair with Trump in the mid-2000s. She was paid $150,000 in 2016 by the parent company of the National Enquirer for the rights to her story about the alleged relationship. Trump denies having sex with McDougal.\nDAVID PECKER \u2014 The National Enquirer's former publisher and a longtime Trump friend. Prosecutors say he met with Trump and Cohen at Trump Tower in August 2015 and agreed to help Trump's campaign identify negative stories about him.\nHOPE HICKS \u2014 Trump's former White House communications director. Prosecutors say she spoke with Trump by phone during a frenzied effort to keep allegations of his marital infidelity out of the press after the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape leaked weeks before the 2016 election. In the tape, from 2005, Trump boasted about grabbing women without permission.\nPROSECUTORS\nALVIN BRAGG \u2014 A former civil rights lawyer and law professor, Bragg is a Democrat in his first term as Manhattan's district attorney. He inherited the Trump investigation when he took office in 2021. He oversaw the prosecution of Trump's company in an unrelated tax fraud case before moving to indict Trump last year.\nAdvertisement\nMATTHEW COLANGELO \u2014 A former high-ranking Justice Department official who was hired by Bragg in 2022 to lead the Trump investigation. They previously worked together on Trump-related matters at the New York attorney general's office.\nJOSHUA STEINGLASS \u2014 A Manhattan prosecutor for more than 25 years, he has worked on some of the office's more high-profile cases, including the Trump Organization's tax fraud conviction in 2022, and cases involving violent crimes.\nSUSAN HOFFINGER \u2014 The chief of the district attorney's Investigation Division, she returned to the office in 2022 after more than 20 years in private practice with her sister, Fran. She worked with Steinglass on the Trump Organization tax fraud prosecution.\nTRUMP'S LAWYERS\nTODD BLANCHE \u2014 A former federal prosecutor, Blanche previously represented Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, in a mortgage fraud case \u2014 and got it thrown out. Blanche successfully argued that the case, brought by the same prosecutor's office now taking on Trump, was too similar to one that landed Manafort in federal prison and therefore amounted to double jeopardy.\nAdvertisement\nSUSAN NECHELES \u2014 A former Brooklyn prosecutor, Necheles is a respected New York City defense lawyer who represented Trump's company at its tax fraud trial last year. In the past she served as counsel to the late Genovese crime family underboss Venero Mangano, known as Benny Eggs, and defended John Gotti's lawyer, Bruce Cutler, in the early 90s.\nEMIL BOVE \u2014 A star college lacrosse player, Bove was a veteran federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York. He was involved in multiple high-profile prosecutions, including a drug-trafficking case against the former Honduran president's brother, a man who set off a pressure cooker device in Manhattan and a man who sent dozens of mail bombs to prominent targets across the country.\nTHE JUDGE\nJUAN M. MERCHAN \u2014 The judge presiding over the case. He was also the judge in the Trump Organization's tax fraud trial in 2022 and is overseeing a border wall fraud case against longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon. Merchan has twice denied requests by Trump's lawyers that he step aside from the case. They contend he is biased because his daughter runs a political consulting firm that has worked for Democrats, including President Joe Biden. Merchan has said he is certain of his 'ability to be fair and impartial.'\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Michael R.

But a scene Monday indicates how the stakes are increasing.","summary":"During the E. Jean Carroll civil defamation trial back in January, the judge issued a warning to Donald Trump. Carroll's lawyers had complained that Trump repeatedly injected commentary from the defense table, notably calling the proceedings a 'witch hunt.'\n'Mr. Trump, I hope I don't have to consider excluding you from the trial,' Judge Lewis A. Kaplan said, adding: 'I understand you are probably very eager for me to do that.'\nWhether Trump literally wants such an outcome is up for debate, but it's readily apparent that he's going to tempt serious sanctions as his first criminal trial begins. While plenty have focused on his apparently nodding off during the proceedings in the Manhattan hush money/election interference case, the more potentially consequential moments have come when he has offered these kinds of interjections.\nAdvertisement\nAnd they show no sign of abating. The situation could leave New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan with some difficult decisions to make about how to treat the high-profile defendant. And if he doesn't sanction Trump, it could serve to reinforce that, despite his claims to victimization, Trump is actually getting special treatment not usually afforded a defendant.\nOn Monday, Trump was witnessed sarcastically chuckling when Merchan noted that he would be in charge of sentencing should Trump be convicted \u2014 and then again when Merchan said he would conduct a fair trial.\nOn Tuesday, Merchan reprimanded Trump for another interjection. This time, Trump said something that the judge suggested appeared to be directed at one of the prospective jurors.\nAfter the prospective juror was dismissed, Merchan quickly addressed Trump lawyer Todd Blanche. Merchan noted that the prospective juror was about '12 feet from your client' and that Trump was 'audibly uttering something' toward them.\nAdvertisement\n'He was audibly gesturing, speaking in the direction of the juror,' Merchan said. 'I won't tolerate that. I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom. I want to make that crystal clear.'\nBlanche responded, 'Yes, your honor,' and spoke to Trump as instructed by the judge.\nThe scene was familiar. Not only was Trump threatened with expulsion that January day in the Carroll case, but a week earlier he also tangled with the judge at the end of his New York civil fraud case, drawing a rebuke from that judge.\nAfter Trump's lawyers made a surprise request to allow Trump to address the court, Judge Arthur Engoron asked Trump to 'promise to just comment on the law and the facts \u2026 and not go outside' those things.\nTrump responded, 'When you say, \u2018Don't go outside of these things,' we have a situation where I'm an innocent man. I've been persecuted by someone running for office.' Trump called it a 'fraud on me.'\nAdvertisement\nEngoron noted that a deadline was approaching for a break in the proceedings. 'You have your own agenda, I certainly understand that,' Trump said. 'You can't listen for more than one minute.'\nEngoron urged Trump's lawyer to 'please control your client.' He soon cut off Trump's remarks.\nThe dilemma for the courts in these outbursts is apparent.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nMerchan told Trump as proceedings were beginning Monday, 'If you disrupt the proceedings in any way, the law permits the court to exclude you from the courtroom and commit you to jail and continue the trial in your absence.'\nActually following through on that threat is not only politically dicey \u2014 by giving Trump the kind of supposed persecution he suggested he craves with his 'I would love it' comment \u2014 but legally dicey as well. In criminal proceedings, defendants have a constitutional right to be present that is stronger than it is in civil cases. It can be forfeited if a defendant acts out, but convictions can be overturned if it's found that defendants were deprived of their rights.\nAdvertisement\nStill, the stakes are increasing. It's one thing to be an unruly defendant and create chaotic scenes in the courtroom; it's another to say things to influence or intimidate a juror, as Merchan suggested Tuesday's outburst might have been intended to do. That could bear directly on Trump's fate in a case in which one juror can prevent his conviction.\nThe jurors in the case are anonymous, but Trump has made little secret of his desire to make life difficult for anyone involved in adversely deciding his legal fate.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Aaron Blake,Staff Writer","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P3SO6WZ72TR6MCBNG57RU4A65M.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.668008,"_id":"dd98e33a33e09455b23a7786938b77b8"},{"title":"At Trump's N.Y. trial, the jury pool spoke, and he had to listen","author":"David Nakamura","published_date":"2024-04-21 10:00:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/21/trump-trial-jury-political-opinions","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The jury selection process for Trump's hush money trial gave ordinary Americans a chance to offer their opinions on the former president's nearly five decades in the public spotlight.","summary":"NEW YORK \u2014 The retired police photographer in the jury pool on the second day of Donald Trump's criminal trial was visibly nervous, at times meandering in his answers. But when a defense attorney asked if he had a strong opinion of Trump, the man offered an immediate response.\n'Oh boy, here we go,' the man said. 'Going back to Central Park, I knew some of the kids, their cousins.'\nThe reference had nothing to do with Trump's divisive presidency. The man, who is Black, was instead alluding to a shocking 1989 New York City rape case. Shortly after five Black and Latino teenagers were arrested and identified as suspects in the brutal assault on a jogger, Trump paid for full-page newspaper ads calling for New York to reinstate the death penalty. The five teens were fully exonerated years later, but Trump has repeatedly suggested he still believes they were guilty.\nAdvertisement\nThe jury selection process for Trump's hush money trial created something akin to a national focus group \u2014 albeit with a New York accent \u2014 giving ordinary Americans a chance to offer their opinions and reflections on the former president's nearly five decades in the public spotlight.\nAs prosecutors and the defense team sought to weed out those with prejudiced views of Trump, one of the most polarizing figures in U.S. political history, a familiar dynamic was suddenly reversed.

A man who immigrated from Italy compared Trump to disgraced former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi \u2014 who was convicted of tax fraud in 2012 \u2014 before being excused from the jury pool.\nNew Yorkers who stayed expressed strong opinions. A man who immigrated from Italy compared Trump to disgraced former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi \u2014 who was convicted of tax fraud in 2012 \u2014 before being excused from the jury pool.\n'It would be a little hard for me to retain my impartiality and fairness,' the man said.\nOthers offered a range of impressions about Trump's career, while insisting their views would not affect their ability to judge him fairly.\nAdvertisement\n'I have got opinions. I'm born and raised in New York and I've kind of spent my whole life knowing about Donald Trump,' said a retired university administrator who told the court she once ran into Trump and then-wife Marla Maples as they shopped for baby supplies. The woman said her cousin once lived in Trump Tower in Midtown.\nThough she professed to have heard positive things about Trump, she told Trump's lawyers: 'How I feel about him as a president is different.'\nSome of the New Yorkers appeared to have nuanced views. Several had read, 'The Art of the Deal,' Trump's best-selling (and ghostwritten) first book about how to succeed in business, a tome that offered such nuggets as: 'Bad publicity is sometimes better than no publicity at all. Controversy, in short, sells.'\n'I found it entertaining,' a middle-aged man who works in real estate development said about the book. The same man told prosecutors that, although his firm had never done business deals with the Trump Organization, he was 'sort of an admirer from afar of some of the work.'\nAdvertisement\nA lifelong New Yorker who works in law enforcement said he had a fondness for Trump because 'as a wannabe hockey player, I still thank him for fixing that Wollman Rink that nobody couldn't fix.'\nHe was referring to a once-dilapidated Central Park ice skating rink that Trump's company took over from the city and renovated into a popular attraction.\nA man who had worked as an attorney said he has mixed views on Trump's political opinions. But he expressed a more definitive view of Trump's reality television career.\n'I was a big fan of \u2018The Apprentice' when I was in middle school,' the man said, referring to the show that debuted two decades ago in which business people competed to impress Trump, who played a version of himself as a ruthless mogul for 14 seasons.\nTrump's celebrity raises the stakes of jury selection for both the prosecution and defense, jury consultants said. In cases with well-known defendants, even jurors who claim they can be impartial sometimes have ingrained views that can be difficult to overcome.\nAdvertisement\nNearly everyone in America knows Trump's name, and his defense lawyers worry that many potential jurors in heavily Democratic Manhattan might be unwilling to express their full opinions of him in open court, a person familiar with the former president's legal strategy who spoke on the condition of anonymity told The Washington Post.\nTrump's early reputation as a larger-than-life New York personality was largely forged by his regular appearances in the tabloid gossip columns, the Rev. Al Sharpton, a fellow New Yorker, said in an interview. Trump's business and dating exploits were closely chronicled, often through tips to reporters from Trump himself.\n'A lot of it was made by the tabloids. He became a tabloid figure,' said Sharpton, who has battled with Trump on civic issues. 'A guy once told me from one of the tabloids, if you get [former New York mayor] Ed Koch or Donald Trump or even me, someone controversial, that's what sells papers.'\nAdvertisement\nJo-Ellan Dimitrius, who consulted for O.J. Simpson's defense team during his 1995 murder trial, said a majority of potential jurors in that case held positive views of the former football star, who died this month. Simpson was ultimately acquitted in the highly publicized trial.\nSome viewed Simpson negatively because he had been repeatedly accused of domestic violence, she said, but 'by far the most vocalized opinion was, \u2018I used to watch him play USC football games and thought he was a funny actor. He's done so well for the football community.''\nIn Trump's case, Dimitrius said, those who will sit in judgment bring 'a compendium of all the knowledge New Yorkers have about him.' She emphasized that the prosecution and defense must compare the prospective jurors' answers in court with any past statements they made about Trump on social media 'to ascertain, \u2018Is this person being honest? Are they hiding something?''\nAdvertisement\nTrump's defense team worked with a jury consultant to review the social media histories of potential jurors who made it to the question-and-answer portion of the selection process. Trump's lawyers also paid close attention to potential jurors' body language as they spoke about the former president, said the person with knowledge of the defense team's strategy.\nbody language as they spoke about the former president, said the person with knowledge of the defense team's strategy.\nOn Thursday, one woman professed that she didn't have 'strong opinions' about Trump and could be fair. But she later conceded under sharp questioning that she her views were, in fact, pronounced.\n'He seems very selfish and self-serving,' the woman said during questioning by Trump's lawyers. 'I don't really appreciate that from any public servant.'\nTrump's lead attorney, Todd Blanche, cited online posts, some dating back more than five years, to challenge potential jurors' ability to be impartial.\nAdvertisement\nIn some instances, Blanche was successful, persuading Merchan to strike one man for a 2017 Facebook post in which he had written: 'Good news!! Trump lost his court battle on his unlawful travel ban!!! Get him out and lock him up.'\nAnother prospective juror had posted an artificial intelligence-generated deepfake video in which Trump appears to repeatedly call himself 'dumb as f---.' The man insisted he could be fair, saying it was 'just something that I reposted. What I think of the defendant outside of this room has nothing to do with the merits of the case.'\nMerchan dismissed him.\nAnother juror was presented with old social media posts she wrote, one calling Trump a 'racist, sexist and narcissist.'\n'Oops, that sounds bad,' she conceded after seeing the post, before promising to be fair. She was dismissed in what Merchan deemed a 'close call.'\nAt other times, however, the judge rejected defense team arguments that anti-Trump posts from prospective jurors' family members should reflect on them. Merchan said other posts amounted to political satire that does not connote bias.\nMerchan denied a defense team's challenge against one woman who had posted videos of New Yorkers celebrating Trump's 2020 election loss to Joe Biden. The woman told the court she was documenting 'a New York City celebratory moment.'\nOther prospective jurors spoke approvingly of Trump's bombastic rhetorical style. Though Trump has attacked Merchan and District Attorney Alvin Bragg, leading the judge to issue a partial gag order, some in the jury pool said they appreciated Trump's lack of filter.\nA Black woman who said she avoids political conversations told the court: 'President Trump speaks his mind and I'd rather [have] that than someone who's in office who you don't know what they're thinking.'\nA grandfather who came to New York from Puerto Rico seemed intrigued by Trump, calling him 'fascinating and mysterious.' Trump 'walks into a room and he sets people off, one way or another,' the man said. 'I find that really interesting.'\nBlanche seemed at a loss over how to interpret his views. 'All right, thank you,' he said.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David Nakamura,Josh Dawsey","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2RSPX5RAGN5I7RISW3LRG6BBOE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.6582336,"_id":"5e6960b51dba35a7a1c637dc74289452"},{"title":"Trump's rhetoric on thwarting Iran vs. his record","author":"Aaron Blake","published_date":"2024-04-15 22:11:18","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/15/trumps-rhetoric-thwarting-iran-vs-his-record","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Trump and his allies are increasingly claiming very bad things wouldn't have happened on his watch. Iran's attacking Israel isn't a great example.","summary":"Donald Trump has spent a good part of his public life crafting an alternate reality. Just two days after Trump took office in 2017, adviser Kellyanne Conway set the tone by citing how Trump's White House had 'alternative facts' about the inauguration crowd size \u2014 claims that were provable falsehoods. Trump went on to put forth more than 30,000 additional falsehoods during his presidency.\nToday, Trump and his allies are increasingly pitching a different type of alternate reality: one in which Americans never booted him from office in 2020, and the major ills of this country and the world magically disappear \u2014 from inflation to the war in Ukraine to the war in Gaza.\nBut they're starting to overreach.\n'It would not have happened if we were in office,' Trump said this weekend of Iran attacking Israel with an unprecedented aerial assault. 'You know that, they know that, everybody knows that.'\nAdvertisement\n'This attack on Israel would have never happened under a Trump presidency,' Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) reiterated.\n'These attacks on Israel would've never happened under President @realDonaldTrump,' added Republican Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake.\n'This would have NEVER happened under Trump,' Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-Tex.), who like the other two has been mentioned as a possible Trump running mate, said. 'Tell me I'm wrong.'\nThe upside of this strategy is evident, because you quite literally can't prove Hunt wrong. It's unfalsifiable. And Americans seem inclined to buy into the concept at least somewhat, judging by how their reviews of Trump's presidency today are better than they ever were in real time. They trust Trump more than President Biden on foreign policy and national security, as well as inflation.\nAdvertisement\nBut rather than merely parroting the unfalsifiable claim, it's worth putting it in context. And trying to apply the talking point to Iran undercuts the claim.\nIt's true that we did not see a war in Gaza during Trump's presidency. But we did see tensions between Israel and Iran threaten to boil over, repeatedly. And not only that. We saw Iran emboldened not just to attack Israel, but actual Americans.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nOn Jan. 3, 2020, Trump ordered the successful killing of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, whom the U.S. government said was planning attacks on Americans.\nDays later, Iran hit back by striking a U.S. military base in Iraq. One contractor suffered a serious eye injury, and 110 troops suffered traumatic brain injuries while sheltering in place.\nThe provocation involved in directly attacking Israel last week is notable. But the attack's actual toll \u2014 99 percent of projectiles were intercepted, according to the Israel Defense Forces, and just one serious injury has been identified \u2014 pales beside the 2020 attack.\nAdvertisement\nThat 2020 attack, it bears noting, was also directly on U.S. personnel, rather than on a U.S. ally. Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said Iran gave him a heads-up in advance that Americans were the targets. (Trump last year appeared to claim that Iran had also given him a heads-up that it would deliberately miss the base, but Washington Post Fact Checker Glenn Kessler called that 'ludicrous,' while noting that most of the missiles in fact hit the base.)\nThe Iranian attack on American personnel was also unprecedented \u2014 the first time in decades of U.S.-Iran tensions that Iran had directly targeted an American position in the Middle East.\nThe comparison between the two events aside, it doesn't exactly suggest Iran was cowed by the strength of Trump's presidency. Even if you regard Iran's retaliation to Soleimani's killing as limited \u2014 Trump would later suggest as much to justify his own lack of retaliation \u2014 the U.S. government concluded that Soleimani had been preparing to attack us on Trump's watch.\nAdvertisement\nThat this all happened in Trump's final full year in office \u2014 after he'd had more than enough time to make the country's foreign policy his own \u2014 is also noteworthy. There were real fears that the events of January 2020 would lead to not just Iranian involvement in a Middle East war but war between Iran and the United States.\nThat didn't happen. But at least one Trump aide who was around in the months leading up to the early 2020 clash with Iran says Trump's talking point is nonsense.\n'I just think Trump is delusional on this point,' former Trump national security adviser John Bolton said Sunday on CNN. 'It's a point that nobody can refute or confirm one way or the other.

In a Washington Post-Schar School poll last month, Americans said 51 percent to 34 percent that Russian President Vladimir Putin would have invaded Ukraine even if Trump were still president. Basically only Trump supporters said they believed Putin wouldn't have (and about 1 in 5 said Putin still would have).","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Aaron Blake,Staff Writer","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6XZFAFRZTEI6XKWZRFMSE4UAYQ.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.6512437,"_id":"53fb7fb48667f14c4a384634f21815f9"},{"title":"N.Y. trial's focus on scandal could underscore Trump's weakness with women","author":"Isaac Arnsdorf","published_date":"2024-04-15 23:48:36","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/04/15/trump-trial-scandal-access-hollywood","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Prosecutors' way of explaining Trump's motivation for paying hush money could underscore his enduring weakness with female voters.","summary":"NEW YORK \u2014 Former president Donald Trump and his allies have fought back against the criminal case he faces here by discounting the impact of alleged conduct that happened years ago and charges that center on the seemingly tedious subject of business records.\nBut the last flurry of motions before jury selection began Monday showed that prosecutors plan to lay out a different kind of story, one that has much more in common with the tabloid fodder that fueled Trump's fame and revisits the 'Access Hollywood' scandal that was a low point during the final weeks of the 2016 election he went on to win. That framing could scramble expectations about the salience of this trial for voters considering whether to return Trump to the White House in November.\nThat framing could scramble expectations about the salience of this trial for voters considering whether to return Trump to the White House in November.\n'With these trials, there's the 12-person jury, and then there's 120 million Americans that are gonna vote that form their own jury on this,' said Jim Kessler, executive vice president of policy for Third Way, a center-left policy group in Washington. 'It's like, \u2018Oh yeah, he's that guy. I forgot about the porn star.' \u2026 You could see women saying, \u2018Here's another reminder why I don't like him.''\nAdvertisement\nFacing 88 criminal charges across four indictments, including allegations of interfering with the 2020 election results and mishandling classified documents, Trump successfully used his legal problems as a rallying cry in the Republican primary. In the general election, it is far less clear how they will affect voters' attitudes.\nMany strategists view the New York case as the least damaging proceeding against Trump and are skeptical that further attention to his character will move the dial for voters already willing to look past 'Access Hollywood' and more. But the sordid details of the Manhattan trial will train public attention on allegations that could matter at the margins.\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's team said they wanted to play the recording of Trump making lewd remarks about groping women on the set of 'Access Hollywood.' They pushed to reference the women who came forward after the tape's disclosure to accuse Trump of sexual misconduct. Prosecutors also said they wanted to describe a previous hush money scheme with a Playboy model, Karen McDougal, and to specify that during that alleged encounter, Trump's wife was pregnant.\nsaid they wanted to describe a previous hush money scheme with a Playboy model, Karen McDougal, and to specify that during that alleged encounter, Trump's wife was pregnant.\nThe judge, Juan M.

The prosecutors appear poised to argue that Trump's campaign was reeling from the 'Access Hollywood' tape, with many Republicans deserting him and condemning his behavior, and he couldn't afford another damaging revelation about an alleged tawdry affair.\nAdvertisement\nTrump has denied the affair. One of his lawyers, Will Scharf, said in an interview on Monday with CNN's Jake Tapper that the jury would have to decide whether it was false for the hush money payments through lawyer Michael Cohen to be recorded as a legal retainer.\nTrump 'became almost obsessed with addressing these allegations,' Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass said while arguing to include other sexual misconduct allegations against Trump, which Merchan denied. 'This is really the key, specifically with female voters.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nPollsters have asked Americans how a potential conviction would affect their vote, but such hypothetical questions are often not predictive. Trials can have unexpected twists. Trump will have his turn to respond. A New York Times/Siena poll this month found that 37 percent of registered voters said they were paying little to no attention to this case.\nAdvertisement\nBut 58 percent of voters \u2014 including a majority of independents \u2014 said they view the charges as very serious or somewhat serious.\n'He stayed together with his wife,' said Martha Zoller, a conservative talk show host in Georgia who voted for Nikki Haley in the Republican primary and argued that rehashing allegations from so many years ago will matter little to voters. 'It just seems like an unnecessary case. \u2026 And I'm not a person that loves Trump.'\nViews of the New York charges echoed a gender gap in support for Trump and Biden. Forty percent of women called them very serious compared with 20 percent of men, according to the New York Times/Siena poll, which also found Biden leading with women by 16 points \u2014 and Trump leading with men by 20.\nConcerns about Trump's polling with women also resurfaced after a jury found him liable last year for sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll and defaming her. In January, Carroll won an additional $83.3 million after Trump defamed her again.\nAdvertisement\nGunner Ramer, the political director of Republican Voters Against Trump, said Monday that their focus groups suggest Trump's other criminal cases are more meaningful to swing voters than the New York case.\n'We run through each indictment, and we ask them which one matters to you most,' Ramer said. 'And this is never the one that matters to them most.'\nVoters already know that Trump is 'not some highly moral human being,' Ramer added, though he views Trump's overall legal woes as potentially impactful with the 'double haters' who dislike both Trump and Biden.\nOn Monday, Merchan also agreed to let prosecutors introduce evidence about a meeting at Trump Tower where a National Enquirer editor allegedly agreed to help suppress negative stories about Trump and publish negative stories about his rivals.\nAdvertisement\n'The entire point of the Trump Tower meeting was to control the flow of information that reached the electorate to accentuate the positive, hide the negative and exaggerate information that would be harmful to Trump's opponents,' Steinglass said.\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche argued that Pecker's meeting with Trump and Cohen did not show evidence of misconduct and that meetings like that are common for candidates. Merchan said the details of the meeting would be admissible as evidence of prior bad conduct that may help the jury decide whether Trump intended to commit a crime when he concealed his reimbursement payments to Cohen, who directly paid off Daniels.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Isaac Arnsdorf,Hannah Knowles","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2RSPX5RAGN5I7RISW3LRG6BBOE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.6457725,"_id":"67d7cd93878ef6419dd69a01c6c320fa"},{"title":"Cannon denies dismissal motions by Trump co-defendants in documents case","author":"Perry Stein","published_date":"2024-04-18 23:39:42","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/04/18/trump-nauta-carlos-oliveira-dismissal-motions","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"U.S. Judge Aileen M.

If so, sign up here. You can also hear Aaron's Campaign Moment podcast weekly on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.)\nThe big moment\nA former president of the United States is on criminal trial for the first time in American history as of this week. It's been a long time coming.\nAnd while the early proceedings in Donald Trump's Manhattan 'hush money'/election-interference case have been somewhat sleepy \u2014 quite literally if you're Trump \u2014 the stage is being set for one of the most consequential legal clashes in American political history. As a quick reminder: The case has to do with hush money payments Trump's lawyer made to an adult-film actress to keep her quiet weeks ahead of the November 2016 election and whether he falsified business records to cover it up.\nAdvertisement\nYou can read the blow-by-blow of all the significant legal maneuverings during jury selection from Monday, Tuesday and Thursday.\nAs for the politics? Here are my early thoughts.\nTrump's antics threaten to boil over, with major political \u2014 and societal \u2014 implications.\nTrump's antics threaten to boil over, with major political \u2014 and societal \u2014 implications.\nThe verdict is obviously important, for reasons we'll get to. But how we get there could also reverberate greatly.\nThe trial is quickly shaping up to be the culmination of Trump's years-long assault on a justice system that has long scrutinized him. And there's increasing reason to believe the situation could get ugly:\nWe're already seeing how all of this could matter. A juror whose biographical details were aired by media outlets \u2014 and scrutinized by Watters \u2014 raised concerns Thursday, citing how people were able to identify her. (Jurors in the case are being kept anonymous.) She was dismissed from the panel.\nThe play here is obvious. Trump wants to make clear that he will make life hard for anybody who might help deliver an adverse verdict. And Trump will push limits in ways that leaves the judge in the case with some very difficult decisions; imagine a situation in which the judge feels compelled to actually jail Trump. (As has been noted, Trump's actions probably wouldn't be tolerated by basically any other defendant.)\nAdvertisement\nTo the extent this can be turned into a circus, perhaps people will dismiss it. Or perhaps it will draw even more interest and people will see in Trump's actions what they previously found unappealing in him.\nAmericans by and large don't buy into Trump's claims that this is a 'witch hunt,' as I wrote this week. But even some who don't believe that do harbor some concerns about the process, and this case in particular . Trump is now forcing the issue in a major way, and how Americans regard the legal process and his conduct could matter greatly.\neven some who don't believe that do harbor some concerns about the process, and this case in particular. Trump is now forcing the issue in a major way, and how Americans regard the legal process and his conduct could matter greatly.\nThis case is less of a threat than the others. But.\nThis case is less of a threat than the others. But.\nThis case is objectively the one that Americans are the least concerned about. A poll this week showed just one-third thought Trump had broken the law \u2014 double-digits less than in his other three indictments. And about the same number regard the charges as 'very serious.'\nAdvertisement\nBut voters are also being reminded about a situation they have overwhelmingly found to be unsavory. About 8 in 10 said Trump at least did something wrong when the 2016 hush money payments to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels were first in the news back in 2018. And polling has shown as many as 7 in 10 say it's a crime to pay someone to remain silent about an issue that could affect an election (which is basically the substance of the charges).\nAlso, even that Associated Press-NORC poll showed 50 percent of voters said a conviction in this case would render Trump unfit for office. Just 29 percent said it wouldn't matter.\nWe've also seen in polls that a potentially decisive number of Americans say they'd flip their votes if Trump is convicted of a crime. Whether that would hold \u2014 and on this case, specifically \u2014 is a huge question.\nAdvertisement\nDemocrats' hands-off approach could be tested.\nDemocrats' hands-off approach could be tested.\nThere is a remarkable asymmetry in the political debate over Trump's criminal trial. While Trump and his allies are all over it, Democrats and the Biden campaign are basically ignoring it.\nAbout the closest the Biden campaign has come to weighing in was a news release this week which slyly included the words 'stormy' and 'hush' and alluded to Trump nodding off. But it was about abortion.\nThis is all in keeping with Democrats' general approach to Trump's criminal cases. While Republicans have leaped to decry things such as Trump's indictments and the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago in August 2022 \u2014 often before they know much of anything about the situations \u2014 Democrats have generally been content to merely say that 'no one is above the law' and leave it at that.\nAdvertisement\nBut that's going to be tested moving forward. The legal system is limited in how it can defend itself, with litigators and judges generally letting their work and courtroom remarks speak for themselves. And at some point, you'd think Democrats would want to drive home Trump's behavior at the trial and how it's symptomatic of his chaotic presidency.\nOf course, they also might not want to bet too heavily on the outcome of a trial the American people haven't shown they're overly concerned about.\nA momentous \u2014 and somewhat counterintuitive \u2014 poll\nOne of the most consequential facets of the 2024 election is how Americans have warmed to Trump's first term. Call it 'amnesia' or anything else, but it's a significant factor. To the extent people continue to remember the grass being greener, that's likely to weigh significantly on who wins in November.\nAdvertisement\nBut it will apparently only take Trump so far.\nA new Yahoo News/YouGov poll provides some interesting findings on this front. It finds 49 percent of people retrospectively approve of Trump's presidency \u2014 higher than that number was at virtually any juncture of his actual presidency \u2014 and just 40 percent approve of President Biden's. Voters were more likely by double digits to say Trump accomplished things than that Biden did. And asked to choose directly whether they were better off under Trump or Biden, voters chose Trump 45 percent to 34 percent.\nAnd yet! The poll shows the race deadlocked \u2014 44-44 in a head-to-head, and 42-42 if you include third-party candidates.\nPart of that imbalance is probably polarization and Democrats not being enthusiastic about Biden's presidency \u2014 but still opposing Trump. But it's logical to think it might also owe to Trump's legal problems and other personal factors.\nWhatever the case, it's worth keeping an eye on \u2014 particularly if Democrats can, in fact, drive home what voters disliked about Trump before and drive the above numbers down.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Staff Writer,Aaron Blake","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/32TFYZIQ3TGNJBGXDQ42UKGIPM.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.6089973,"_id":"ad12fc51bfb8217802f61a86151197d5"},{"title":"Trump's court conduct gives Democrats a \u2018Sleepy Joe' retort","author":"Patrick Svitek","published_date":"2024-04-19 19:29:53","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/19/biden-trump-court-sleeping","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Democrats, including President Biden's campaign, have been eager to promote reports that former president Donald Trump has apparently fallen asleep during his hush-money trial in New York.","summary":"Former president Donald Trump has long cast President Biden as 'Sleepy Joe,' accusing him of being too old and weak to do the job. Now Biden's campaign sees an opportunity to turn the tables.\nThe campaign has increasingly put a spotlight on reports that Trump has appeared to doze off during his hush-money trial in New York, which started this week.\n'A feeble and tired Donald Trump once again falls asleep in court,' the campaign said Friday on X, responding to a New York Times live blog entry saying Trump 'appears to have fallen asleep in court again.'\nThe dig is notable because Biden's campaign and the White House have otherwise avoided commenting on the trial itself. Trump has argued that the case is an attempt to interfere with the 2024 election, claiming without evidence that Biden has orchestrated it in the run-up to their November rematch.\nAdvertisement\nTrump's campaign fired back at the Biden campaign Friday, calling the Times report 'fake news from a reporter who wasn't even in the courtroom.'\n'Contrast that with Biden falling asleep constantly at meetings, and tripping and busting his ass while falling down numerous times,' Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement.\nThe Times reporter who wrote the blog post, Maggie Haberman, said in an email that she was watching from an overflow room outside the courtroom 'along with other reporters, could see [Trump's] entire face on a very large monitor through closed-circuit camera.'\nThe trial is the first of four that Trump faces with the 2024 election looming.

Washington Post reporters have been watching the trial from inside the courtroom \u2014 but seated behind Trump \u2014 and from the overflow room where there is a video feed. They have seen his eyes close multiple times this week.\nOn Tuesday, during questioning of the jurors, Trump closed his eyes and his head occasionally dipped down. In another moment, Trump leaned back and his eyes appeared to be closed as his head occasionally tilted.\nOn Thursday, Trump appeared to be resting his eyes while the judge, Juan Merchan, read extended jury instructions.\nWhen there were first reports that Trump was apparently dozing off in court \u2014 on the trial's Opening Day \u2014 the Biden campaign responded playfully, using it to highlight a top issue for Democrats this election cycle.\nAdvertisement\n'Wake Up Donald: After Stormy Abortion Ban Coverage, Trump Poll Memo Attempts to Hush Panic,' read the subject line of a Biden campaign news release.\nThe news release referred to a Trump campaign memo that downplayed the political potency of the issue of abortion in Arizona after a state Supreme Court upheld a near total abortion ban there last week.\nBiden's campaign told The Washington Post that it remained focused on issues beside Trump's trial.\n'Our campaign and the President are focused on the American people \u2014 not Donald Trump's trials and tribulations,' Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement. 'We're also not sleeping on the fact that campaigns are won by the candidate who remains focused on fighting for the American people \u2014 not distracted by their own grievances or pursuit of revenge and retribution.'\nAdvertisement\nStill, the criticism of Trump comes as part of a sustained effort by the Biden campaign to amplify examples of the former president mixing up people, misstating facts or slipping over his words, as Biden officials fight back against concerns about Biden's own mental fitness. Even though Biden, 81, is only a few years older than Trump, 77, polls show voters are more concerned about Biden's age.\nAt the White House, officials have repeatedly declined to comment on the case and suggested Biden is not paying close attention.\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday, the first day of the trial, that she expected Biden to 'get an update at some point today' but that he was focused on meetings with foreign leaders that day. Asked about the trial the next day, she said Biden was focused on a three-day tour of Pennsylvania that he was starting that day.\nJury selection in Trump's trial concluded Friday afternoon, and opening statements are expected Monday.\nThe trial, Trump said Friday afternoon on social media, 'is a Long, Rigged, Endurance Contest.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Patrick Svitek","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2RSPX5RAGN5I7RISW3LRG6BBOE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.6055655,"_id":"6c9a2cafdc928863a785273d605c3927"},{"title":"Trump's transparent attempt to play the victim on \u2018election interference'","author":"Aaron Blake","published_date":"2024-04-22 22:00:23","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/22/trumps-transparent-attempt-play-victim-election-interference","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Trump calls his prosecutions 'election interference.'

Trump posted on social media Monday morning, adding in another post: 'It's all about Election Interference. Sad!'\n'This is done for purposes of hurting the opponent of the worst president in the history of our country,' Trump said at the courthouse Monday morning.\nTrump even on Sunday night seemed to nod to the rubber-and-glue strategy.\n'Tomorrow morning I report to a New York Criminal Court for a Trial on, somewhat ironically, ELECTION INTERFERENCE,' he wrote.\nThis from a man who is accused of that crime in three of his four criminal indictments, was impeached twice for alleged election interference-related offenses, and experienced his first big controversy as president for the same. Trump has also unapologetically solicited political favors involving electoral opponents from foreign governments, despite foreign election interference being illegal.\nAdvertisement\nThe tenuousness of Trump's argument is readily apparent. Trump claims that merely holding a trial while he's a candidate for president \u2014 and a gag order preventing him from saying things that could taint the proceedings \u2014 amounts to interfering in an election.\nPeople can make their own judgments about how substantial the 'hush money' charges in Manhattan are. But the case pertains to an established crime and a rather transparent effort to withhold information from Americans at a crucial juncture in the 2016 election. (Trump is accused of illegally covering up a $130,000 payment to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels to prevent her from going public with allegations of an affair on the eve of the election.)\nIt's also something Trump lied about, for whatever reason. And it's a trial to be decided by a jury of Trump's peers that should be wrapped up well in advance of the party conventions this summer, allowing Americans to render their own decisions on the proceedings.\nAdvertisement\nIn other words, it's a lot more substantial than a supposedly ill-timed criminal trial. And at the very least, we'll soon have an actual verdict on Trump's own alleged election interference.\nBelow is a summary of how what's known about Trump's actions compares to this purported 'election interference.'\nThe Manhattan 'hush money' case\nWhether Trump's and his then-lawyer Michael Cohen's efforts to keep Daniels silent changed the results of a tight 2016 election, we'll never know. But there is evidence that they feared the impact of her allegation on the campaign.\nAs far back as 2015, Trump and Cohen met with David Pecker, the then-chairman of American Media Inc. and publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid. Pecker, who became the first witness in the trial Monday, offered to buy the rights to stories that would reflect poorly on Trump's campaign and bury them \u2014 a practice known as 'catch and kill.'\nAdvertisement\nCohen has also released a September 2016 recording featuring Trump that suggests the efforts to bury such stories was indeed related to the campaign.\nThe Russia investigation\nSpecial counsel Robert S. Mueller III's report did not establish that Trump or members of his campaign conspired with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 election. But it did find that Russia targeted a hacking operation at Hillary Clinton's personal office just hours after Trump said publicly, 'Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.' (Trump claimed it was a joke, even as he has continued to solicit foreign help in campaigns.)\nTop Trump advisers also met at Trump Tower with a Russian promising dirt on Clinton. And a bipartisan Senate report left open the possibility that there was more 'collusion' beneath the surface.\nThe Ukraine scandal and impeachment\nApparently undeterred by the Russia investigation, Trump dispatched lawyer Rudy Giuliani to work with Ukrainian officials to try to dig up dirt on Trump's likeliest opponent, Joe Biden, early in the 2020 campaign.

He's now been indicted both federally and in Fulton County, Ga., for alleged election subversion. The accusations are that he illegally pressured state officials, organized slates of 'fake electors,' tried to misuse the Justice Department, pressured then-Vice President Pence, and exploited the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection to try to prevent Congress from confirming Biden's victory.\nWhether any of these actions will be determined to be illegal, his role in them is largely a matter of public record. There was no real reason to doubt the 2020 election results, but Trump pulled multiple levers in service of trying to overturn it.\nAdvertisement\nHe was also impeached shortly after Jan. 6. The charge then was incitement of insurrection rather than election interference more broadly, but the idea was that Trump whipped up the crowd in hopes of changing the result in Congress that day. A historic number of Senate Republicans (seven) voted to convict him, and many others who voted to acquit him indicated their vote was based upon a technicality rather than Trump's innocence.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Aaron Blake,Staff Writer","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TKTBEHCPRMI6XIPV7WXSRT6KSA.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.604082,"_id":"56ce98c96ffbc276a08b9044e62fc26d"},{"title":"Trump seems to nod off briefly as prospective jurors get instructions","author":"Isaac Arnsdorf","published_date":"2024-04-15 20:11:53","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/15/trump-asleep-court","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Donald Trump closed his eyes and appeared to nod off Monday afternoon in a Manhattan courtroom.

Anyone who's paid attention to Trump's political trajectory should seriously doubt that even multiple convictions, on the most serious charges, would have much impact one way or the other. The word 'shame' has no meaning in the Trump political universe.\nTrump is right, however, when he says we have a 'rigged' and 'two-tiered' justice system. But it's rigged in favor of people like him. Defendants who are rich, famous and powerful get to fly first-class.\nAdvertisement\nRecall how we got here: Some legal analysts bemoan the fact that this New York case \u2014 stemming from a hush money payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election, allegedly disguised in an illegal manner \u2014 is the first to go to trial. The allegations are hardly trivial: Trump's actions squelched embarrassing information that might have impacted the outcome of his race against Hillary Clinton. In language Trump would understand, that could be called 'election interference.'\nYes, the charges in the other cases involve weightier matters of state: the role Trump played in plotting to overthrow the 2020 election and inspiring the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection; the role he played in trying to reverse the election result in the state of Georgia specifically; and his alleged unlawful hoarding of highly sensitive classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, including in a chandeliered bathroom.\nBut why are those trials delayed? Because Trump took advantage of our two-tiered justice system to slow them down.\nAdvertisement\nAttorney General Merrick Garland bears some responsibility in the Jan. 6 case as he waited far too long to even begin an investigation of Trump's possible culpability. Granted, no Justice Department had ever put a former president on trial. But no president had ever allegedly conspired to cling to power by overturning or blocking certification of an election he had lost.\nOnce charges against Trump were finally brought, though, Trump had the money to hire phalanxes of lawyers who filed motion after motion to slow everything down. When the trial judge ruled against novel and fanciful legal arguments \u2014 that a president has 'absolute immunity' against criminal prosecution, for example \u2014 Trump could pay his lawyers to appeal. And then to appeal again, all the way to the Supreme Court.\nLikewise, in the classified documents case, Trump has employed lawyers to gum up the works with a blizzard of pretrial motions. It also happens that the inexperienced judge presiding over that case was appointed to the federal bench by Trump \u2014 an advantage no other defendant has had in the history of U.S. jurisprudence.\nAdvertisement\nIn Georgia, Trump had the wherewithal to hire lawyers who investigated the prosecutors and discovered a personal relationship they could paint as a potential conflict of interest. No overworked public defender would have done that. The case survives, but after months of delay.\nAnd how has Trump used all this time he bought? To viciously attack the judges (except the friendly one in Florida), prosecutors and potential jurors who dare to hold him accountable. He has defied the spirit and possibly the letter of gag orders, including one imposed by Merchan. A less rich, less famous, less powerful defendant would have been fined or jailed for contempt of court.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Eugene Robinson","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MKEATE5A75VVAB3F7CEQUAQV7A_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.571866,"_id":"8e8807e362d24987df71cecb6443cd37"},{"title":"Donald Trump will use his weekend reprieve from the courtroom to campaign in North Carolina","author":"Bill Barrow","published_date":"2024-04-20 04:28:13","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/20/trump-biden-2024-campaign-north-carolina/66cb9732-fece-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Former President Donald Trump is campaigning in North Carolina as he juggles legal troubles and his rematch against President Joe Biden","summary":"WILMINGTON, N.C. \u2014 On a weekend reprieve from the courtroom, former President Donald Trump will campaign Saturday in North Carolina as he juggles legal troubles and his rematch against President Joe Biden.\nTrump's evening stop in the coastal city of Wilmington marks his first rally since his criminal hush money trial began this week with jury selection in Manhattan. The occasion offers the former president a fresh chance to amplify claims that his multiple pending indictments are an establishment conspiracy to take him down \u2014 and, by extension, squelch the voters who first elected him eight years ago.\n'They want to keep me off the campaign trail,' Trump insisted earlier this week in Harlem, where he visited a neighborhood convenience store and addressed a throng of media outside. Rather than pursue violent criminals, he alleged, 'They go after Trump.'\nAdvertisement\nThe event Saturday also underscores the importance of North Carolina, a presidential battleground that Trump won by 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020. That was the closest margin of any state that Trump won. Saturday will be the second time in as many months that Trump has come to the state.\n'The presidential race is going to run through North Carolina,' said Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, in a recent interview.\nNorth Carolina is one of seven states that both the Trump and Biden campaigns have said they will dedicate significant campaign resources to winning. Trump has insisted he wants to widen the map, even into his native New York, which is heavily Democratic. Most Republicans, though, agree that Trump will have a difficult path to an Electoral College majority if Biden were to win North Carolina's 15 electoral votes. Trump tacitly acknowledged North Carolina's status by tapping then-state Republican Chairman Michael Whatley to lead his campaign's effective takeover of the Republican National Committee.\nAdvertisement\nThere is no precedent for the kind of campaign Trump now has to run \u2014 in North Carolina and nationally.\nWith opening arguments of his trial expected Monday, Trump will be confined to the courtroom for the foreseeable future, limiting his ability to see voters, fundraise and make calls. Biden, conversely, spent multiple days this week campaigning in Pennsylvania, another key battleground. Trump aides have promised weekend rallies and events on Wednesdays, the one weekday Trump's trial is expected to be in recess. The former president's campaign also has promised additional weeknight appearances around New York, as in Harlem.\nThat schedule adds pressure for Trump to maximize his limited opportunities to reach voters and command media attention beyond his indictments.\nIn North Carolina, Biden's campaign already has hired statewide leadership and field organizers for offices across the state.

Mercer said the GOP, from Trump to volunteers, will stress a family-first message around the economy and public safety.\nVoters, Mercer said, 'understand the importance of what those messages mean to them in their daily lives' and are 'fed up' with Biden, 'whether it's with sky high inflation, the open southern border or the migrant crime crisis.'\nAdvertisement\nTrump will be joined Saturday by North Carolina Republican gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson, whom Trump has endorsed and called 'Martin Luther King on steroids.'

Moreover, he might actually be held accountable for his repeated Truth Social screeds, following the judge's gag order prohibiting threats against witnesses.\nAs for the gag order, the Manhattan district attorney's office filed a motion on Monday to hold Trump in contempt. The prosecutors recalled that the court entered an order on April 1 prohibiting Trump from making or directing others 'to make public statements about known or reasonably foreseeable witnesses concerning their potential participation in the investigation or in this criminal proceeding' and later denied Trump's motion to stay that order on April 9. 'The very next day, and continuing through this past weekend, defendant willfully violated this Court's order by publishing several social media posts attacking two known witnesses \u2014 Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels,' the prosecutor argued. 'These attacks unquestionably violate the Court's April 1 order. And defendant's violation is willful: a continuation of conduct that this Court has already found to be \u2018deliberate and intended to intimidate this Court and impede the orderly administration of this trial.''\nThe penalty sought is mild considering Trump's wealth: $1,000 for each of three violations of the court's order, an order 'to remove the social media posts attacking Cohen and Daniels' and a warning that 'future violations of the Court's restrictions on his extrajudicial statements can be punished not only with additional fines, but also with a term of incarceration of up to thirty days.' In the case of his civil trial, Judge Arthur Engoron's fines had their intended effect: The threats stopped for the balance of that trial.\nAdvertisement\nWhile prosecutors stand a good chance of prevailing, given Trump's outbursts against two critical witnesses, the court might soon be faced with the prospect of more social media outbursts. The presumptive GOP nominee's inability to contain himself might present Merchan with a dilemma: Jail Trump, allowing him to play the martyr, or permit him to bully witnesses and perhaps others associated with the trial?\nMerchan no doubt would like to avoid incarcerating a former president (even if it amounts to merely putting him in a holding cell behind the courtroom), but he does have another option: Add some zeros to the fines. The fines might start at, say, $100,000 and go up from there.\nThe trickier issue concerns Trump's in-court conduct. Falling asleep on the first day earned him ridicule on social media and TV cable shows, but also might suggest he does not appreciate the gravity of his situation.\nAdvertisement\nEven worse, Trump said something audibly and gestured as a dismissed prospective juror left the courtroom, which earned him a smackdown from the judge. 'I won't tolerate it. I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom. \u2026 I want to make that crystal clear,' Merchan said. If Trump is acting out on just the second day \u2014 and if his muttering during the E. Jean Carroll and New York civil trials are any indication \u2014 he might not be able to refrain from forcing the judge to hold him in contempt.\nFollow this author Jennifer Rubin 's opinions\nFollow this author\nJennifer Rubin\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nDisplaying his belligerence, bullying and showing disdain for rules will not endear Trump to the jury. But in Trump's perverse mind-set, baiting the judge and even risking conviction in a 'rigged' trial, as he claims, might seem politically advantageous: The more he is punished, the more his supporters rally to his side. (Trump seems incapable of appreciating that this behavior pushes all other voters into the arms of his opponent.)\nWhether deliberate or not, any further outbursts from Trump will leave Merchan little choice. After one warning, he cannot allow his courtroom to become a ring in Trump's circus. If Trump keeps it up, Merchan eventually will be left no choice but to remove Trump, even for just a day.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jennifer Rubin","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2RSPX5RAGN5I7RISW3LRG6BBOE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.5705495,"_id":"4d7ad44f561d107e05fc938c909b0662"},{"title":"Trump trial further splinters his relationship with his beloved New York","author":"Josh Dawsey","published_date":"2024-04-17 09:00:01","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/17/trump-hush-money-new-york-manhattan-queens","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"He was a Queens-born developer who conquered Manhattan and the tabloids, but now he's a Florida man who visits the city only intermittently.","summary":"NEW YORK \u2014 He was a publicity hound and a tabloid star. He was a developer who bragged about his acquisitions and exaggerated his wealth, emblazoning his name on towers that scraped the sky. He was a Queens boy made good \u2014 with no small amount of help from his father's money \u2014 bursting onto the Manhattan scene through sheer force of personality.\nDonald Trump was, in short, a certain type of New Yorker \u2014 brash, boorish, bombastic.\nBut now, in a New York trial that began Monday \u2014 Trump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up an alleged hush money payment to an adult-film star during the 2016 election \u2014 the former president's long-running and turbulent love affair with the city seems to have finally run into irreconcilable differences.\nTrump has officially decamped for his private Mar-a-Lago Club, changing his official residence in the third year of his presidency from Manhattan to Palm Beach, Fla. He has been walloped at the ballot box, losing his home state resoundingly in both 2016 and 2020 \u2014 even as he talks of hosting a rally at Madison Square Garden this year and urges his advisers to say he could win New York in November. A September 2017 NBC 4 New York-Marist New York City poll \u2014 from the first year of his presidency \u2014 found that 21 percent of New York City voters approved of him and 72 percent disapproved, with 54 percent 'strongly' disapproving.\nAdvertisement\nNow, a jury of his peers is set to decide his fate in one of four criminal cases he faces. But that is not all.\nIn February, New York Attorney General Letitia James won a civil fraud case against Trump, who was ordered by a judge to pay more than $350 million \u2014 a penalty that, with interest, tops out at closer to $450 million. And until he posted bond at the beginning of this month, James had been threatening to seize some of his major New York assets, including his prized 40 Wall Street and Trump Tower buildings.\nEarlier this year, a New York jury awarded advice columnist E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million in a defamation case against Trump, which followed another New York jury last year finding Trump liable for sexual abuse in a civil case filed by Carroll.\nTo Trump, according to people who know him, the city he once aspired to inhabit now seems to be conspiring against him, culminating in something of a tabloid-style divorce \u2014 not dissimilar to the Page Six spectacle of the 1990 end of his marriage to his first wife, Ivana.\nAdvertisement\n'My take from Trump was that he always had this huge fixation on New York,' said Melissa DeRosa, a top aide to former New York governor Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who met with Trump in the Oval Office on multiple occasions. 'He felt very burned by the people here and by the politicians. But he always wanted to know what was going on in the city, who was saying what, and he was very fixated on what was happening in New York.'\nTrump's New York is one of big brassy skyscrapers, big buxom blondes and big red ties. It is where he made a cameo in the 1992 'Home Alone' sequel during a scene at the Plaza Hotel \u2014 which he owned at the time \u2014 and it served as the high-pressure, moneyed backdrop for his hit show, 'The Apprentice.'\nIt is garish and grandiose, not unlike Trump himself.\n'He's a New Yorker to his bones,' said Tim O'Brien, a senior executive editor of Bloomberg Opinion and a Trump biographer who is critical of the former president. 'He's an outer-borough New Yorker who loves New York sports and New York money and New York media and New York institutions and the New York business brawl, and he wants for all of that to accept him. And now he's getting rejected in the most blatant and strong-minded of ways \u2014 by his peers, by voters, by judges.'\nAdvertisement\nBut it is also the New York of a consummate outsider, relentlessly striving for acceptance among the entrenched Manhattan elite \u2014 with Trump a real-life Gatsby, perpetually stretching toward the green light, just out of reach.\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton, a longtime New York civil rights activist and current MSNBC host, recalled appearing on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' just after the 2016 election. The hosts asked him to explain Trump and how he managed to appeal to people seemingly so different from himself.\n'You need to be from New York to understand Trump,' Sharpton said.\nSharpton offered his explanation on the air: Trump is an outsider from Queens, 'not part of the Park Avenue real estate hierarchy and the blue bloods who eat at the Four Seasons and have breakfast at the Regency.' Trump called minutes later.\nAdvertisement\n'I told my wife, \u2018Al gets me,'' Trump said on the phone, according to Sharpton. '\u2018Al understands these muckety-mucks downtown, and they look down on me just like the establishment looks down on you. You're from Brooklyn \u2014 you get it. And now, look at me! Can you believe it? I'm the president of the United States.''\nBut Sharpton cautioned that a Manhattan jury is unlikely to be sympathetic: 'He better know that 12 New Yorkers from a jury are not people who see themselves as outsiders.'\nTodd Blanche, one of Trump's lawyers, has suggested to Trump advisers that he believes the actual case is, on the merits, the weakest of the four Trump is facing \u2014 but that it will be difficult to win because the city's jury pool dislikes him so much.\nIn a court filing last month seeking to delay the case, Trump's lawyers unsuccessfully argued that New York County is 'overwhelmingly biased against President Trump.' Alan Garten, another one of Trump's lawyers, argued privately after Trump's 2020 election loss that he needed to move his company out of the state, according to a person who heard him.\nAdvertisement\nSpokespeople for Trump did not respond to questions for this article.\nTrump's physical sliver of New York has changed, too. His Trump Tower office in Midtown is mostly cleaned out, with little on the walls and 'no hubbub and buzz, like there used to be,' said one adviser who has been there with him. Many of his longtime employees are gone, and his former chief financial officer is in jail.\nTrump no longer ventures out to his favorite haunt for dinner, the throwback 21 Club \u2014 where the waiters knew his preferred table (No. 14) and his usual order (a well-done burger, with fries) \u2014 because the Secret Service and his motorcade snarled traffic. He is now sometimes greeted by loud protesters who can be heard inside his building.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThis adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share candid details, said that Trump 'doesn't have that many people to see there' anymore, and 'it's not like it once was.' Though the former president still loves his apartment in the city \u2014 a gilded triplex in Trump Tower \u2014 he says 'doing business there isn't like it used to be,' this person added. While in town for the trial, he has been spending nights there and hosting dinners with donors and world leaders.\nAdvertisement\nIn some ways, Trump's split with New York, which was hastened by his political career, is unsurprising. The relationship had always been tumultuous and based on unequal, if mutual, need.\nFor many financial institutions, the appeal of doing business with Trump changed in the mid-to-late 2000s, said Robert Wolf, a former CEO and chairman of UBS Americas.\n'Trump once was a brand that businesses would be fine attaching themselves to,' Wolf said, explaining that changed when all the major banks began viewing risk differently. 'Some banks were comfortable with real estate exposure, some weren't. Some were comfortable with casino risk, and some weren't. \u2026 We were comfortable until we weren't.'\nKathryn Wylde, the CEO of the Partnership for New York City, the city's biggest business lobbying group, said the New York business community thought it was 'incredible,' in a surreal way, when Trump became president.\nAdvertisement\n'Everyone in New York who has dealt with Trump has a story, and most of them reflect unpleasant experiences doing business with him,' Wylde said. 'Not all, to be clear \u2014 you have a few who are big fans. But the vast majority of people had a bad experience.'\nTrump often wanted to use his fame to secure better deals. Cristyne Nicholas, a prominent public relations executive, recalled haggling with him over her contract to work on his golf course project in the Bronx in 2014.\n'He believed we should have been doing this pro bono; his position was a lot of firms would do anything to be associated with the Trump name and fame,' Nicholas recalled.\nNicholas said she agreed to a below-market rate \u2014 and began courting politicians in the Bronx to appear. Soon, though, she saw perceptions of Trump change. 'Every Bronx politician was chomping at the bit to speak and be invited, and a few weeks later, he announces he's running for president, and they pretend they don't know him,' she said.\nAdvertisement\nNicholas said she gently warned Trump against running for president, saying it would make him less popular in New York. He disagreed, citing 'everyone I run into on the street.'\nWhen he announced his presidential campaign in 2015, some former employees believed it was a gimmick to generate buzz for himself in New York, according to people who worked for him at the time.\nWylde added that Trump had never been a member of her partnership, nor the Real Estate Board of New York, the city's most influential real estate group.\nNonetheless, in April 2017, Wylde brought a group of the city's top real estate and finance CEOs to visit Trump in the Oval Office, where he lavishly praised them for being successful, calling them 'killers.'\n'He was very friendly,' she said. 'He was thrilled when they all showed up to pay homage to him. That hadn't happened before.'\nIn one meeting with Cuomo, a Democrat who had known Trump for decades, Trump talked about how New York real estate titans were 'now my best friends' \u2014 a tongue-in-cheek reflection of his becoming president \u2014 and called Cuomo 'my governor,' according to one attendee. After another coronavirus meeting with Cuomo that frequently veered off topic, Trump's team wanted to have a news conference to highlight the governor of New York visiting the White House, but Cuomo demurred, according to Gareth Rhodes, a former Cuomo aide who attended the meeting.\nBut the president wasn't always jovial. In a different 2020 meeting, he began by berating Cuomo because the New York attorney general had just subpoenaed his son \u2014 a development that wasn't public, said DeRosa, the top Cuomo aide. Trump insisted that the governor had orchestrated it, but Cuomo was unaware of the subpoena.\n'The meeting was over before it began,' DeRosa said.\nOver two hours on a recent Friday outside 40 Wall Street, in the Financial District, hundreds of people snapped photos of Trump's building, while only about 50 people entered and left the building. Three large security guards stood sentry in the marble lobby, taking special notice of individuals who approached.\nEmployees in the building have gotten accustomed to Trump visiting because of his court dates, and several said Eric Trump was a regular visitor.\nIn some ways \u2014 much like Trump Tower in Midtown \u2014 the iconic Wall Street building has become a tourist curiosity, as well as a recipient of animosity toward the former president. People who work there recounted a slew of incidents of Trump haters directing their ire at the building: the mentally ill man who entered the lobby and began screaming that Trump is a molester; the elderly woman who walked up and spit on the building; the person who flung what looked like urine at the tower; the large inflatable rat that was once positioned outside; the passersby who pause to hold up their middle finger.\nMany of the employees in the building \u2014 which houses law firms, accounting firms and assorted other white-collar businesses \u2014 said they were not fans of Trump, nor of working at a facility with his name emblazoned on it in large letters. They described it as a typical Lower Manhattan high-rise office building, kept clean but with few frills. Since the pandemic, almost every employee said, the building has been far more empty.\nBut there were some supporters.\nRicardo Hudson, a 38-year-old IT professional who works in the building, said he 'isn't very political' but he's a Trump fan.\n'When I think of Trump, I think of billionaires and money,' said Hudson, who was born in Jamaica but grew up in New York, where he now lives. 'I don't think people appreciated him a lot as president, but now they're saying they want to vote for him.'\nDavid Roitblat, the founder of Better Accounting Solutions, which has an office in the building, said that as a businessman, he has closely followed the cases against Trump and believes they are 'politicized.' If James had seized 40 Wall Steet, Roitblat said, he would have moved his company 'on principle.'\nLuke Hickinbotham, an Australian tourist visiting the United States, had ventured down to stretch his arm up and capture a picture of Trump's building.\n'Everyone at home thinks he's crazy; even the conservative right-wing people think he's a bit crazy. He's kind of the epitome of bonkers America,' he said. 'But he's entertaining to watch if he's not your president.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Josh Dawsey,Ashley Parker","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7U3ATAHS4UI6VABFLU2IS5UKZA.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.5641665,"_id":"0175a6a8fb7bac3a9c6eaf3b32cb4c36"},{"title":"In a luxe N.Y. condo, residents battle over dumping the Trump name","author":"Maham Javaid","published_date":"2024-04-19 11:00:12","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/04/19/trump-building-new-rochelle-name","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"'Like when your parents are getting divorced': Inside the hallways of the building where the condo board wants to dump Trump's name.","summary":"A referendum underway inside one New York condominium building has led to bitter divisions between once-friendly neighbors, who have handed out dueling information and lobbed accusations of wrongdoing back and forth as votes are tallied.\nAt issue? Whether to strip former president Donald Trump's name from the facade of their luxury high-rise \u2014 one of the tallest in downtown New Rochelle, N.Y.\nThe board of Trump Plaza New Rochelle dropped the Trump Organization as the building's property manager three years ago, then in 2022 asked the 194 unit owners to vote on dropping the Trump name. Most favored a rebrand, but the election didn't hit the required supermajority. That led the board to launch a second vote, infuriating a group of residents who are fighting tooth-and-nail to continue living under the banner of the politically divisive 45th president.\nAdvertisement\nRelationships in the hallways have turned icy, some say. 'The mood in the building feels like when your parents are getting divorced,' said one renter, Paul K., who spoke on the condition that his last name be withheld because he's trying to stay out of the fray.\nOne the one side is former board member Rudy Southwell: 'We all bought into the building with the Trump name because it denotes luxury even with all the political issues. To me it's financially sound to keep the name, because people will get over today's news cycle, but this building will stand for years.'\nOn the other side: Current board president Greg Root, pushing for a 'neutral name.'\nOwners are being asked to cast ballots on re-christening the building for its address, One Seventy Five Huguenot Condominium.

But Root maintains that those campaigning against change are merely a 'small but vocal minority' he alleges is 'spreading misinformation, false allegations and conspiracy theories.'\nEach side accuses the other of being driven by politics. Root, however, argues that the association with the twice-impeached president is hurting property values, citing an analysis the board conducted from news stories and real estate data.\n'Based on market analysis, not politics, it is in the financial best interest of the unit owners,' he said.\nThe condo board in New Rochelle, a city of roughly 82,000 about 40 minutes from midtown Manhattan where almost 56 percent of registered voters are Democrats, is not the first to try to take down the former president's name; buildings in Stamford, Toronto, Manhattan and Panama have done so since he stepped into politics. Most revamps have been prompted by concerns the Trump link was dinging property values.\nElsewhere in Westchester County, which includes New Rochelle, different Trump-branded buildings have come to different decisions. Yorktown's Trump Park Residences kept the name, and White Plains' former Trump Tower at City Center rebranded as the Tower at City Place, according to the Journal News.\nInside the New Rochelle condo, the idea of prying the platinum letters off the high-rise has led to a battle reminiscent of recent U.S. elections. The group fiercely committed to the Trump name has created PowerPoint presentations and fliers of their own, alleging they are being censored, the vote is rigged and the board is breaking its bylaws. The board adamantly denies those claims and an unaffiliated attorney who practices condo law told The Washington Post the voting process appears compliant with the bylaws.\nthe voting process appears compliant with the bylaws.\nAdvertisement\nThe saga roiling Trump Plaza New Rochelle shows how the former president's rise to the White House, his contentious term and the barrage of legal cases that followed have altered his brand.

But as many as half are concerned about fairness and the role of politics.","summary":"For the better part of the past eight years, Donald Trump has laid the groundwork to get voters to dismiss any adverse result in a court of law as the product of a political 'witch hunt' or a 'weaponized' justice system.\nNow the effort is reaching its culmination, with Trump suffering multiple major losses in civil court and his first criminal trial starting in Manhattan this week, six and a half months before the 2024 election.\nAmericans writ large aren't inclined to accept Trump's framing at this point. But even those skeptical of it harbor concerns about his being given a fair shake in ways that could especially matter with his Manhattan trial under way.\nLet's take it piece by piece.\n1. Americans mostly blame Trump and say the scrutiny is appropriate\nOne consistent finding in the polls is that Americans don't broadly buy into the 'witch hunt' framing. They don't appear to have much sympathy for Trump, because they think he's brought this situation upon himself.\nAdvertisement\nA Washington Post-University of Maryland poll in December asked whether the Justice Department was 'holding Trump accountable under the law like anyone else' or 'unfairly targeting Trump for political reasons.' Americans chose the former by a wide margin: 57 percent to 41 percent. Even 20 percent of Republicans said Trump was being treated justly.\nA January USA Today/Suffolk University poll featured a similar, if somewhat less lopsided, split. A majority \u2014 52 percent \u2014 agreed that the legal actions against Trump were the 'appropriate work of the justice system,' compared to 43 percent who said they were 'inappropriate and should be dropped.'\nAnd a CNN poll from August showed Americans are significantly more inclined to blame Trump's many criminal charges on his actions (47 percent) than on a supposed 'political abuse of the justice system' (31 percent). (An additional 21 percent said it was hard to know.)\n2. Crucially, they also think he's guilty\nAnother hurdle for Trump in all of this is that, regardless of perceptions of the process, Americans by and large think he's actually a criminal. While reviews of each individual indictment vary \u2014 around half or less think he's guilty in a given case \u2014 clear majorities think he's committed at least some significant crimes.\nAdvertisement\nIn a New York Times-Siena College poll released this weekend, Americans said 54 percent to 37 percent that Trump has committed serious federal crimes. (Even about 1 in 5 Republicans agree.)\nIn the Post-University of Maryland poll, Americans said 56-33 that Trump was guilty of election subversion. Twice as many said he was 'definitely guilty' (40 percent) as said he was 'definitely innocent' (20 percent).\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAnd even aside from whether he's ultimately found guilty, Americans see there being legitimate evidence that could at least point in that direction \u2014 and seemingly justify charges and a trial. In a Public Religion Research Institute poll in August, Americans said 58 percent to 37 percent that there was 'credible evidence' that Trump committed 'serious federal crimes.'\nAt the very least, most Americans haven't thrown a blanket over these cases and dismissed them outright, as Trump would like. As many as 4 in 10 align with his argument that he's being politically targeted, but fewer see him as essentially blameless or that there's no justification for the charges.\n3. They do see politics at work and aren't convinced the process will be fair\nAll of that said, larger numbers of Americans do harbor a certain skepticism of these proceedings that could ultimately matter, depending on how things unfold. They see politics at play and aren't convinced Trump will be treated fairly.\nAdvertisement\nThat could be particularly relevant given that the case they regard with the most skepticism, in Manhattan, is going first and could be the only trial held before the 2024 election.\nSome Americans are of two minds on this. While the Times-Siena poll has shown that clear majorities think Trump has committed crimes, in its December edition, Americans said 49 percent to 43 percent that they didn't believe he would get a fair and impartial trial in his federal election-subversion case.\nSimilarly, a Reuters-Ipsos poll last week showed Americans were slightly more inclined to believe Trump's prosecutions were 'excessive and politically motivated' (48 percent) than not (41 percent).\nWe see that 'politically motivated' label lingering in other polls. The Times-Siena poll in December showed Americans about evenly split on whether the charges were 'politically motivated' (46 percent) or based on the prosecutors' actual belief that he committed crimes (48 percent).\nAdvertisement\nAnd on no case has the perception been more pronounced than the Manhattan case. Shortly before Trump was indicted, a March 2023 Quinnipiac University poll showed twice as many said the case was 'mainly motivated by politics' (62 percent) as said it was 'mainly motivated by the law' (32 percent).\nSeeing politics at play is not the same as seeing Trump as blameless or not warranting charges.\nBut you begin to see how the Manhattan prosecution being the first and potentially only pre-election case could harm the efforts to prosecute Trump. Only about a third of Americans think Trump is guilty in the case; they see the charges as less serious; and sizable numbers are on the lookout for unfairness and politics.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Staff Writer,Aaron Blake","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TQUGPSMQNFKUHQGJ3DBTDRXP44_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.5629716,"_id":"98e3a1eb7639685d336f22b7e5dc560a"},{"title":"Poland's president becomes the latest leader to visit Donald Trump as allies eye a possible return","author":"Jill Colvin","published_date":"2024-04-18 01:02:13","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/17/trump-poland-duda-election/4a5dbf0e-fd1f-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Former President Donald Trump has met in New York with Polish President Andrzej Duda","summary":"NEW YORK \u2014 Former President Donald Trump met Wednesday in New York with Polish President Andrzej Duda, the latest in a series of meetings with foreign leaders as Europe braces for the possibility of a second Trump term.\nThe presumptive Republican nominee hosted Duda for dinner at Trump Tower, where the two were expected to discuss Ukraine, among other topics. Duda, who has long expressed admiration for Trump, is also a staunch supporter of Ukraine and has encouraged Washington to provide more aid to Kyiv amid Russian's ongoing invasion. That funding has been held up by Trump allies in Congress.\nAs he arrived, Trump praised the Polish president, saying, 'He's done a fantastic job and he's my friend.'\n'We had four great years together,' Trump added. 'We're behind Poland all the way.'\nU.S. allies across the world were caught off guard by Trump's surprise 2016 win, forcing them to scramble to build relationships with a president who often attacked longstanding treaties and alliances they valued. Setting up meetings with him during the 2024 campaign suggests they don't want to be behind again.\nAdvertisement\nEven as he goes on trial for one of the four criminal indictments against him, Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden are locked in a rematch that most observers expect will be exceedingly close in November.\n'The polls are close,' said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a Biden ally and a major voice in his party on foreign affairs. 'If I were a foreign leader \u2014 and there's a precedent attached to meeting with candidates who are nominated or on the path to being nominated \u2014 I'd probably do it too.'\nMurphy noted that former President Barack Obama did a lengthy international tour and met with foreign leaders when he first ran for the White House. So did Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, who challenged Obama in 2012 and whose trip included a stop in Poland's capital, Warsaw.\nDuda's visit comes a week after Trump met with British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, another NATO member and key proponent of supporting Ukraine, at the former president's Florida estate.\nAdvertisement\nAnd last month, Trump hosted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, an autocrat who has maintained the closest relationship with Russia among European Union countries. Orban shared a montage of footage of the visit on his Instagram feed, with included an image of him and his staff meeting with Trump and the former president's aides in a scene that looked like an official bilateral meeting.\nTrump also met briefly in February with Javier Milei, the fiery, right-wing populist president of Argentina who ran a campaign inspired by Trump, complete with red 'Make Argentina Great Again' hats. Milei gave Trump an excited hug backstage at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, according to video posted by a Trump campaign aide.\nBiden administration officials have been careful not to weigh in publicly on foreign leaders' meetings with Trump, who they acknowledge has a real chance of winning the race.\nAdvertisement\nWhile some officials have privately expressed frustration with such meetings, they are mindful that any criticism would open the U.S. to charges of hypocrisy because senior American officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, meet frequently with foreign opposition figures at various forums in the United States and abroad.\nSecurity and policy officials monitor the travel plans of foreign officials visiting the U.S., but generally don't have a say in where they go or with whom they meet, according to an administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss protocol.\nTrump has been back in his hometown this week for the start of his criminal hush money trial, which has dramatically limited his ability to travel and campaign. While in town, aides have been planning a series of events that began Tuesday night when Trump, after court adjourned, stopped by a Harlem bodega where a man was killed to rail against crime and blast the district attorney who made him the first former president in U.S. history to stand criminal trial.\nAdvertisement\nDuda, a right-wing populist who once proposed naming a military base in his country 'Fort Trump,' described the dinner earlier Wednesday as a private get-together between friends at Trump's former residence while he is in town for meetings at the United Nations.\n'I have been invited by Mr. Donald Trump to his private apartment,' Duda told reporters, saying it was 'a normal practice when one country has good relations with another country' to want those relations to be as strong as 'possible with the representatives of various sides of the political stage.'\nHe described a friendly relationship with Trump built over years of working together.\n'We know each other as people. Like two, I can say in some way, friends,' said Duda, whose term ends in 2025.\nDuda's visit comes as House Republicans wrangle over a $95 billion foreign aid bill that would provide new funding to Ukraine, including money for the U.S. military to replace depleting weapon supplies.\nAdvertisement\nMany Trump allies in the House are fiercely opposed to aiding Ukraine, even as the country warns that it is struggling amid a fresh Russian offensive. Trump has said he might be open to aid in the form of a loan.\nLike Cameron, Duda's efforts to push the U.S. to approve additional aid put him in common cause with Biden, who has struggled for six months to unlock additional congressional funding.\nOne area where Trump and Duda agree when it comes to the conflict are their efforts to push NATO members to increase their defense spending. Duda has called on fellow members of the alliance to raise their spending to 3% of gross domestic product as Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine. That would represent a significant increase from the current commitment of 2% by 2024.\nTrump, in a stunning break from past U.S. precedent, has long been critical of the Western alliance and has threatened not to defend member nations that do not hit that spending goal. That threat strikes at the heart of the alliance's Article 5, which states that any attack against one NATO member will be considered an attack against all.\nAdvertisement\nIn February, Trump went even further, recounting that he'd once told leaders that he would 'encourage' Russia to 'do whatever the hell they want' to members that are \u2014 in his words \u2014 'delinquent.'\nDuda suggested he intended to raise his proposal at the dinner.\n'I have never talked with President Donald Trump about my proposal of raising the spending on defense of NATO countries from 2% to 3% of GDP, but I think that his approach to it will be positive,' he said.\nThe visit was met with mixed reaction in Poland, where fears of Russia run high and Duda's friendly relationship with Trump has been a source of controversy.\nPoland's centrist Prime Minister Donald Tusk, a political opponent of Duda, was critical of the dinner but expressed hope that Duda would use it as an opportunity 'to raise the issue of clearly siding with the Western world, democracy and Europe in this Ukrainian-Russian conflict.'\nAdvertisement\nDuda, for his part, said he wasn't worried since presidents regularly meet with various politicians during foreign trips.\n'No, I am not worried because presidents meet with their colleagues, especially with those who had held presidential offices in their respective countries,' he said. 'This is regular practice, there is nothing extraordinary here.'\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jill Colvin,Monika Scislowska","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IZSYFJX5D4I65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.556155,"_id":"a3a75ac4146f7b90167c218bdfbd6164"},{"title":"Donald Trump brings his campaign to the courthouse as his criminal hush money trial begins","author":"Jill Colvin","published_date":"2024-04-16 01:10:56","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/15/trump-criminal-trial-campaign/2d693668-fb8e-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Former President Donald Trump spent his first day on trial as a criminal defendant lashing out at the judge and prosecutors, casting himself as a victim and angrily posting on social media","summary":"NEW YORK \u2014 Former President Donald Trump began his day as a criminal defendant lashing out at the judge and prosecutors, casting himself as a victim and angrily posting on social media.\nIn other words: a familiar routine.\nBut inside the courtroom, which was closed to TV cameras, Trump was a different man \u2014 reserved and muted in a stark departure from his feisty approach to other legal troubles.\nThe contrast spoke to the gravity of his situation. Trump is now the first former president ever to stand trial on criminal charges and faces the prospect, if he loses, of becoming the first major American presidential candidate in history to run as a convicted felon.\nTrump is accused in the case of falsifying business records to hide alleged hush money payments made to a porn star to keep her from going public during his 2016 campaign with allegations of an affair.\nAdvertisement\nThe trial is expected to last at least six weeks and Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is required to attend every day court is in session \u2014 a schedule that will dramatically alter his daily life and his ability to campaign in battleground states.\nSo Trump instead brought his campaign to the courthouse, delivering statements before and after the day's proceedings, which he again cast as nothing more than a politically motivated effort by his rivals to hinder his campaign.\n'This is political persecution,' he steamed after arriving with a phalanx of lawyers and several senior aides, but without his wife or other family members. 'This is an assault on our country,' he went on.\nTrump is already well practiced in the art of campaigning from the courtroom. In addition to appearances related to his four criminal trials, Trump this year voluntarily attended most days of his civil fraud trial as well as a defamation case brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll, who had accused Trump of rape.\nAdvertisement\nThose two trials did not end well for Trump: The former president was found liable in both cases, and now owes over half a billion dollars, including interest.\nDuring those hearings, Trump was often admonished by the judges, who instructed him to be quiet or answer questions more succinctly. At one point, the judge in the Carroll suit threatened to kick Trump out of the courtroom for speaking loudly. Another day he stormed out. Trump also openly sparred with the judge in his civil fraud case, including from the witness stand.\nSuch behavior would not be tolerated in a criminal courtroom and Judge Juan Merchan made clear Trump could be sent to jail and prosecuted separately if he were to engage in such disruptive behavior.\nOn Monday, Trump did not.\nAt times, he was seen whispering and passing notes with Todd Blanche, his lead attorney. But during other stretches, Trump slouched forward, casting his gaze toward the ceiling, or leaned back in his chair with his arms folded and his eyes closed.\nAdvertisement\nEvery movement was memorialized by a small pool of reporters inside. As he entered the courtroom, Trump 'paused for a split second' and 'licked his lips' before walking up the courtroom's center aisle. When he was introduced as the defendant, Trump turned and gave prospective jurors 'a little tight-lipped smirk.' Later, when he exited the courtroom for a break, Trump glared at a New York Times reporter who earlier had reported Trump had fallen asleep in his chair.\nWhile his body language was carefully parsed, he was seen more than heard.\nDuring the first day of his trial, Trump said just five words on the record \u2014 'Yes' once, and 'Yes, sir' twice \u2014 as he was read his so-called 'Parker warnings' informing him that his right to be present at the trial could be revoked if he acted out and that he could be sent to jail for disruptive behavior.\nAdvertisement\nIt remains unclear how long Trump's restraint will last as the trial drags on.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe sterile, fluorescent-lit courtroom is a world away from the gilded Mar-a-Lago club where he has taken up residency in his post-presidential life. There he is surrounded by doting staff and ardent supporters who deliver standing ovations every night as he enters the dining room.\nIn the courtroom, Trump was introduced to jurors not as president \u2014 as his aides still call him \u2014 but 'Mr. Donald J. Trump' \u2014 and faced restraints, including the prospect that he might not be granted permission to attend his youngest son's high school graduation.\nThe judge has not ruled on the matter, but did bar Trump from traveling to Washington next Thursday, when the Supreme Court will take up his argument that, as a former president, he is immune from prosecution.\nAdvertisement\n'We think that it is important for the court to remind Mr. Trump that he is a criminal defendant and that he is under the court's supervision,' one prosecutor, Christopher Conroy, said.\nWith Trump stuck in New York for the foreseeable future, aides have been planning rallies and other political events on weekends and on Wednesdays, when court is not supposed to be in session. Merchan said Monday that Wednesdays could be added if he trial falls behind schedule.\nAides are also considering possible events around New York after court ends for the day. Trump has often talked about wanting to campaign in his home state, even though New York remains overwhelmingly Democratic.\nHe is also expected continue to speak from the courthouse and hold press conferences to spin each day's proceedings, as he has in his other trials.\nAdvertisement\nWhile Trump has complained about being taken off the campaign trail, he has been keeping a relatively light schedule of public events since he locked up the GOP nomination last month, with most of his rallies scheduled on weekends anyway. Instead, he has been focused on fundraising as he tries to close the gap with his Democratic rival, President Joe Biden.\nHe is also expected to rely more heavily on surrogates. On Monday, allies including North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and Florida Rep. Byron Donalds \u2014 all potential vice presidential or cabinet picks \u2014 fanned out across cable networks to blast the case.\nTrump's indictments proved beneficial during the primaries, helping him rake in tens of millions of dollars from angry supporters and denying his GOP rivals the media spotlight as they were trying to gain traction.\nAdvertisement\nIt's unclear, however, how a criminal trial and possible conviction resonate with the broader general election audience, which includes more moderate and independent voters that could decide the race.\nNearly half of registered voters, 46%, said in a recent NYT/Siena College poll that Trump 'should be found guilty' in the New York trial. And about 6 in 10 said the charges were 'very' or 'somewhat' serious.\nThe details of the case are salacious \u2014 involving a porn star, tabloids and hush money payments. But the case is widely see as posing less of a legal risk to Trump than his other cases, which accuse him of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election and of charges under the Espionage Act over his hoarding of classified documents that could lead to serious jail time.\nBut the hush money case could be the only one that makes it to trial before November's vote.\nAdvertisement\nBiden's campaign, meanwhile, ignored Monday's proceedings as his aides seek to avoid the appearance of judicial interference.\nCampaign officials said Monday that they will instead focus on continuing to present a political split-screen between the two men, with the president focused on governing and Trump focused on himself.\nThat contrast was especially striking this weekend, as Iran launched an attack against Israel and Biden worked to prevent a wider Middle East escalation, speaking by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jordan's King Abdullah II.\nHe'll spend the week campaigning in battleground Pennsylvania, with events planned in Scranton, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, as Trump remains in court.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Michael R.

Last summer he wrote that he himself would not be running for president because 'beating Trump is more important.' In January, when he was stumping for Nikki Haley, he said that Trump 'can barely keep a cogent thought' without a teleprompter. At an event in February, he explained his belief that Trump wouldn't be the party's standard-bearer forever by saying that 'a--holes come and go.'\nAs he said all this, he added a caveat: He'd support the eventual GOP nominee, even if it was Trump.\nAnd now, at the Gridiron, Sununu was accepting the inevitable, because it's happening.\n'My focus isn't about Trump.

Jan. 6, 2021, had been a breaking point. He thought about not voting for president. Or writing someone in, as he'd done in 2016. Then, on March 25, the United States abstained from vetoing a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. Three days later, Levine was at his keyboard typing an email to 1,600 of his contacts.\nAdvertisement\nSubject line: 'NEVER SAY NEVER; WHY I WILL VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP.'\n'I remain concerned about Trump's relationship with the truth,' Levine wrote in the email.

The question becomes: as between the two, who will leave a better, safer, and more prosperous America for my grandchildren? Hands down, the answer is Trump.'\nIn an interview, Levine cited a laundry list of Biden's shortcomings, beyond the U.N. vote, to justify his support of Trump: the 'catastrophic' withdrawal from Afghanistan, 'the open border,' 'failed Bidenomics,' and a 'social justice agenda' that's 'particularly damaging to America's Jews.' And he was upset about how the Biden administration had been trying to use its influence to undermine Israel's military offensive in Gaza. Biden lately has cautioned that a military assault on the city of Rafah would be a 'mistake' and has advocated for a freer flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n'When the Allies were firebombing Dresden, did anyone say let's stop and feed the civilians?'

Congress does very little, even the president ends up doing very little, but the agencies themselves have a huge impact on the lives, very quietly, when it comes to the rules and policies that they implement without congressional approval.'\nLiz Cheney blames the general Republican drift back to Trump on Kevin McCarthy, the former GOP leader who visited Trump's home in Palm Beach for lunch and posed for a photo with him a few weeks after the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n'What we saw happen was this notion that Republican elected officials excused the behavior, enabled the behavior' of Trump, said Cheney, the former Wyoming congresswoman who was essentially booted from Congress by fellow Republicans for criticizing Trump too much, at a talk in Iowa last month. 'And by doing that it created a situation where I think voters thought, \u2018Well, it must not be that he's that dangerous, because if he were, then you would have more people saying so.'' (McCarthy, who's also endorsed Trump, recently explained that visit by saying he just wanted to check up on Trump because 'when something bad happens in your life, everybody abandons you.')\nBut this all really may have started before Jan. 6, says Alyssa Farah Griffin, who worked in Trump's White House and later turned on him.\n'He was smart about consolidating power before he lost the election,' she says. 'He was so entrenched in the RNC, he was so entrenched in the party committees and at the state level, that I think for politicians who care first and foremost about self-preservation, it made it pretty much impossible to walk away from him.'\n'It used to be that Republicans fell in line with whoever the party chose,' Hemmer says. 'And now the party is following the base, and falls in line with whoever the base has fallen in love with.'\nIf Sununu wasn't in love before, he has fallen in line now. And ultimately, he doesn't think his opinion matters that much to voters who are sick of Biden and are considering the Republican nominee.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jes\u00fas Rodr\u00edguez","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H3PWEERWCFC35NZBXER4AYIV24.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.554399,"_id":"a7597cd031c74cbfe4439b45042febd1"},{"title":"Only 1 in 3 US adults think Trump acted illegally in New York hush money case, AP-NORC poll shows","author":"Thomas Beaumont","published_date":"2024-04-16 04:03:01","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/16/trump-trial-indictment-hush-money-poll/37b41800-fba6-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The first criminal trial facing former President Donald Trump is also the one in which Americans are least convinced he committed a crime, a new AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll finds","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 The first criminal trial facing former President Donald Trump is also the one in which Americans are least convinced he committed a crime, a new AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll finds.\nOnly about one-third of U.S. adults say Trump did something illegal in the hush money case for which jury selection began Monday, while close to half think he did something illegal in the other three criminal cases pending against him. And they're fairly skeptical that Trump is getting a fair shake from the prosecutors in the case \u2014 or that the judge and jurors can be impartial in cases involving him.\nStill, half of Americans would consider Trump unfit to serve as president if he is convicted of falsifying business documents to cover up hush money payments to a woman who said he had an affair with her.\nAdvertisement\nWhile a New York jury will decide whether to convict Trump of felony charges, public opinion of the trial proceedings could hurt him politically. The poll suggests a conviction could hurt Trump's campaign. Trump enters a rematch with President Joe Biden as the first presumptive nominee of a major party \u2014 and the first former president \u2014 to be under indictment. A verdict is expected in roughly six weeks, well before the Republican National Convention where he will accept the GOP nomination.\nTrump has made the prosecutions against him a centerpiece of his campaign and argued without evidence that Biden engineered the cases. That argument helped him consolidate GOP support during the Republican primary, but a conviction might influence how many Americans \u2014 including independent voters and people long skeptical of Trump \u2014 perceive his candidacy.\n'Any conviction should disqualify him,' said Callum Schlumpf, a 31-year-old engineering student and political independent from Clifton, Texas. 'It sets a bad example to the rest of the world. I think it misrepresents us, as a country, as to what we believe is important and virtuous.'\nAdvertisement\nYet, a cloud of doubt hangs over all the proceedings. Only about 3 in 10 Americans feel that any of the prosecutors who have brought charges against Trump are treating the former president fairly. And only about 2 in 10 Americans are extremely or very confident that the judges and jurors in the cases against him can be fair and impartial.\n'It's very obvious political persecution,' said Christopher Ruff, a 46-year-old political independent and museum curator from Sanford, North Carolina. 'I'm no fan of Trump in any way, shape or form. Didn't vote for him, never will. But it's obviously all political.'\nConsistent with AP-NORC polls conducted over the past year, the new poll found that about half of Americans say Trump did something illegal regarding the classified documents found at his Florida home, and a similar share think he did something illegal regarding his alleged attempt to interfere in Georgia's vote count in the 2020 presidential election. The poll also found that nearly half of Americans believe he did something illegal related to his effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\nAdvertisement\nProsecutors in New York will argue that Trump falsified his company's internal records to hide the true nature of a payment to his former lawyer, Michael Cohen. Cohen alleges he was directed by Trump to pay adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 one month before the 2016 election to silence her claims about an extramarital affair with Trump.\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to the 34-count indictment and denied any affair with Daniels.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe poll found that 35% of Americans say Trump has done something illegal with regard to the hush money allegations. Slightly fewer, about 3 in 10, think he did something unethical without breaking the law. Fourteen percent think he did nothing wrong at all. Those numbers haven't shifted meaningfully in the year since he was first charged in the case.\nRepublicans are much less likely than Democrats and independents to say Trump committed a crime in the hush money case.\nAdvertisement\n'He's done nothing wrong,' said Louie Tsonos, a 43-year-old sales representative and Republican from Carleton, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. 'Because Trump has a lot of money and fame, they want to destroy his reputation. Or at least they are trying to.'\nFewer than one in 10 Republicans say Trump did something illegal in the case, while 4 in 10 Republicans think he did something unethical but did not break the law. About 3 in 10 Republicans, like Tsonos, say he did nothing wrong.\nBy contrast, about 6 in 10 Democrats and roughly 3 in 10 independents believe he did something illegal.\nMonica Brown, a Democrat from Knoxville, Tennessee, thinks Trump did something unethical, though not illegal, in the New York criminal case under way. But a conviction would ruin his credibility to serve as president, she said.\nAdvertisement\n'I don't believe any president \u2013 whether it's Donald Trump or anyone else \u2013 should have a criminal conviction on his record,' said Brown, a 60-year-old veterinary technician and social worker. 'Even if it's related to something like hush money, what respect are they going to get from anyone? Citizens of the country or world leaders, they aren't going to respect you.'\nNearly 6 in 10 Republicans say they would consider Trump fit to be president even if he were to be convicted of falsifying business documents in the hush money case. About 8 in 10 Democrats say Trump would not be fit to serve in the event of a conviction. About half of independents think he would be unfit to serve, with 22% saying he would be fit and 30% saying they didn't know enough to say.\n'I don't think any of that stuff has any relevance to his ability to lead this country,' said Jennifer Solich, a Republican from York, Pennsylvania, and retired nuclear engineer who believes Trump would be fit to serve if convicted in the New York case. 'There may be some unethical aspects to it. I just think it's more trivial than what we're facing as a nation.'\n___\nBeaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Thomas Beaumont,Amelia Thomson-Deveaux","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GLZZSJX3UYI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.5408072,"_id":"ef85587100119a24e17bedaeccfbf8e6"},{"title":"Trump lawyers say Stormy Daniels refused subpoena outside a Brooklyn bar, papers left 'at her feet'","author":"Jake Offenhartz","published_date":"2024-04-17 22:26:10","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/17/stormy-daniels-donald-trump/7d8bb0cc-fd09-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Donald Trump's legal team says it tried serving a subpoena on Stormy Daniels as she arrived for a screening of her documentary at a gay bar in Brooklyn last month, but the porn actor and hush money\u2026","summary":"NEW YORK \u2014 Donald Trump's legal team says it tried serving a subpoena on Stormy Daniels as she arrived for an event at a bar in Brooklyn last month, but the porn actor, who is expected to be a witness at the former president's criminal trial, refused to take it and walked away.\nA process server working for the former president's lawyers said he approached Daniels with papers demanding information and documents related to a documentary recently released about her life and involvement with Trump, but was forced to 'leave them at her feet,' according to a court filing made public Wednesday.\n'I stated she was served as I identified her and explained to her what the documents were,' process server Dominic DellaPorte wrote. 'She did not acknowledge me and kept walking inside the venue, and she had no expression on her face.'\nAdvertisement\nThe encounter outside the 3 Dollar Bill nightclub has touched off a monthlong battle between Trump's lawyers and Daniels' attorney that continued this week as the presumptive Republican nominee's criminal trial began in Manhattan.\nTrump's lawyers are asking Judge Juan M. Merchan to force Daniels to comply with the subpoena. In their filing, they included a photo they said DellaPorte took of Daniels as she strode away.\nDaniels' lawyer Clark Brewster claims they never received the paperwork. He described the requests as an 'unwarranted fishing expedition' with no relevance to Trump's criminal trial.\n'The process \u2014 instituted on the eve of trial \u2014 appears calculated to cause harassment and/or intimidation of a lay witness,' Brewster wrote in an April 9 letter to Merchan. Brewster didn't immediately reply to a message from The Associated Press seeking comment.\nAdvertisement\nThe hush money case is the first of Trump's four criminal cases to go to trial. Seven jurors have been seated so far. Jury selection is set to resume Thursday.\nDaniels is expected to testify about a $130,000 payment she got in 2016 from one of Trump's lawyers at the time, Michael Cohen, in order to stop her from speaking publicly about a sexual encounter she said she had with Trump years earlier.\nCohen was later reimbursed by Trump's company for that payment. Trump is accused of falsifying his company's records to hide the nature of that payment, and other work he did to bury negative stories during the 2016 campaign.\nTrump pleaded not guilty last year to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. He denies having a sexual encounter with Daniels. His lawyers argue the payments to Cohen were legitimate legal expenses, and were recorded correctly.\nAdvertisement\nIn a separate filing made public Wednesday, the Manhattan district attorney's office said that if Trump chooses to testify at the trial, prosecutors plan to challenge his credibility by questioning him about his recent legal setbacks. The filing was made last month under seal.\nTrump was recently ordered to pay a $454 million civil penalty following a trial in which a judge ruled he had lied about his wealth on financial statements. In another trial, a jury said he was liable for $83.3 million for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll after she accused him of sexual assault.\nMerchan said he plans to hold a hearing Friday to decide whether that will be allowed.\nUnder New York law, prosecutors can question witnesses about past legal matters in certain circumstances. Trump's lawyers are opposed. Trump has said he wants to testify, but he is not required to and can always change his mind.\nAdvertisement\nAs for the subpoena dispute, it marks the latest attempt by Trump's lawyers to knock loose potentially damaging information about Daniels, a key prosecution witness.\nThey are demanding an array of documents related to the promotion and editing of the documentary, 'Stormy,' which explores Daniels' career in the adult film industry and rise to celebrity since her alleged involvement with Trump became publicly known.\nThey are also requesting Daniels reveal how much, if anything, she was compensated for the film.\nTrump's lawyers contend the film's premiere last month on NBC's Peacock streaming service \u2014 a week before the trial was originally scheduled to start \u2014 stoked negative publicity about Trump, muddying his ability to get a fair trial.\nIn the filings made public Wednesday, Trump's attorneys accuse Daniels of 'plainly seeking to promote her brand and make money based on her status as a witness.'\nAdvertisement\nThe subpoena also demands communications between Daniels and other likely witnesses in the trial, including Cohen and Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who alleges she had an affair with Trump. It also requests any communications between Daniels and Carroll.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Michael R.

The prosecutor's delivery was calm and measured throughout \u2014 never raising his voice, and keeping his hands in his suit pockets for much of the time he spoke.\nTrump's crimes, the prosecutor said, arose out of his secret election-year deal with the National Enquirer to squelch bad stories about his sex life \u2014 a conspiracy launched in a meeting between Trump, the tabloid's then-CEO David Pecker, and Michael Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer and fixer.\nThat pact ultimately led Cohen to arrange a $130,000 payment to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels to keep her from going public about an alleged sexual encounter she'd had with Trump years earlier, the prosecutor said.\nCohen is expected to testify that Trump purposely misrepresented reimbursements to Cohen to conceal what the money was for.\nAdvertisement\nCohen's testimony will be 'damning' and convincing, Colangelo said.\n'I suspect the defense will go to great lengths to get you to reject his testimony, precisely because it is so damning,' Colangelo said, though he acknowledged that Cohen 'has made mistakes.'\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche countered when it was his turn to address the panel that the prosecutor's case would collapse because it was built on Cohen's lies.\n'Unbeknownst to President Trump, in all the years that Mr. Cohen worked for him, Mr. Cohen was also a criminal,' Blanche said. 'He cheated on his taxes, he lied to banks, he lied about side businesses.'\nBlanche said that when the FBI began investigating Cohen, he tried to 'blame Trump for virtually all of his problems' and continues to do so.\n'Michael Cohen was obsessed with President Trump, he's obsessed with President Trump even to this day,' Blanche said.\nAdvertisement\nCohen weighed in on social media later in the day, using a profanity to refer to Trump and saying 'your attacks of me stink of desperation. We are all hoping that you take the stand in your defense.'\nCohen, an admitted perjurer and felon, is considered central to the prosecution's case, and how jurors view him may ultimately decide whether they convict Trump. Colangelo said the jury will be convinced Cohen is telling the truth about the hush money payments because his statements will be 'backed up by testimony from other witnesses' as well as bank records, emails and text messages.\nTrump will provide some of the evidence that will prove his guilt, Colangelo said, because jurors will hear 'Donald Trump's own words on tape, in social media posts, in his own books and in video of his own speeches.'\nAdvertisement\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records, for categorizing the reimbursement payments to Cohen as legal expenses.\nThe payment from Cohen to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was done 'at Donald Trump's direction and for his benefit, and he did it with the specific goal of influencing the outcome of the election,' said Colangelo.\n'No politician wants bad press. But the evidence at trial will show this was not spin or strategy,' he said. 'This was a planned, coordinated long-running conspiracy to influence the 2016 election, to help Donald Trump get elected through illegal expenditures, to silence people who had something bad to say about his behavior, using doctored corporate records.'\nTrump's lawyer Blanche struck back at that characterization, saying the district attorney is trying to make legal conduct sound like a criminal conspiracy.\nAdvertisement\n'There's nothing illegal about what happened between AMI, Mr. Pecker, Mr. Cohen and President Trump,' Blanche said, referring to American Media Inc., the Enquirer's parent company at the time. 'This sort of thing happens regularly, where newspapers make decisions about what to publish, how to publish. It happens all the time with famous people, wealthy people.

Goldberg, citing 'four people with firsthand knowledge of the discussion that day,' reported that Trump canceled a visit to Aisne-Marne American Cemetery near Paris in 2018 because he did not believe it was important to honor American war dead.\n'In a conversation with senior staff members on the morning of the scheduled visit, Trump said, \u2018Why should I go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers,'' Goldberg wrote. 'In a separate conversation on the same trip, Trump referred to the more than 1,800 Marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood [during World War I] as \u2018suckers' for getting killed.'\nAdvertisement\nTrump, on repeated occasions, vehemently denied this account. During the 2020 campaign, he claimed that 25 people had denied the story on the record \u2014 though at best the White House could produce 14 names of people traveling with the president, and most of those people were not present for the relevant conversations or issued carefully parsed statements. An exception was John R. Bolton, then Trump's national security adviser and later a sharp critic, who said the trip was scrubbed because of weather.\nIn 2023, however, John F. Kelly, Trump's White House chief of staff in 2018 \u2014 who had previously not commented on the controversy \u2014 issued a statement to CNN that Trump 'rants that our most precious heroes who gave their lives in America's defense are \u2018losers' and wouldn't visit their graves in France.'\nAbsent a recording, there's no way to definitively confirm the story. (The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.) But here's a guide for readers to make their own assessment.\nA dispute between on-the-record sources\nJohn F. Kelly: He was Trump's chief of staff and so is a credible source. Note, however, that his statement is carefully worded and does not directly say Trump refused to visit the graves because he thought they were losers. He says Trump thinks war dead are losers and he did not want to go to the cemetery. Both could be true \u2014 but not connected.\nJohn F.

But he said that the Marine pilots who fly the presidential helicopter Marine One announced that the weather was so bad that it would not be safe to use it. Traveling by road to the cemetery 50 miles northeast of Paris was estimated to take 90 to 120 minutes. 'We went round and round' about whether to make the trip, as other world leaders \u2014 such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron \u2014 were traveling by car. But, as Bolton put it, 'they don't carry a nuclear football.' While Trump could have overruled the pilots, he said that would have been unusual.\nBolton noted that Trump the next day did make remarks commemorating the 100th anniversary of the signing of the armistice at another World War I cemetery just outside of Paris, the Suresnes American Cemetery \u2014 an event that had been previously scheduled. 'Here on the revered grounds of Suresnes American Cemetery lie more than 1,500 U.S. service members who made the ultimate sacrifice in the First World War,' Trump said.\nAnonymous sources\nBeside the Atlantic, other news organizations reported that administration officials \u2014 provided anonymity to speak freely \u2014 said that Trump did not want to visit the cemetery.\nAdvertisement\nJennifer Griffin of Fox News: 'Source: \u2018The President was not in a good mood.

But there are numerous examples of Trump suggesting that he thinks soldiers who were wounded or died in combat were losers. As part of his statement to CNN, Kelly referenced these anecdotes: 'A person that thinks those who defend their country in uniform, or are shot down or seriously wounded in combat, or spend years being tortured as POWs are all \u2018suckers' because \u2018there is nothing in it for them.' A person that did not want to be seen in the presence of military amputees because \u2018it doesn't look good for me.''\nAdvertisement\nSen.

It had rained that day, and the ground was soft; at one point Avila's wheelchair threatened to topple over. Milley's wife, Holly\u00adanne, ran to help Avila, as did Vice President Mike Pence. After Avila's performance, Trump walked over to congratulate him, but then said to Milley, within earshot of several witnesses, \u2018Why do you bring people like that here? No one wants to see that, the wounded.' Never let Avila appear in public again, Trump told Milley.'\nAdvertisement\nVeterans: Griffin reported, via an anonymous source, that Trump was puzzled why people went into military service: 'What's in it for them?

The tea party was one manifestation, and Trump's appearance as a presidential candidate in 2015 did attempt to leverage that frustration with establishment Washington.\nMore important, though, was the overlap between that anti-establishment sentiment and the embrace of outright false claims about political subjects. Part of the frustration with Republican leaders was that their actions and rhetoric were increasingly divergent from the rhetoric on Fox News and on fringier upstarts like Breitbart. Trump was both unattached to D.C. respectability and immersed in the fringe-right vernacular, and that's what he presented to Republican primary voters.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nThis was the origin of the idea that Trump speaks frankly while others don't. It wasn't that he was honest; far from it. It was that he said the things that his supporters were hearing from (dishonest) actors elsewhere because he didn't care about being seen as dishonest. His supporters saw this as unusual honesty, when it was in fact the opposite.\nAdvertisement\nTrump's dishonesty has been relentless ever since, often infecting his allies and his party. But he retains a perception of honesty and frankness among his supporters because they dislike and distrust those pointing out his dishonesty \u2014 his opponents, the media, etc. Trump is granted the benefit of the doubt, despite being perhaps uniquely undeserving of it.\nOver the weekend, CBS News published the results of a poll conducted this month by YouGov. It focused on views of the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, but included a telling question related to the point above.\nRespondents were asked to evaluate whether they viewed different sources of information about the war in Ukraine as trustworthy. Overall, only two sources were viewed as more trustworthy than not: the military/Pentagon and journalists and media operating in the war zone. Every other presented option was underwater, with more people saying they viewed them as untrustworthy than as trustworthy.\nAdvertisement\nIn part, that was because of broad skepticism from independents, who are generally more likely to indicate distrust when asked such questions. Only the military was viewed as more trustworthy than not on net among independents.\nBut it was also because, among Republicans, the only broadly trusted source of information about the war was \u2026 Donald Trump.\nPresident Biden was viewed as trustworthy by four times as many Democrats as deemed him not trustworthy. That was a similar ratio to other sources of information: the military, the State Department, the media. Among Republicans, though, only Trump earned that level of confidence. They were 58 points more likely to say they trusted Trump as a source of information than to say they didn't. The next closest source of information was the military, where the gap was only 20 points.\nAdvertisement\nSome of this is performative, a presentation by Republicans that they agree with Trump and don't agree with others on the specific issue of Ukraine. But, certainly, a substantial amount isn't. If the military says that Ukraine is at risk of being overrun by Russia in the absence of more support, and Trump says this is just neoconservative warmongering, a lot of Republicans are going to nod along with Trump.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBy itself, acceptance of this view of Ukraine is a demonstration of the triumph of Trump's politics. In separate questions, CBS News also asked whether the United States had a responsibility to do something about Ukraine or to defend democracy broadly. That latter idea would have been uncontroversial among Republicans 20 years ago. Now, fewer than half of Republicans say the United States has a global responsibility to defend democracy.\nInterestingly, the support among Democrats for defending Ukraine and democracy comes despite Democrats being more likely to say they don't remember the Cold War \u2014 largely because Democrats skew younger than Republicans.\nAdvertisement\nThe Trumpian resurrection of 'America First' leveraged hostility to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to broadly undermine the idea that the United States should retain its traditional alliances. This idea used to sit mostly on the right-wing fringe, too, but both Afghanistan and Americans' general uninterest in foreign policy made it a valuable position for Trump to embrace. That it also empowers the autocrats he seems to want to befriend and emulate is a reward on its own.\nThat initial CBS News poll question shows the extent to which dishonesty has become embedded in the expectations of Trump's party and his base of support. As was the case after the 2020 election, it can create friction in those places where his world intersects with the real world.\nOn Friday, for example, the judge overseeing his case in New York chastised Trump's attorneys.\nAdvertisement\nHe felt compelled, New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan wrote, to express his 'continuing and growing alarm over counsel's practice of making serious allegations and representations that have no apparent basis in fact \u2014 or at least are unsupported by a legitimate basis of knowledge.'\nWell, Trump's attorneys have to translate Trump's dishonest presentations into something palatable for the American legal system. This is hard to do. It is much easier for Trump to simply immerse in his own dishonesty and pull his supporters in with him.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"National Columnist,Philip Bump","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4F4RQBXEKAES3KPQM7L54II6IU_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.505832,"_id":"231f5bb57a23d4d7644d5616084fd462"},{"title":"Trump forced to listen silently to people insulting him as he trades a cocoon of adulation for court","author":"Jill Colvin","published_date":"2024-04-20 04:05:59","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/20/trump-trial-jurors-hush-money-criticism/4ba4d7e6-fecb-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Over the past week, Donald Trump has been forced to sit inside a frigid New York courtroom and listen to a parade of potential jurors in his criminal hush money trial share their unvarnished\u2026","summary":"NEW YORK \u2014 He seems 'selfish and self-serving,' said one woman.\nThe way he carries himself in public 'leaves something to be desired,' said another.\nHis 'negative rhetoric and bias,' said another man, is what is 'most harmful.'\nOver the past week, Donald Trump has been forced to sit inside a frigid New York courtroom and listen to a parade of potential jurors in his criminal hush money trial share their unvarnished assessments of him.\nIt's been a dramatic departure for the former president and presumptive GOP nominee, who is accustomed to spending his days in a cocoon of cheering crowds and constant adulation. Now a criminal defendant, Trump will instead spend the next several weeks subjected to strict rules that strip him of control over everything from what he is permitted to say to the temperature of the room.\nAdvertisement\n'He's the object of derision. It's his nightmare. He can't control the script. He can't control the cinematography. He can't control what's being said about him. And the outcome could go in a direction he really doesn't want,' said Tim O'Brien, a Trump biographer and critic.\nWhile Trump is occasionally confronted by protesters, generally he lives a life sheltered from criticism. After leaving the White House, Trump moved to his Mar-a-Lago waterfront club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he is surrounded by doting paid staff and dues-paying members who have shelled out tens of thousands of dollars to be near him.\nMany days, Trump heads to his nearby golf course, where he is 'swarmed by people wanting to shake his hand, take pictures of him, and tell him how amazing he is,' said Stephanie Grisham, a longtime aide who broke with Trump after the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\nAdvertisement\nWhen he returns to Mar-a-Lago in the afternoon, members lunching on the patio often stand and applaud. He receives the same standing ovation at dinner, which often ends with Trump playing DJ on his iPad, blasting favorites like 'It's a Man's Man's Man's World' by James Brown.\nGrisham, who spent long stretches traveling with Trump and at Mar-a-Lago during his 2016 campaign and as White House press secretary, described staff constantly serving as cheerleaders and telling Trump what he wanted to hear. To avoid angry outbursts, they requested motorcade routes that avoided protests and left a stack of positive press clips every morning on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.\nNow, Trump faces a trial that could result in felony convictions and possible prison time. And he will have to listen to more critics, without being able to punch back verbally \u2014 something he revels in doing.\nAdvertisement\nAmong the expected witnesses in the trial are his former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, and the porn actor who alleged she had sex with him, Stormy Daniels. Both have savaged him in interviews and books as well as on social media.\nTrump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Trump proved during his first week in court that 'he will remain defiant in the face of this unprecedented political lawfare' and said, 'It is clear that his support from the American people will only grow as they watch Joe Biden, Alvin Bragg and the Democrats putting on this bogus show trial six months before the election.'\nNew Yorkers who said they couldn't approach the case fairly were excused during jury selection. But one of the women with the harshest assessments of him will be among those who will determine his fate on 34 counts of falsifying business records.\nAdvertisement\n'I don't like his persona, how he presents himself in public,' said the woman, who has lived in upper Manhattan for the last 15 years. The woman said she didn't agree with some of Trump's politics, which she called 'outrageous.'\n'He just seems very selfish and self-serving, so I don't really appreciate that in any public servant,' she said, adding that while she doesn't 'know him as a person,' how he 'portrays himself in public, it just seems to me it is not my cup of tea.'\nTrump's legal team took issue with her responses, but they were out of challenges by the time she was up for consideration.\nJudge Juan Manuel Merchan has withheld the names of prospective jurors for safety concerns.\nOn Friday, one prospective juror, who said she had attended the 2017 Women's March protesting Trump's inauguration, complained of the influence he has over his base.\nAdvertisement\n'I think his rhetoric at times enables people to feel as if they have permission to discriminate or act on their negative impulses,' she said, citing people she has heard make homophobic or racist comments. Still, she said she didn't have strong feelings about the former president and wasn't sure of his current policy positions.\nAnother man said he'd grown up admiring the former president and business mogul's real estate portfolio and even thinking he might someday live in Trump Tower. But he had come to oppose Trump's 'negative rhetoric and bias against people that he speaks about.'\nAt other times, lawyers read aloud social media posts from prospective jurors mocking Trump and celebrating his defeats.\nOne prospective juror, an older white woman, was struck from the jury pool by the judge after Trump's legal team uncovered years-old social media posts that described Trump as a 'racist, sexist' narcissist.\nAdvertisement\nOne of Trump's attorneys called the posts 'vitriolic.'\n'She harbors a deep hatred for him,' said the lawyer, Susan Necheles. 'She said that 'I wouldn't believe Donald Trump if his tongue were notarized'' and that he was 'anathema' to everything she was taught about love.\nConfronted with the posts inside the courtroom, the juror said she understood why they'd be concerning to the defense, but her views had evolved. 'Election policies can get pretty spicy and Mr. Trump can get pretty spicy,' she said.\nMerchan, the judge, also dismissed a man who in 2017 had shared a Facebook post celebrating the defeat of one of Trump's policies in court. 'Get him out and lock him up!' it read in part.\nCourt rules require Trump to be present throughout the trial. He can't storm out of the courtroom like he did during a recent defamation trial. He is also barred by a gag order from attacking any of the jurors, including on his Truth Social platform.\nAdvertisement\nHe has already been admonished by Merchan for audibly uttering something and gesturing while one juror was answering questions.\n'I will not tolerate any jurors being intimidated in this courtroom,' said Merchan, who previously warned Trump he could be sent to jail for engaging in disruptive behavior in court.\nTrump's assessments in the courthouse weren't all bad, however, with a perhaps surprising number of potential jurors saying they had no strong opinions about one of the best known and most divisive men on the planet.\nIn fact, the process seemed to reveal more supporters than might be expected in a borough where President Joe Biden captured 87% of the vote in 2020.\nOne potential juror Thursday who spoke of Trump in glowing terms said he was 'impressed' with Trump's career as a successful businessman.\nAdvertisement\n'I mean he was our president, pretty amazing. He is a businessman in New York. He has forged his way, you know, he made kind of history in terms of like where he started and where he has become,' said the man, who said he saw his own story similarly.\nOn Tuesday, another man expressed regret that he couldn't juggle the trial with his job.\n'Your Honor, as much as I would love to serve for New York and one of our great presidents, I could not give up my job for six-plus weeks,' he said.\nMany said they had read his book 'The Art of the Deal.'\nEven the woman who criticized his persona and ended up on the jury anyway acknowledged his appeal to voters.\n'Sometimes the way he may carry himself in public leaves something to be desired. At the same time, I can relate to sometimes being a bit unfiltered,' she said. 'I see him speak to a lot of people in America. I think there is something to be said about that.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jill Colvin","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JJJTJ6X6ZMI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.4902024,"_id":"a6b8cc86796e7ad2d46cebf81b39d374"},{"title":"Company defends Trump's $175 million bond in new filing","author":"Michael Kranish","published_date":"2024-04-16 20:35:35","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/16/trump-bond-175-million-court-challenge-hankey","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Trump's $175 million bond is secured by his cash, according to the company backing an arrangment that allows Trump to appeal a massive civil fraud judgment.","summary":"Representatives for the firm that posted a $175 million bond for Donald Trump pushed back against objections raised by New York's attorney general, saying in a court filing late Monday that the deal is 'adequately secured' by the former president's cash.\nThe filing sets the stage for a court hearing next week in Trump's New York civil fraud case, where Justice Arthur Engoron will decide whether the bond has met state requirements \u2014 allowing Trump to appeal a massive civil judgment and preventing state authorities from seizing his properties in the meantime.\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James (D) on April 4 raised concerns about the arrangement, including whether Knight Specialty Insurance Company, whose owner is billionaire Trump supporter Don Hankey, is properly licensed in the state.\nbillionaire Trump supporter Don Hankey, is properly licensed in the state.\nKnight and Trump's representatives said in the new filing that the bond is backed by Trump's Charles Schwab brokerage account, which has just over $175 million in cash. The filing also argues that Knight is properly licensed, including a statement from New York's former superintendent of insurance, Gregory V. Serio, that Knight is qualified to do business in the state.\nAdvertisement\nThe filings, said Alan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, demonstrate that 'Knight is fully authorized to enter into this transaction and the bond is backed 100 percent by cash.'\nSome experts, though, said the filing may not have fully answered all of James's concerns about the bond. Adam Pollock, a former New York assistant attorney general familiar with bond matters, said that while the filing moves the matter 'in the right direction,' it is still 'overly complicated' and is likely to prompt Engoron to examine it thoroughly.\n'It continues to raise serious questions about whether this bond actually secures the attorney general's judgment,' Pollock said. 'Justice Engoron is clearly going to hold a detailed hearing to examine the issue.'\nPollock cited, for example, a document in the filing that referred to an agreement with a separate company that backed a $91 million bond in a defamation case.\nbacked a $91 million bond in a defamation case.\nAdvertisement\nAn individual close to the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality concerns, acknowledged that portion of the filing was mistaken, referring to it as a 'typo.'

He said that he secured a 'modest fee' for backing the bond but declined to disclose details other than to say it was 'a small percentage but a large dollar amount,' stressing that he believed the collateral from Trump made it a good business deal.\nA person familiar with the matter, speaking on the condition of anonymity to disclose a confidential agreement, said that the bond fee was 1 percent and that Trump expected to benefit from being able to earn interest on the $175 million at a rate of about 5 percent, making it worthwhile to use the bond company.\nUnder the terms of the deal, Trump granted Knight a security interest that gives it control of the funds and requires Trump to increase the amount in the account if it falls below $175 million.\nAdvertisement\nA spokesman for the New York attorney general's office declined to comment.\nIn February, Engoron ruled that Trump and his business partners owed more than $450 million in penalties and interest after years of submitting inflated financial information to banks and insurers to get better rates.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jonathan O'Connell,Michael Kranish","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MEHQJS4H72IWSWRDPV2PNFK57A_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.4892,"_id":"8209917e35dc788962c68f8dc3ca4640"},{"title":"What to know about Trump's NY trial lawyers, Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles","author":"Perry Stein","published_date":"2024-04-15 11:00:31","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/15/trump-lawyers-todd-blanche-susan-necheles","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"When Donald Trump appears for his first criminal trial on Monday, he will be flanked by two veteran New York attorneys: Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles.","summary":"When Donald Trump appears for his first criminal trial on Monday, he will be flanked by two veteran New York attorneys: Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles.\nOver the past year, the former president has shed some of the less experienced lawyers who had attached themselves to his politics and elevated his conspiracy theories, with lawyers like Blanche and Necheles taking their place as he fights charges in four criminal cases.\nPeople familiar with their work describe them as reputable lawyers who have the experience to effectively defend Trump in court \u2014 if their famously combative and fickle client allows them to do their jobs.\nBlanche left New York's oldest law firm, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, to start his own firm and represent Trump.

As a federal prosecutor, he worked alongside Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who is now the top prosecutor in the state case against Trump.\nBlanche first caught Trump's attention when he helped Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, avoid state charges of mortgage fraud after Manafort was convicted at trial on similar federal counts. Blanche also represented Trump aide Boris Epshteyn when Epshteyn was questioned in a Justice Department investigation involving the former president.\nAdvertisement\nTrump enlisted Blanche to help him find a lawyer to defend him in the New York criminal case. Blanche contacted former colleagues from the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, a person familiar with the situation told The Washington Post recently.

Another told the court, 'I don't like his persona.'\nAdvertisement\nOverall, the jurors showed a range of knowledge about his court cases, with several saying they didn't follow the news closely.\nTrump is the first former U.S. president to stand criminal trial. He faces 34 counts of falsifying business records in connection with reimbursement of a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election. Prosecutors have accused Trump of classifying the reimbursement as a legal expense, rather than a campaign expense, and of authorizing the payment to Daniels to keep her from publicly accusing him just before the 2016 election of a tryst she alleged happened years earlier.\nIt is one of four criminal indictments against Trump; the other three trials are delayed and may not happen before the election.\nIn addition to picking a jury, lawyers have been sparring in the courtroom this week over whether Trump has repeatedly violated a gag order by making public comments and social media posts related to witnesses and others Merchan has said should be protected.\nAdvertisement\nThat discussion led to an extraordinary exchange late Thursday where Trump's lawyer pledged to keep his client from posting about witnesses and the judge said he did not think that was possible.\nOn the first day of the trial, prosecutors asked for Trump to be held in contempt and fined $1,000 for each of what they said were three violations. Before juror candidates came into the courtroom Thursday, prosecutors alleged that Trump had violated his gag order 'seven more times' in recent days by repeatedly highlighting articles and tweets disparaging the credibility of Michael Cohen, a key government witness who was once Trump's lawyer and fixer, and that of the jurors selected on the second day of the trial.

'I don't believe at this point that I can be fair and unbiased and let the outside influences not affect my decision-making in the courtroom.\"\nMerchan then directed reporters covering the case to refrain from publishing or publicly discussing identifiable details relating to potential jurors. He later clarified that two facts in particular were off limits: where the jury candidates are employed, and where they previously worked.\nProfessional backgrounds had been discussed openly since jury selection began, as candidates read answers to a lengthy biographical questionnaire and also spoke about their jobs through voir dire questioning by the prosecution and defense.\nAdvertisement\nA second panelist, who had been selected as Juror No. 4, also underwent additional questioning Thursday.

Like everyone who was selected, she promised that she could evaluate the case based only on the evidence that will be presented \u2014 putting her feelings on Trump aside.\nThe trial is slated to last six to eight weeks.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Isaac Arnsdorf,Rachel Weiner,Devlin Barrett,Shayna Jacobs","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VD5U6UAHH6AIUSULIZCF653FLU_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.4612994,"_id":"6f66c00186749c9825ad653e04fc42a7"},{"title":"Melania Trump, long absent from campaign, will appear at a Log Cabin Republicans event in Mar-a-Lago","author":"Stephany Matat","published_date":"2024-04-20 04:21:29","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/20/melania-trump-log-cabin-republicans-maralago-fundraiser/75deba3e-fecd-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Former first lady Melania Trump is making a political comeback during the presidential campaign of her husband, former President Donald Trump","summary":"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Former first lady Melania Trump will attend a fundraiser Saturday for the Log Cabin Republicans, an advocacy group for LGBTQ+ members of the GOP, in a rare political appearance after months of being absent from her husband's campaign.\nThe event at the Palm Beach estate she shares with former President Donald Trump will take place behind closed doors.

'This is so much more stressful than I thought it was going to be.' A couple of hours later, a man who had been protesting outside the courthouse all week in opposition to both Trump and President Biden set himself on fire; he was hospitalized in critical condition.\nThrough questions designed to root out bias among the jury pool, both sides have started to signal their trial strategies.\nAssistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass told prospective jurors that the government would prove not just bank fraud but an implicit conspiracy to 'commit election fraud' and 'pull the wool over the eyes of the American voters.' In prosecutors' formulation, Trump skirted campaign finance laws by funneling a $130,000 payment to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels though Michael Cohen, his attorney and fixer, then falsely claiming the money used to repay Cohen was for legal work.\nAdvertisement\nDefense attorney Susan Necheles laid the groundwork for impeaching the testimony of Cohen, a convicted perjurer, by asking potential jurors if they could 'use your common sense' and 'understand that if two witnesses \u2026 say two diametrically opposed things, someone is lying.'\nShe added that jurors should agree that 'if somebody tells a story a number of different ways over time and changes the details, that might be a sign that they are lying.'\nThe first of four criminal prosecutions Trump faces, the New York state case is generally seen as the weakest in part because of the players involved. Cohen admits he has lied to Congress as well as federal tax and election officials. Daniels, who is also known as Stephanie Clifford, previously denied she had an affair with Trump; she has said she felt she had no choice because of the nondisclosure agreement she signed.\nAdvertisement\nAnother prosecutor suggested the government would try to compensate for those potential weaknesses by presenting paperwork in court that would back up their accounts.

He told himself that one day he would live in Trump Tower, the Fifth Avenue landmark Trump built in the early 1980s: 'That was a powerful symbol for me.'\nNow, the man said, he associated Trump with 'harmful' and 'divisive' politics. Worse, he said, he did not think Trump really believed the biased things he said \u2014 'I think he just pushes it to stay in power.'\nThe man was eliminated from the group after it came out that he had referred to Trump on social media as 'the devil.'

It's a social network, like Twitter back when it was Twitter.

And that was enough for a lot of people to jump in when the stock went public, including some people who bet their futures on it.\nWhat's happened since the stock went public at the end of last month is not normal. Consider three other tech stocks, ones that put a bit more effort into the 'tech' part.\nWhen Google and Twitter went public in 2004 and 2013, respectively, prices quickly jumped upward from their initial offer prices and then held fairly stable. Facebook's stock, made public in 2012, stayed flat at the outset and then dropped over the next few weeks.\nNow let's superimpose shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (ticker: DJT).

And then it started steadily shedding value.\nIt was like its own little tech-stock bubble went pop . Trump's share of the stock was worth north of $5 billion at the end of March.

Trump is overextended. His brand is 'fighter for the common man,' but he also needs money. So his brand extends to 'buy this all-American Bible' and 'buy digital pictures of Trump' and 'buy shares in the parent company of this Mastodon instance.'

And on Tuesday, he is scheduled to deliver a speech in Scranton, Pennsylvania, about why the wealthy should pay more in taxes to reduce the federal deficit and help fund programs for the poor and middle class.\nBiden is proud to say that he was largely without money for much of his decades-long career in public service, unlike Trump, who inherited hundreds of millions of dollars from his father and used his billionaire status to launch a TV show and later a presidential campaign.\nAdvertisement\n'For 36 years, I was listed as the poorest man in Congress,' Biden told donors in California in February. 'Not a joke.'\nIn 2015, Trump declared as part of his candidacy, 'I'm really rich.'\nThe Republican former president has argued that voters have no need to see his tax data and that past financial disclosures are more than sufficient. He maintains that keeping taxes low for the wealthy will supercharge investment and lead to more jobs, while tax hikes would crush an economy still recovering from inflation that hit a four-decade peak in 2022.\n'Biden wants to give the IRS even more cash by proposing the largest tax hike on the American people in history when they are already being robbed by his record-high inflation crisis,' said Karoline Leavitt, press secretary for the Trump campaign.\nThe split goes beyond an ideological difference to a very real challenge for whoever triumphs in the November election. At the end of 2025, many of the tax cuts that Trump signed into law in 2017 will expire \u2014 setting up an avalanche of choices about how much people across the income spectrum should pay as the national debt is expected to climb to unprecedented levels.\nAdvertisement\nIncluding interest costs, extending all the tax breaks could add another $3.8 trillion to the national debt through 2033, according to an analysis last year by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\nBiden would like to keep the majority of the tax breaks, based on his pledge that no one earning less than $400,000 will have to pay more. But he released a budget proposal this year with tax increases on the wealthy and corporations that would raise $4.9 trillion in revenues and trim forecasted deficits by $3.2 trillion over 10 years.\nStill, he's telling voters that he's all for letting the Trump-era tax cuts lapse.\n'Does anyone here think the tax code is fair? Raise your hand,' Biden said Tuesday at a speech in Washington's Union Station to a crowd predisposed to dislike Trump's broad tax cuts that helped many in the middle class but disproportionately favored wealthier households.\nAdvertisement\n'It added more to the national debt than any presidential term in history,' Biden continued.

But his campaign is committed to tax cuts while promising that a Trump presidency would reduce a national debt that has risen for decades, including during his Oval Office tenure.\n'When President Trump is back in the White House, he will advocate for more tax cuts for all Americans and reinvigorate America's energy industry to bring down inflation, lower the cost of living, and pay down our debt,' Leavitt said.\nMost economists say Trump's tax cuts could not generate enough growth to pay down the national debt. An analysis released Friday by Oxford Economics found that a 'full-blown Trump' policy with tax cuts, higher tariffs and blocking immigration would slow growth and increase inflation.\nAdvertisement\nAmong Biden's proposals is a 'billionaire minimum income tax' that would apply a minimum rate of 25% on households with a net worth of at least $100 million.\nThe tax would directly target billionaires such as Trump, who refused to release his personal taxes as presidents have traditionally done. But six years of his tax returns were released in 2022 by Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee.\nIn 2018, Trump earned more than $24 million and paid about 4% of that in federal income taxes. The congressional panel also found that the IRS delayed legally mandated audits of Trump during his presidency, with the panel concluding the audit process was ' dormant, at best.'\nBiden has publicly released more than two decades of his tax returns. In 2022, he and his wife, Jill, made $579,514 and paid nearly 24% of that in federal income taxes, more than double the rate paid by Trump.\nAdvertisement\nTrump has maintained that his tax records are complicated because of his use of various tax credits and past business losses, which in some cases have allowed him to avoid taxes. He also previously declined to release his tax returns under the claim that the IRS was auditing him for pre-presidential filings.\nHis finances recently received a boost from the stock market debut of Trump Media, which controls Trump's preferred social media outlet, Truth Social. Share prices initially surged, adding billions of dollars to Trump's net worth, but investors have since soured on the company and shares by Friday were down more than 50% from their peak.\nThe former president is also on the hook for $542 million due to legal judgments in a civil fraud case and penalties owed to the writer E. Jean Carroll because of statements made by Trump that damaged her reputation after she accused him of sexual assault.\nIn the civil fraud case, New York Judge Arthur Engoron looked at the financial records of the Trump Organization and concluded after looking at the inflated assets that 'the frauds found here leap off the page and shock the conscience.'\n__","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Josh Boak,Jill Colvin","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PMNPQ3H23UI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.4494243,"_id":"4be3535a8ff227e0ae530bc02108c0ad"},{"title":"Half of would-be Trump jurors said they can't be impartial.

Half of them were dismissed after raising their hands.\nTrump soon promoted the Fox News commentary of former Justice Department official and Trump administration appointee John Yoo, who called it 'pretty extraordinary' that 'half of the jury pool already says they're so biased against President Trump that they can't serve on the jury.'

The idea is that Trump can't get a fair trial in a locale where just 12 percent of voters supported him in 2020, and this laid that fact bare.\nAdvertisement\nThat is not precisely what the jurors said, though. And while the situation is certainly extraordinary, it wasn't necessarily so for that reason.\nContrary to Yoo's claim and some characterizations, jurors weren't dismissed because they said they were biased against Trump .

The question was broadly about whether they could be fair and impartial in the case, which could logically include being biased in Trump's favor or other factors. Merchan laid out extensive criteria for a fair juror, saying one must also not harbor prejudices toward potential witnesses or prejudge the facts of the case.\nGiven the makeup of Manhattan, it's perhaps fair to assume that a large number of those who raised their hands meant they were biased against Trump, but we can't say that with certainty.\nThe question from there is how surprising and instructive this is.\nAdvertisement\nSome experts on the jury selection process say it's not too surprising. But they also note that it's difficult to say, because it's so unusual to begin a trial this way. While jurors are often asked if they can be fair and impartial, a 'no' answer doesn't generally lead to their immediate dismissal.\n'It's very common to ask potential jurors if they think they could be fair,' said Thomas Frampton, an expert on jury selection at the University of Virginia School of Law. 'Though in an ordinary trial, there would be significant follow-up questioning by the judge or the parties (depending on the jurisdiction) to interrogate whether the juror is truly biased, whether they can put aside their preconceptions, and whether they would ultimately follow instructions.'\nNancy S. Marder, the director of the Chicago-Kent College of Law's Justice John Paul Stevens Jury Center, noted that such a question can provide jurors with an opt-out if they decided they didn't want to serve on the case for other reasons.\nAdvertisement\n'In some cases it could be that some prospective jurors do not want to sit on a six-week jury trial that will be in the public eye,' Marder said. 'One anthropologist who had been called for jury duty in a high-profile case in New York once described what he saw as a \u2018culture of excuses.'

But he said that 'dismissing the jurors for cause without allowing the attorneys to attempt to rehabilitate them should actually speed the selection process,' which involves hundreds of prospective jurors and could take weeks.\nAdvertisement\nWhich brings us to a related point: What does it say about the Manhattan jury pool specifically that half would claim an inability to be fair and impartial?\nIt's perhaps less surprising when you look at a national YouGov poll released Monday. The survey found that 57 percent of Americans said they could be impartial jurors in the case; but the other 43 percent said that they would not be (19 percent) or that they weren't sure (24 percent).\nPassions about Trump also run high across the country. Polling has shown as much as three-quarters of the country has either 'strongly favorable' or 'strongly unfavorable' views about Trump.\nThis is also a case that has already garnered extensive media coverage. As many as half of Americans have already wagered either that Trump broke the law or that he did 'nothing wrong.' Just 19 percent told AP-NORC pollsters last week that they didn't know enough to offer a judgment. If a juror has already come to a conclusion like that, regardless of feelings toward Trump personally, that can also affect their ability to serve impartially.\nAdvertisement\nAnd that gets at the flip side of Trump and his allies' complaints. While this could be read as a sign that the jury pool broadly might have lots of biases, the people who raised their hands claiming bias were also quickly excluded from serving as jurors.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Staff Writer,Aaron Blake","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DKWJNK4S5GFFF4RD3J2YHI4VZA_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.4471188,"_id":"1672622e01b64f693c3a9e34c1eff61d"},{"title":"Voices from the first week of Trump's hush money trial in N.Y.","author":"Mark Berman","published_date":"2024-04-20 10:00:40","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/20/trump-trial-new-york-quotes","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"How attorneys, potential jurors, the judge and the defendant spoke about the Trump trial in New York during its first week.","summary":"The first week of Donald Trump's criminal trial in New York ended Friday with a full panel of 12 jurors and six alternates in place ahead of opening statements expected Monday.\nJury selection saw numerous moments of drama and tumult, including potential jurors growing deeply emotional and the judge chiding Trump. The former president has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records.\nHere is a look at the historic trial's first days, as told by some of its participants.\n'I don't think I can be impartial.' (Unnamed potential juror)\nDuring jury selection, New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan, who is hearing the case, placed significant weight on how the potential jurors felt.\nPotential jurors were asked whether they could not be fair or impartial in deciding the case. If they felt that way, they were promptly excused. In some cases, though, potential jurors spent some time mulling the issue before coming to that conclusion.\nAdvertisement\nThat's what happened with one potential juror, who came in Friday morning and, after sleeping on it, said she did not believe she could be impartial after all. Merchan excused her.\n'I will not have any jurors intimidated in the courtroom.' (New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan)\nIt only took until the trial's second day for Merchan, who is hearing the case, to admonish Trump for his behavior in court.\nTrump's courtroom conduct has run afoul of other judges in some of his recent cases. When the writer E. Jean Carroll sued Trump for defamation, the judge hearing the case threatened to throw him out of court for not keeping quiet while she testified. And during a civil fraud trial against Trump and his business, he clashed with a different judge, who urged his attorneys to 'control your client.'\nAdvertisement\nIn this case, Merchan's admonition came while potential jurors were questioned Tuesday. Trump appeared to react to a potential juror \u2014 and Merchan did not appreciate it.\nMerchan addressed Trump's attorney, Todd Blanche, saying that his client 'was audibly uttering something' and that 'he was gesturing and he was speaking in the direction of the juror' while they were nearby.\n'I will not tolerate that,' Merchan said.\n'We object to having this trial during the campaign season.' (Todd Blanche, Trump attorney)\nAcross Trump's various criminal cases, his attorneys have sought \u2014 successfully, in some cases \u2014 to delay the proceedings whenever possible. They also tried to have this trial postponed, but they were rejected again and again.\nIn court on Monday, Blanche reiterated the defense's objection to the trial taking place now. Blanche's contention: It was unfair to have the trial take place while Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is campaigning ahead of the November election. The trial proceeded after his remark.\nAdvertisement\nLater in the week, Merchan also expressed his irritation with Trump's side for its repeated attempts to seek new rulings on issues that had been decided. 'That has to end,' Merchan told Trump's lawyers Friday. 'There comes a point when you accept my rulings.'\n'I definitely have concerns now.' (Juror No. 2, now former)\nJury selection included some hiccups along the way. Merchan has said potential jurors' names would only be shared with prosecutors and defense attorneys \u2014 and not released publicly.\nBut the jury questionnaire included inquiries about some potentially identifying personal details, such as jobs and past and present employers. Some of the information has circulated in some news reports and online.\nA woman who had been selected as Juror No. 2 on Tuesday came in Thursday morning with concerns after friends, co-workers and relatives reached out, apparently recognizing her connection to the trial.\nAdvertisement\n'I don't believe at this point that I can be fair and unbiased and let the outside influences not affect my decision-making in the courtroom,' she said. She was excused from the jury.\n'I should be allowed to speak.' (Former president Donald Trump)\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday morning, Trump said a gag order that Merchan had placed on him in the case had taken away his 'constitutional rights to speak.'\nMerchan imposed a gag order last month prohibiting the former president from publicly commenting on witnesses in the case 'concerning their potential participation in the investigation or in this criminal proceeding.' He also barred Trump from commenting on potential jurors, court employees and the staff of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Then, after Trump publicly attacked Merchan's daughter, the judge expanded the order to also block him from commenting on Merchan's and Bragg's families.\nProsecutors say Trump has already repeatedly violated this gag order, which his attorneys dispute. Merchan has set a hearing for Tuesday morning to address the matter.\n'We don't expect you to have been living under a rock.' (Joshua Steinglass, prosecutor)\nJury selection in this case was expected to be tricky, given that it involves a defendant who is so prominent and about whom so many people have deeply entrenched opinions.\nAdvertisement\nSteinglass, one of the prosecutors in the case, acknowledged during jury selection that simply knowing about Trump was not disqualifying. Addressing potential jurors, Steinglass said the case had 'nothing to do with your personal politics,' but required jurors who would not let their beliefs influence their decisions.\nSusan Hoffinger, another prosecutor, also reminded potential jurors that the case was 'not about who you're going to vote for in the fall.'\n'This is so much more stressful than I thought it was going to be.' (Unnamed potential juror)\nMuch of the attention on this case has understandably focused on the defendant.\nBut during the trial's first week, courtroom proceedings were largely focused on the potential jurors, who were asked a battery of questions about topics including their jobs, social media habits, sources of news and feelings about Trump.\nMultiple possible jurors said they were feeling increasingly nervous during the jury selection process.\nOne of those people fought back tears Friday, while saying the pressure of the situation was overwhelming. Her voice broke while she spoke in court. Merchan soon excused her.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Mark Berman","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RFHCXOJPP3ZMVE2NJYQGGIIP6Q.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.4435525,"_id":"065ba580d50f2116f750b9103868c117"},{"title":"Bragg case critical as the only successful election deception case","author":"Jennifer Rubin","published_date":"2024-04-15 11:45:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/15/trump-bragg-election-fraud-case-2016","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Steps taken by the former president in the runup to the razor-close 2016 election may have changed the course of history","summary":"We made it.\nThe day has finally arrived for the historic trial in Manhattan of Donald Trump on charges of falsifying business documents. The case concerns Trump's scheme to conceal embarrassing information from voters in the 2016 election. Derided as a 'rump' case, or 'trivial,' it actually may be the most consequential of the four criminal cases facing the former president.\n'This is the case that reflects the efforts Trump went through to influence the 2016 election \u2014 and it worked. He won the election,' says Karen Friedman Agnifilo, who worked for decades in the Manhattan district attorney's office. 'And he only won by a slim margin of fewer than 80,000 votes in three swing states.' Trump sought to buy off two women who said they had sexual encounters with him (Trump denies that) because he not unreasonably feared he would lose if, in the wake of the Access Hollywood tape, these allegations came out:\nAdvertisement\nWhat if, on the heels of the release of the Access Hollywood tape right before the 2016 election, where Trump boasts of grabbing women's genitals without their consent, that he was able suppress from voters the fact that he had extra marital affairs with both an adult film porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy Bunny Karen McDougal, was the key to his victory by this slim margin?\nYou don't have to believe Agnifilo. That's also essentially how Judge Juan M. Merchan will summarize the case to prospective jurors:\nThe allegations are in substance, that Donald Trump falsified business records to conceal an agreement with others to unlawfully influence the 2016 presidential election. Specifically, it is alleged that Donald Trump made or caused false business records to hide the true nature of payments made to Michael Cohen, by characterizing them as payment for legal services rendered pursuant to a retainer agreement. The People allege that in fact, the payments were intended to reimburse Michael Cohen for money he paid to Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, in the weeks before the presidential election to prevent her from publicly revealing details about a past sexual encounter with Donald Trump. Donald Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies the allegations.\n'The money was given to influence the 2016 election,' Fred Wertheimer, founder and president of Democracy 21, told the Guardian. 'In other words, the silence was purchased so [Daniels] would not provide damaging information in the closing weeks of his campaign.'\nFollow this author Jennifer Rubin 's opinions\nFollow this author\nJennifer Rubin\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nIf you doubt the importance of this case, consider an alternate history: Trump never silenced these women, Hillary Clinton won, three right-wing justices did not get appointed, Roe v. Wade remained law, and Trump never had the chance to attempt a coup in the aftermath of the 2020 election. Much depended on the facts set out in the indictment.\nRoe v. Wade remained law, and Trump never had the chance to attempt a coup in the aftermath of the 2020 election. Much depended on the facts set out in the indictment.\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has not changed his theory of the case. What's changed is the slow realization among commentators that the case revolves around allegations that, if proven true in court, will amount to Trump's first \u2014 and only successful attempt \u2014 to use deception and illegal means to gain power.\nAdvertisement\nBragg's theory of the case was set out in the second paragraph in the indictment's statement of facts:\nFrom August 2015 to December 2017, the Defendant orchestrated a scheme with others to influence the 2016 presidential election by identifying and purchasing negative information about him to suppress its publication and benefit the Defendant's electoral prospects. In order to execute the unlawful scheme, the participants violated election laws and made and caused false entries in the business records of various entities in New York. The participants also took steps that mischaracterized, for tax purposes, the true nature of the payments made in furtherance of the scheme.\nBragg's case has always been about this critical sequence of events. But several points are worth stressing.\nTo begin, we can never prove that 'but for' the payoff scheme Trump would have lost. Constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe tells me, 'It's inherent in the nature of things and the limits of human knowledge that one can never demonstrate with certainty how history would have unfolded had one or another pivotal event, including an obviously crucial deception of tens of millions of people who hadn't yet come to expect the worst of Mr. Trump, not occurred.'\nprove that 'but for' the payoff scheme Trump would have lost. Constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe tells me, 'It's inherent in the nature of things and the limits of human knowledge that one can never demonstrate with certainty how history would have unfolded had one or another pivotal event, including an obviously crucial deception of tens of millions of people who hadn't yet come to expect the worst of Mr. Trump, not occurred.'\nBut if any crime in pursuit of office would be deemed the decisive event in 2016 and beyond, Tribe said, 'the felonies charged by Alvin Bragg in the New York prosecution that is about to unfold in real time qualify for that designation.'\nAdvertisement\nSecond, the notion that Bragg's case is less important because it is brought in state court by a local district attorney misconceives how our federal system works. Although federal laws may preempt state laws, the federal government is not more important than state governments. The two systems operate in parallel, each performing their assigned tasks. Is a mass murder case in state court less important than a federal case about punching an OSHA inspector? Certainly not.\nA subsidiary argument for discounting Bragg's case goes like this: If the payoff scheme was such a big deal, prosecutors in the federal Southern District of New York (SDNY) would have brought the case. That's nonsensical as well. A nearly infinite set of considerations goes into a charging decision, including the availability of a relevant statute with provable elements, the quality of witnesses, the prosecutor's adversity to risk and the pendency of other cases. Recall that the SDNY prosecuted former Trump attorney Cohen for participation in the payoff scheme; after that, it may have decided it could not rehabilitate him sufficiently to testify against Trump. (State prosecutors who deal with shady witnesses have no problem with such a situation. Moreover, Bragg has a mound of documents that substantiate Cohen's testimony.) If anything, this reminds us that it would be patently unjust to prosecute Cohen but not the man who directed and benefited from muzzling these women.\nFinally, the tabloid phrase 'hush money' is particularly inapt in describing the case. Paying hush money isn't illegal; falsifying business records is. Here, the alleged sex really is incidental. As Tribe tweeted, 'Saying Trump is on trial for paying hush money to a porn star is like saying John Wilkes Booth was tried for sneaking up behind Lincoln in Ford's Theatre.'\nAdvertisement","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jennifer Rubin","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OETC43K3TTOPPQO5OEC345U6PA_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.442304,"_id":"8bb67659b1db221617af3258054bb09a"},{"title":"Trump's history-making hush money trial starts Monday with jury selection","author":"Jennifer Peltz","published_date":"2024-04-15 04:05:08","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/15/trump-hush-money-trial-jury-selection/591e5b64-fadd-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The hush money trial of former President Donald Trump begins Monday with jury selection","summary":"NEW YORK \u2014 In a singular moment for American history, the hush money trial of former President Donald Trump begins Monday with jury selection.\nIt's the first criminal trial of a former commander in chief and the first of Trump's four indictments to go to trial. Because Trump is the presumptive nominee for this year's Republican ticket, the trial will also produce the head-spinning split-screen of a presidential candidate spending his days in court and, he has said, 'campaigning during the night.'\nAnd to some extent, it is a trial of the justice system itself as it grapples with a defendant who has used his enormous prominence to assail the judge, his daughter, the district attorney, some witnesses and the allegations \u2014 all while blasting the legitimacy of a legal structure that he insists has been appropriated by his political opponents.\nAdvertisement\nAgainst that backdrop, scores of ordinary citizens are due to be called Monday into a cavernous room in a utilitarian courthouse to determine whether they can serve, fairly and impartially, on the jury.\n'The ultimate issue is whether the prospective jurors can assure us that they will set aside any personal feelings or biases and render a decision that is based on the evidence and the law,' Judge Juan M. Merchan wrote in an April 8 filing.\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records as part of an alleged effort to keep salacious \u2014 and, he says, bogus \u2014 stories about his sex life from emerging during his 2016 campaign.\nThe charges center on $130,000 in payments that Trump's company made to his then-lawyer, Michael Cohen. He paid that sum on Trump's behalf to keep porn actor Stormy Daniels from going public, a month before the election, with her claims of a sexual encounter with the married mogul a decade earlier.\nAdvertisement\nProsecutors say the payments to Cohen were falsely logged as legal fees in order to cloak their actual purpose. Trump's lawyers say the disbursements indeed were legal expenses, not a cover-up.\nTrump himself casts the case, and his other indictments elsewhere, as a broad 'weaponization of law enforcement' by Democratic prosecutors and officials. He maintains they are orchestrating sham charges in hopes of impeding his presidential run.\nAfter decades of fielding and initiating lawsuits, the businessman-turned-politician now faces a trial that could result in up to four years in prison if he's convicted, though a no-jail sentence also would be possible.\nRegardless of the eventual outcome, the trial of an ex-president and current candidate is a moment of extraordinary gravity for the American political system, as well as for Trump himself. Such a scenario would have once seemed unthinkable to many Americans, even for a president whose tenure left a trail of shattered norms, including twice being impeached and acquitted by the Senate.\nAdvertisement\nThe scene inside the courtroom may be greeted with a spectacle outside. When Trump was arraigned last year, police broke up small skirmishes between his supporters and protesters near the courthouse in a tiny park, where a local Republican group has planned a pro-Trump rally Monday.\nTrump's attorneys lost a bid to get the hush money case dismissed and have since repeatedly sought to delay it, prompting a flurry of last-minute appeals court hearings last week.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAmong other things, Trump's lawyers maintain that the jury pool in overwhelmingly Democratic Manhattan has been tainted by negative publicity about Trump and that the case should be moved elsewhere.\nAn appeals judge turned down an emergency request to delay the trial while the change-of-venue request goes to a group of appellate judges, who are set to consider it in the coming weeks.\nAdvertisement\nManhattan prosecutors have countered that a lot of the publicity stems from Trump's own comments and that questioning will tease out whether prospective jurors can put aside any preconceptions they may have. There's no reason, prosecutors said, to think that 12 fair and impartial people can't be found amid Manhattan's roughly 1.4 million adult residents.\nThe process of choosing those 12, plus six alternates, will begin with scores of people filing into Merchan's courtroom. They will be known only by number, as he has ordered their names to be kept secret from everyone except prosecutors, Trump and their legal teams.\nAfter hearing some basics about the case and jury service, the prospective jurors will be asked to raise hands if they believe they cannot serve or be fair and impartial. Those who do so will be excused, according to Merchan's filing last week.\nAdvertisement\nThe rest will be eligible for questioning. The 42 preapproved, sometimes multi-pronged queries include background basics but also reflect the uniqueness of the case.\n'Do you have any strong opinions or firmly held beliefs about former President Donald Trump, or the fact that he is a current candidate for president, that would interfere with your ability to be a fair and impartial juror?' asks one question.\nOthers ask about attendance at Trump or anti-Trump rallies, opinions on how he's being treated in the case, news sources and more \u2014 including any 'political, moral, intellectual, or religious beliefs or opinions' that might 'slant' a prospective juror's approach to the case.\nBased on the answers, the attorneys can ask a judge to eliminate people 'for cause' if they meet certain criteria for being unable to serve or be unbiased. The lawyers also can use 'peremptory challenges' to nix 10 potential jurors and two prospective alternates without giving a reason.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Michael R.

The jury will ultimately be asked not whether Trump is guilty of a crime in the abstract but, instead, whether the state provided enough evidence to eliminate any doubt that he violated the letter of the law. This means that the letter of the specific law undergirding the charges in the indictment against Trump is crucially important.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nIn that indictment, Trump is charged with 34 felonies, each predicated on his having allegedly falsified business records. Specifically, prosecutors argue, he caused the Trump Organization and his personal trust to record payments made to attorney Michael Cohen in 2017 as retainer fees rather than as reimbursements for the $130,000 Cohen paid to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election.\nFalsifying business records is not always a felony. But if the 'intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof,' the New York criminal statute reads, it can be charged as one. As it was in each of the charges against Trump.\nAdvertisement\nSo what is the 'another crime?' It isn't articulated in the criminal indictment. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was somewhat vague when the indictment was handed down, saying that the intent was 'to conceal crimes that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election.'\nOffering his opening statement Monday, prosecutor Matthew Colangelo made clear that the crime was centered on Cohen's payment to Daniels.\n'This was a planned, coordinated, long-running conspiracy to influence the 2016 election,' Colangelo said, 'to help Donald Trump get elected through illegal expenditures, to silence people who had something bad to say about his behavior, using doctored corporate records. It was election fraud, pure and simple.'\nTrump's attorney, Todd Blanche, rejected that idea.\nAdvertisement\n'There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election; it's called democracy,' he said during his opening statement. 'They put something sinister on this idea as if it was a crime. You'll learn it's not.'\nExcept that it can be. And in this case, almost certainly is.\nAt issue is another fairly esoteric body of law: campaign finance limits. These laws limit how much money people can contribute to political campaigns and how campaigns have to report what they take in and how they spend it. Outside parties can spend money on promoting candidates, too; those are called independent expenditures. But they can't coordinate with the campaigns or candidates on how they plan to do so.\nThe goal of those laws \u2014 an important aspect of the issue at hand \u2014 is centrally to limit the corruption that could follow from a big donor bankrolling a candidate's entire campaign. If, say, Google could simply put up a candidate and spend $1 billion getting her elected to the Senate, it would be hard for anyone to compete \u2014 and Google would have a presumably loyal senator sitting in D.C.\nAdvertisement\nSo with those prohibitions in mind, consider what Cohen did \u2014 as he admitted when pleading guilty to federal campaign finance charges.\nCohen and a representative of Trump's campaign (later revealed to be Trump) met with David Pecker \u2014 then chairman of American Media Inc. and publisher of the National Enquirer \u2014 in August 2015. Pecker offered to help the campaign by buying stories that would reflect negatively on Trump and then burying them. AMI and Pecker confirmed this story in a non-prosecution agreement reached with the government.\nAlready, you can see that this is an offer to benefit the campaign that involved coordination with agents of the campaign; that is, with people empowered to act on the campaign's behalf. That's Trump himself, of course, but also Cohen, who would represent the campaign publicly and discussed campaign strategy with Trump.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Pecker later bought a similar story from former Playboy model Karen McDougal for $150,000 intending to bury it, it 1) was an action taken to benefit the campaign, as per the August 2015 meeting and 2) was not an independent expenditure, since the McDougal payment was made in consultation with Cohen. Cohen pleaded guilty to 'causing an unlawful corporate contribution' \u2014 since corporations like AMI can't legally contribute to campaigns, and the $150,000 was a non-monetary contribution to Trump. AMI and Pecker offered testimony, resulting in that non-prosecution agreement.\nIn October 2016, a month before the election, Pecker informed Cohen about Daniels's story. Cohen reached a deal with Daniels's attorney \u2014 also McDougal's attorney \u2014 for $130,000, but didn't pay immediately. Only when Cohen learned that Daniels was thinking of going public elsewhere in the days before the election did Cohen finally pay the money.\nCohen pleaded guilty to federal campaign-finance charges related to this as well. That plea didn't depend on arguing that Cohen was an agent of the campaign, though; instead, it argued that Cohen made the contribution 'in cooperation, consultation, and concert with, and at the request and suggestion of one or more members of the campaign.' A later filing identified that member of the campaign: Trump.\nSome on the right have argued that the payment to Daniels didn't violate campaign-finance law. Earlier this month, Trump shared on social media a 2023 article written by the National Review's Andrew McCarthy, making that case.\nAdvertisement\nThe timing, McCarthy argued, 'was just common-sense hardball' on the part of Daniels and McDougal, 'striking when their leverage against the notoriously parsimonious Trump was at its height; it didn't mean that [nondisclosure agreements] \u2014 which Trump had plenty of other personal, political, and business incentives to pay for \u2014 were necessarily in-kind campaign expenses.'\nPerhaps this could be an argument made against such charges, albeit a dubious one. After all, Cohen recorded a September 2016 conversation with Trump in which they discussed the McDougal case and, in another context, the need to bury negative information until after Election Day. The idea that Trump and Cohen didn't view the Daniels payment as related to the campaign is ridiculous \u2014 especially since it first came to their attention immediately after The Washington Post published the 'Access Hollywood' tape, drawing new scrutiny to Trump's interactions with women.\nBut Trump's defense team isn't trying to make McCarthy's argument anyway.\nAdvertisement\n'There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,' Blanche told jurors Monday. 'It's called democracy.'\nSo if Trump was admittedly trying to influence the election by agreeing with Cohen to pay off Daniels, then Cohen \u2014 as he admitted in federal court \u2014 violated campaign-finance laws. And therefore, if the repayments to Cohen were falsified to obscure their intent \u2014 remember, the Cohen-Daniels story didn't become public until 2018, after the reimbursements had been made \u2014 it seems as though that was done to 'conceal the commission' of those campaign-finance violations.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Philip Bump,National Columnist","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YHHELZFKMQI6TBZTJDEHENPTSY.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.441796,"_id":"443d3b98102fb281f9558620de40bc73"},{"title":"Former Trump staffer who said to 'fan the flame' after 2020 loss hired to lead Wisconsin GOP","author":"Scott Bauer","published_date":"2024-04-15 17:07:08","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/15/wisconsin-republican-donald-trump-2020-election/9748ec7a-fb4a-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The director of Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign in Wisconsin who pushed allegations of widespread fraud that were ultimately debunked has been hired to run the Republican Party of Wisconsin heading into the November election","summary":"MADISON, Wis. \u2014 The director of Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign in Wisconsin, who pushed allegations of widespread fraud that were ultimately debunked, has been hired to run the Republican Party of Wisconsin heading into the November election.\nAndrew Iverson will serve as executive director of the Wisconsin GOP as it prepares to host the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July, the state party announced Friday. He takes over for Mark Jefferson, who left in February to serve as executive director of the Tavern League of Wisconsin.\nIverson, a graduate of Wisconsin Lutheran College, most recently worked as regional political director for the Republican National Committee. He previously worked on campaigns in Wisconsin for U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil. In 2020, Iverson was the state director for Trump Victory, a joint operation of the Trump campaign and the RNC.\nAdvertisement\nIt was in that role following Trump's narrow loss in Wisconsin in 2020 that Iverson told other operatives two days after the election to support claims that Trump had actually won. His comments came as Trump's campaign was suing in other battleground states and preparing to request a recount of the two largest Democratic counties in Wisconsin.\nBiden defeated Trump by nearly 21,000 votes in Wisconsin in 2020, a result that has withstood independent and partisan audits and reviews, as well as lawsuits and the recounts Trump requested.\n'Here's the drill: Comms is going to continue to fan the flame and get the word out about Democrats trying to steal this election. We'll do whatever they need (inaudible) help with. Just be on standby in case there's any stunts we need to pull,' Iverson said in the recording of a meeting two days after the November election that was obtained by The Associated Press.\nAdvertisement\nWisconsin was a big part of Trump's victory in 2016, when he smashed through the Democrats' 'Blue Wall' in the Upper Midwest, and his campaign fought hard to keep the swing state in his column four years later before his loss to Biden. Wisconsin is one of a few battleground states this year that could go either way in the rematch between Trump and President Joe Biden.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'At the end of the day, this operation received more votes than any other Republican in Wisconsin history,' Iverson said in the 2020 recording. 'Say what you want, our operation turned out Republican or DJT supporters. Democrats just got 20,000 more than us, out of Dane County and other shenanigans in Milwaukee, Green Bay and Dane. There's a lot that people can learn from this campaign.'\nIverson's comments came after Trump sued in other states and before be brought a case in Wisconsin seeking to overturn his loss. The Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected that case in December 2020.\nAdvertisement\nWisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming said in a statement that he was 'thrilled' with the hiring of Iverson.\n'His wide breadth of experience and ability will prove crucial for us winning in November,' Schimming said in a statement. 'Wisconsin will decide the 2024 race. Andrew Iverson is the right man for the job in this pivotal election.'\nIn addition to the presidential race, Wisconsin has a high-profile U.S. Senate race pitting Democratic incumbent Sen. Tammy Baldwin against Republican businessman Eric Hovde.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Scott Bauer","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.4233985,"_id":"845f0f87027c903031eb5962e988cbcd"},{"title":"Sleepy Don","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-18 10:00:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/can-he-do-that/sleepy-don","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"In our second episode, the crew discusses the jurors selected during the first two days of former president Donald Trump's Manhattan criminal trial \u2013 and why plenty of other prospective jurors were dismissed.\nWashington Post reporter Devlin Barrett joins to discuss what it's like covering the trial from inside the courthouse.","summary":"At the start of Trump's Manhattan criminal trial, the court needs 12 jurors and six alternates \u2013 but many times that number have been dismissed, for a whole variety of reasons, some mundane and others surprising.

The warning came a few minutes later.\nDePaola, the 64-year-old namesake of DePaola's Bagel and Brunch here in Maryland's conservative Eastern Shore, whispered to a reporter that Hogan better avoid disparaging former President Donald Trump.\n'I'm a Trumper,' DePaola said as Hogan posed for pictures and made small talk with the excited breakfast crowd on a recent Friday morning. 'I think Larry would be better off if he kept how he felt about Trump under his breath.'\nThe brief exchange during a weeks-long bus tour illustrates a stark political reality for the popular Republican former governor, who has single-handedly transformed Maryland's sleepy Senate race into a top-tier contest in the national fight for the Senate majority. Hogan, who was perhaps the most outspoken anti-Trump Republican governor in the nation, can ill afford to lose any pieces of his delicate and diverse political coalition.\nAdvertisement\nHe's hoping to become the first Republican in more than 40 years to win a Senate seat in this deep-blue state, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1 statewide, with much of the Democratic support in Baltimore and the suburbs of Washington. Over the next six months, Hogan will have to fend off political threats from all sides.\nAs Trump loyalists eye the 67-year-old businessman with skepticism, Democrats are counting on abortion rights to make Hogan's historic challenge even harder. But the R after his name may ultimately prove the most serious liability for Hogan in a state Trump lost by 33 points four years ago.\nIf Hogan wins Maryland's open Senate seat, Republicans would almost certainly claim the majority in the U.S. Senate \u2014 and with it, the power to control the agenda and judicial nominations for the next two years, at least.\nAdvertisement\nIn an interview, Hogan confirmed that he would caucus with Republicans in Washington, despite his concerns about Trump's grip on the party. He also vowed not to leave the GOP after the election, even if Trump returns to the White House.\n'I'm a real Republican,' Hogan told The Associated Press, noting that he does not identify with Trump's 'Make America Great Again' movement.\nWhen pressed to explain his concerns about MAGA, and whether he views Trump as a threat to U.S. democracy, Hogan parsed his words carefully.\n'I think certainly there has been some threats,' Hogan said. 'But you know, I think that's not what this campaign is really all about.'\nMeanwhile, Hogan's opponents on the left are only just beginning to organize as Democrats wade through their own nomination process. While Hogan faces token opposition in the GOP, Democrats will pick Hogan's general election opponent next month.\nAdvertisement\nOn Tuesday, a coalition of labor, immigration and progressive groups gathered in the state capital to criticize the former governor for using his veto powers to block legislation to increase abortion access while undermining other Democratic priorities, including health care, environmental protection and education funding.\nThe anti-Hogan event was a reminder that voters in his gubernatorial elections may have been more willing to overlook party affiliation than they will be in a Senate contest that could tilt the balance of power in Washington toward Republicans.\n'Despite him claiming to be a moderate, we know his actions show that he's a staunch Republican,' said 1199 SEIU political director Ricarra Jones, who slammed Hogan's veto of legislation to increase the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour.\nAdvertisement\n'The Senate race in November is bigger than just Maryland,' she continued. 'A Republican-dominated Senate would pursue a drastically different agenda, one that could unwind years of progressive achievements and reshape Maryland's policy landscape in ways that could take generations to reverse.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nMeanwhile, Hogan is trying to avoid divisive political disputes as he reintroduces himself to Maryland voters during a low-profile 'Back to Work' bus tour across the state.\nPerhaps the nation's most vocal anti-Trump Republican governor while in office, Hogan barely mentions Trump's name unless asked about him. He's just as eager to ignore abortion, even though Maryland is among the states that will vote on an abortion referendum this fall \u2014 a winning issue for Democrats in red and blue states alike where ballot questions have appeared since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022.\nAdvertisement\nDemocrats suggest he would support a federal abortion ban, but Hogan insisted in an interview that he would not.\nHe also said he strongly supports in-vitro fertilization and would introduce legislation to protect the practice, an apparent attempt to clarify his position after he declined to say in an Axios interview last month whether he would support such federal protections.\nHe also said he 'would consider voting for' a Maryland ballot measure this fall that would preserve abortion rights, although he argues that it's unnecessary.\nHogan said abortion doesn't comes up much on the campaign trail. He predicted it wouldn't be 'a deciding issue' in the election.\nAsked about the issues that matter most to him, Hogan said he's most focused on ending the divisiveness in Washington, followed by the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, crime and the economy.\nAdvertisement\nBut Hogan largely avoided talking politics at all on his weekend bus tour, preferring to connect with voters on a personal level. He was eager to jump behind restaurant counters to chat with the kitchen staff or pose for pictures welcoming small business owners. And voters, regardless of their party affiliation, embraced him enthusiastically at nearly every stop.\nLanda Mitchell, a 46-year-old old African American woman from Hanover, Maryland, flagged down the governor as he toured small business booths at a weekend boat show. She had met him years ago at a fundraiser for the homeless.\nMitchell said she's not a Republican, but she'd likely vote for Hogan.\n'He's not far right wing. He's over there, but he's not far far over there,' Mitchell said with a laugh, adding that she's not sure whether she'll support President Joe Biden this fall because of the state of the economy. 'I'm far from a Trump supporter, but I go into the grocery store today and I cry.'\nAdvertisement\nCaroline County Sheriff Donald Baker, who welcomed Hogan on a tour through his office, said he also appreciates the former governor's strong support for law enforcement, noting that the sheriff's office didn't get a single applicant for a recent job posting.\n'It's gonna be a tough road for him to navigate,' Baker said of Hogan's political challenge. 'If anybody can do it, I believe Larry Hogan can do it. Why? Because he is a middle-of-the-road kind of guy. He knows how to work with people.'\nAnd as Democrats fight to link him to Trump's Republican Party, Hogan will take pains to distance himself from Trump \u2014 but not too far.\n'We don't want to alienate Trump voters,' Hogan told the AP. 'We need Trump voters. And we need a lot of Biden voters. Maryland is tough.'\nBut he doesn't expect Trump or any other MAGA celebrities to campaign in Maryland on his behalf in the coming months. He said he's not sure if he'll even attend this summer's Republican National Convention, where Trump will formally become the GOP presidential nominee; Hogan skipped Trump's last two nominating conventions as well.\n'I don't think Trump would help me at all. I ran 46 points ahead of him,' Hogan said, noting that Trump lost Maryland in 2020 by a bigger margin than any other state in the nation. 'I don't think he needs to campaign in Maryland.'\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brian Witte,Steve Peoples","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XOXDTUH4OEI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.3883643,"_id":"de1c62eb78be15b75d6ab364c61b7173"},{"title":"Partisans are more likely to view O.J.

In each case, partisans were significantly more likely to view the other party's candidate unfavorably than they were to view O.J. Simpson \u2014 a man accused (and acquitted) of nearly decapitating his ex-wife, among other things \u2014 very unfavorably.\nBesides the Simpson component, this two-unpopular-candidates scenario is no longer novel. It was similarly the case in 2016 and, like then, it means that some portion of each candidate's support includes people who incongruously view their preferred candidate unfavorably.\nCurious about the extent of that incongruity, I reached out to YouGov for their polling in the past three presidential contests, each of which has featured Trump. In April 2020, the then-sitting Republican president was viewed quite positively by his own supporters, in part because he was seeing an approval boost from his initial response to the coronavirus pandemic. (That's obvious from the 'very favorable' percentage he enjoyed from his supporters at that point, too.) Other than that, at least 1 in 10 supporters of each major-party candidate has said in April that they viewed their own candidate unfavorably.\nThe extent to which Trump and Biden are viewed unfavorably by their own supporters in 2024 is more modest than was the case for Trump and Hillary Clinton in April 2016. Then, nearly a fifth of each candidate's support viewed them unfavorably. Relatedly, supporters of Trump and Biden are now also a bit more likely to view the other party's presumptive nominee very unfavorably \u2014 in part because the major-party candidates have established track records as president.\nThis prompts an obvious question, though: Why would you vote for a candidate you view unfavorably? The answer, in many cases, is simply that the voter dislikes the other candidate more . YouGov's most recent data shows that a third of those who say they plan to vote for Trump are doing so mostly as a vote against Biden's candidacy. A majority of Biden's supporters say their vote is meant to block Trump.\nmore.

In his case, he added, 'there's no crime. You know where the crime is? In the bodegas, where they come and rob them every week.' As is his recent habit, he included a separate excoriation of recently arrived immigrants, who, he insisted, were taking all the jobs and who were 'prisoners and people from mental institutions, largely.'\nAdvertisement\nViewed through a sympathetic lens, you see what Trump is arguing: They're coming after me when there's real crime out there? Step back one degree from that sympathetic view, though, and you come to a more useful position: Rather than being assessed on a sliding scale, crimes should generally be subject to accountability.\nFor years, Trump has offered his base a bifurcated view of law enforcement. Local police are lionized, both as a statement of allegiance and as the thin blue line keeping America safe from salivating hordes of leftist rioters, urban criminals and immigrant savages. Federal law enforcement, though, is suspect and corrupt, a position intertwined with long-standing investigations into Trump at the federal level. With his indictments at the local level in Georgia and Manhattan, Trump simply tied the local district attorneys back to his federal political opponents. ('By the way, this trial that I have now?' he said at the bodega. 'That's a Biden trial.')\nAt the moment, though, this divergent view of crime \u2014 Trump and his allies are innocent political targets while liberal prosecutors let other criminals slide \u2014 is more distant from reality than usual.\nAdvertisement\nCrime, by most available metrics, is down in recent years. That includes homicides, which, as the Wall Street Journal reported this week, have dropped sharply in several cities. In New York City, violent crime is down 3 percent year-to-date. Grand larceny is similarly down 3 percent, though the number of robberies is up 4 percent.\nBut it is an election year, so, as was the case in 2020 and 2022, warnings from Trump and his allies about criminal activity are omnipresent and breathless.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'The next six months is going to be intense,' Kari Lake, a Republican candidate for Senate in Arizona, said at a rally over the weekend, as the New York Times reported.

And maybe strap on a Glock on the side of us just in case.'\nThe New York Post \u2014 a perpetual engine of fearmongering about crime \u2014 reported that 'Californians are buying up guns after Border Patrol starts dumping thousands of migrants on streets.' In March, there were about 131,000 background checks conducted in California, a process that generally precedes a gun sale. Last March there were 128,000; the March before that, 129,000. In March 2021, there were 144,000.\nAdvertisement\nNone of this is to say that violent crimes don't occur; they do. It is, instead, to point out that heightened rhetoric about the dangers of crime doesn't comport with the reality of trends in crime data.\nThis rhetoric sits alongside a willingness to give Trump and his allies a pass. Polling from the Associated Press, conducted by NORC this month, shows that only a small fraction of Republicans think Trump did anything illegal concerning the four indictments he faces. Only 6 percent of Republicans think he did anything illegal in the New York case.\nThis idea that Trump is being unfairly targeted for scrutiny and sanction \u2014 an idea Trump has relentlessly promoted for obvious reasons \u2014 extends to his allies. On Tuesday night, Newsmax host Greg Kelly (son of the former commissioner of the New York Police Department) encouraged viewers to write to former Trump adviser Peter Navarro, imprisoned in Florida.\nLet's all WRITE Peter Navarro.

The reality is that Navarro ignored a congressional subpoena and was found guilty of contempt of Congress.\nAdvertisement\nBut Navarro was just stonewalling the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, hardly something a Trump supporter is going to be overly worried about. Likewise the actions of Trump: Oh, he tried to block Joe Biden's presidency? Why not focus on the real criminals?\nreal criminals?\nIt's all about how the criminal actions are perceived. Trump keeping classified documents gets a shrug, but the specter of tattooed immigrants lying in wait in the dingy streets of New York is indelible. That the former happened and the latter is wildly overheated is neither here nor there. They are the bad guys, not us. They deserve to be cracked down on, to be constrained or punished. Not us. They are the ones we should be worried about.\nThey are the bad guys, not us. They deserve to be cracked down on, to be constrained or punished. Not us.

Biden endorsed the package and last month said he would sign an earlier version of the TikTok legislation that the House passed.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2020, Trump issued an executive order to ban TikTok if its parent company did not sell it within 45 days. The order was later blocked in court.\n'As far as TikTok is concerned, we're banning them from the United States,' Trump said in July 2020.\nBut Trump's public stance on the social media app swung in the other direction in recent months, with the former president arguing in March that a TikTok ban would only empower Facebook, which he has called 'an enemy of the people.' Trump's post on Monday appeared to be the first time he explicitly referenced Biden while railing against proposals to force a TikTok sale.\nAsked for comment on Trump's post, Biden's reelection campaign referred to the White House, which denied it was working to shut down TikTok.\n'We've been clear: we do not want to ban apps like TikTok,' White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said in a statement. 'What we want \u2014 and what the legislation we support would do \u2014 is ensure that TikTok becomes owned by an American company so that our and our children's sensitive personal data stays here instead of going to China and so that Americans' understandings and views can't be manipulated by algorithms potentially controlled by the [People's Republic of China].'\nAdvertisement\nTrump accused Biden of wanting to shut down TikTok to 'help his friends over at Facebook' become more powerful and 'be able to continue to fight, perhaps illegally, the Republican Party.' Under the bill passed on a 360-58 vote by the House Saturday, TikTok's owner would have up to 360 days to divest, meaning any ban is not likely to happen until after Election Day.\nThe chamber in March passed an earlier version of the bill trying to force a TikTok sale on a shorter timeline, but it has languished in the Senate. The latest proposal's attachment to the foreign aid package could boost its chances in the upper chamber.\nTrump's reversal on TikTok raised questions about his relationship with Jeff Yass, a Republican megadonor from Pennsylvania who is also a TikTok investor. Trump, who is working to cultivate more heavyweight GOP donors as Biden builds a large fundraising advantage, met earlier this year with Yass but said afterward that they did not discuss TikTok.\nAdvertisement\nA former top aide in Trump's White House, Kellyanne Conway, is advocating for TikTok in Congress and has spoken to Trump about the importance of defending the application, The Washington Post reported last month. Conway is being paid by the Club for Growth, the conservative group that counts Yass as one of its biggest donors.\nTrump has called TikTok a national security threat but also touted its popularity, saying in a March interview with CNBC that there is 'a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok.'\n'As you know, I was at a point where I could have gotten it done if I wanted to,' Trump said, suggesting he ultimately wanted to leave the matter to Congress. 'I sort of said, \u2018You guys decide, you make that decision,' because it's a tough decision to make. Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Patrick Svitek","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4C5JJT7HLI2E5DL5MSNO5CGQUI_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.3488917,"_id":"e1e587ec6ac0052af84253b0b3f420c0"},{"title":"Election 2024 latest news Biden to mark Earth Day with Va. event while Trump is on trial in N.Y.","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-22 11:05:41","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/22/election-2024-campaign-updates","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Live updates from the 2024 campaign trail with the latest news on presidential candidates, polls, primaries and more.","summary":"Election 2024\nGet the latest news on the 2024 election from our reporters on the campaign trail and in Washington.\nWho is running?

It's a sharp comedown since nearing $80 after the owner of Truth Socialmerged with a shell company to get its stock trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol 'DJT,' for Trump's initials.\nPart of the decline may be due to criticism that the stock price had zoomed way past what skeptics said the money-losing company is worth, particularly one with tough odds for success. But another part is also likely because of action Trump Media took Monday.\nThe company filed documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that open the door for the future potential sale of millions of shares. The document, called an S-1, relates to warrants held by investors that can be transformed into shares of stock, as well as shares held by company insiders.\nAdvertisement\nThe filing also includes all the shares held by the former president. Trump, though, remains under a 'lock-up' deal that largely restricts him from selling his shares for another roughly five months. His son, Donald Trump Jr., who is a director on the board, and CEO Devin Nunes, are also bound by the lock-up.\nTypically, all shares of stock held by insiders subject to lock-up deals are included in such filings, according to Jay Ritter, an expert on initial public offerings of stock at the University of Florida's Warrington College of Business.\nThe filing does not necessarily mean any investors are planning to sell their shares, Sarasota, Florida-based Trump Media & Technology Group said in a statement.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nTrump Media got its place on the Nasdaq after merging with a company called Digital World Acquisition Corp., which was essentially a pile of cash looking for a target to merge with. It's an example of what's called a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, which can give young companies quicker and easier routes to getting their shares trading publicly.\nAdvertisement\nS-1 filings are typically filed quickly after a SPAC deal closes, usually within 15 or 30 days, said Kristi Marvin, founder of SPACInsider.com, which specializes in SPAC deals.\nThe exercise of warrants referenced in Trump Media's S-1 filing would increase the number of shares outstanding for the company. That in turn could put downward pressure on the stock price. When something becomes more available, it tends to fall in price unless demand for it picks up accordingly.\nThe drop in Trump Media's stock price over the last few weeks hurts its shareholders, who experts say are mostly smaller-pocketed investors rather than big institutions. Several users of Truth Social have said they bought shares to show their support of the former president.\nThe drop also puts a huge hit on Trump's finances directly. He could personally own nearly 114.8 million shares, depending on the company's performance. That would be worth $3.15 billion at its current price. On March 27, that was worth nearly $7.6 billion.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Associated Press","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IYFM6BH3JII65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.341533,"_id":"e8c46dd4ab007c49eaf508f29ec4b889"},{"title":"Trump, hush money and the increasingly quaint notion of embarrassment","author":"Robin Givhan","published_date":"2024-04-20 16:00:39","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/04/20/trump-hush-money-increasingly-quaint-notion-embarrassment","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"There's nothing small about Trump's New York trial; it's the country's fealty to decency and honesty that have become distant, writes columnist Robin Givhan.","summary":"The first of the four criminal cases facing Donald Trump began in New York City with prospective jurors being grilled on their ability to put aside what they already know and believe to be true about the former president and fairly render a verdict about the issues at hand. Those issues have been exquisitely described by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg as 'falsifying New York business records to conceal damaging information and unlawful activity from American voters before and after the 2016 election.' Among the information that Trump was allegedly attempting to hide was that he cheated on his wife with adult-film actress Stormy Daniels \u2014 something Trump denies. The prosecution has said Trump engaged in illegal subterfuge because he worried that revelations about his infidelity might offend the female electorate. The defense has said Trump simply wanted to keep a personal matter private lest it embarrass him and his family.\nAnd so, here we are. A jury has been seated and opening arguments are expected to begin Monday in a trial for which the dominant talking points spring from Trump's capacity to be mortified and the public's ability to be shocked. How quaint.\nTrump is accused of caring so deeply about what prospective voters thought of the way he treated women that he went to extraordinary lengths to hide the truth about his brutish nature. We are having this conversation after Trump was found to have defamed the writer E. Jean Carroll when she accused him of raping her and he called her a liar. After the jury ordered him to pay Carroll a settlement of more than $83 million, he continued to publicly attack her. We are here after Trump stood before an audience of voters and referred to one woman as 'crazy,' another as 'nasty,' called a third a 'whack job' and bragged about being instrumental to the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade and taking away a right to bodily autonomy that women had had for generations.\nRoe v. Wade and taking away a right to bodily autonomy that women had had for generations.\nAdvertisement\nThe legal issues in the New York case are real and they are concerning. And bless the hearts of the lawyers who are litigating them. But it's hard to look at the criminality being charged without considering just how far the country has come in the years since the alleged activities took place. It seems like such an innocent time back then, before norms and traditions had begun to disintegrate, before folks turned numb to incivility and civil disruption.\nThe New York charges, of which there are 34, have sometime been referred to as comprising the 'runt' of the criminal cases against Trump because legal experts view them as the fuzziest and weakest. The road to Bragg's accusation of election interference winds through a sordid field of tabloid stories, porn, payoffs and sex. Nonetheless, sitting in a courtroom as a criminal defendant is serious business and having to do so as a former president speaks to both the power of this democracy and the fragility of it. There's nothing small about this case, it's just that the country's fealty to decency, respectability and honesty has retreated further and further into the distance.\nThe elements of the New York case occurred back before Trump's election lies helped to spark an insurrection, before Trump saw 'good people' among the white nationalists marching in Charlottesville clutching tiki torches and spewing hate, before Trump aspired to use the American military to intimidate fellow citizens exercising their right to free speech and assembly. Those things shocked the consciousness until they no longer did. Until they became mere markers on the road to \u2026 where? As the completed jury was being settled, a man tossed pamphlets filled with conspiracy theories into the air and set himself ablaze across from the courthouse. Bystanders screamed, police and civilians attempted to douse the flames, and the man was rushed to a hospital. Law enforcement made statements. Security was discussed. The trial would press on. And then, within minutes, it seemed, the horror had faded. The surprise had dissipated. We are numb.\nThis case isn't marked by dire references to top-secret documents or calls to halt the peaceful transfer of power or a shady plot to find votes. It's more human scale than that. And so, it takes us back to a time when we still \u2014 occasionally \u2014 treated each other like humans instead of adversaries, mobs, monsters and heretics. Despite all the attendant security, scrutiny and Trump's own bluster, this is the trial that reminds the public that the former president is merely a man \u2014 not a god, not an omnipotent leader, not the bearer of Everyman's burden. His alleged crimes are those borne out of fear and shame. This is a trial that reminds us of the smallness of Trump even as the idea of him, the myth of him has become outsize.\nAdvertisement\nThe former president and his lawyers have worked mightily to delay the start of this case, but now that it has launched, it's moved more briskly than many expected. It was both heartbreaking and heartening to follow along as the jury was assembled. New Yorkers' anxieties and fears bubbled to the surface in the cold, dingy courtroom in Lower Manhattan as they considered the pressure they would face and what it would mean if their identity were made public as members of the jury sitting in judgment of Trump. Some even wept. But as riddled with emotion as they were, they retained an earnest desire to do right by a fellow citizen even if it was one whose political beliefs they abhorred, whose personality they found savage and whose behavior they deemed foul.\nThe public knows little about the jurors as a matter of security. But the details that are known paint them as New Yorkers with varying political opinions and professions who are engaged with the daily news to widely different degrees. They are tasked with looking into our past and brushing the dust off old saws such as shame, shock and dignity.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Robin Givhan,Senior Critic-At-Large","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZHUYERYXPQHV57QMQ6FKMNAYNY_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.33769,"_id":"2abf71a7a7c5afe8e916deb1d704861a"},{"title":"Trump loses bid to halt Jan. 6 lawsuits while he fights criminal charges in the 2020 election case","author":"Alanna Durkin Richer","published_date":"2024-04-18 20:46:30","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/18/trump-capitol-riot-jan-6-civil-lawsuits/bb85c992-fdc4-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Donald Trump has lost a bid to pause a string of lawsuits accusing him of inciting the U.S. Capitol attack, while the former president fights his 2020 election interference criminal case in Washington","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Donald Trump lost a bid Thursday to pause a string of lawsuits accusing him of inciting the U.S. Capitol attack, while the former president fights his 2020 election interference criminal case in Washington.\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington denied defense lawyers' request to put the civil cases seeking to hold Trump responsible for the Jan. 6, 2021, riot on hold while the criminal case accusing him of conspiring to overturn his election defeat to President Joe Biden plays out.\nIt's the latest legal setback for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, whose trial in a separate criminal case related to hush money payments made during the 2016 campaign began this week with jury selection in New York.\nThe lawsuits brought by Democratic lawmakers and police officers who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 seek civil damages for harm they say they suffered during the attack, which aimed to stop Congress' certification of Biden's victory.\nAdvertisement\nTrump has claimed he can't be sued over the riot that left dozens of police officers injured, arguing that his words during a rally before the storming of the Capitol addressed 'matters of public concern' and fell within the scope of absolute presidential immunity.\nWashington's federal appeals court ruled in December that the lawsuits can move forward, rejecting Trump's sweeping claims that presidential immunity shields him from liability. The court, however, said Trump can continue to fight, as the cases proceed, to try to prove that his actions were taken in his official capacity as president.\nIn court papers filed last month, Trump's lawyers told the judge that 'basic fairness to criminal defendants' warrants pausing the civil cases until after the 2020 election criminal case is resolved. They argued that allowing the lawsuits to proceed could force Trump to 'prematurely telegraph' his defense strategies in the criminal case.\nAdvertisement\nMehta, who was appointed to the bench by former President Barack Obama, said the public has an interest in the prompt resolution of the civil lawsuits in addition to the criminal case. And the judge said 'appropriate safeguards' can be put in place to allow for the lawsuits to advance without infringing on Trump's Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Alanna Durkin Richer","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WJR224H5YQI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.3348618,"_id":"b53bf64d00441133d8028c7e55401659"},{"title":"Trump to meet with Polish president Duda as NATO leaders call for additional support for Ukraine","author":"Steve Peoples","published_date":"2024-04-16 23:39:26","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/16/trump-poland-duda-election/8fbdf42c-fc4a-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda on Wednesday in New York","summary":"NEW YORK \u2014 Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda on Wednesday in New York.\nThe planned dinner meeting, confirmed by a person familiar with the matter, comes as European leaders prepare for the possibility that Trump might win the November election and return to the White House.

Trump, meanwhile, has been railing against how liberal Kennedy purportedly is, making not subtle suggestions to Democrats (a group with whom he admittedly has limited sway) that they back Kennedy rather than Biden.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news.

Each man won the presidency thanks to narrow margins in a handful of states, after all, so the prospect of seeing a swing state swing in the other direction because of Kennedy is particularly unappealing.\nAdvertisement\nNew data from Fox News's well-respected polling arm offers insight into how real that threat is. The verdict?\nMaybe? Sort of. Kind of?\nThe poll was conducted in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, four states that flipped from backing Trump in 2016 to preferring Biden in 2020. (The Michigan results weren't really that close last time, but whatever.) In every state except Georgia \u2014 where Trump has a stronger lead \u2014 the results in a head-to-head contest between the major-party candidates show a functionally tied race. When Kennedy is added to the mix? The results in every state except Georgia show a functionally tied race.\nYou can see the shifts below. On the outside of each graph are the results of the poll when Biden and Trump are the only offered options; the center three columns show the results when Kennedy is in the mix. At the top of each Biden and Trump column in the middle is the percentage-point drop the candidates experience when thrown into the larger field.\nPennsylvania and Wisconsin go from tied to one candidate having a two-point lead when the field is larger, but 'a two-point lead' and 'tied' are functionally the same thing when you consider margins of error. In other words, there's no obvious effect on the outcome shown in the polls. But there would be some effect on Election Day \u2014 an uncertain one that both major-party candidates want to shape.\nAdvertisement\nThe Fox News poll asked about the full field before the head-to-head matchup in each state. Asking both questions allowed it to break down the head-to-head support for Trump and Biden relative to how those same respondents had answered the question about the full field.\nIn each state, about 9 in 10 of those who picked either Trump or Biden in the head-to-head question had also chosen that candidate when presented with the full field. But anywhere from about 5 to 10 percent of those candidates' head-to-head support came from people who picked Kennedy when given the choice.\nIn Michigan, for example, 1 in 10 respondents who picked Trump in the head-to-head contest had picked Kennedy when given the fuller field. If Kennedy didn't make the ballot in Michigan, that would be better news for the former president. Unfortunately for Trump, he did.\nAdvertisement\nWe can summarize these findings accurately and unsatisfactorily. Kennedy's presence on the ballot in swing states would pull voters from both major-party candidates. The effect of doing so, however, is uncertain, and it's not clear that Kennedy would shift the winner in any state from Trump to Biden or vice versa. But, also? He might.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Philip Bump,National Columnist","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WYV262GUECERIM4KLNF7WZ7OUU_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.331924,"_id":"f4572428350093ca6657ff2bdc0a7245"},{"title":"Trump's Mar-a-Lago fundraising pitch to oil executives: I will kill wind","author":"Maxine Joselow","published_date":"2024-04-17 10:00:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/04/17/trump-wind-power-oil-executives","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"'I hate wind,' the former president told oil industry officials at a recent Mar-a-Lago dinner, doubling down on promises to end this form of clean energy.","summary":"Former president Donald Trump repeatedly ranted about wind power during a fundraising dinner with oil and gas industry executives last week, falsely claiming that the renewable-energy source is unreliable, unattractive and bad for the environment.\ndinner with oil and gas industry executives last week, falsely claiming that the renewable-energy source is unreliable, unattractive and bad for the environment.\n'I hate wind,' Trump told the executives over a meal of chopped steak at his Mar-a-Lago Club and resort in Florida, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation.\nTrump's comments reveal how he is wooing potential donors with his long-standing hostility to wind farms and pledges to halt this form of renewable energy if he returns to office.

In an emailed statement, Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said the former president would 'make America energy dominant again.'\nAdvertisement\nEnergy analysts say they expect a second Trump administration would slow the pace of offshore wind lease sales and environmental reviews. These steps could undercut the industry at the very moment when it needs to accelerate to meet Biden's goal of 100 percent clean electricity by 2035, and to help New England reduce its deep dependence on imported gas and oil.\n'Project reviews and auction schedules could slow substantially, potentially to the point of a de facto pause,' analysts with ClearView Energy Partners wrote in a recent note to clients. 'In short: the regulatory uncertainty from the upcoming election could keep project developers on the sidelines.'\nA Trump Interior Department would also prioritize offshore oil and gas leasing in the Gulf of Mexico over offshore wind auctions, said William Perry Pendley, who served as acting director of Interior's Bureau of Land Management under Trump.\nAdvertisement\n'The priority has to be oil and gas,' Pendley said, adding, 'I don't think there's a reason to press forward on wind.'\nTrump told executives at the fundraising dinner he would open up the Gulf of Mexico to drilling, a person with knowledge of the meeting said, lift Biden's pause on new liquefied natural gas exports, speed up drilling permits, reverse regulations aimed at deploying electric vehicles and do what he could to help the oil and gas industry. He listened to each executive for about four or five minutes.\nPointing out the window to the Atlantic Ocean at one point, one attendee said, the former president claimed that offshore wind turbines break down when they are exposed to saltwater \u2014 though these projects are designed to resist saltwater corrosion.\nNear the end of the meeting, Trump told executives that they should contribute to his campaign \u2014 the leader of his main super PAC was in the room \u2014 because he was trailing Biden financially. His policies would be much better for the oil and gas industry than those of Biden, and he'd do much of what they wanted 'on Day 1,' he said.\nAdvertisement\nIn addition to political uncertainty, offshore wind developers face significant economic challenges. Rising interest rates and supply-chain bottlenecks have contributed to the demise of some projects, including two in New Jersey late last year.\noffshore wind developers face significant economic challenges. Rising interest rates and supply-chain bottlenecks have contributed to the demise of some projects, including two in New Jersey late last year.\nDemocrats are doing their best to lock in commercial-scale offshore wind projects before Trump has a chance to halt them. The Biden administration has already approved eight, including one that is up and running. Democratic governors in the Northeast have also reinforced their commitments to deploying more offshore wind energy, regardless of the balance of power in Washington.\nIf Biden were to win a second term, he would be in a position to accelerate offshore wind along the Gulf and West coasts, and add more capacity to the Atlantic. Once those steel turbines were anchored to the ocean floor, they would be hard to scuttle \u2014 once reason the stakes now are so high.\nA long battle\nTrump's crusade against wind power dates back to 2006, when he bought an 1,800-acre estate in Scotland near a planned wind farm that he warned would be 'monstrous' and 'really ugly.'\nAdvertisement\nThe Trump Organization sought to build a golf course there, and it sued to block the wind project, saying the turbines would ruin the view for golfers. In December 2015, less than a year before the U.S. election, judges on Britain's top court unanimously rejected that claim.\nBut the battle raged on. While in the White House, Trump frequently attacked the clean-energy source, suggesting without evidence that it causes cancer.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'If you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations your house just went down 75 percent in value,' Trump said in a 2020 speech. 'And they say the noise causes cancer. And of course it's like a graveyard for birds.'\nThere are no known instances of wind farms causing cancer. While turbines can kill birds, research suggests that house cats cause far more bird deaths in the United States each year, and that painting the turbine blades black can help reduce fatalities.\nAdvertisement\nYet taking a cue from Trump's anti-wind rhetoric, Interior delayed the approval of America's first major offshore wind farm in 2019. Then-Interior Secretary David Bernhardt extended the environmental review of Vineyard Wind, a proposed wind farm near Martha's Vineyard, Mass.\nThe decision pushed back the timeline for the project, which had planned to start operating in 2021. It also cast a pall of uncertainty over the entire offshore wind sector, as other developers worried about the administration potentially interfering in their own projects.\nBernhardt, who now chairs the Center for American Freedom at the America First Policy Institute, a pro-Trump think tank, did not respond to requests for comment. Bernhardt has been talking with energy executives and others in recent weeks about policies in a second Trump term, according to a person familiar with the outreach, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.\n\u2018A shot in the arm'\nToday, the forces opposing offshore wind have multiplied and become more powerful. Fossil fuel interests have worked with right-wing think tanks and community groups to block projects up and down the East Coast, according to a recent report by Brown University's Climate and Development Lab.\nAdvertisement\nSeveral of these groups have repeated Trump's false claims that wind turbines are killing whales and driving the marine mammals 'crazy.' Many are now feeling emboldened by the former president's rhetoric.\n'It's a shot in the arm to our movement,' said Robin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast New Jersey, which describes itself as a grass-roots group made up of 'residents, homeowners, business owners, fishermen and visitors.'\nTrump 'rightly sees offshore wind as a boondoggle,' said H. Sterling Burnett, director of the Arthur B. Robinson Center on Climate and Environmental Policy at the Heartland Institute, a conservative think tank that has called climate change a 'hoax' and has sued to stop an offshore wind project off Virginia.\nEarly on, Protect Our Coast received support from the Delaware-based Caesar Rodney Institute, a think tank that has been backed by fossil fuel interests such as the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers and the American Energy Alliance. The Heartland Institute received funding from oil giant ExxonMobil until 2008.\nForging ahead\nRegardless of the election, officials in the Biden administration and Northeast are forging ahead with ambitious offshore wind goals. And they are making union labor \u2014 a key Democratic constituency \u2014 central to this push.\nAdvertisement\nInterior this month approved the nation's eighth large offshore wind project south of Martha's Vineyard, Mass. Overall, the Biden administration has approved more than 10 gigawatts of clean energy from offshore wind projects \u2014 enough to power nearly 4 million homes.\nIn New England, which relies on natural gas to fuel nearly 43 percent of its power generation, Vineyard Wind is now delivering power to roughly 30,000 homes, despite the delay under Trump. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey (D), who has set a goal of 100 percent clean electricity by 2030, has praised the developers for agreeing to hire hundreds of union workers.\n'In a whole new industry like offshore wind, we're seeing the beginnings of workers coming together and collectively organizing,' said Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, the country's largest federation of labor unions. 'These are all things that would be at risk if there were a second Trump administration. So we think it couldn't be more dire.'\nYet Rebecca Tepper, secretary of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, said Trump's false claims about wind power won't stop the state's progress.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Josh Dawsey,Maxine Joselow","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7SPM5SHZULAYCB5HCCGSOGOV44.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.328121,"_id":"504cdce022d14073d3894f41036e8bdf"},{"title":"Trump goes from court to campaign at a bodega in his heavily Democratic hometown","author":"Jill Colvin","published_date":"2024-04-16 20:56:49","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/16/trump-harlem-trial-bodega/d80b6e92-fc33-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Donald Trump plans to visit New York's Harlem neighborhood after spending his second day in a lower Manhattan courtroom as a criminal defendant","summary":"NEW YORK \u2014 Donald Trump plans to visit New York's Harlem neighborhood Tuesday after spending his second day in a lower Manhattan courtroom as a criminal defendant.\nTrump was expected to stop by Sanaa Convenient Store, a tiny bodega that sells chips, sodas and other snacks. Trump aides said the former president and current Republican nominee chose the store because it has been the site of a violent attack on an employee. He will also highlight consumer inflation under President Joe Biden, aides said.\nThe visit would be Trump's first campaign appearance since his criminal hush money trial began, making the presumptive GOP nominee the first former president in U.S. history to stand criminal trial.\nTrump will be confined to the courtroom on most days, dramatically limiting his movements and his ability to campaign, fundraise and make calls. Aides have been planning rallies and other political events on weekends and Wednesdays, the one weekday when court is not supposed to be in session. Plans also include local appearances Trump can make after court recesses each day.\nAdvertisement\nTrump's stop in Harlem demonstrates the former president's determination to amplify familiar campaign arguments even within the strictures of being a criminal defendant.\nIn July 2022, Jose Alba, a clerk at the store in Hamilton Heights, a heavily Hispanic section of Harlem, was attacked by 35-year-old Austin Simon. The resulting altercation, captured on surveillance video, ended with Alba fatally stabbing Simon. Alba was arrested and charged with murder but the Manhattan district attorney dropped the charges within weeks, saying they could not prove Alba had not acted in self-defense.\nOn another evening in August 2022, according to the New York Post, owner Osamah Aldhabyani was in the store when a customer entered and an altercation between the two ensued. The customer was arrested, the newspaper reported.\nAdvertisement\nBefore his arrival, Trump's campaign distributed materials to journalists criticizing Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for his handling of the stabbing case, including the weeks Alba spent jailed at Rikers Island without bail. Bragg oversees the office now prosecuting Trump.\nThe former president's local appearance also affirms his intentions to campaign in his home state, even though New York remains overwhelmingly Democratic. In 2020, Biden garnered more than 60% of the vote in the state and ran up even wider margins in New York City. Trump insists he can win New York in November anyway, and he has mused about holding rallies in the South Bronx and Queens, where the former president was born and grew up, and even Madison Square Garden.\n'I may rent Madison Square Garden,' he said in an interview with Breitbart News. 'That's the belly of the beast, right?'\nAdvertisement\nThat would be a prohibitively expensive proposition, particularly as his campaign has worked to save cash as it confronts a fundraising gap with Biden.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'You know, the president is very keen on New York,' Chris LaCivita, Trump senior campaign adviser, told The Associated Press last month as he talked up the campaign's efforts to put more states in play. Still, LaCivita laughed when asked whether he agrees. 'I don't get out in front of the boss. I do what the boss says. The boss drives,' he said.\nTrump has argued that the ongoing influx of migrants to the city, where he grew his real estate empire and became a tabloid fixture, has made New Yorkers more willing to vote for him since his 2020 loss to Biden. The city has struggled to house the new arrivals, putting many up in city hotels.\n'I think we have a chance. New York has changed a lot in the last two years,' he told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo. 'The people of New York are angry. People that would have never voted for me because I'm a Republican \u2014 I mean they're Democrats ... I think they're going to vote for me. So I think we're going to give New York a heavy shot.'\nAdvertisement\nTrump cited the 2022 New York governor's race, when Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul prevailed over Republican former Rep. Lee Zeldin \u2014 but by a much tighter margin than usual for her party's statewide nominees.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a top Trump ally, said Monday that Trump will be campaigning all over the state while he's forced to be on trial in New York.\n'He's going to make the best out of this,' she said, adding that 'Democrats in New York and the judge and everyone, they're really going to regret it.'\nAt the least, Trump, long a famous figure for New Yorkers, showed Tuesday that he can still turn heads in the city.\n'Papito Trump is coming. Yeah!' said one passerby ahead of the former president's arrival.\nLesandra Carrion, 47, who lives in the neighborhood, came out to see the former president when she heard he might be visiting.\nAdvertisement\nShe said she doesn't agree with everything Trump says or does but declared that 'he speaks the truth.' Carrion cited the rising migrant population and strained city resources. 'I think that he will make a difference,' she said of Trump.\nAs for his troubles at the courthouse at the south end of Manhattan, Carrion was dismissive. 'He's going to beat that,' she said.

They were not shown on the closed-circuit feed in the media overflow room.\nManhattan prosecutors and Trump's defense team received a list of names, but New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan strictly forbade them from making it public.\nTrump, present in the courtroom for nearly six hours of proceedings, craned his neck to get a glimpse as the jury pool entered. He stood and looked their way when Merchan introduced him as the defendant.\nAdvertisement\nAnd he listened impassively as the credentials of the first 10 prospective jurors came into view: Longtime New Yorkers, and some relative newcomers, who mostly read the New York Times, listen to NPR and watch CNN. A few said they tune into Fox News and read the conservative-leaning New York Post.\nMost of those 10 prospective jurors who answered a questionnaire in court Monday were not voracious consumers of social media \u2014 with the exception of a marketing director at FanDuel, a sports betting app \u2014 and none had read Trump's books or attended his political rallies, or participated actively in anti-Trump rallies.\nFor the most part, they identified themselves as having no strong views of the defendant that could prevent them from being impartial \u2014 a seeming rarity in a nation sharply polarized, particularly on the question of Trump's presidency and, in some quarters, his guilt or innocence.\nAdvertisement\nThere were only hints about how they might feel about the case in which Trump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up payments to an adult-film actress ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump has pleaded not guilty and called the prosecution politically motivated.\n'I feel nobody is above the law \u2014 whether a sitting president, a former president or a janitor,' said one man, a bookseller from the Upper West Side who is married with two children, one entering college and one finishing. He copped to listening to a good amount of talk radio \u2014 when his morning alarm rings, in the shower and while commuting.\n'It's NPR on all three occasions,' the man said.\nAll told, a jury of 12 New Yorkers, with six alternates, will be selected to decide Trump's fate.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBefore hearing from individual prospective jurors, Merchan had asked any of the pool of 96 to raise their hands if they could not be impartial \u2014 or if they could not serve for any other reason. Several hands went up, and the judge dismissed them from the jury pool.\nAdvertisement\nThen, one by one, they entered the jury box and read off the answers to the questions. New York is the city that made Trump famous, as a Queens-born real estate magnate who owns Trump Tower in Midtown, and whose residents first got to know him as a gossip-pages tabloid fixture during his rise in the 1980s.\nBut the opening day of jury selection sounded more like the prospective jurors were reciting their dating app profiles than sounding off about their partisan views of Trump.\nThe first man was a venture capitalist with a master's degree in business administration who likes to frequent city restaurants and listens to the New York Times' podcast 'The Daily,' a breakdown of the day's biggest news stories.\nThe next man was a creative director who has worked for Lands' End and Kenneth Cole who enjoys hiking, cooking and playing with his dog. One woman works in marketing for a city government agency and enjoys going to public parks and theater shows.\nAdvertisement\nWere these folks Democrats or Republicans? MAGA or part of Resistance Twitter? It was difficult, if impossible, to say. Hints, based on education, news consumption or jobs, about where they fall on the political spectrum would have to be sussed out when the prosecutors and defense attorneys directly question the jury pool in the coming days.\nThere were humorous moments, and human ones: 'My wife works at a bank but I have no idea what she does,' confessed one man, a public prosecutor in Bronx County who told Merchan that, despite his profession, he could judge Trump impartially.\nFor Trump, who is required to be in the courtroom each day for a trial that the judge has said could last six to eight weeks, an up-close view of the jury appears to be a key component of his legal strategy. His lawyers told Merchan that the former president, who once held summits with global leaders, wants to be present for private sidebar questioning of potential jurors in a small conference room.\nAdvertisement\nMerchan responded that such a scenario, which would require a Secret Service agent to be present, could prove intimidating to the potential jurors \u2014 instead, he said, the sidebars would take place in the courtroom, with the rest of the jury pool removed.\nBy day's end, there was but a single moment that appeared to reflect the nation's great political polarization. One woman, who had not raised her hand to be dismissed, said 'yes' to a question about whether she had strong feelings about Trump that could preclude her from being impartial.\nThe judge asked lawyers from both parties to approach the bench, then dismissed the woman, a Harlem resident who works at Bloomingdale's and likes to shop and go clubbing.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David Nakamura","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NMPNHASNNQ7E44EDNOZRISLQOI.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.3166575,"_id":"c1828e87654b6872d9c8dbc9f0005d56"},{"title":"The Trump Trials: Day One is in the books.

We saw this happen when then-President Donald Trump imposed worldwide steel tariffs in 2018. U.S. prices for steel predictably rocketed upward, far above prices in other countries. Within two years, these tariffs resulted in about 75,000 fewer jobs across downstream manufacturers, according to calculations from researchers Kadee Russ and Lydia Cox. And by the way, that number doesn't even include the additional job losses among U.S. exporters that faced painful counter-tariffs levied by other countries.\nthe additional job losses among U.S. exporters that faced painful counter-tariffs levied by other countries.\nThe metal duties weren't the only Trump-era tariffs that economically backfired. As I've noted before, at least four separate studies found that the costs of Trump's various import duties (on Chinese goods, washing machines, solar panels, etc.) were borne mostly or entirely by Americans, in the form of higher prices.\nThis proved useful for some of Trump's political rivals. In campaign ads and speeches, Democrats sometimes (correctly) accused Trump of raising the costs of back-to-school shopping or Christmas gifts. Among the more high-profile critics was then-presidential candidate Joe Biden.\nAdvertisement\n'President Trump may think he's being tough on China,' Biden said in 2019 of Trump's China tariffs. 'All that he's delivered as a consequence of that is American farmers, manufacturers and consumers losing and paying more.' Biden's 2020 campaign site likewise argued that Trump's 'tariff war' had cost hundreds of thousands of jobs.\nFollow this author Catherine Rampell 's opinions\nFollow this author\nCatherine Rampell\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nAdvertisement\nBiden has, rightly, pointed out the folly of these plans: Mere days ago, the White House warned in a statement about the catastrophically inflationary effects of Trump's proposed tariffs. Then, in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, Biden promptly forgot his own warning. In fact, in addition to his plans to increase tariffs on Chinese steel, he also signaled support for new tariffs on China's shipbuilding sector.\nAfter all, the U.S. shipbuilding industry is struggling. That's partly because of high input costs, including for materials such as \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 steel .\n.\nThe best thing you can say about Biden's proposed tripling of tariffs on Chinese metals is that it might be toothless. Why? We've already levied so many different kinds of tariffs on Chinese metals \u2014 under both Trump and earlier presidential administrations \u2014 that China doesn't sell much steel here anymore anyway. Chinese-made steel accounted for just about 2 percent of U.S. steel imports in 2023, so raising the price of Chinese-made steel might not move overall market prices much. ('Biden's basically putting Chinese steel on double-secret probation,' said Cato Institute trade researcher Scott Lincicome.)\nAdvertisement\nEven so, Biden's tariff actions are hardly benign. A White House news release hints of ongoing union pressures to also limit steel imported from Mexico, which actually is one of our top sources of steel imports. Meanwhile the Biden administration is vigorously defending his predecessor's tariffs in court. If successful, these efforts would make Trump's next round of tariffs \u2014 or Biden's, for that matter \u2014 even easier to implement, regardless of Biden's on-again-off-again warnings about their costs.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Catherine Rampell","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RAMXWBBT6K6TGIUXQS5VIXHX2Y_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.294331,"_id":"12801d2cdaec39d1968812d7f36f625d"},{"title":"Trump takes aim at a remaining House Republican who voted to impeach him","author":"Mariana Alfaro","published_date":"2024-04-17 19:25:46","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/17/trump-dan-newhouse-republican-challenger","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Donald Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, just Newhouse and one other remain in the chamber.","summary":"Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) is among a dying breed in Congress: Of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Donald Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, just Newhouse and one other remain in the chamber.\nIf Trump has his way, that won't be the case much longer.\nThe former president last week endorsed Jerrod Sessler, a conservative Republican who has never held public office but who is once again challenging Newhouse in the race for the 4th District in Washington state.\nIn a post shared on his social media site Truth Social, Trump said Sessler is 'MAGA all the way, and has my complete and total endorsement \u2014 he will never let you down.'\nNewhouse, Trump said, 'has to go.'\nSpeaking to The Washington Post this week, Newhouse declined to comment on Trump's endorsement of his challenger, suggesting only that he expected that the former president would do that. Newhouse, however, remained optimistic that he will prevail in the primary.\nAdvertisement\n'I'm going to win,' he said. 'I'll work as hard as I can.'\nOf the 10 House Republicans who voted with Democrats to impeach Trump after a mob of his supporters broke into the Capitol on Jan. 6, only Newhouse and Rep. David Valadeo (R-Calif.) remain in the House. Valadeo faces a difficult general election in the 22nd District of California \u2014 a district that President Biden won by about 13 points in 2020.\nTrump has long sought revenge against the Republicans who turned against him in the wake of the Capitol attack.\nIn 2022, four of the 10 Republicans \u2014 then-Reps. Tom Rice (S.C.), Jaime Herrera Beutler (Wash.), Liz Cheney (Wyo.) and Peter Meijer (Mich.) \u2014 lost their primary races to challengers from the right.\nFour others \u2014 then-Reps. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), John Katko (N.Y.), Anthony Gonzalez (Ohio) and Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) \u2014 chose to retire. Only Newhouse and Valadao were able to hold on to their seats.\nAdvertisement\nUpton \u2014 who did not run for reelection in 2022 after his Michigan district was redrawn in a way that would've likely pushed him out in the general \u2014 told The Washington Post on Wednesday that he's sure Trump's decision to endorse Newhouse's challenger is 'more vengeance.'\nUpton said that 'everyone had their own reason to vote the way that they did' on Trump's impeachment charges.\n'Some were worried for their own safety. Some said, 'You know, this is what my district would want' versus perhaps what I saw first hand,' he said. 'And some were, frankly, just scared of this bully.'\nNewhouse's district, Washington's 4th, is a solidly red seat. The congressman has easily won reelection there by wide margins since 2014, most recently in 2022, when he defeated his Democratic opponent by 35 points. Trump won the district by 19 points in 2020. These numbers probably make the primary election the de facto general.\nAdvertisement\nIn his endorsement of Sessler, Trump called Newhouse a 'weak and pathetic RINO' \u2014 short for 'Republican in name only.'\nThis is not the first time Sessler, a Navy veteran and businessman, has challenged Newhouse. In 2022, Sessler and five other Republicans tried to unseat Newhouse, a farmer, but Newhouse prevailed. This time, however, Sessler is the only candidate challenging Newhouse in the GOP primary.\nIn a post shared on X after Trump's endorsement, Sessler said, '#Honored.' Online, Sessler often shares messages from some of the most right-wing members of Congress and touts his credentials as a political firebrand.\nIn an interview with The Washington Post last month, Newhouse said that while many of his moderate Republican colleagues in the House are leaving Congress \u2014 citing their conference's inability to collaborate and strike successful legislative deals \u2014 he still has unfinished business in the chamber, and he will not let himself be discouraged from being in office by the more extreme wing of his party.\nAdvertisement\n'I've still got some things I want to accomplish, some issues that are important to me. It is a difficult environment, but it's always hard, it's never easy to get legislation through,' he said. 'One of my biggest priorities is making some positive changes to our agricultural labor laws, and we've been getting we've been making progress. I don't want to leave before that's done.'\nUpton said he is optimistic about his former colleague's chances and said he believes Newhouse is the type of lawmaker who should remain in Congress.\n'He's got an unblemished record. He's honest as the day is long. He's the type of people that voters ought to want in a responsible position like a member of Congress,' Upton said. 'He'll be able to sell that back home. But it's likely going to be a rough couple of months. And it raises questions on the personal side: Is it worth it?'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Mariana Alfaro","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OFTHCNOLGZ5JQLP5A2BDRFDAHI_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.2881126,"_id":"aa0a87ee7aee43590cfc33893e2d9b8d"},{"title":"Biden flexes his cash advantage, GOP megadonors spend big in latest FEC filings","author":"Maeve Reston","published_date":"2024-04-16 10:59:14","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/16/trump-biden-fundraising-april-fec","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Federal Election Commission filings from the first quarter of 2024 show a competitive race for cash between Republicans and Democrats in many key Senate races across the country.","summary":"President Biden and the Democratic groups allied with his campaign continue to demonstrate an enormous cash advantage over Donald Trump's presidential effort with nearly six months until the election.\nDown the ballot, new Federal Election Commission filings from the first quarter of 2024 show a leading Democratic super PAC outpacing its GOP counterpart in the battle for the Senate.\nDemocrats' hopes of maintaining control of the U.S. Senate \u2014 where they have a slim 51-49 majority \u2014 has long looked like difficult because the 2024 map is far more favorable to Republicans. Democrats are trying to defend 23 seats in the Senate \u2014 including three held by independents who caucus with Democrats \u2014 while Republicans need to hold just 11. The Democratic Party's task is complicated by the fact that they are all but certain to lose the seat of retiring Sen. Joe Manchin III, a conservative Democrat in deep-red West Virginia\nAdvertisement\nDemocratic groups are pouring resources into Ohio and Montana to help incumbent Sens. Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester defend their seats in states Trump carried in 2016 and 2020. Democrats are also defending their Senate seats in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nevada \u2014 states that are key to the presidential race \u2014 as well as Michigan, where Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow is retiring. Both Michigan and Arizona are open seats.\nThe Senate Leadership Fund, which supports Republicans, posted strong numbers in the first quarter of the year \u2014 raising $26 million, nearly doubling their cash on hand ($59.5 million). But Senate Majority PAC, an independent group associated with Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, outperformed its Republican counterparts \u2014 raising nearly $38.9 million during the quarter and ending the three-month period with $92 million in cash on hand. Senate Majority PAC has reserved $239 million in ads to defend seats in seven states.\nCongressional Republicans have expressed concerns about their ability to hold to the party's slim House majority in November. Those fears have been amplified in recent weeks by Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's threat to try to oust Speaker Mike Johnson over a Ukraine funding dispute, as well as the looming departure of Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), who will vacate his seat at the end of the week Gallagher's exit will leave Republicans with a one-vote majority \u2014 their smallest in decades.\nAdvertisement\nThe Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC which is supporting Republican House candidates across the country, reported raising $18.8 million in the first quarter and ended the period with $68.6 million in cash. House Majority PAC, which backs Democrats, will not file its report until April 20. But the group has said it raised $37 million with its affiliated organization House Majority Forward in the first quarter \u2014 demonstrating its advantage over CLF.\nBiden maintains his cash edge over Trump\nThough reports filed Monday continued to show Biden's huge cash advantage over Trump, they also offered a partial picture of the big money flowing into a new Trump super PAC, Right for America, which raised $13 million in the first quarter and spent nothing. The major donors to the committee were Ike and Laura Perlmutter, who donated $10.1 million, and Anthony Lomangino, the Palm Beach-based chairman and founder of Southern Waste Systems who gave $1.1. million.\nAdvertisement\nThe leadership PAC that Trump has primarily used to pay his legal fees, Save America, will not file its next report until April 20. But Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, spent $1.7 million on legal fees in the first quarter through another committee, Make America Great Again PAC. That group also spent $400,000 on 'document hosting' fees that are often related to discovery in legal cases. Trump spent more than $55 million on legal fees in 2023, creating a strain on overall fundraising effort as he fights criminal charges in four cases.\nThe Biden campaign announced earlier this month that it raised more than $90 million in March and that broader Biden effort had about $192 million in cash at the end of the month \u2014 more than double what their rivals are holding in their war chest. Reports from some Biden committees, alongside Democratic super PACs, showed the generosity of top Democratic donors such as megadonor James Simons, who gave $2.5 million each to Future Forward super PAC and Senate Majority PAC in the first three months of the year. He was joined by businessman Fred Eychaner, Kenneth and Jennifer Duda, and others in writing seven-figure checks to Future Forward, which raised $20 million in the first quarter of the year and has promised to spend $250 million on ads supporting Biden.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nOne notable donor to Biden's effort was David Ellison, the CEO of Skydance Media, who gave the maximum of $929,600 to the Biden Victory Fund in the first quarter. David Ellison is the son of Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, who has backed Trump in previous cycles and donated millions of dollars in the 2024 cycle to committees that were supporting South Carolina GOP Sen. Tim Scott when he ran unsuccessfully for the GOP nomination.\nAdvertisement\nBy comparison, the Trump campaign and the RNC said they raised $65.6 million in March and ended the month with about $93 million in cash. Trump is raising money jointly with the Republican National Committee after his contested primary race for the GOP nomination, and has immersed himself in the effort to close the gap with Democrats in recent months. Trump's new joint fundraising committee with the RNC, Trump 47 Committee, brought in $23.6 million, and nearly all of it in the month of March.\nPrior to a Palm Beach fundraiser this month that the Republican National Committee said raised more than $50.5 million, Trump held frequent calls with donors and kept close tabs on which donors had written a check for the maximum of more than $800,000. The money from those checks is divided among Trump's campaign, Save America, the RNC and more than three dozen state party committees.\nTrump's fundraising efforts appear to be paying off. The Trump 47 committee collected checks totaling more than $800,000 from Robert Mercer, the billionaire hedge fund magnate; Linda McMahon, the former professional wrestling executive who served as Trump's head of the Small Business Association; Casino mogul Phil Ruffin; Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, and his wife Suzanne; and Joe Ricketts, who is the founder of TD Ameritrade.\nThe Trump 47 committee collected checks totaling more than $800,000 from Robert Mercer, the billionaire hedge fund magnate; Linda McMahon, the former professional wrestling executive who served as Trump's head of the Small Business Association; Casino mogul Phil Ruffin; Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, and his wife Suzanne; and Joe Ricketts, who is the founder of TD Ameritrade.\nSenate GOP self-funded candidates spend big\nThough some Democratic incumbents posted an impressive total in hotly contested Senate races, Republicans have fielded several wealthy candidates who can fund their own campaigns including Tim Sheehy in Montana and Eric Hovde in Wisconsin, both of whom are backed by Trump.\nAdvertisement\nHovde, a banking executive who is challenging Baldwin, reported Monday that he had raised $9 million in the first quarter of this year \u2014 including $8 million that he loaned to himself. At the end of March, he reported $5.35 million in cash to Baldwin's more than $10 million. Baldwin raised $5.4 million over the first three months of the year and spent $3.1 million.\nTim Sheehy, the former Navy SEAL challenging Tester in Montana, loaned another $500,000 to his Senate campaign \u2014 bringing the total that he has loaned to his campaign to $1.45 million so far this cycle. The Republican candidate, who owns an aerial firefighting business, has been at the center of controversy in the Montana race after The Washington Post detailed the inconsistent accounts he has given over the years about his war wounds.\nSheehy reported $1.9 million in cash on hand at the end of the third quarter after raising $3 million and spending about $2.4 million. The Montanans for Tester reported raising $8 million during the quarter; spending $6.4 million and ending the three month period with about $12.6 million in cash on hand.\nMegadonors make a play in key Senate races\nKen Griffin, one of the biggest donors to the Republican Party who ultimately put money behind the super PAC supporting Nikki Haley in her battle against Trump, is turning his attention to Senate and House races.\nAdvertisement\nGriffin donated $10 million to newly formed super PAC, Maryland's Future, at a moment when former governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, is making a play for the Senate seat in a blue state.\nHogan upended the race when he made a surprise entrance earlier this year, and a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released in March showed him leading his Democratic rivals by double-digits. Several Democrats \u2014 including Rep. David Trone (D-Md.) and Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks \u2014 (D) are facing off in the May 14 primary for the seat that is being vacated by retiring Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.). Trone loaned his campaign another $18.5 million in the first quarter and reported less than a $1 million in cash.

On Wednesday, Trump issued a social media post calling it the '2nd Worst Venue in the Country.'\nTo fight back against what he says is an inherently unfair jury pool, Trump's defense team hired a jury consulting firm that is analyzing all posts from jurors, according to the person, who declined to identify the firm.\nThat is not a particularly novel strategy among wealthier defendants who can afford to pay for such work, but it is unique in that it is being applied in a case involving Trump, someone about whom millions of Americans have gossiped, joked, criticized and praised for years \u2014 meaning there is far more potential social media material for his lawyers to seize on.\nin a case involving Trump, someone about whom millions of Americans have gossiped, joked, criticized and praised for years \u2014 meaning there is far more potential social media material for his lawyers to seize on.\nAdvertisement\nBut that work exploring the social media posts of potential jurors is happening under tremendous time pressure.\nNew York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan has been focused on moving jury selection along quickly \u2014 seven jurors were sworn in after less than a day and a half of jury selection earlier this week. Ultimately, the process will select 12 jurors and six alternates.\n'We had to rush to get all the research done and will have to rush again' on Thursday, when jury selection resumes, said one person familiar with the effort.\nThat digging is made more difficult by the fact that Manhattan has so many people, meaning it is more difficult to ensure they are reviewing posts from the right person with any given name. In addition, any one person might use multiple social media accounts under nicknames or pseudonyms.\nAdvertisement\nThe jury in this case is partly anonymous \u2014 their names are known to the lawyers in the case but will not be made public.\nSome on the defense team wonder if, now that they showed their tactic in open court, some prospective jurors will start deleting old online posts before court resumes Thursday, this person said.\nTrump spokesman Steven Cheung said the charges against the former president were unfair and deliberately filed in jurisdictions that are most hostile to him.\n'The deck has been stacked against President Trump in a gross abuse of our legal system, wherein his persecutors have deliberately targeted some of the most Democrat-heavy jurisdictions in the country to bring forth their bogus cases,' Cheung said.\nTrump's defense team used old social media posts to argue against the person in the very first seat of the jury box.\nAdvertisement\nBlanche said that woman 'has a series of extraordinarily hostile Facebook posts.'\nMerchan appeared confused by Blanche's assessment. The post at issue was a video on Facebook of a spontaneous street celebration for Joe Biden's 2020 election victory, with comments suggesting she was also happy about the result.\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass called the claim 'ridiculous.'\nQuestioned about it in court, the woman explained that she found herself witnessing a historic event near her home when she left the house to move her car that day, and she emphasized that she knew she could still be a fair juror.\nIf Merchan decides a person would not be fair and impartial, he can excuse any prospective juror. Otherwise, if either side objects, they too can strike some jurors from the panel \u2014 but each side only gets 10 so-called peremptory challenges.\nAdvertisement\nIn the matter of the prospective juror's old Facebook video, the judge refused to dismiss her for cause, so Blanche used one of Trump's challenges to dismiss her. The back-and-forth made it clear the defense was scrambling, even as his lawyers argued in court, to do quick searches on the people who seemed most likely to be chosen as jurors from a larger pool that had been summoned for jury duty.\nTrump's defense team has taken the position that old critical or mocking online statements about him are evidence of bias and grounds for removal. Steinglass argued that in many instances, the age of the posts alone may make them largely irrelevant, not to mention that some of those raised in court appeared to be internet humor.\nOn Tuesday, Merchan's judgment on the social media hewed closer to the prosecutors, but he did agree with the defense that one old comment crossed the line.\nAdvertisement\nIn that instance, the prospective juror years ago had written 'lock him up' in reference to Trump, who was president at the time.\n'Everyone knows that if Mr. Trump is found guilty in this case, he faces a potential jail sentence, which would be \u2018lock up,'' Merchan said. 'I don't think that I can allow this juror to remain.'\nAt Merchan's mention of the possibility of jail, Trump shook his head slightly in disgust.\nSo far, the judge has been mostly skeptical of the defense claims of dangerous bias exhibited by old social media posts.\nJurors questioned in court about their old social media posts were often defensive and dismissive of the suggestion that the old posts revealed anything important about their views or ability to be fair.\n'If you look at my social media, you can see there is very little on there that I post now that has anything to do with politics, it got too vitriolic for people, people that I knew for years,' said one woman who had posted political parody and humor items in 2018 that the defense said showed she was anti-Trump. 'I may have posted this, but I learned a good lesson from it.'\nAdvertisement\nIf the judge continues to disagree with the defense's arguments about most of the jurors' social media posts, Trump could burn through his allotted number of challenges quickly and be left with little say over the remaining members of the panel. Trump is also allowed two peremptory challenges for every alternate juror.\nIn court Tuesday, Blanche suggested he might make future challenges to juror selections based on additional discoveries of social media posts related to his client.\nMerchan said the pace of jury selection means opening statements could take place Monday, and if that schedule holds, Trump's online researchers have only a few days more to try to influence the makeup of the jury.\nIncreasingly, courts have had to wrestle with problematic social media posts that came to light only after a jury is seated or after a verdict has been rendered.\nAdvertisement\nThat was the case in the prosecution of longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone, who tried to get his conviction for lying to Congress dismissed after finding out that the forewoman of his jury had posted on social media about his arrest and posted again shortly after his conviction.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Shayna Jacobs,Devlin Barrett,Josh Dawsey","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2RSPX5RAGN5I7RISW3LRG6BBOE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.2629952,"_id":"312bb89b916b04c5d934f0b3a9bba9b8"},{"title":"Seven jurors picked in Trump's N.Y. trial as judge presses ahead","author":"Devlin Barrett","published_date":"2024-04-16 21:53:24","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/16/trump-new-york-criminal-trial-hush-money","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The New York Supreme Court justice overseeing former president Donald Trump's criminal trial said opening statements could begin as soon as Monday","summary":"NEW YORK \u2014 The judge overseeing former president Donald Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan said opening statements could begin as soon as Monday, as the jury selection process sped up and Trump got an earful from the people who might soon decide his fate.\nLawyers for Trump repeatedly argued that old social media posts by many of the prospective jurors or their friends showed that they were not being forthcoming about their animosity toward him, while prosecutors argued that old dumb jokes on the internet were not a cause to dismiss someone from the panel.\nTrump, the likely Republican nominee for president in the November election, spent hours Tuesday listening to potential jurors offer their opinions of him \u2014 some blunt, some guarded, and some just funny.\nBy the end of the day, seven people had been sworn in as jurors \u2014 more than a third of the total number of people that will be needed to hold a trial with a full jury and six alternates.\nAdvertisement\nIf New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan can stick to that pace, the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president will be fully underway in less than a week \u2014 a potential turning point for Trump's campaign to return to the White House.\nTrump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records.

'You can't judge him because he speaks his mind.'\nPressed by Trump lawyer Todd Blanche on what she thought of Trump's outspoken nature, she laughed and said, 'Come on, what can you say about that? If I told you all the time what I thought about people \u2014 I want to say some things to people but my mama said be nice.'\nBlanche questioned the prospective juror as the selection process began focusing more closely on each potential panelist's views about him. Trump's defense team is worried about trying to assemble a jury from heavily Democratic Manhattan, where he is unpopular.\nMany potential jurors who made it through the initial screening insisted that they could be fair, and some of them openly resisted stating what their political views were, despite being pressed repeatedly by Blanche.\nAdvertisement\nOne potential juror questioned Tuesday said he was originally from Mexico but took an oath to become a U.S. citizen in 2017 \u2014 the same year Trump was sworn into office.

'I'm very grateful to be an American and that happened on the first year that he was president.'\nAnother prospective juror, a woman with black glasses, became animated discussing how Trump, like any criminal defendant, has a right not to testify if he doesn't want to.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'If he decides not to speak \u2026 that's your right, you can't presume that makes him guilty,' she said, waving her hand for emphasis.

Trump lost his court battle on his unlawful travel ban!!!' New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan said that if the juror had stopped there, there would not be a problem, but the post went on to say: 'Get him out, and lock him up.' The judge dismissed that potential juror for cause \u2014 one of two jurors the judge decided Tuesday afternoon should not be on the panel.\nAnother woman in the jury pool was asked about a video she posted to social media after the 2020 election, which showed people in upper Manhattan celebrating the results.\nwas asked about a video she posted to social media after the 2020 election, which showed people in upper Manhattan celebrating the results.\nAdvertisement\nThe juror said she happened to see the celebrations while parking her car, and recorded it for posterity, and did not believe it would affect her judgment in the case.\n'Regardless of my thoughts about anyone or anything or political feelings or convictions,' she said, 'the job of a juror is to understand the facts of a trial and to be the judge of those facts.'\nBlanche argued she should be dismissed for cause, calling her Facebook posts 'extraordinarily hostile,' but the judge disagreed, saying she had provided what he believed was a reasonable explanation.\nThe defense challenged a potential juror from the Upper West Side over online posts made or shared by her husband in 2016, including one that had a theme of the comic book heroes the Avengers uniting against Trump.\nover online posts made or shared by her husband in 2016, including one that had a theme of the comic book heroes the Avengers uniting against Trump.\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass argued that Trump's lawyers were making too much of old social media posts.

'If this is the worst thing that you're able to find about this juror,' Merchan said, it gave him more confidence in her ability to be fair and impartial.\nOne potential juror questioned about her social media posts said they were years old and she had stopped posting about politics.\n'It got too vitriolic for me,' she said.

It was a campaign stop, alerted to the press in advance and summarized in a news release afterward. And despite insistences from Trump and his allies that having to attend the trial is an encumbrance designed to keep him off the campaign trail, the bodega visit was a good reminder that there's still plenty of time in the week for Trump to campaign.\nEspecially when one campaigns the way Trump does.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nLet's consider April and May of his previous two presidential campaigns.\nIn 2020, he held precisely zero campaign rallies \u2014 not because he didn't want to but because the pandemic was still new and his approach to it was still somewhat cautious. It is admittedly unfair, though, to suggest that he could have kept up his 2020 schedule had he been on trial at that point (although he could).\nIn 2016, his calendar was busier. He held 44 rallies during those two months \u2014 but they were also months in which he was forcefully contesting the Republican nomination! Even so, only about half those rallies fell on weekdays when Trump would have been required to be in the courtroom in 2024. (The judge in the Manhattan case has blocked off Wednesdays to tend to other work.)\nNotice what happened when he functionally secured the nomination in early May, though, after Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and former Ohio governor John Kasich dropped out: His schedule evaporated. He wasn't really campaigning in May anyway.\nAdvertisement\nPut another way: Trump has never held presidential campaign rallies in the middle of May.\nThose rallies, incidentally, were often of the fly in, speak and leave variety. In 2020, these were the centerpiece of his campaigning efforts: landing at an airport and holding a rally on the tarmac. That style of rally was covid-friendly, at least more than arena rallies, and it let him spend relatively little time on the ground.\nThat approach could work well this year, too. You can get from the courthouse to the helipad at South Street Seaport in about 20 minutes. It's a half-hour to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York by helicopter and then, say, two hours to Detroit. Another half-hour of driving and you could have an 8:30 p.m. rally in Michigan even if court doesn't get out until 5 p.m.\nCampaigning isn't just rallies, of course. A candidate's time must also be spent in strategy meetings and fundraising, things that Trump will not do while he's otherwise engaged on the 15th floor of the criminal court building. If the legal and campaign schedule is too exhausting, perhaps he will need to adjust the amount of time he spends outside of the courtroom on Truth Social posting disparaging comments and reposting news articles. (This used to be called 'executive time.')\nAdvertisement\nThe focus of complaints this week, though, hasn't been the interruption to his campaign but, instead, that he might not get to attend son Barron's upcoming high school graduation. It will be held on a Thursday, requiring that Trump get approval from the court to attend. His allies have moaned loudly that Trump can't go; in reality, the judge indicated he might be amenable to allowing him to do so.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Philip Bump,National Columnist","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C4GPGB44W7EKWV6BI6NQKA2GPM_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.2439184,"_id":"752609b56ba5544ee0f8d4c4365c1b3b"},{"title":"How Trump has become angrier and more isolated on Truth Social","author":"Derek Hawkins","published_date":"2024-04-22 09:00:54","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2024/trump-truth-social-posts","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Here on his company's social network Trump is offering followers an intimate view of what his second term could look like: isolated, vitriolic and vengeful.","summary":"One of the worst Senators in the United States Senate is, without question, Bill Cassidy, A TOTAL FLAKE, Republican though he may be.

He has traded combative tweets for even more belligerent screeds. Diatribes against his perceived enemies have drawn gag orders from judges in multiple cases. His media diet has become almost exclusively right-wing. And above all, he persists in spreading lies about his 2020 election loss, deep into his campaign for another term.\nhas become almost exclusively right-wing. And above all, he persists in spreading lies about his 2020 election loss, deep into his campaign for another term. Here on his company's social network, the former president's increasingly confrontational posting keeps his most ardent followers primed for action, helps him raise money and provides daily fodder for a media sphere that exists largely to amplify him. And he has reason to believe his efforts are paying off: Polling shows that Trump has convinced as many as 70 percent of Republicans that Biden won the 2020 election because of voter fraud.\nFew Americans hang out in this corner of the internet. Truth Social's most popular account, Trump's, has a fraction of the following he boasts on Twitter.\nTrump has about 6 million followers on Truth and 87 million on Twitter\nTWITTER\n87.3 million followers\nEach circle\nrepresents\n1 million\nfollowers\nTRUTH SOCIAL\n6.7 million\nData as of March 15\nTWITTER\nTRUTH SOCIAL\n87.3 million followers\n6.7 million\nEach circle represents\n1 million followers\nData as of March 15\nBut it's here that Trump \u2014 who reshaped campaigning and the presidency with his use of social media \u2014 offers an intimate view of what his second term could look like: isolated, vitriolic and vengeful.\nThe Washington Post analyzed all of Trump's online posts from the official launches of his presidential campaigns in 2016 and 2024 to show how his social media use has changed from his first presidential run.\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nMany of Trump's Truth Social posts in this story contain falsehoods, misleading statements or baseless claims.

Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung, in response to a request for comment from The Post, said that 'President Trump uses Truth Social \u2014 which is as hot as a pistol \u2014 to speak truth to power and get his message out unfiltered.'\nOn a typical day, Trump's feed is a flurry of polls and links interspersed with a drumbeat of attacks and dire warnings about the state of the country:\nA snapshot of Trump's Truth Social feed on April 2, 2024\nA snapshot of Trump's Truth Social feed on April 2, 2024\nDonald J.

I just posted a $175,000,000 Bond just for the right to Appeal this travesty of a case, which I won at the Appellate Division, but this Judge refuses to accept- A FIRST. He is a whacked out nut job who just made up a number out of thin air, just like he did on the value of Mar-a-Lago. Businesses won't enter New York because of this decision, and many are fleeing. Think of it - I had to pay an enormous sum for the right to Appeal the ridiculous decision of a CROOKED Judge and A.G.

Observations on how Donald Trump is reacting. Tidbits on what testimony is causing jurors to scribble notes. 'Let me give you some quotes to make you feel like you're inside the courtroom,' MSNBC's Yasmin Vossoughian said before reading the reports of colleagues.\nTrump's hush money trial is illustrating the potency of live blogs as a news tool \u2014 by necessity.\nTelevision and text journalism are normally two very different mediums. Yet because New York state rules forbid camera coverage of trials and the former president's case has such high interest, blogs are emerging as the best way to communicate for both formats.\nPRESENTING LITTLE PIECES OF THE NEWS\nDuring opening arguments in the case on Monday, CNN used one-third of its television screen to display short printed updates of what was going on, written by its three journalists stationed at the Manhattan courthouse. MSNBC did something similar with onscreen 'chyrons' \u2014 superimposed text.\nAdvertisement\nTraditional outlets like The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Associated Press use news blogs regularly, experience that proved helpful Monday. While such blogs often supplement traditional television coverage of big events like the Academy Awards or election nights \u2014 it's known as a 'second-screen' experience \u2014 this time consumers had no other option.\nSome 140 reporters watched from the courtroom or via closed-circuit television in an overflow room, feeding news to editors.\nBlog dispatches sometimes felt like bits and pieces of a print story in development, like this from The Washington Post's Devlin Barrett: 'They disguised what the payments were,' (prosecutor Matthew) Colangelo said, speaking clearly and calmly with his hands in his suit pockets.'\nOthers try to set the scene: 'All 18 jurors are looking directly at the veteran prosecutor, who stands at a lectern in the middle of the courtroom about halfway between them and Trump,' wrote AP's Michael R. Sisak.\nAdvertisement\nThe New York Post \u2018s Kyle Schnitzer wrote that Trump attorney Todd Blanche wrapped up his opening statement with a hometown appeal, quoting him in saying, 'use your common sense, you're New Yorkers, that's why we are here.'\nANALYSIS AND DEBUNKING ARE ALSO STAPLES\nOther observances are more analytical or seek to correct the record.\nThe Post's Shayna Jacobs wrote that 'in opening statements, prosecutors focused heavily on the circumstantial evidence that they argue will help prove that Donald Trump paid off Stormy Daniels in 2016 to keep her from going public about an alleged encounter with Trump a decade before.'\nThe Times' Maggie Haberman wrote as Trump's attorney was delivering his opening statement that 'Blanche is trying to portray the the National Enquirer's practices as similar to how other news outlets operate, in terms of deciding when and how to publish a story. That is not correct.'\nAdvertisement\nFor CNN and MSNBC, which covered opening arguments more extensively Monday than Trump-friendly outlets Fox News Channel and Newsmax, there were some growing pains in getting used to the new form of storytelling.\nMSNBC used text less frequently, occasionally relying on the awkwardness of correspondents trying to search through notes for the latest quotes. 'Trump lawyer: Trump is not on the hook for what Cohen did,' read one MSNBC chyron. 'Trump lawyer: Nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,' read another.\nA handful of times, CNN's Jake Tapper interrupted speakers to read blog dispatches that viewers were also able to see for themselves on their screens.\nStill, the blog-like reports were often more helpful than on-screen analysts, particularly when they tried to predict what would take place next. One MSNBC pundit confidently predicted that Judge Juan Merchan would end the day's proceedings before a first witness was called and a CNN analyst said that first witness would wrap his testimony with a juicy revelation.\nNeither happened.\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David Bauder","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BMUFEVQA44I67DVMHHDNZNM6WU.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.2189336,"_id":"f9331c276f46a37ae9ba3f7690a9facb"},{"title":"An NPR veteran blasted NPR for its Russia coverage.

Stories on Trump-Russia, Hunter Biden and covid-19 have all suffered from acute NPRitis, he writes. And racial and identity considerations \u2014 as well as affinity groups \u2014 shape workplace culture.\nThe essay triggered a bona fide media drama that concluded on Wednesday with Berliner's resignation. On his way out, he delivered a parting shot at CEO Katherine Maher. 'I cannot work in a newsroom where I am disparaged by a new C.E.O. whose divisive views confirm the very problems at NPR I cite in my Free Press essay,' Berliner wrote on X.\nJust what had Maher done to deserve such a diss? She had published a statement pushing back against Berliner's essay: 'Questioning whether our people are serving our mission with integrity, based on little more than the recognition of their identity, is profoundly disrespectful, hurtful, and demeaning.' As NPR's own David Folkenflik reported, Berliner took exception to that commentary.\nAdvertisement\nWhich is to say, Berliner is now an expert in disparagement and umbrage. In his Free Press essay, he deplores his colleagues' 'advocacy' and alleges that it had 'veered toward efforts to damage or topple [Donald] Trump's presidency.'\nNow that is disparagement. Even in the rough-and-tumble world of journalism, slamming your colleagues for their published work \u2014 especially in another outlet \u2014 is a rare undertaking. As Berliner suggests in his essay, it was something of a last resort, considering that he had raised his concerns internally to little effect. He invited people to sample NPR's coverage and 'make their own judgment.'\nthat is disparagement. Even in the rough-and-tumble world of journalism, slamming your colleagues for their published work \u2014 especially in another outlet \u2014 is a rare undertaking. As Berliner suggests in his essay, it was something of a last resort, considering that he had raised his concerns internally to little effect. He invited people to sample NPR's coverage and 'make their own judgment.'\nInvitation accepted. Over the past several days, I have sifted through roughly three years' worth of NPR's coverage of Russiagate, the effort by federal investigators and the media to discover the truth about the Trump campaign's connections to Russia. Since NPR's alleged tilt on this story serves as Exhibit No. 1 in Berliner's onslaught \u2014 and since it's central to the claim that the network sought to topple Trump \u2014 I chose to limit my efforts to this portion of the essay.\nAdvertisement\nAnd what a portion it is! The NPR Russia-Trump coverage plume under fire from Berliner consists of thousands of articles, podcasts, segments and so on. Berliner links to one. His serious allegations, accordingly, are backed by scant evidence, if any at all. It's a lazy, summary approach to evaluating a large body of work \u2014 a feelings-based critique of the sort that passes for media reporting these days. Too often, essayists write their conclusory broadsides against this or that outlet, confident in the knowledge that their fellow ideological travelers will applaud no matter how threadbare the supporting material.\nFollow this author Erik Wemple 's opinions\nFollow this author\nErik Wemple\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nBerliner's opus was published by the Free Press, an outlet dedicated to covering stories 'ignored or misconstrued in the service of an ideological narrative' \u2014 and not by NPR, which requires infinitely greater substantiation for its media reporting, whether the crisis lies in its own newsroom or somewhere else.\nThe irony there: Berliner has edited many of the stories carrying the byline of Folkenflik, NPR's media correspondent. He knows better.\nAdvertisement\nHere's how Berliner supports his conclusions on NPR's Russia work: '[Rep. Adam] Schiff, who was the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, became NPR's guiding hand, its ever-present muse. By my count, NPR hosts interviewed Schiff 25 times about Trump and Russia. During many of those conversations, Schiff alluded to purported evidence of collusion. The Schiff talking points became the drumbeat of NPR news reports.'\nYes, Schiff is a recurring presence in the broadcasts. 'Like many broadcast news organizations, NPR interviewed Rep. Schiff often during the Trump administration, as he was a principal figure in the Russian interference investigation \u2014 a story we covered with caution and perspective,' says an NPR spokesperson in a statement. 'Rep. Schiff's perspective was only one element of our coverage of the Russian interference story, in no way did he commandeer the reporting of NPR.' According to the spokesperson, NPR did 900 interviews with congressional lawmakers between January 2017 and December 2019 \u2014 including Paul Ryan, Jim Jordan, Eric Swalwell and others.\nNumbers matter less than the content of those Schiff interviews, which tend toward procedural mishmash, recitation of previously reported revelations and the centrality of oversight. In this interview, Schiff says that if former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort cooperates with authorities, 'we could learn a lot more.' In this one, the congressman speaks to his committee's investigative imperatives: 'I think we need to use subpoenas, and we need to stand up and say, we're going to get the answers here.' In this one, Schiff is asked whether Trump gets 'especially agitated' when the topic turns to Russia. 'Well, absolutely,' he responds.\nAdvertisement\nIs this the prejudicial poison of which Berliner writes? We asked him to supply instances of in which Schiff's talking points suffused NPR's independent reporting. After several emails and a phone call, Berliner hasn't responded with supporting material.\nHad NPR wished to addle its lefty audience with suggestive reporting about Trump's alleged criminality regarding Russia, it had a tool at its disposal. The so-called Steele dossier, published in early January 2017 by BuzzFeed News, contained explosive allegations presented by a former British intelligence officer. Various news outlets and commentators bathed the dossier in credibility that it didn't deserve, as noted in an extensive thread by Drew Holden and a series in this space. Top offenders include McClatchy, which ran stories bolstering the dossier's claims that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen had traveled to Prague for collusive business; and dossier believer in chief Rachel Maddow of MSNBC, who cheered for the document throughout Russiagate.\nNPR's dossier work was by no means perfect. 'Fresh Air' host Terry Gross, for example, occasionally failed to properly smack down dossier boosters during interviews. Yet the outlet was careful to avoid McClatchy's 'scoops' on Cohen and otherwise to cordon off its descriptions of the dossier with police tape. 'NPR has never detailed the document because so much of it remains unproved,' reads a 2019 NPR story. The NPR spokesperson said in a statement: 'We were not able to find any examples of NPR corroborating unconfirmed elements of the Trump dossier.\"\nAdvertisement\nAs further evidence of his employer's errant ways, Berliner argues that after the Mueller report found 'no credible evidence of collusion, NPR's coverage was notably sparse. Russiagate quietly faded from our programming.' It's an immutable law of media physics, of course, that coverage peters out when a story comes to an end. Who, after all, is doing continuing coverage of Abscam these days?\nBut there's more flimsiness afoot here. Berliner's dismissal of Robert S. Mueller III's findings \u2014 technically misguided, because the special counsel's investigation didn't apply the 'concept of 'collusion'' in its work \u2014 leaves the impression that the media's pursuit of the various Russiagate strands was a fool's errand. In fact, journalists as well as official investigations documented a spreadsheet's worth of scandalous activity that didn't amount to an international conspiracy, in Mueller's view. Trump will have you believe that the absence of criminality signifies the absence of wrongdoing, a logical atrocity abetted by Berliner's essay.\ninvestigation didn't apply the 'concept of 'collusion'' in its work \u2014 leaves the impression that the media's pursuit of the various Russiagate strands was a fool's errand.

Trump will have you believe that the absence of criminality signifies the absence of wrongdoing, a logical atrocity abetted by Berliner's essay.\nDitching the nitty-gritty, Berliner's claim of an NPR campaign to 'topple' Trump grinds against the measured claims in NPR's day-to-day coverage. Examples abound. In this segment, NPR correspondents struggle to wrap their heads around the just-released Mueller report. In this one, NPR's Mary Louise Kelly interviews a former CIA official who presciently shoots down liberal fever dreams related to Russia and Trump. In this piece, published months before the Mueller report, an NPR editor argues that the Russia case is 'weakening' and even attributes an 'important kernel of truth' to the famous tweet by Trump citing 'No Smocking Gun \u2026 No Collusion.' This piece highlights Trump's point of view regarding the Mueller investigation. And this one bears the headline, 'Trumps Exult Following Reports Of No Phone Contact Ahead Of 2016 Russia Meeting.'\nAdvertisement\nFollowing the Russia experience, writes Berliner, NPR compounded its mistakes by moving on with 'no mea culpas, no self-reflection.' By all means, self-reflect \u2014 it's a good step for any news organization after a big story. Presumably, Berliner would have supplied various URLs for such a review, but he didn't share any with me. After skulking around in the NPR search box, I'd nominate the Gross interviews on the dossier and other pieces that faced challenges or turned out to be inconsistent with other reporting.\nWith his tendentious claims, however, Berliner doesn't merely overstep the paltry evidence in his piece. He positions his now-former workplace as a hive of ideologues driven by political outcomes instead of the facts \u2014 basically a left-wing analogue to Fox News. That salvo appeared to diminish his appeal as a newsroom collaborator.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Erik Wemple,Media Critic","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2L5BQLWZNEI63LV5H7JKYTCGBI_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.1857276,"_id":"06cb834bf913dd5178db8261539908c5"},{"title":"Pennsylvania race previews Democrats' plan to focus campaign on democracy","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-22 10:00:06","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/22/scott-perry-democrats-pennsylvania-primary-democracy","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The bid to oust Republican Rep. Scott Perry has centered on his involvement in Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.","summary":"CAMP HILL, Pa. \u2014 Democratic congressional candidate Mike O'Brien had only been knocking on doors in a leafy suburban neighborhood here for about 20 minutes when he came upon a house with a sign featuring his opponent's face in the window. He smiled.\n'WANTED for crimes against the CONSTITUTION,' the sign read. 'Scott Perry for Prison. Traitor. Insurrectionist. Criminal.'\n'That's one of the reasons why I'm running,' O'Brien, one of six Democrats vying to unseat Perry, a GOP congressman, told the couple who answered the door. 'You can't let Trump and Perry overthrow democracy under the guise of patriotism anymore.'\nIt's a message that Democrats, including President Biden, hope will resonate in places like Camp Hill, a middle-class suburb outside Pennsylvania's capital, Harrisburg. The area was once a Republican stronghold but has become more politically independent in recent years due to population growth and moderate Republicans alienated by Trump's norm-busting behavior.\nAdvertisement\nThe competitive Democratic primary here Tuesday offers a preview of how Democrats intend to make democracy a central issue in competitive races for seats such as Perry's, which could help determine control of the narrowly divided U.S. House. It also provides a glimpse of the case Biden will make in battleground states like Pennsylvania.\nBiden has said his reelection is above all else about preserving democracy, which he warns is under threat if Trump wins a second term. In his first campaign speech of 2024, on the day before the anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, Biden stood less than 100 miles from here in Valley Forge.\n'Whether democracy is still America's sacred cause is the most urgent question of our time, and it's what the 2024 election is all about,' he said.\nIt remains unclear whether voters will see it that way. Beyond the defense of democracy, Americans will be asked to weigh more tangible issues, including inflation, immigration and abortion. The age of the candidates \u2014 Biden is 81 and Trump is 77 \u2014 will also loom large in a presidential rematch that polls show many Americans didn't want.\nAdvertisement\nBut there's also reason to believe democracy as an issue will carry more weight than it did four years ago. This is the first presidential vote since Trump and his allies spread false claims about the 2020 election results, a violent mob besieged the U.S. Capitol to stop the certification of Biden's victory and Trump declared that he would be a 'dictator' \u2014 if only on 'day one' of his second term.\nSince the 2020 vote, there has been additional evidence that campaigns built on the defense of democracy can resonate in the Trump era. In his campaign for governor in 2022, Democrat Josh Shapiro eviscerated Republican Doug Mastriano, who played a key role in the effort to challenge Biden's win in Pennsylvania and paid to bus Trump supporters to Washington for the 'Stop the Steal' rally on Jan. 6. Shapiro ultimately beat Mastriano by 15 percentage points.\nDemocrats say a similar pitch will work in the 10th Congressional District race against Perry, who was a key liaison between House Republicans and the White House in efforts to overturn the election.\nAdvertisement\nThe House select committee investigating Jan. 6 found that Perry took part in White House meetings where strategies to try to undermine the transfer of power were discussed. He also pressed the Justice Department to investigate wild and unfounded claims that military satellites had been used to flip votes from Trump to Biden. After Trump supporters attacked the Capitol, Perry formally objected to the counting of Pennsylvania's electoral votes.\nIn 2022, the FBI seized Perry's cellphone as part of its investigation into attempts to thwart certification of the 2020 election. The Jan. 6 committee subpoenaed the congressman to testify, but he refused. He later denied assertions by former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson that he had asked for a preemptive pardon.\nNationally, Democrats see Perry, who is running for his seventh term in Congress, as one of their best shots at toppling a prominent election denier and are expected to invest heavily in trying to flip the seat.\nAdvertisement\nWhile most Republicans who voted against certifying the 2020 results represent safe red districts, Perry's district is more of a bellwether. Under the boundaries of the 10th District, Trump would have won by four percentage points over Biden. Shapiro won the district by 12 percentage points in 2020, while Perry won reelection by eight points. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the district 'lean Republican.'\nDemocrats say they can beat Perry this time with a stronger candidate and a more targeted message tying the congressman to extremism and Jan. 6, as Shapiro successfully did against Mastriano. Perry's campaign said it sees that as a fantasy.\n'They say insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result. Democrats tried and failed to make the events that followed the 2020 election an issue in the 2022 midterm elections. Congressman Perry earned reelection in 2022 by an even larger margin than he did in 2020 because the voters of south-central Pennsylvania know he is fighting for them each and every day,' said Matt Beynon, spokesman for the Perry campaign.\nSome public polling suggests that Democrats are significantly more worried about threats to democracy than other voters. A USA Today-Suffolk poll conducted in March asked respondents to choose the issue most important to them in their presidential vote. Among Democrats, 44 percent said threats to democracy were their top issue versus 20 percent of independents and 6 percent of Republicans. For Democrats, no other issue came close.\nA Washington Post-Schar School poll also conducted in March found that a majority of Americans were very or extremely worried about threats to democracy in the United States, including 58 percent of Democrats and 47 percent of Republicans.\nAdvertisement\nStephen Medvic, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College, said democracy is clearly a factor for voters in the Democratic primary. But he said he's skeptical of its power to move swing voters in the general election against Perry.\nThe Democratic nominee, he said, will have to 'connect a bunch of dots that this candidate had a role, and that Jan. 6 was a real threat and going forward that Trump and Perry would continue to put democracy at risk.'\nDemocrats are getting some help on that front from anti-Trump Republicans. A new group, Republicans Against Perry, placed a billboard this month on a major interstate through the district. The ad shows photos of Mastriano and Perry, both with red Xs over their faces.\nCraig Snyder, who served as chief of staff to then-Republican Sen. Arlen Specter, started the group and said he's received thousands of inquires from people who want to be involved.\nAdvertisement\n'When you look at the responses we've had, the people wanting to come to events, it's enough Republicans in the district to form a pro-democracy coalition,' he said.\nFirst, Democrats need to pick a candidate to run against Perry.\nO'Brien, a 42-year-old retired TOPGUN fighter pilot, said voters are most enthusiastic when he alleges that Perry, who is also a veteran, violated his oath of office to uphold the Constitution by siding with Trump after the 2020 election.\nAs O'Brien knocked on doors in the district one recent day, a couple in their 80s told him that they were deciding between him and Janelle Stelson, a longtime local TV news anchor whose name recognition has made her the presumptive front-runner in the race. O'Brien told them that his message is 'very focused on democracy and making sure that Trump and Perry aren't in a position to overthrow it again.'\nAdvertisement\nThe couple said they had long been registered Republican but recently became Democrats because of their deep aversion to Trump. Electing him again, Kathy Vollmer, 83, said, 'would be like vindicating him.' Her husband, Phil Vollmer, 85, chimed in, saying, 'Perry's an idiot. Trump is dangerous.'\nStelson was also a longtime registered Republican but switched to become a Democrat in January 2023. If she can convince traditional Democrats to vote for her in the primary, she said she thinks her past political affiliation will help her win over the independents and Republicans needed to beat Perry.\nWalking through a suburban neighborhood in York County one recent day, Stelson said Perry's role in Jan. 6 is part of her message. 'He tried to overturn all of our votes,' she said.\nBut she's also focusing heavily on reproductive rights and Perry's support for legislation that would make it federal law that life begins at conception.\nAdvertisement\nHours before the last debate of the primary, O'Brien went to get a fade at the barbershop in Harrisburg he frequents. Inside, over the low hum of razors, he debated politics with owner Johnny Butler, a registered Democrat who said he has backed Trump because he finds the former president to be authentic \u2014 even if he's lying.\nButler said issues such as inflation are on his mind as he makes his choices for 2024. Asked if he was worried that Trump would attempt to subvert democracy, Butler said that 'it's impossible' because of the Constitution.\nLater that night, Butler was in the debate's audience to support O'Brien, who was the only candidate on the stage to mention democracy in his opening and closing remarks. In their questions, the moderators didn't bring it up.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RI55GNNQKO7TPZMXWE3PN6OTME_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.17325,"_id":"4f48d25ab8bbe695615cddb093db1856"},{"title":"Trump's legal bills drain millions more from his political committees","author":"Maeve Reston","published_date":"2024-04-21 01:17:42","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/20/trump-legal-bills-fundraising-reports","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The former president's legal bills account for more than a quarter of the spending by his political committees in March, new campaign finance filings show.","summary":"Donald Trump is picking up his fundraising pace even as he fights criminal charges in four cases and appeals a nearly half-billion dollar civil fraud judgment against him in New York. But his legal expenses continue to be a tremendous burden on his campaign and its allied groups, the latest campaign finance records show, accounting for 26 percent of the spending in March by his political committees.\nNew Federal Election Commission filings released Saturday show that Save America leadership PAC, a Trump-aligned group he has used to pay some of his lawyers, took in $5 million during March and racked up $4.6 million in legal bills for Trump and some of his associates. Throughout this election cycle, Save America has spent the most on legal bills among the groups in Trump's orbit.\nTrump's political committees have spent at least $16.7 million on legal bills so far this year, and owe another $900,000 to various firms as of the end of March, bringing his overall legal fees since starting his campaign to around $86 million.\nAdvertisement\nThose costs have continued to siphon money away from the main super PAC supporting Trump, MAGA Inc., which agreed to refund $60 million to Save America last year. They transferred $52.25 million in 'contribution refunds' back to the leadership PAC in 12 installments that began last May. MAGA Inc. made another transfer of $5 million back to the leadership PAC in March, accounting for almost all of Save America's money flowing in, new reports show.\nFEC reports do not require candidates or their leadership PACs to disclose what legal matters each lawyer or law firm handled when they report payments to those firms.\nStill, there are signs that Trump's efforts to portray his legal troubles as unjust attacks are convincing grass-roots donors to keep giving to his campaign. The FEC data show that at one key moment in the civil fraud case, for example \u2014 March 22, when he was being asked to post a bond of several hundred-million dollars to keep New York authorities from seizing his assets \u2014 donations to his campaign spiked. A New York appeals court panel later said that former president Donald Trump would be allowed to post a reduced bond of $175 million.\nAdvertisement\nOn March 22, Trump wrote an all-caps post on his Truth Social platform claiming that he had almost $500 million in cash, 'a substantial amount of which I intended to use in my campaign for president.' He claimed in the post that the judge in the case was trying to take that money away from him. (Trump's attorneys had said in a March 18 court filing that he was unable to finance an appeal bond of more than $450 million to cover the judgment in the business fraud case.)\nIt was his best fundraising day since his mug shot was taken in Fulton County, Ga., in August. In the last half of March, after clinching the Republican nomination, Trump has averaged over $1.2 million a day via the online fundraising platform WinRed.\nCampaign finance records filed this week show that the joint Trump fundraising effort with the Republican National Committee is raking in big checks, with key donors giving the maximum of more than $800,000. But the GOP nominee's available cash at the end of March still trailed far behind what Biden and allied Democratic groups had stashed.\nAdvertisement\nHere are some other key takeaways from the latest filings:\nA vice-presidential windfall for Kennedy\nNicole Shanahan's personal wealth was one of her chief assets when Robert F. Kennedy Jr. chose her as his running mate for his long-shot independent bid for the White House. FEC records show that Shanahan helped to replenish Kennedy's campaign treasury a day after joining the ticket on March 26 \u2014 donating $2 million to the campaign. The money is a much-needed infusion that could bolster Kennedy's efforts to get on the ballot in as many states as possible. As a candidate, Shanahan can donate an unlimited amount of money to the campaign.\nBefore joining the ticket, Shanahan had donated the maximum of $6,600 to Kennedy's campaign. Her venture firm, Planeta Management LLC gave $500,000 in July to Common Sense PAC, another outside group supporting Kennedy. Planeta Management LLC also gave $4 million in January to American Values 2024, a super PAC supporting Kennedy \u2014 money that helped pay for a pro-Kennedy ad during the Super Bowl.\nPlaneta Management LLC also gave $4 million in January to American Values 2024, a super PAC supporting Kennedy \u2014 money that helped pay for a pro-Kennedy ad during the Super Bowl.\nDemocrats tout financial advantage as they seek House control\nReports filed to the FEC this week showed the Democrats extending their fundraising advantage well beyond the presidential race to many key areas in the battle for control of the House and Senate.\nto many key areas in the battle for control of the House and Senate.\nAdvertisement\nThe Republican National Committee, which was struggling to raise cash throughout the GOP primary, doubled its cash on hand, ending March with $22 million in cash.

The GOP-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC reported that it had nearly $68.6 million in cash to spend on key races at the end of March, while the House Majority PAC reported $63.2 million in cash remaining at the end of the period in filings on Saturday.\nAdvertisement\nThough Senate Republicans are facing a much more favorable map and managed to recruit several wealthy contenders in key races, some of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents are amassing huge war chests. That group includes Sen. Jon Tester (Mont.), who had nearly $12.7 million in cash at the end of March; and Sen. Sherrod Brown (Ohio), who had nearly $16 million in cash at the end of the period.

Despite the subtle change since the paper's previous poll \u2014 a within-the-margin-of-error lead for Donald Trump narrowed \u2014 the release triggered a new round of discussion about the state of the presidential race. Specifically: why the poll shows that younger voters, a bastion of Democratic politics, are so supportive of the former president.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nIn 2020, Joe Biden won voters under the age of 30 by 24 points, according to Pew Research Center's comparison of polls to voter records. In the latest Times-Siena poll, though, voters under 30 prefer Biden by only 1 point. That the race is close is a function of older voters \u2014 those 65 and up \u2014 backing Biden by 9 points, despite preferring Trump by 4 points four years ago.\nSo what gives? Has there been a huge shift over the past four years? Is this a function of a very weird, repeat election?\nAdvertisement\nMaybe and maybe. But part of it probably comes down to who Siena's pollsters think are likely to vote.\nLet's first point out that this is one poll. Different polls conducted recently \u2014 including ones from YouGov (conducted for The Economist) and Ipsos (conducted for Reuters) \u2014 offer different assessments of these same groups. YouGov's poll, for example, also shows Trump with a 1-point lead, but gives Biden a wide advantage among younger voters and Trump a big advantage among older ones.\nThe results from the Ipsos poll, meanwhile, shows little variation. A slight Biden lead among registered voters at the younger end of the spectrum; a slight Biden lead at the older one.\nIpsos was generous to provide a number of different divisions of their results by age, one of which was particularly noteworthy. If we divvy up their respondent pool into three groups \u2014 under 35, 35 to 54 and 55 and up \u2014 we find that the Biden-Trump margin between the two is essentially equal. But the levels of support for each candidate increase as the age of the respondent pool increases. Among those under 35, Trump and Biden each get about 30 percent. For those 55 and up, they each get about 40 percent.\nsupport for each candidate increase as the age of the respondent pool increases. Among those under 35, Trump and Biden each get about 30 percent. For those 55 and up, they each get about 40 percent.\nThe difference comes in the percentage of each group that says they would vote for a different candidate or, more often, wouldn't vote at all. Within the youngest group, a fifth say they wouldn't vote for Biden or Trump. Within the oldest group, only 7 percent do.\nAdvertisement\nWriting for 538 last week, University of Pennsylvania political scientist Dan Hopkins pointed to research included in a recent Associated Press poll conducted by NORC. That poll found that support for Trump and Biden varied widely depending on how often respondents voted in recent elections. Among those who didn't vote in any of the last three federal elections \u2014 2018, 2020 and 2022 \u2014 Trump led by 18 points. Among those voted in all three, Biden led by 11 points.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThat pattern held among Black and White respondents, too, with only the most frequent Hispanic voters diverging in favor of Biden.\nThis is a good point at which to note that several of these characteristics overlap. Younger Americans are more likely to be Asian, Black or Hispanic than are older Americans. Young people are also more likely to be political independents, a group that generally votes less often and follows political news less closely.\nAdvertisement\nThe divide between politically active and non-politically active young people is, for example, probably one reason why recent Pew Research Center data looking at voter registration continues to show a broad Democratic advantage among young people while Gallup, looking at self-reported identity , sees a shrinking one. Which group better represents the November electorate?\nidentity, sees a shrinking one. Which group better represents the November electorate?\nThe Times-Siena results include both overall results and results among voters more likely to cast a vote. They didn't find much difference between the two groups by age; the margins among likely voters only shifted by a point or two. But it also depends on how the pollster identifies who's likely to vote. The importance of how pollsters look at the electorate was made obvious in a useful 2016 experiment \u2014 by the Times \u2014 where different pollsters offered different estimates of the presidential vote using the same pool of responses.\nIt's early. It's a weird election. There's a lot of hostility to Biden on the left, particularly among those only loosely tied to the Democratic Party. This probably makes it unusually hard to know which of those younger not-likely-to-vote voters actually won't and which might grudgingly (or even eventually excitedly) commit to one candidate or the other. Different pollsters will come to different conclusions about who might vote, and the results within age groups will differ accordingly. In each of the polls presented in this article, it's worth noting, the Biden-Trump contest is within the margin of error.\nAdvertisement\nBest to close with a reminder: The polls will remain close until Election Day, and small fluctuations probably tell us less than we might think. Big fluctuations, meanwhile, will probably prove to be smaller than anticipated.\nThe Times-Siena poll also triggered some discussion about generational divides in support for Trump and Biden. From the data shared by Ipsos, we offer this graph as a point of discussion and debate \u2014 and offer no further thoughts beyond those above.\nThe Times-Siena poll also triggered some discussion about generational divides in support for Trump and Biden.

Yet only a handful of observers are able to see or even hear what is going on.\nInstead, most of the nation is getting news of former President Donald Trump's hush money trial secondhand. Starting with preliminary motions and jury selection Monday, reporters in a Manhattan courtroom must convey what is being said to the outside world after the fact.\nThat's all because New York state law regarding media coverage of court proceedings is one of the most restrictive in the country. Last week's death of O.J. Simpson, whose murder trial beamed live from a California courtroom captivated a nation three decades ago, was a telling reminder of how New York is behind the times \u2014 or, at least, a holdout.\nWHY WON'T NEW YORK LET ME SEE IT?\nRegulations limiting media coverage in courtrooms date back nearly a century, when the spectacle of bright flashbulbs and camera operators standing on witness tables during the 1935 trial of the man accused of kidnapping and killing Charles Lindbergh's baby son horrified the legal community, according to a 2022 report by the New York-based Fund for Modern Courts.\nAdvertisement\nRules to enforce decorum spread nationally, amended to account for the invention of television, as defense lawyers worried that video coverage would harm their cases, the report said.\nYet an interest in open government chipped away at these laws and \u2014 slowly, carefully \u2014 video cameras began to be permitted in courts across the country, often at the discretion of judges presiding in individual cases.\nNew York allowed them, too, on an experimental basis between 1987 and 1997, but they were shut down. Lobbyists for defense lawyers remain strong in New York and hold particular sway among lawyers in the state Assembly, said Victor Kovner, a former New York City corporation counsel who advocates for open courtrooms.\nNew York and Louisiana are the only states remaining that completely restrict video coverage, the Fund for Modern Courts said.\nAdvertisement\nTo Kovner and others, that's outrageous.\n'We're the media capital of the world, we like to think, and the fact that cameras aren't permitted in one of our three branches of government is unacceptable,' said New York State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal, who has sponsored a bill to try to change that.\n'It's one of the most consequential trials of our modern age,' the senator said. 'I think the public has a right to see exactly what happens in that courtroom.'\nWAIT \u2014 I SAW A PICTURE OF TRUMP IN COURT AT THE TRIAL'S START\nThat's because the presiding judge, Juan M. Merchan, permitted a handful of still photographers to shoot photos of Trump before the day's proceedings started. Once court was called into session, courtroom sketch artists \u2014 a dying communications form \u2014 hold sway.\nThere is actually some video coverage of the trial, available on monitors in an overflow room adjacent to the main courtroom. It was packed Monday with reporters, court officers and a few members of the public, including Ron Sinibaldi, a former accountant from Long Island who lined up outside the courthouse before midnight for a seat.\nAdvertisement\n'I read presidential biographies,' Sinibaldi said. 'I go to presidential libraries. I'm here for the history.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nHOW CAN THOSE INVOLVED GET AROUND THE RESTRICTIONS?\nIn a hallway outside of the courtroom, a limited number of cameras and a small pool of reporters are positioned to capture remarks of anyone involved in the trial who want to address the outside world. That included Trump, even before the proceedings started.\nAbsent live coverage of the trial, how often the former president chooses to take advantage of those cameras and whether news organizations carry his remarks either live, taped or not at all will play a big role in how the case is perceived publicly.\nMSNBC carried his remarks live on Monday morning. 'They're trying to grab the narrative regardless of the outcome,' CNN reporter Phil Mattingly said of the Trump defense team.\nHOW ARE JOURNALISTS COVERING THE TRIAL HANDLING IT?\nWith some difficulty. CNN stationed a team on the streets of Manhattan outside the courtroom, where a truck festooned with pro-Trump flags frequently drove by, blaring horns and music from loudspeakers. Reporters sometimes struggled to be heard. 'It is kind of a circus down here,' CNN's Kaitlan Collins said.\nAdvertisement\nCommentators and experts, many of them with experience in jury selection, offered opinions from outside the courtroom or from studios. Fox News analyst Jonathan Turley said 'most cities, at least those outside of New York,' will see the case as a weaponization of criminal justice.\nWith estimates that jury selection could take two weeks, and no way of showing it, journalists will have a lot of time to fill unless they turn their attention elsewhere.\nWILL OTHER TRUMP CASES BE TELEVISED?\nGeorgia, where Trump faces charges of election meddling, gives judges discretion over whether to allow television cameras. Superior Court of Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee has said he will make all hearings and trials in that case available for broadcast. That has already included hearings on whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis would be allowed to argue the case.\nAdvertisement\nFederal courts do not allow cameras in criminal cases. Trump is facing separate federal cases for election interference and mishandling classified documents, although it is not clear when, or if, trials will take place.\nThe feds offer one glimmer of hope: The U.S. Supreme Court permits audio of oral arguments to be broadcast outside of the courtroom. But there's no indication that this would apply to Trump's case. New York's law does not allow audio coverage of his hush money trial.\nProponents of legislation to open up New York courts to electronic media coverage are hoping the attention paid to the Trump case may boost their proposals. The idea is being considered as part of current negotiations over the New York state budget so, theoretically, a new law could even affect the Trump trial if it is passed and goes into effect immediately.\nGiven New York state's history, it's best not to count on it.\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David Bauder","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.159918,"_id":"4dbecba6a6391a527368591bc0f56814"},{"title":"Live updates Opening arguments expected in Trump hush money trial","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-22 12:30:41","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/22/trump-hush-money-trial-live-updates","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Opening arguments are expected to take place Monday in Donald Trump's hush money trial in New York.","summary":"NEW YORK \u2014 Opening statements are expected Monday morning in Donald Trump's trial for allegedly falsifying business records to hide a hush money payment during the 2016 presidential election campaign.

That night, at his hotel, a group of similarly minded demonstrators banged drums, played loud music and used a loudspeaker until 12:15 a.m., yelling slogans including, 'Wake up, sleepy Joe!' and 'I am your nightmare, Biden!'\nAt a another site where Biden was speaking in Scranton, a very different group of demonstrators assembled, these backing Donald Trump. They held signs reading 'Joe Biden: You're Fired' and waved flags bearing the former president's name. Asked by a local news host about the proliferation of pro-Trump signs across Pennsylvania, Biden bristled: 'Well, you haven't been driving in the right places, pal. \u2026 He has no presence here.'\nHe has no presence here.'\nAt other times, Biden faced much friendlier terrain during his three - day swing through Pennsylvania, as large pro-Biden crowds materialized and supporters shouted, 'Four more years' or 'We love you, Joe.' One group held a sign reading 'Scranton Loves Joe!'\n-day swing through Pennsylvania, as large pro-Biden crowds materialized and supporters shouted, 'Four more years' or 'We love you, Joe.' One group held a sign reading 'Scranton Loves Joe!'\nAdvertisement\nThe question for Biden, as he throws himself in earnest into winning a state that means an enormous amount to him personally and politically, is how all these roiling sentiments will play out in November, in Pennsylvania and across the country. In many ways, Pennsylvania is a microcosm of the United States \u2014 a Democratic operative once famously described it as two metropolitan areas with Alabama in between \u2014 and strategists will be paying close attention to the state's Democratic and Republican primaries Tuesday for clues on which party has momentum.\n'Look, you're my ticket to the White House: you, Pennsylvania,' Biden told a group of campaign workers in Philadelphia on Thursday. 'No, it's not hyperbole. You're the ticket to the White House.'\nPolls show the race essentially tied between Biden and Trump, and both campaigns expect the state \u2014 which went for Trump by 0.72 percent in 2016 before swinging to Biden by 1.17 percent in 2020 \u2014 to come down to the wire in 2024.\nIn a recent memo on Pennsylvania, Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez stressed that Democrats have won statewide races there in 2018, 2020 and 2022, as voters turned sharply against Trump' policies from abortion to election denialism.\nAdvertisement\nBut Biden's visit highlighted his challenge as an incumbent at a time when many voters are worried about the economy and the country's direction, while others oppose his position on Gaza, and the nation overall is deeply polarized. Speaking to supporters in Scranton on Tuesday, Biden mused about the level of animus he has faced around the country.\n'I've never thought I'd see a time when I'm going through a neighborhood, or a rural town that's in the West, and see big signs that have a Trump sign in the middle that says \u2018F Biden,' and having a little kid standing with his middle finger \u2014 7 years old, 8 years old,' Biden said. 'Well, I promise, it happens all the time. It's not who we are.'\nDavid Urban, a Republican strategist who led Trump's successful effort to flip Pennsylvania in 2016, said his travels through the state have convinced him that Biden is struggling with its residents, many of whom blame him for the high cost of living and for policies they see as hostile to the local energy industry.\n'The current president is pushing a big rock up a hill, trying to convince people things aren't as bad as they are,' Urban said.\nLast week, Biden was pushing hard.\nAdvertisement\nHe unleashed a populist speech in Scranton. He embraced unions while addressing steelworkers in Pittsburgh. He made stops at Sheetz and Wawa, a nod to the hometown convenience stores whose respective merits are hotly debated, as well as to the kind of retail politicking aides say will be pivotal to helping the 81-year-old president connect with skeptical voters.\nAnd Biden ended his trip Thursday by visiting a majority-Black neighborhood in Philadelphia, where he accepted an endorsement from family members of his most prominent third-party rival, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nAs Biden's birthplace and the largest battleground state \u2014 home to a crucial 19 electoral college votes \u2014 Pennsylvania looms large in the president's personal and political backstory. It's a state both Democrats and Republicans view as crucial to victory, and it stands as a key a test of whether everyday Americans believe his performance as president warrants another term.\nAdvertisement\nThat's a big part of the reason Biden has spent so much time in Pennsylvania, which has the added benefit of being close to both Washington and his home state of Delaware.\nLike Biden, who has already traveled to the state a handful of times this year, Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has also prioritized Pennsylvania. His aides and allies see it as a central pillar in their push to knock down Democrats' venerated 'blue wall' of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2014 as Trump did in 2016 but not in 2020.\nWith a population of about 13 million consisting of large urban centers, fast-changing suburbs, millions of blue-collar workers and vast rural stretches, Pennsylvania reflects many of the trends upending the nation's political landscape. Since 1960, no Democrat has won the presidency without carrying the state.\nAdvertisement\nAt a recent rally ahead of his criminal trial in New York, Trump told a large crowd in Schnecksville, Pa., that Biden is responsible for high inflation, global instability and a general malaise hanging over the country.\n'All of America knows that the real blame for this nightmare lies with one person: Crooked Joe Biden,' Trump said. 'That's why the people of Pennsylvania are going to tell Crooked Joe, \u2018You're fired. Get out. You're fired.''\nBiden's swing through the state offered a glimpse at how he will respond to such attacks, as aides noted that he made a point of addressing several constituencies that helped propel him to the White House in 2020.\nOn Tuesday, the president visited his childhood home after giving a speech contrasting his view on taxes with that of Trump, saying he represents the scrappy values of Scranton while Trump reflects the money-focused morals of Mar-a-Lago in Florida. His pitch to the United Steelworkers union Wednesday featured a populist pledge to protect American industry from unfair foreign competition, including by tripling tariffs on Chinese-made steel if necessary. He also took a jab at Trump, joking that the former president \u2014 who was in New York facing a court trial \u2014 was 'busy right now.'\nAdvertisement\nHis speech at the Martin Luther King Jr. Recreation Center in Philadelphia on Thursday targeted the city's large population of Black voters. John White Jr., a former state representative and civil rights leader, introduced Biden by praising his record of boosting 'Black livelihoods,' and the president was accompanied around town by Mayor Cherelle Parker (D).\nThroughout the trip, Biden played up his personal connection to the state, where first lady Jill Biden grew up \u2014 she often mentions her attachment to Philadelphia sports teams \u2014 and where the Bidens had their first date. He talked about launching his 2020 campaign in Pittsburgh and turning to Philadelphians to bolster his Senate campaigns over the years. He said he had been dubbed Pennsylvania's 'third senator' because of how often he was on the news in Philadelphia, which shares a media market with his hometown of Wilmington.\nAt the same time, the Biden campaign unleashed a blitz of advertising targeting key groups in the state, including Black residents and Hispanic voters from Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, as well as a ramped-up ground operation aimed in part at holding down Trump's margins in rural and exurban parts of the state. The Trump campaign's on-the-ground presence is more limited than Biden's effort, which now includes more than a dozen offices and a mix of paid staff and volunteers.\nAdvertisement\nThat advantage in fundraising and campaign infrastructure will pay dividends for Biden down the road, said Brendan McPhillips, a senior campaign adviser who managed Biden's 2020 race in Pennsylvania and the successful campaign of Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) in 2022.\n'The gap is huge between what the president's campaign has been doing and is doing right now, versus Trump, who has come into the state once or twice for very brief visits,' McPhillips said, adding that the Biden campaign plans to open another dozen Pennsylvania offices, including in some Trump-friendly areas, in the coming months.\nBut for Trump's allies, the negative emotions sparked by Biden during his visit suggest he will struggle to hit his marks in the parts of the state where he needs a strong turnout to overcome Republicans' dominance in rural counties.\nAdvertisement\n'This '24 race feels way more like '16 than '20,' Urban said. 'The antipathy toward Biden \u2014 I won't say it's the same as it was toward Clinton, but it's definitely present.

Richard M. Nixon did not actually make that claim himself about the Vietnam War during the 1968 campaign. Instead, he made a vague promise to 'end the war and win the peace in the Pacific' and let voters imagine he knew how do that.\nNixon's strategy, as it turned out, consisted of going to Moscow and Beijing to win over North Vietnam's principal allies, while dropping hints that he was a 'madman' who was willing to use nuclear weapons if Hanoi did not stop fighting. To further increase the pressure on Hanoi, he stepped up bombing of North Vietnam and invaded Cambodia to clear out communist sanctuaries.\nNone of Nixon's machinations produced what he promised: 'peace with honor.' In 1973, he signed a peace treaty that pulled all remaining U.S. forces out of South Vietnam but allowed North Vietnam to keep between 140,000 and 300,000 of its own troops in the south. A little more than two years later, North Vietnam conquered South Vietnam. The south's fall demonstrated, for neither the first nor the last time, that the surest way to end any war is for one side to win and the other to lose.\nAdvertisement\nThat brings us to the 'very stable genius' and his current plans to end the war in Ukraine. If elected again, Trump claims he would end the war in 24 hours, but he has been cagey about how he would pull off this miraculous feat, supposedly so that he could maintain his flexibility to negotiate.\nFollow this author Max Boot 's opinions\nFollow this author\nMax Boot\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nHungary's authoritarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, proclaimed after meeting with Trump last month that the former president's formula was simple and cynical: 'He will not give a penny in the Ukraine-Russia war. Therefore, the war will end, because it is obvious that Ukraine cannot stand on its own feet.'\nTrump aides told The Post that Orban's statement, which sounded entirely plausible to me, was 'false,' even though Trump has not publicly contradicted it. The aides explained that the presumptive GOP nominee's actual plan is to push for 'Ukraine to cede Crimea and Donbas border region to Russia' in return for an end to the Russian invasion.\nAdvertisement\nIf that is Trump's plan, it is more preposterous than anything Nixon ever contemplated during the Vietnam War. It displays a witches' brew of arrogance, ignorance and defeatism.\nStart with the arrogance: Trump regards himself as the world's greatest dealmaker despite a long track record, going back at least to 1990 and his first casino bankruptcy, indicating the opposite. As president, he was very good at abrogating treaties \u2014 including the Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 but not very successful at negotiating new ones. He announced the Abraham Accords but did not personally negotiate them, as Jimmy Carter did with the Camp David Accords, and he renamed the North American Free Trade Agreement rather than truly renegotiating it. His summits with Kim Jong Un did not produce North Korean denuclearization; Pyongyang's weapons of mass destruction program is considerably more advanced now than it was when Trump and Kim met in Singapore in 2018.\nOf greatest relevance to the conflict in Ukraine was Trump's ill-fated attempt to negotiate an end to the war in Afghanistan. His 2020 deal with the Taliban was as one-sided as Nixon's Paris peace accords with the North Vietnamese: Trump's negotiators agreed to withdraw all U.S. troops within 14 months and free 5,000 Taliban prisoners. In return, the Taliban promised not to allow Afghanistan to become a haven for international terrorists. The Taliban was not required to stop fighting or reconcile with the Afghan government.\nAdvertisement\nOnce President Biden had finished pulling all U.S. forces out, the Taliban launched an offensive that led to its swift takeover of the entire country. Trump now calls the exit from Afghanistan the most 'embarrassing moment in the history of our country' and tries to blame it all on Biden, but he set the retreat in motion.\nThere is no reason to suppose Trump would have any greater success in ending the war in Ukraine without betraying U.S. allies. He seems to have fallen for Russian propaganda \u2014 which is prevalent on the MAGA right \u2014 suggesting that the war in Ukraine is a minor border dispute that can be easily resolved by handing over to Moscow the Russian-speaking regions it covets: Crimea and Donbas. But, even leaving aside the morality of sacrificing another country's territory to a brutal aggressor, there is no indication that Russian tyrant Vladimir Putin would be satisfied for long with only a small piece of Ukraine.\nThe current conflict began, after all, with a Russian blitzkrieg aimed at taking Kyiv. That war plan strongly suggests that Putin, who has repeatedly denied that Ukraine is a sovereign nation, wants to control all of Ukraine. Then, in September 2022, Putin annexed four provinces of Ukraine: Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Though Russian forces now control almost all of Luhansk, they occupy only parts of the other provinces. (I recently visited Kherson and met with its Ukrainian governor.) Donetsk is part of Donbas region along with Luhansk, so if Trump were to try to turn over Donbas to Putin, he would be ceding territory that Russia hasn't actually conquered. Is he even aware of these important details? Doubtful.\nAdvertisement\nYet even sacrificing Crimea and Donbas would be extremely unlikely to satisfy Putin's imperial ambitions. Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president who is now the deputy chairman of its Security Council, last month unveiled Moscow's own 'peace plan,' which calls for the unconditional surrender of Ukraine and its absorption into Russia. The Russian Orthodox Church, which is a handmaiden of the Putin regime, has declared the conflict in Ukraine a 'holy war.'\nEven if Putin promises to respect Ukrainian sovereignty as part of a peace deal, there is no reason to accept his assurances at face value. He has a long record of breaking promises and violating treaties, such as the 1994 Budapest Memorandum in which Russia joined with the United States and Britain to guarantee Ukraine's territorial integrity in return for Kyiv giving up its nuclear weapons. Putin likely would use any cease-fire to ready his forces for another major push on the Ukrainian capital.\nIt is possible, admittedly, that Putin might eventually abandon his maximalist objectives if he were convinced that his military forces were headed toward defeat. But Ukraine's counteroffensive last year failed, and Russia is now reportedly readying a major offensive that has the potential to break through Ukrainian lines. The defenders are running critically low on ammunition because Trump's allies in the House have been blocking the passage of aid to Ukraine. The top U.S. general in Europe warned last week that Russia's 5-to-1 advantage in artillery shells could soon become 10 to 1 if U.S. aid isn't forthcoming.\nAdvertisement","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Max Boot","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VQ7QSEBND5BHRB3MJJVCKLCBBI.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.0902042,"_id":"cb674d83c2d88ec6f26404db89701b27"},{"title":"Judge in Trump case orders media not to report where potential jurors work","author":"David Bauder","published_date":"2024-04-18 22:12:35","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/18/trump-hush-money-trial-media-jurors-anonymity/c277bad8-fdd0-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial has ordered the media not to report where potential jurors have worked","summary":"NEW YORK \u2014 The judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial ordered the media on Thursday not to report on where potential jurors have worked and to be careful about revealing information about those who will sit in judgment of the former president.\nJudge Juan Merchan acted after one juror was dismissed when she expressed concerns about being 'outed' for her role in the case after details about her became publicly known.\nThe actions pointed to the difficulties involved in trying to maintain anonymity for jurors in a case that has sparked wide interest and heated opinions, while lawyers need to sift through as much information as possible in a public courtroom to determine who to choose.\nDespite the setback, 12 jurors were seated by the end of Thursday for the historic trial over a $130,000 hush money payment shortly before the 2016 election to porn actor Stormy Daniels to prevent her from making public her claims of a sexual meeting with Trump years earlier. Trump has denied the encounter.\nAdvertisement\nThe dismissed juror told Merchan she had friends, colleagues and family members contacting her to ask whether she was on the case. 'I don't believe at this point I can be fair and unbiased and let the outside influences not affect my decision-making in the courtroom,' she said.\nMerchan directed reporters not to report it when potential jurors told the court their specific workplaces, past or present. That put journalists in the difficult position of not reporting something they heard in open court, and some media organizations were considering whether to protest having that onus placed on them.\nEven if that specific information wasn't released, there was some concern that enough information about potential jurors would get out that people might be able to identify them anyway.\nAs an example of what is getting out there, Politico on Thursday identified one potential juror as 'a woman who lives in Manhattan and works as an asset manager.' She grew up in England and Hong Kong and lives with a self-employed boyfriend.\nAdvertisement\nAnother potential juror was identified as 'an attorney for a large media company who lives in Gramercy Park.'\nOn Fox News Channel Wednesday night, host Jesse Watters did a segment with a jury consultant, revealing details about people who had been seated on the jury and questioning whether some were 'stealth liberals' who would be out to convict Trump.\n'This nurse scares me if I'm Trump,' he said. 'She's from the Upper East Side, master's degree, not married, no kids, lives with her fiance and gets her news from The New York Times and CNN.'\nBesides his order about employment history, Merchan said he was asking the media to 'simply apply common sense and refrain from writing about anything that has to do, for example, with physical descriptions.'\nHe said 'there was really no need' for the media to mention one widely-reported tidbit that a juror speaks with an Irish accent.\nAdvertisement\nAnonymous juries have long existed, particularly in terrorism and mob-related cases or when there is a history of jury tampering. They have been ordered more frequently in the last two decades with the rising influence of social media and the anonymous hate speech that is sometimes associated with it. Usually courtroom artists are told they aren't permitted to draw the face of any juror in their sketches; New York courts do not permit video coverage of trials.\nDuring the Trump defamation trial in Manhattan federal court earlier this year, jurors had heightened protection of their identities by a security-conscious judge who routinely did not allow anyone in his courtroom to have a cellphone, even if it was shut off. Jurors were driven to and from the courthouse by the U.S. Marshals Service and were sequestered from the public during trial breaks.\nWhen asked general questions about themselves during jury selection in that case, prospective jurors often gave vague answers that would have made it nearly impossible to determine much about them.\nAdvertisement\nAfter the ruling in that case, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan ordered the anonymous jury not to disclose the identities of any of the people they served with, and advised jurors not to disclose their service. So far, none have come forward publicly.\nNew York criminal defense lawyer Ron Kuby said New York state law requires trial attorneys be provided the names of jurors, even when they are otherwise anonymous. However, he said, the right can be overridden by the need to protect jurors' safety.\nAs for the media, he said the judge can't control what is reported but he can severely restrict what reporters see and hear if necessary.\n'There are actions the judge could take. Courts have extraordinary powers to protect jurors from tampering and intimidation. It is really where a court's power is at its peak,' Kuby said.\nAdvertisement\nHe said the ability of lawyers at Trump's trial to research the social media history of jurors was important.\n'Both sides have interest in preventing sleeper jurors who have their own agenda from serving on the jury,' he said.\nNeama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor who is president of the West Coast Trial Lawyers, said the difficulty at the Trump trial is weeding out people with extreme viewpoints.\n'Everyone in the entire country knows who Donald Trump is,' Rahmani said. 'Some think he's a criminal traitor and insurrectionist. Others think he's a hero. You don't have a lot of people in the middle.'\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Larry Neumeister,David Bauder","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XI55GVH52AI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.0821004,"_id":"6cf342c8fc7780dddbb6bb4a4a823393"},{"title":"Scranton vs. Mar-a-Lago: Biden turns sharply to populism","author":"Cleve R.

He even nodded to the visit in a speech that mixed his biography with his thoughts on tax policy.\n'Scranton is a place that climbs in your heart, and it never leaves,' Biden said. 'For me it was 2446 North Washington Avenue.'\nBut the trip was about more than sentiment during the first day of Biden's three-day swing through this pivotal battleground state. He leaned into populist anger against the rich and worries of a world weighted against the middle class as he sought to draw distinctions between himself and his likely Republican opponent in November, Donald Trump.\nAdvertisement\n'All I knew about people like Trump is that they looked down on us,' Biden told the crowd in his childhood town, contrasting his upbringing with Trump's frequent visits to his resort in Palm Beach, Fla. 'They wouldn't let us into their homes and their country clubs. When I look at the economy, I look at it through the eyes of Scranton, not through the eyes of Mar-a-Lago.'\nBiden will further stress that contrast Wednesday when he travels to Pittsburgh to address the United Steelworkers and unveil a raft of new trade protections for the steel industry. The president will call for a tripling of the 7.5 percent tariff on Chinese steel imports, as well as increased pressure to prevent China from shipping steel to America through Mexican ports.\nBiden will also call for an investigation of Chinese subsidies for its shipbuilding industry, following a petition from the United Steelworkers and four other unions last month.\nAdvertisement\nThe actions are just the latest sign of the president's determination to be seen as a defender of American workers like those in the steel industry, whose employees are spread across states in the industrial Midwest, the so-called 'blue wall' that could decide Biden's political fate in November.\nIn making the argument, he has leaned into his middle-class upbringing, including the years he spent in Scranton, which he portrays as a scrappy, working-class town. He argues that Trump, on the other hand, is a billionaire who lives in a gilded club in Florida and would bolster other billionaires, the very people who have had an unfair advantage for too long.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nHoning that point, Biden stressed that the richest Americans, and the companies they own, pay little or no taxes.\n'No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher,' he said, citing Trump as part of the problem.\nAdvertisement\nBiden in recent months has struck a populist tone in other ways. He has criticized big corporations for raising prices and imposing what he calls 'junk fees' \u2014 hidden costs that companies like banks and airlines tuck into their consumer prices.\nTrump and his supporters respond that Trump was by far the better president for working-class Americans and would be again \u2014 one who boosts the economy, fights illegal immigration, cuts taxes and slashes regulation. But the battle is also over who is more emotionally aligned with workers, as Trump stresses his cultural conservatism and Biden emphasizes his modest upbringing and ties to unions.\nPennsylvania, which is central to these battles, is a pivotal swing state that is expected to see frequent visits from both Trump and Biden before November's election. Trump won the state in 2016 but lost it by some 80,000 votes to Biden in 2020. After Biden's stop in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, he will travel to Philadelphia on Thursday.\nAdvertisement\nTrump is courting the same middle-class voters with his own brand of economic nationalism. The Republican has said that, if elected, he would impose an across-the-board tariff of 10 percent on all foreign products and a 60 percent levy on Chinese imports. Many economists say the move would stoke inflation.\nWhile Biden will talk international economic policy on Wednesday, Tuesday was about linking his biography to his politics.\n'We know that the best way to build an economy is from the middle out and the bottom up. \u2026 It's a stark contrast to my opponent,' Biden said in Scranton.

This might well be Trump's most inflationary and economically destructive idea yet. That's quite an achievement, considering everything else he and his advisers have cooked up (universal tariff hikes, deficit-financed tax cuts, huge reductions in the labor force, etc.).\nTrump's objective, Politico reports, is to boost U.S. exports and reduce imports. Basically, if a dollar buys, say, fewer euros or Japanese yen than it currently does, that makes U.S.-made products look a little cheaper and potentially more attractive to European and Japanese customers (among others). So, hey, maybe this could help some U.S. companies trying to sell products abroad.\nAdvertisement\nThat is, until you consider everything else that might happen if we deliberately tried to weaken our currency, which would open up a Pandora's shipping container of disastrous consequences.\nelse that might happen if we deliberately tried to weaken our currency, which would open up a Pandora's shipping container of disastrous consequences.\nFollow this author Catherine Rampell 's opinions\nFollow this author\nCatherine Rampell\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nIt's true the dollar is unusually strong right now, although probably not for reasons Trump is happy about. Exchange rates typically reflect a country's macroeconomic conditions (among other factors, such as interest rates). Thanks to a variety of factors \u2014 including our relatively limited exposure to the war in Ukraine \u2014 we're doing better than most of our peer countries. In the words of Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor and former International Monetary Fund chief economist, 'The U.S. economy has been on a tear.'\nThe relative strength of the dollar does make U.S.-made goods less attractive, though with so many other countries in or edging toward recession, our potential global customers might not be feeling terribly flush anyway. I suppose if Trump tanked the U.S. economy, whether on purpose or otherwise, that might achieve his objective of swiftly weakening the dollar and shrinking trade deficits.\nAdvertisement\nIf not via recession, how would Team Trump weaken our currency? That's not totally clear. He might try to force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. This is something Trump already wants to do for other reasons. (For instance, he owes a lot of debt, so lower rates would help his own finances.) Or maybe he would bully lots of other countries into raising their interest rates, which seems unlikely to happen. But if it did, it might result in a global recession.\nOr perhaps he would tax foreign financial flows into the United States, as some senators have proposed. This, too, would likely tank the economy, according to Peterson Institute for International Economics fellow Maurice Obstfeld.\n(Noticing any themes here?)\nWhatever the mechanism, a weaker dollar would likely lead to higher prices for American consumers , and not just during their summer vacations to Italy. Americans buy a lot of imported goods, from fruit to toys to cars to home furnishings. Those would all get more expensive as the purchasing power of the dollar fell.\nhigher prices for American consumers, and not just during their summer vacations to Italy. Americans buy a lot of imported goods, from fruit to toys to cars to home furnishings. Those would all get more expensive as the purchasing power of the dollar fell.\nAdvertisement\nSo much for Trump's pledge to vanquish inflation. And that's not the only problem with his plan.\nPerhaps some U.S. exports would get more competitive, as Trump hopes. Ironically, though, some U.S. industries that stand to benefit most from a weaker dollar are not exactly Republican darlings. They include Big Tech, Hollywood and higher education, sectors that enjoy some combination of being quite competitive at exporting things and/or having large offshore profits, which would become more valuable.\nThere's also a risk that other countries won't want to go along with Trump's scheme. Our trading partners might engage in a series of countermeasures to keep their currencies from appreciating against the dollar, which we might meet with counter-countermeasures, and so on. In other words, we might see a sequel to the trade wars Trump initiated before.\nAdvertisement\nGlobal trade or currency wars would, again, likely be bad for pretty much everyone, including U.S. businesses and consumers.\nDeliberately weakening the dollar, or even attempting to, also threatens its role as the world's 'reserve currency.' We have a stable government that has reliably paid its bills and doesn't do dodgy things to deliberately manipulate the value of its fiat currency. As a result, the dollar is widely used in international trade and dollar-denominated U.S. government debt is in high demand.\nThe fact that U.S. dollars are considered a virtually risk-free store of value gives the United States some huge privileges. It enables us to keep spending more than we collect in taxes, since it's cheap and easy for our government to borrow to finance ever-growing deficits. Eroding the dollar's global use might make it more expensive for the U.S. government to keep borrowing so much (which means taxes might need to rise, or spending decline, to cover budget shortfalls).\nAdvertisement\nWe might also weaken our ability to impose sanctions upon countries, businesses or individuals whose actions we disapprove of, since dollars are used so often in international transactions and we have some ability to restrict those transactions.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Catherine Rampell","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2Y6M7ZENAE5BL2GYPSHK3LLZNQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.064522,"_id":"a8bd1822802b05c7d26ec68912fbfbc3"},{"title":"Biden returns to his Scranton roots to pitch tax plan","author":"Chris Megerian","published_date":"2024-04-16 09:05:42","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/16/joe-biden-scranton-pennsylvania-election-taxes/80482f1e-fbd0-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"President Joe Biden will begin three straight days of campaigning in Pennsylvania in his childhood hometown of Scranton","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden returns to his childhood hometown of Scranton on Tuesday to open three straight days of campaigning in Pennsylvania, capitalizing on the opportunity to work the battleground state while Donald Trump spends the week in a New York City courtroom for his first criminal trial.\nThe Democratic president plans to use Scranton, a working class city of roughly 75,000 people, as the backdrop for his pitch for higher taxes on the rich.

He visited so often, he was sometimes called 'Pennsylvania's third senator.'\nIn 2020, Biden described the presidential campaign as 'Scranton versus Park Avenue,\" and his reelection team is framing this year's race in a similar way.\n'You've got Joe Biden, who sees the world from the kitchen table where he grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Donald Trump, who sees the world from his country club down in Mar-a-Lago,' said Michael Tyler, the campaign's communications director.\nChristopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, described Scranton as a 'mythical place in political culture,' and it will provide a test for Biden's political appeal.\nAdvertisement\n'It's an area that, on paper, aligns perfectly with the populist gains of the Republican Party during the Trump era,' Borick said.\nHowever, Biden won the city and the surrounding county in 2020. If he's able to carry Scranton and similar places again this year, as well as limit Trump's winning margins in rural areas, Biden may be able to secure another victory in Pennsylvania.\n'Everything is on the margin. Everything that we talk about are small shifts,' Borick said.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBiden's pitch on taxes is a key part of his effort to blunt Trump's populist allure.\nWhen Trump was president, he signed into law a series of tax breaks in 2017 that disproportionately benefit the rich. Many of the cuts expire at the end of 2025, and Biden wants to keep a majority of them to fulfill his promise that no one earning less than $400,000 will pay more taxes.\nAdvertisement\nHowever, he also wants to raise $4.9 trillion in revenue over 10 years with higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations. His platform includes a 'billionaire's tax,' which would set a minimum rate of 25% on the income of the richest Americans.\nBiden's travels in Pennsylvania overlap with the start of Trump's first criminal trial, presenting an opportunity and a challenge for the president's campaign.\nTrump is defending himself against criminal charges for a scheme to suppress allegations of affairs with a porn actress and a Playboy model. Biden's team has quietly embraced the contrast of the former president sequestered in a courtroom while the current president has free rein to focus on economic issues that are top of mind for voters.\nHowever, the juxtaposition becomes less helpful if Trump soaks up the country's attention during the first-ever criminal trial of a former president.\nAdvertisement\nBiden campaign officials said they weren't worried about the trial.\n'No matter where Donald Trump is, whether it's in Mar-a-Lago or a courtroom or anywhere else, he'll be focused on himself, his toxic agenda, his campaign of revenge and retribution,' Tyler said. 'That's going to be a continuation of the contrast the American people have been able to see since this campaign began.'\nSam DeMarco, chair of the Republican Party in Allegheny County, where Pittsburgh is located, said Democrats' message is that 'the economy is good, we're just not smart enough to realize it.'\nHowever, DeMarco said, 'across the board, it costs more to live today than it did when Joe Biden came to office.'\n'These are the things that families feel,' he said. 'And a scripted appearance by the president is not going to change that.'\nAdvertisement\nTrump was last in Pennsylvania on Saturday night in Schnecksville, where he described Biden as a 'demented tyrant' and blamed him for all of the country's problems, in addition to his own legal woes.\n'All of America knows that the real blame for this nightmare lies with one person, Crooked Joe Biden,' Trump said.\nHe attacked Biden's tax plans, falsely claiming that 'they're going to raise your taxes by four times.'\nTrump also went on an extended riff about the Civil War battle in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, calling it 'so vicious and horrible, and so beautiful in so many different ways,' and suggesting that the Confederate General Robert E. Lee is 'no longer in favor.'\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Chris Megerian","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PG5JJVH32AI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.064522,"_id":"ecb2a463505cc556b4d3214e08174909"},{"title":"Biden's polls improve as Kennedy and third-party factor shifts","author":"Aaron Blake","published_date":"2024-04-22 15:09:31","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/22/kennedy-biden-trump-polls","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Two new high-quality polls show Robert F. Kennedy Jr. taking more votes from Trump than Biden. And they're not the only polls to suggest a changing dynamic.","summary":"It's been something approaching an article of faith on the left and in some corners of the media that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. poses a spoiler threat to President Biden's reelection.\nIt's never been quite clear that'll be the case, though, particularly given that Kennedy is much more popular among Republicans than Democrats.\nAnd now, there are growing signs that Kennedy and his fellow third-party candidates might not cost Biden after all. Indeed, they \u2014 and particularly Kennedy \u2014 could actually pull more from Trump.\nTwo new high-quality polls since Sunday bear this out.\nThe latest is from Marist College on Monday. It shows Biden at 51 percent and Trump at 48 percent in a national head-to-head contest. But when you factor in third-party candidates \u2014 Kennedy, Green Party candidate Jill Stein and independent Cornel West \u2014 Biden's lead goes to five percentage points, larger than the poll's 3.6-point margin of error.\nAdvertisement\nMarist has long been one of Biden's better polls. But that's his best showing in a high-quality poll for many months.\nAn NBC News poll Sunday showed a similar dynamic. While Biden trailed by two points head to head (44-46), he led by two points (39-37) when the question included the third-party candidates.\nBoth NBC results are within the margin of error, but the key here is the four-point shift toward Biden when you include third-party candidates. That's something we really haven't seen before.\nAnd a big reason for the shift is Kennedy. He takes twice as much of his support from voters who had previously picked Trump in the head-to-head question (15 percent of those voters) than those who had picked Biden (7 percent). Biden cedes more votes than Trump to Stein, but Kennedy is a larger factor given that he's been pulling more votes throughout the race.\nAdvertisement\n(That poll is also merely the latest to show Kennedy's image among right-leaning voters is vastly superior to his image among left-leaning ones. While Republicans like him 40 percent to 15 percent \u2014 a plus-25 split \u2014 Democrats dislike him 53-16 \u2014 a negative-37 split.)\ndislike him 53-16 \u2014 a negative-37 split.)\nThe Marist poll shows Kennedy pulling only slightly more from actual Republicans (10 percent) than Democrats (8 percent). But it suggests he's pulling more from Trump-leaning independents.\nWhile Biden and Trump are tied at 49 percent among independents in the head-to-head, Biden leads 34-30 among independents when you include third-party candidates.\nAs in the NBC poll, Kennedy pulls more from Trump head-to-head voters (17 percent) than Biden voters (11 percent).\nWhile these are perhaps the most compelling recent polls to suggest Kennedy and the broader third-party impact aren't hurting and could even help Biden, they're not the only ones:\nAdvertisement\nAll of it paints a picture of a dynamic situation with the third-party candidates.\nBiden has probably suffered more among them in the past because Democrats are less enthusiastic about his candidacy than Republicans are about Trump's. In addition, both Stein and West are clearly to Biden's political left, and Kennedy at the very least has a name that could resonate with more casual left-leaning independents.\nBut what generally happens as a general election proceeds is that voters gravitate toward the two major-party candidates because they actually have a shot at winning, and third-party candidates fade.\nPerhaps what we're starting to see is voters who don't like Trump migrating from flirting with third-party candidates to going for Biden. Perhaps Kennedy's far superior image among right-leaning voters or his tendency toward Republican-friendly conspiracy theories is starting to register. Or \u2014 though it's early to say this with any certainty \u2014 perhaps Trump's personal problems surrounding his first criminal trial are starting to have more of an effect.\nAdvertisement\nIt's a battle that is far from over, particularly given that both sides are likely to spend the next six-plus months trying to attach Kennedy to the other side's politics. Biden appeared last week with members of the Kennedy family who have distanced themselves from their relative's campaign. And at least some Republicans are starting to worry about the Kennedy impact and fight back, attacking the candidate they once boosted when Kennedy was challenging Biden for the Democratic nomination.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Staff Writer,Aaron Blake","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SYYVSPQY2B6S5DTB6RZEJSGTJI.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.0176907,"_id":"5fbb2a771fb32e1e42e1de095a83c37a"},{"title":"Today's Opinions: It's Trump trial time at last","author":"Amanda Katz","published_date":"2024-04-15 21:11:42","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/15/trump-trial-israel-iran-war-dating-american-west","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Plus: Will Israel's defenses help deescalate conflict with Iran?

This could be the crown jewel of 'both-sidesism,' accomplishing that feat in multiple ways.\nFor starters, it blurs the distinction between Biden's clear and unwavering position (to write Roe v. Wade into a federal statute) with Trump's well-documented inconsistencies, deflections and contradictions. These two men simply are not equally deficient communicators.

We know the 42 questions potential jurors in the former president's trial in Manhattan were asked. They made sense. They included: 'Which of the following print publications, cable and/or network programs, or online media, such as websites, blogs, or social media platforms do you visit, read, or watch?' 'Do you have any feelings or opinions about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case?'\nBut I was haunted by question 34: 'Do you have any strong opinions or firmly held beliefs about former President Donald Trump, or the fact that he is a current candidate for president that would interfere with your ability to be a fair and impartial juror?' That second clause is doing a lot of work, but I'm wondering about the first clause. Is it possible to find someone who does not? I have even more questions for anyone with a positive answer to this question. Indeed, I have more questions, in general. They go something like this.\n1. Wait, you don't have any strong opinions or firmly held beliefs about Donald Trump?\nAdvertisement\n2. Have you been living in a hole for the past 20 years?\nFollow this author Alexandra Petri 's opinions\nFollow this author\nAlexandra Petri\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\n3. For the past 50 years?\n4. Tell us more about the hole in which you have resided. What are the dimensions of the hole? Is it comfortable? Do you get Netflix? Can we join you there?\n5. But, seriously, how have you spent the past several decades of life? Please choose from the following:\n(a) Under the misapprehension that Y2K would soon bring about the end of the world, I have been in a bunker sealed off entirely from the outside world for three decades, but I just ran out of shelf-stable beans and had to emerge. Very sad news about O.J., my favorite football star, whom I'm sure we all remember fondly exclusively for football!\nfor football!\n(b) I was cryogenically frozen in a lab accident, but nobody realized what had happened until last year, when they were conducting a long-overdue deep clean of the facility. I sort of wish they'd just left me in there, but I'm excited that jeans fashion came back around to exactly where it was when I got put in the vat!\nfashion came back around to exactly where it was when I got put in the vat!\nAdvertisement\n(c) I gave up reading the news for my New Year's resolution in 1979 and I've stuck to it ever since. I just finished reading all of Proust and I go on so many walks in nature. Want to see my blood pressure?\n(d) I was, until recently, a bird, due to a complicated curse that we don't need to get into right now. But I just found true love and turned back! This case is my first reintroduction to the world of humans!\n(e) I can't say \u2026 I really can't say. Well \u2026 but no! No, I mustn't. No, I simply can't. You must not ask me! Don't ask!\n(f) I am a secret agent and I have been embedded in this country under special instructions to absorb no news and tell no one of my mission. Oh \u2014 oops.\n(g) Other.\n6. You seriously don't have a strong opinion about Donald Trump? What has been your source of news? Select all that apply:\nAdvertisement\n(a) Whenever they update 'We Didn't Start The Fire,' I make guesses based on the new verses.\n(b) Ocean Spray bottle caps.\n(c) The normal way: The FBI beams it directly into my brain and I learn all that I need.\n(d) My mother-in-law's Facebook, but only the comments on the posts, not the posts themselves.\n(e) The pigeons tell me.\n(f) Town crier.\n8. You seriously don't have any preconceived notions about Donald Trump?\n(a) No, but now that I see him, I don't like his looks.\n(b) No, but now that I see him there with his eyes shut looking so peaceful, I LOVE HIM and must protect him at all costs.\n(c) No, I do! I just thought it would stress you out if I said I didn't. This was fun for me.\n9. If you do have preconceived notions about Donald Trump, can you set them aside to serve as a juror?\n(a) I thought I wasn't allowed to get rid of preconceived notions in this country any longer.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Alexandra Petri","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MEHQJS4H72IWSWRDPV2PNFK57A_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.9610953,"_id":"cd10d57a2437a3f0d3b8d708b7db1616"},{"title":"The questions jurors will face in Trump's N.Y. trial","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-16 18:07:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/the-questions-jurors-will-face-in-trumps-ny-trial/2024/04/16/f4dc1098-959c-4ac1-9a63-bc4b25086993_video.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The Post's Libby Casey, Rhonda Colvin, and James Hohmann discussed what questions prospective jurors will face impacting the selection process on April 15.","summary":"Politics\nThe questions jurors will face in Trump's N.Y. trial\nThe Post's Libby Casey, Rhonda Colvin, and James Hohmann discussed what questions prospective jurors will face impacting the selection process on April 15.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https%3A%2F%2Fd1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net%2F04-16-2024%2Ft_ba21132ad0d845f391078ba25408c9c7_name_FINAL_THUMB_TRUMP_TRIALS_SOCIAL.jpg&w=1080","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.9476542,"_id":"2b979110756f26a9921ed59aac4845e6"},{"title":"Tuesday briefing: Trump's hush money trial; Jan. 6 Supreme Court case; coral bleaching; Caitlin Clark WNBA draft; and more","author":"Jamie Ross","published_date":"2024-04-16 10:30:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/the-seven/2024/04/16/what-to-know-for-april-16","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Catch up in minutes with these 7 stories.","summary":"Jury selection will continue today.
