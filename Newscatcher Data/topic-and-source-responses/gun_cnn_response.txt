They carry no serial numbers, do not require background checks and provide no transfer records for traceability. Critics say they are attractive to people who are otherwise legally prohibited from buying firearms.\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives approved a regulation in 2022 that required the manufacturers to have serial numbers on the kits and keep records of who purchased them. Advocacy groups and five companies that manufacture the kits sued, arguing the regulation wasn't permitted under law.\nThe rule does not prohibit the sale or possession of any ghost gun kit, nor does it block an individual from purchasing such a kit. Instead, it requires compliance with federal laws that impose conditions on the commercial sale of firearms.\nA US district court in Texas threw out the rule and the conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals mostly upheld that decision. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, has weighed into the case twice on its emergency docket, pausing lower court rulings that barred the regulation from taking effect.\nLast summer, a 5-4 court sided with the Biden administration in the first emergency request, allowing the regulations to remain in effect while legal challenges played out. At the time, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett sided with the liberal justices in the administration's favor.\nAfter the order was issued, the district court stepped in to block the regulations as applied to two manufacturers. The Supreme Court stepped in again last fall to allow the regulations to remain in effect.\nThe Biden administration said police departments have faced an 'explosion of crimes involving ghost guns' in recent years. In 2017, police submitted about 1,600 ghost guns for tracing. Four years later, the number had grown to more than 19,000.\nBoth sides \u2013 the administration and the manufacturers \u2013 asked the Supreme Court to take the case.\nThe kit makers said their product is intended to cater to 'law-abiding citizens making their own firearms' and accused the Biden administration of attempting to shut their companies down.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,John Fritze","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2147857583.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":8.914774,"_id":"9f4768aa02fe83028ed59f1bd5dea923"},{"title":"Tennessee Rep.

A similar law that could put guns in the hands of teachers has been approved by lawmakers in Iowa, and presumably other states could choose to follow suit.\nIt's the latest proof that \u2014 a full year after the devastating mass shooting at The Covenant High School in Nashville that killed six people \u2014 our state's political leaders are no closer to providing meaningful, viable solutions to address our state's tragic gun violence problem.\nThe Covenant High School in Nashville that killed six people \u2014 our state's political leaders are no closer to providing meaningful, viable solutions to address our state's tragic gun violence problem. Guns are still the leading cause of death in children and teens in America, and Tennessee continues to be plagued by one of the highest rates of violence perpetrated with firearms in the country. The Republican supermajority that controls our state's General Assembly, tragically, have reneged on their responsibility to pass meaningful gun safety legislation.\nIf Republicans have failed to make inroads in combating senseless gun violence, it cannot be because they are unaware of the seriousness of the problem. The magnitude of our gun violence problem was made clear to residents of Tennessee and the entire nation last March after a shooter armed with a weapon of war carried out the massacre at The Covenant School. Among the dead were three children, 9-year-olds Hallie Scruggs, Evelyn Dieckhaus and William Kinney.\nHere's what Republican lawmakers could do instead of passing measures that would introduce even more guns into our public spaces, and now potentially our classrooms: They could listen to some of the parents who have been appalled at the idea that the adults to whom they have entrusted their children's care at school every day might be carrying loaded guns.\nOne such mom, Beth Gebhard, whose son attended The Covenant School told me after the shooting that quick action by her son's teacher might have saved his life that day, as well as the lives of all of the other children in the class. But it's not because the teacher confronted the shooter with a gun. Far from it.\n'My son was in a second-grade classroom close to where the children were slain. The children heard the intensely loud, repeated shots,' Beth told me.\n'I know the primary reason he's still alive is that his teacher \u2014 under extreme duress \u2014 was able to follow her training to lock the classroom door, pull down the shades, shepherd the children to the safe corner of the room and be there with them, helping them to follow her breathing and to stay silent so the Nashville police officers could do their work.'\nBeth knows that guns belong in the hands of trained professionals who are best equipped to meet the threat posed by a gunman. Putting firearms into the hands of classroom teachers and administrators every day is simply asking for more heartache and tragedy.\nHere's some more wisdom that Tennessee lawmakers could glean from parents: Immediately following The Covenant School massacre, grieving parents lined the streets and the entrance to the Tennessee State House, demanding common sense gun safety laws. Students walked out of schools across Nashville and Memphis making similar demands. We've seen a groundswell of similar protests in recent days, as parents and students raise their voices in opposition to the measure being considered in the House that could put guns in the hands of their teachers.\nRelated article Van Jones: Going home, I encountered a huge problem\nRelated article Van Jones: Going home, I encountered a huge problem Their sentiments are echoed across the country. A strong majority of Americans favor stricter gun safety laws in the US, according to a Gallup poll, and a similar majority of teachers believe arming them would make schools less safe, according to research by the Rand Corporation. In Tennessee, a wide majority \u2014 about three-quarters of registered voters \u2014 want red flag laws, according to polling last year from Vanderbilt University.\nThere is one more group that Tennessee lawmakers should consult with before passing a measure that could make our gun violence problem even worse: The members of the law enforcement community who are directly tasked with keeping schools safe.\nThe National Association of School Resource Officers (NASRO) also opposes arming teachers, and their research data aligns with the fears of teachers and school staff. Among other warnings, NASRO reports that a law enforcement officer could mistake an armed teacher for an assailant and that discharging weapons in a school is an 'extremely risky action' that could result in wounding or killing innocent children and staff.\nTheir data also indicate that an armed teacher is more likely to interfere with first responders' actions than to stop a school shooter. Besides all of the data indicating the dangers of arming teachers, the training outlined in the proposed bill is insufficient to prepare teachers to safely carry and operate a weapon in the event of a mass shooting.\nUnfortunately, rather than heeding wise counsel on the subject of reducing gun violence, our legislature has frequently resorted to reactive and even anti-democratic tactics.\nTennessee state Rep. Justin Jones, Rep. Gloria Johnson and I responded to the pleas of our constituents and the mourners outside and inside the State House last year, joining them in peaceful protest against a conservative majority that refused to listen.\nHowever, on that day and every day since, the majority party lawmakers appear to answer to a different constituency \u2014 the Tennessee Firearms Association and the National Rifle Association. And they responded to our efforts to represent the grieving people of Tennessee by expelling Jones and me \u2014 two Black men \u2014 from our duly elected offices.\nAlthough our municipal governments promptly reinstated us and our constituents voted us back into office, the supermajority in the Tennessee State House is still trying to silence us. Despite the retribution politics that dominate the Republican agenda, we refuse to be silent. We will not sit still and be quiet while our children and communities are ravaged by gun violence.\nArming teachers increases the likelihood of shootings in schools, increases the chance that students will have access to guns and erodes trust in educators. A teacher with a handgun is unable to stop a shooter with a military-style weapon, and teachers aren't able to respond in the ways trained law enforcement agents can. Adverse impacts \u2014 including fatal outcomes \u2014 will disproportionately fall on already marginalized populations such as disabled and Black students.\nAccording to the national teachers' union the American Federation of Teachers, more than three in four teachers oppose putting guns in the hands of educators and school staff, stating that schools would be more dangerous if staff were armed. Most parents, as well as students, oppose arming teachers.\n'Arming teachers is not the answer to school shootings \u2014 it's a dangerous next step in the gun lobby's \u2018guns everywhere' agenda. We need to vote these reckless politicians out and elect lawmakers who will fight for the common sense, research-backed gun safety laws that Tennesseans deserve,' says Angela Ferrell-Zabala, executive director of Moms Demand Action, the anti-gun violence group founded after another horrific school mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in December 2012.\nAs parents tell me time and again, guns in classrooms simply are not the answer. 'Can you imagine what would have happened if my son's teacher left the classroom with a handgun to confront the shooter with military-grade weapons?' Beth asked me. 'Not only would she have been killed, but she would have left terrified 8-year-olds alone \u2014 many likely crying and some following her \u2014 alerting the shooter to their presence. I have no doubt my son wouldn't have survived.'\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook This moment requires our highest reasoning and the best of our efforts. It requires elected officials to do everything we can to end the gun violence epidemic plaguing our communities, our state and our nation. But the bill that passed the Tennessee Senate last week and is under consideration in the House is a red herring that not only prevents us from dealing with the problem of gun safety and fear in schools, but also puts our kids and teachers in more danger.\nArming teachers does not create the school environment we want or need. Students deserve better. They deserve nurturing and care in a trusting and productive educational environment where they can thrive.\nWe need what a vast majority of Tennessee voters and voters nationwide want: common sense gun legislation. These include those articulated by Covenant Families for Brighter Tomorrows and Mothers Over Murder, who are calling for more counseling for children, closing gun-buying loopholes, mandating stronger background checks and passing safer storage laws.\nWe must do right by our children and our communities.

Using a silent panic alarm app on her phone, she alerted police and within seconds her image appeared on multiple screens in the Broward County Sheriff's Office.\nThe sheriff's office was able to immediately give her instructions to evacuate the school, and call the fire department and the bomb squad.\n'We were able to coordinate the whole thing within seconds,' Capt. Michael Riggio with the Broward County Sheriff's Office told CNN. Thankfully, the threat was unfounded. It was called in by an elementary school student as a joke, the sheriff's office said.\nThe school district, which serves more than 251,000 students, adopted a silent panic alarm system in the wake of the February 14, 2018, mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that claimed 17 lives.\nRelated article Gun violence is remaking America's classrooms\nRelated article Gun violence is remaking America's classrooms Florida has since raised the minimum age to buy firearms from 18 to 21 under a law that also allows for some teachers to be armed. Despite the impassioned pleas for more thorough gun reform that followed the Parkland shooting, the number of school shootings in the US has climbed steadily each year since 2018, with the exception of 2020, when many schools were closed due to Covid-19, according to CNN's analysis of events reported by the Gun Violence Archive, Education Week and Everytown for Gun Safety.\nFlorida adopted Alyssa's Law in 2020, named in honor of Alyssa Alhadeff, who was 14 when she was killed in the Parkland shooting. The law requires public schools to install a silent panic alarm system in schools that is directly linked to law enforcement. In the absence of gun reform, proponents of Alyssa's Law say a silent panic alarm system can reduce response time in the face of gun violence or a medical emergency.\nSince then, only a handful of states have followed suit. Five states \u2013 New Jersey, New York, Texas, Tennessee and Utah \u2013 have also approved legislation requiring or encouraging silent panic alarm systems in schools.\nSome schools have adopted apps that allow staff to report an emergency with a few clicks on their phones. Others have opted to provide staff with literal panic buttons, often attached to an ID badge that is always on their person. The panic buttons or apps can often send precise location information to law enforcement and initiate a school-wide alert or shelter in place notice.\nIn 2018, Alyssa's family founded Make Our Schools Safe, a nonprofit that advocates for the adoption of Alyssa's Law across the United States.\n'On February 14, I texted my daughter Alyssa. I told her to run and hide \u2013 that help was on the way, and then unfortunately, that help didn't get there fast enough,' Alyssa's mother, Lori Alhadeff, told CNN. 'Time equals life and if we can get help on the scene as quickly as possible, we know that we will save lives.'\nAlyssa's Law legislation has been introduced in Nebraska, Arizona, Virginia, Oregon, Georgia, Michigan, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Oklahoma, according to Make Our Schools Safe. There have also been several attempts to introduce legislation at the federal level.\n'They think it's a great idea,' Alhadeff said, 'but they want to know how it's going to be funded, so it is a budget concern. However, what I would say is this: We need to make school safety a top priority in every school district.'\nAlhadeff says her family's story and those of others who have lost loved ones to gun violence in schools often makes the difference when advocating for legislation. She recently traveled to Utah and spoke with Rep. Ryan Wilcox and other state legislators before they made the decision to add the panic button requirement to a state school safety bill, backed by $100 million in funding.\nFunding is generally built into the laws at a state level. Florida allocated $6.4 million in recurring funds to help schools implement panic button systems.\nBrent Cobb, CEO of Centegix, a company specializing in safety technology, told CNN the cost of outfitting a school with his company's panic button systems is about $8,000 a year.\nPanic button systems can be helpful, but they're just one of multiple safety measures, like perimeter security, that schools need to keep students safe, Mo Canady, executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers, a nonprofit group of school-based security professionals, told CNN.\nCanady says his early days working as a school resource officer in the US coincided with the 1999 Columbine High School massacre that killed 13 people in Colorado.\n'We didn't have this kind of technology at that time, so it was a bit of a guessing game,' he said. 'Now, if you hear shots fired, you know where they're exactly coming from, is the shooter moving somewhere else \u2013 this kind of technology can help us narrow down where we need to look.'\nCanady says there needs to be a structure in place so schools and law enforcement agencies know how to respond to reported emergencies.\n'The last thing we want to do is hand out a piece of technology without any policy or procedure in mind \u2013 \u2018just push it if you have a problem,'' he said.\nAlhadeff says the ultimate goal is to see Alyssa's Law implemented nationwide.\n'Think about our banks. Every bank has a panic button. Every federal office has a panic button. Why wouldn't we want to make panic buttons in every one of our schools across this country?' Alhadeff said.\nWhile panic button systems are often installed to protect staff and students from potential gun violence, the systems have more often been used in cases of medical emergencies, according to Centegix.\nThe company released a report in January showing of about 15,000 alerts sent within Texas schools, 98% were for 'everyday incidents related to health and behavioral emergencies.' The report cites incidents of cardiac arrest and seizures on campus, where a panic button was used to quickly get help.\nshowing of about 15,000 alerts sent within Texas schools, 98% were for 'everyday incidents related to health and behavioral emergencies.'

The Broward County school district opted for the SaferWatch app, according to Broward County Public Schools Chief Safety and Security Officer Jaime Alberti. The company told CNN it's used by 2,000 schools and 200 law enforcement agencies nationwide.\nIn Broward County, the app connects the sheriff's office to cameras in the schools. It also allows school staff to report emergencies to law enforcement and has an anonymous tip reporting function that is open to students and other community members in the district.\nAlberti says the district has an operation center that runs 24/7 to sift through and follow up on tips, for instance, of people threatening to commit an act of violence on campus. Many of those tips end up being false alarms, Alberti says, but the district's partnership with the Broward County Sheriff's Office allows them to investigate and follow up with the appropriate resources.\nCapt. Mike Riggio told CNN the tip reporting function has been critical for getting ahead of threats before they're acted on. The department's threat assessment unit has hired behavioral health licensed therapists to assess people who may want to commit acts of mass violence and connect them to mental health providers in the community.\n'I think there are still not a lot of places in the country that have quite the relationship we do,' Riggio said. 'In our real time crime center, we have sworn detectives and crime analysts who work together. And now that we have cameras when things happen, we're on those cameras right away. We have eyes into the school.'\n'You're at a school on the other side of the county, you hit that panic alarm, within 5 seconds, it's going off in our crime center,' he added.\nThat peace of mind is paramount in a community still healing from the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Alberti said.\n'It's still very present. It's still very painful,' he said. 'So we're double checking. We're triple checking.

It was hauled nearby to a secure Air Canada cargo warehouse, where, hours later, a hulking white box truck backed into a loading dock.\nThe truck driver wore dark clothing, a high-visibility vest and a face mask. He stepped out with a clipboard holding a duplicate of a consignment bill for a seafood shipment picked up the previous day.\nA forklift loaded a tightly sealed container into the back of the five-ton truck, where the driver nudged the load with his body to make sure it was secure. He pulled down the rear door and drove away.\n'This story is a sensational one,' Peel Regional Police Chief Nishan Duraiappah said Wednesday in announcing charges against nine suspects in the heist. 'One which we jokingly say belongs in a Netflix series.'\nThe heist actually was a sophisticated caper allegedly involving Air Canada insiders. It morphed into an international operation that, in the words of one official, worked a kind of reverse alchemy to turn gold into guns trafficked from the US intended for use by criminals on the streets of Canada.\n'This isn't just about gold. This is about how gold becomes guns,' said the official, Nando Iannicca, head of the Peel regional government, which is responsible for the airport. 'It turns into people who are harmed or killed.'\nIn September, the man who allegedly drove the truck in the gold theft was arrested following a traffic stop in Pennsylvania with a cache of 65 guns \u2013 purchased in Florida and Georgia with proceeds from gold melted down after the heist \u2013 that he allegedly intended to smuggle into Canada.\nKeeping those guns off the streets of Canada 'saved lives without a doubt,' Duraiappah said. 'This is a dotted line to people's well being anywhere in this country wherever those firearms ended up.'\nDetails of the heist were gleaned from statements and interviews with Canadian and US law enforcement officials, court documents and surveillance footage and images released by police.\nIn the annals of Canadian crime, only the great maple syrup heist of 2012 \u2013 in which millions of dollars worth of the sweet stuff were stolen from a warehouse holding Quebec's strategic syrup reserves \u2013 garnered as much attention around the world. That heist was the subject of an episode on a Netflix series.\nThe gold heist is 'almost out of an \u2018Ocean's 11' movie or \u2018CSI,' ' Patrick Brown, the mayor of Brampton, a city near Toronto Pearson International Airport, said as he stood with a group of police officers and other elected officials in front of the truck used in last year's heist.\nAt 3:56 p.m. on April 17, 2023, a plane from Zurich landed in Toronto with a shipment of 6,600 gold bars weighing nearly 900 pounds and about $1.9 million in bank notes.\nThe gold bars from a precious metals refining company in Switzerland were destined for a bank in Toronto. The bank notes were headed to the Vancouver Bullion & Currency Exchange.\nAt 6:32 p.m., the suspect in the white box truck arrived at the Air Canada warehouse with a copy of an airway bill that had been printed out earlier at the same facility.\nThe document said the shipment came from a seafood company in the United Kingdom that \u2013 according to the company website \u2013 specializes in the finest Atlantic salmon. It's destination was one of Canada's largest seafood distribution companies, which caters to luxury hotels and restaurants as well as chain and independent retailers.\nInstead of a load of farm-raised seafood, the truck driver pulled away from the loading dock with loot.\n'They needed people inside Air Canada to facilitate this theft,' Peel Regional Police Det. Sgt. Mike Mavity said.\n'Anyone that worked at that business \u2026 would likely have known that it was a high value commodity and not obviously just seafood,' Mavity told CNN, referring to the way the shipment was wrapped and labeled.\nAt about 9:30 p.m., a Brink's security company armored truck arrived with the actual waybill for the shipment of pure gold and bank notes. Air Canada employees couldn't find the container and an internal investigation was started. The theft was reported to Peel police at 2:43 a.m.\nFor weeks after the heist, investigators leading what police dubbed 'Project 24 karat' painstakingly went over surveillance video from more than 200 businesses and residences along the side roads and highway route the truck had taken.\n'We're trying to find businesses that their video cameras obviously are focused on the highway, but capture the highway in the background. And we could perhaps sometimes see just a little snippet of the truck passing by and then we just kept following it,' Mavity said.\nby and then we just kept following it,' Mavity said. 'Every time the highway would meet a major intersection, we'd have to go to video of that intersection and see if the truck got off. If it didn't we keep leapfrogging along. So it was very, very time consuming. These sort of investigations, it's not like TV at all.'\nArrests Made After 20 Million Dollar Gold Heist - Stolen gold shipment truck route\nArrests Made After 20 Million Dollar Gold Heist - Stolen gold shipment truck route Investigators were able to track the truck on separate snippets of video for about 20 miles before it vanished as the vehicle wound up way into rural Canada.\n'I think they must have definitely thought they got away with it,' Mavity said in an interview.\nEarly in the investigation, days after the theft, a 31-year-old former Air Canada manager who police later identified as one of two alleged inside men in the heist led officers on a tour of the warehouse. He appeared stressed. The ex-manager resigned last summer, traveled to Dubai and is now believed to be in India.\n'We didn't understand what the cargo warehouse looked like. And we had a lot of questions on how the goods came in, and then moved through there and went out,' Mavity recalled.\n'An officer actually noticed that he was sweating profusely and thought it was kind of strange but didn't think anything of it,' Mavity said of the former manager. 'We had our suspicions at the time but, as far as our investigation, we weren't in a position to act on those suspicions yet.'\nLast year Brink's sued Air Canada over the theft, claiming millions of dollars in damages after an 'unidentified individual' presented a 'fraudulent' waybill at the warehouse and 'absconded with the cargo,' according to the statement of claim.\n'No security protocols or features were in place to monitor, restrict or otherwise regulate the unidentified individual's access to the facilities,' said the statement, adding Air Canada accepted the fraudulent document 'without verifying its authenticity in any way.'\nAir Canada, in a statement, confirmed two employees charged in the theft worked at the warehouse. One was suspended, the other resigned. In its legal response to the Brink's lawsuit, Air Canada has denied it was 'careless' and its security lax.\n'As this is now before the courts, we are limited in our ability to comment further,' the statement said.\nIn a statement, the Brink's company thanked Peel Regional Police and said, 'We will continue to cooperate with them as this investigation continues to unfold.'\nA big break in the case came on September 2, 2023, when the 25-year-old man who allegedly drove the truck in the gold heist was arrested in Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Canadian police had identified him as the truck driver early in the investigation but had not been able to locate him.\nA Pennsylvania state trooper stopped a rental car for a minor traffic violation. The driver bolted on foot and, after he was caught, troopers found 65 guns \u2013 including two fully automatic rifles and considered machine guns \u2013 in the car. The man has been charged with conspiracy to illegally traffic firearms into Canada.\nAuthorities contacted police in Canada after finding the driver's name in a law enforcement database.\n'That kind of set everything in motion in terms of his whereabouts, what his activity was at least in the states, which then led to some cooperation with the Canadian law enforcement agency,' said Eric DeGree, special agent in charge of the Philadelphia field division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. 'Obviously 65 firearms is something that you don't see every day\u2026 So that's kind of how they got us involved.'\nEleven of the firearms were stolen, one had an obliterated serial number and five were ghost guns, which are assembled to make homemade weapons.\n'Had he not been stopped by that Pennsylvania state trooper I don't know if he would have been intercepted at the border,' Mavity said of the man arrested in Pennsylvania.\nEach illegal handgun, purchased for a few hundred dollars in the US, can be sold on the streets of Canada for up to $6,000.\n'The buyers could be anyone from a street gang or drug traffickers all the way to more coordinated individuals,' Duraiappah said. 'They're not just the typical type of firearms that are used at \u2026 a pharmacy robbery or a carjacking. Without a doubt, you know, not knowing where they would have ended up in Canada, one or all of them would have been used in the facilitation of another crime.'\nCanadian Investigators learned a Toronto jeweler charged in the heist allegedly helped melt down the gold bars, which had serial numbers, in smelting pots seized by the police. The gold was then sold to buy guns across the border. Only six crude bangle bracelets made of pure gold and worth about $65,000 remained of the 6,600 gold bars.\nLess than a week after the gold heist, the truck driver was using an encrypted messenger app to arrange with another suspect his illegal entry into the US to buy firearms, according to an indictment filed in the US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.\nThe exchanges included travel arrangements and accommodations and photos of large amounts of Canadian currency wrapped in rubber bands, with the message,'Just picked up the change for you going\u2026 to exchange the change to USD,' the indictment said.\nAnother exchange in August 2023 had the truck driver discussing the purchase of several firearms for '3500,' with one suspect responding: 'Get it\u2026Good to go.' There were photos of firearms and large amounts of cash.\nThat same month, a text message from the driver talked about the acquisition of '45 stick,' presumably referring to firearms. Another suspect expressed concern about the truck driver 'getting pulled,' the indictment said.\nUS law enforcement officials are still trying to identify the source of the stolen guns.\nOf the nine heist suspects \u2013 who Canadian investigators said had been enjoying a lavish lifestyle, including trips to Dubai and India \u2013 five were arrested and released because they could not be held on bail on the theft charges. They were ordered to appear in court at a later date.\nOn August 30 and 31, the indictment said, surveillance footage from a U-Haul storage facility in Atlanta captured the truck driver carrying a backpack. Two days later, on September 2, the same backpack was found in the truck of his rental car with more than 30 firearms inside.\n'This investigation isn't done,' Peel Deputy Police Chief Nick Milinovich said.\nStill, Duraiappah said, his investigators in recent days have been joking about what actors would play them in a Netflix series.\nCNN's Paula Newton and Fabiana Chaparro contributed to this report.\nCNN's Paula Newton and Fabiana Chaparro contributed to this report.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"world","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ray Sanchez,Ramon Sanchez,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-950729116-copy.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":7.3529186,"_id":"19d5653ccd59f992b06e3cf1f2b0240e"},{"title":"Texas boy, 10, confesses to fatally shooting a sleeping man when he was 7, authorities say","author":"Ashley R.

On April 12, a Nixon-Smiley Consolidated Independent School District principal told Gonzales County authorities the elementary school student had threatened to assault and kill another student on a school bus the previous day, prompting them to conduct a threat assessment, according to the release.\nSchool district officials informed the responding deputy the 10-year-old had made comments about shooting and killing a man two years ago, according to the release.\nGonzales County's criminal investigators determined, based on what the child shared at school, he may have knowledge about Rasberry's death.\nThe school district's superintendent, Jeff Van Auken, said in an April 18 letter addressed to parents obtained by CNN affiliate KSAT-TV the child would not be returning to the school.\nDuring a forensic interview at a child advocacy center, the child 'provided information that was consistent with first-hand knowledge of the homicide of Brandon Rasberry,' according to the release.\nAuthorities reported the child said he was visiting his grandfather, who lived in the same RV park as Rasberry, on January 16, 2022, the release states.\nAfter obtaining a pistol he found in the glove box of his grandfather's truck, the child told investigators he entered Rasberry's RV, according to the release.\nAuthorities said the child stated he had never met Rasberry though had seen him walking around the RV earlier that day.\nThe child told investigators he saw Rasberry sleeping, approached him and fired a shot, striking the man once in the head, according to the Gonzales County Sheriff's Office.\n'The child stated as he was leaving the RV he discharged the firearm another time into the couch inside the RV,' the release states.\nThe child told authorities he then left the RV and returned the firearm to the truck's glove box.\n'The child was also asked if he was mad at Brandon for some reason or if Brandon had ever done anything to him to make him mad, the child stated no,' according to the Gonzales County Sheriff's Office's news release.\nGonzales County Sheriff's Office's news release. The child said his grandfather had pawned the gun, which investigators tracked down at a pawn shop in Seguin, Texas, on April 12, the release states.\nThe Gonzales County Attorney's Office, Texas Department of Child Protective Services and Gonzales County Juvenile Probation joined the investigation.\nA forensic analysis and comparison of two spent shell casings found at the scene of the homicide determined the pawned gun was the same firearm used to kill Rasberry, according to authorities.\n' Because of the severity of the crime and because of the continued concern for the child's mental wellbeing the child was placed on a 72-hour emergency detention,' according to the sheriff office's news release.\n'Because of the severity of the crime and because of the continued concern for the child's mental wellbeing the child was placed on a 72-hour emergency detention,' according to the sheriff office's news release.

Because the child was 7 years old at the time of Rasberry's death, the Gonzales County Attorney's Office will not file or accept murder charges in the case, according to the Gonzales County Sheriff's Office.\nCNN has reached out to the Texas Department of Public Safety for comment.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ashley R.

Here are some of the policies Biden says he would enact if elected for a second term.","summary":"President Joe Biden's main pitch to voters ahead of November is simple: They should vote for him because he is not Donald Trump. In speeches and political events since his reelection campaign began in earnest earlier this year, Biden had said that his second term would essentially be a continuation of his first: 'Let's finish this job,' Biden said in a video announcing his reelection campaign last year. In making his case to voters, Biden has contrasted his own ideas of governance with Trump's stated plans to drastically alter how the federal government works, how executive power would be used and how America's role on the world stage will change if the former president wins a second term. Biden, meanwhile, has promised to protect American democracy, pass a federal law to codify the right to an abortion into law, preserve the country's international alliances and agreements and deliver on climate benchmarks. His ability to deliver on these promises even if he wins a second term, though, is not a certainty. Many of his more lofty ambitions would require congressional approval and action. In some of his most significant and enduring acts as president, Trump appointed three conservative nominees to the Supreme Court. The ensuing right-wing supermajority paved the way for the court's 2022 decision that overturned Roe. V Wade, which had enshrined the right to an abortion in federal law for nearly half a century. Biden has made the court's decision, and Trump's repeated promises to go further in restricting abortion access if he were to win in November, a centerpiece of his reelection campaign. 'Like most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right,' Biden said during his State of the Union address on March 7. '\u2026 But my predecessor came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned. He's the reason it was overturned \u2014 in fact, he brags about it.' 'Look at the chaos that has resulted,' Biden added. During the speech, Biden promised to codify the abortion-related protections enshrined in Roe v. Wade into federal law if he wins a second term, but he acknowledged that would require the cooperation of a Democratic-controlled Congress. 'If Americans send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you, I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again,' Biden said. Biden called for codifying Roe into law when he was running for president in 2020. While seeking office in 2020, Biden made ambitious climate-related promises, warning that climate change presents an existential threat to humanity. Some of those promises panned out: Biden's landmark legislative achievements, the bipartisan infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act, include hundreds of billions of dollars to encourage clean energy production and the manufacturing of electric vehicles. Pollution-falling emissions fell by 2% in the United States last year. Activists on Biden's left flank still think the president has not done enough \u2014 they want Biden to declare a climate emergency that would free up federal resources to confront climate change. Biden will need more time to fulfill some of his other pledges, including cutting emissions in half by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, and having a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. Biden said the 2020 race was a 'battle for the soul of the nation.' Now, he has made preserving democracy the focal point of his 2024 campaign \u2014 saying the value Americans place on a free and democratic society is the most important question of our country's time. He lays out the stakes in stark terms: If Trump wins a second term, the United States will face a crisis that could lead to the erosion of democratic norms. 'Not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault here at home as they are today,' Biden said during his State of the Union address last month. Today, he warned, there are 'forces taking us back in time.' Biden urged Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. The acts, which would have made Election Day a federal holiday, bolstered voting-related security measures, allowed all voters to request mail-in ballots and updated parts of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act, were blocked by Senate Republicans in 2021. 'Pass and send me the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act,' Biden told Congress during his address, 'and stop denying another core value of America \u2014 our diversity across American life.' Biden has criticized Republican-led drives to ban certain books from public schools. 'Banning books \u2013 it's wrong,' he said in his State of the Union address. The United States, he said, shouldn't be erasing history. In the same speech, Biden also called for expanded pre-kindergarten for 3- and 4-year-olds, along with raises for teachers in public schools. He said he wants to continue making college more affordable by expanding access to Pell grants for working-class families, renewing a 2020 promise he made to double the grants' value. 'To remain the strongest economy in the world,' Biden said, 'we need the best education system in the world.' In some of his first actions as president, Biden worked to return the United States to the presence it held on the world stage before Trump became president. As president, Trump denigrated alliances like NATO and withdrew the United States from crucial international agreements, including the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accords. While running in 2020, Biden promised to undo damage wreaked by Trump on America's international partnerships. Biden has said he will continue to repair relationships that have faltered under Trump's control \u2014 and uphold American commitments to NATO and Ukraine. Trump, meanwhile, has said he would encourage Russia to do 'whatever the hell they want' to NATO-member countries who don't fulfill certain funding obligations. Biden frequently refers to those comments while speaking with supporters. 'The rest of the world is wondering what in the hell is happening to us,' Biden said at a campaign event in New York last month. 'And they're relieved, not because I'm so special but that I'm not Trump.' In an earlier Dallas fundraiser, Biden said the United States' international reputation was 'crushed when (Trump) was president.' 'Imagine what will happen if he's reelected,' Biden said. In 2022, Biden signed the most comprehensive gun-reform legislation in nearly 30 years. The law, passed shortly after a White supremacist massacred 10 people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket, allocated more than $750 million to help states implement crisis-intervention programs, closed certain loopholes in existing gun-control legislation and required more thorough reviews for people aged 18 to 21 who wanted to buy firearms. Biden has said he wants to go further. 'I'm demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,' Biden said at his State of the Union address. 'Pass universal background checks. None of this violates the Second Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners.' He made a similar promise while running in 2020 but has not been able to get Congress' support. Biden has homed in on Trump's statements suggesting he would be open to cutting programs like Social Security and Medicare. In an interview with CNBC last month, Trump said: 'There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements,' Trump said on CNBC. Biden responded on X: 'Not on my watch.' He reiterated his vow to protect Social Security during his State of the Union address. 'Many of my Republican friends want to put Social Security on the chopping block,' Biden said 'If anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age I will stop them.' 'I will protect and strengthen Social Security and make the wealthy pay their fair share,' he added. ``\nPresident Joe Biden's main pitch to voters ahead of November is simple: They should vote for him because he is not Donald Trump.\nIn speeches and political events since his reelection campaign began in earnest earlier this year, Biden had said that his second term would essentially be a continuation of his first: 'Let's finish this job,' Biden said in a video announcing his reelection campaign last year.\nIn making his case to voters, Biden has contrasted his own ideas of governance with Trump's stated plans to drastically alter how the federal government works, how executive power would be used and how America's role on the world stage will change if the former president wins a second term.\nBiden, meanwhile, has promised to protect American democracy, pass a federal law to codify the right to an abortion into law, preserve the country's international alliances and agreements and deliver on climate benchmarks.\nHis ability to deliver on these promises even if he wins a second term, though, is not a certainty.

The children's mother, Veronica Butler, however, wanted more access to her kids than the court-ordered supervised Saturday visits she was allowed.\nIt was the latest flash point in a custody fight that had already gone on for five years.\nThese are some of the details investigators laid out in probable cause affidavits submitted as part of requests for warrants for the arrest of Adams, her boyfriend Tad Cullum and married couple Cole and Cora Twombly. Each has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of kidnapping and a count of conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the killings of Butler, who had children with Adams' son, and another woman, Jilian Kelley. This story uses the statements from the affidavits and other official statements to unravel how investigators say the murders happened.\nThe four suspects were walked separately into the Texas County Courthouse on Wednesday, each shackled and wearing a striped jail jumpsuit and protective vest.\nAll four defendants were denied bond during their initial court appearance, according to the court docket. They were assigned court-appointed attorneys with the Oklahoma Indigent Defense System, according to Charles Laughlin, the agency's executive director. The agency's policy is not to speak to the media regarding pending cases, Laughlin told CNN in an email.\nThe two victims, Butler and Kelley, disappeared in the empty, open landscape of Oklahoma's panhandle while traveling from Kansas to pick up Butler's children from Adams late last month.\nInvestigators say they were deliberately killed by Adams, Cullum and the Twomblys. And it wasn't the first time Butler had been in their sights.\nIn February, Adams, her boyfriend and the couple traveled to Butler's home near Hugoton, Kansas, intending to kill her, a witness told investigators.\nThey planned to throw an anvil through Butler's windshield while she was driving, reasoning that it would look like an accident, as anvils regularly fall off work vehicles, the witness added.\nBut Butler did not leave her home.\nAt about that time, Adams did an online search for how to get someone out of their house. She also looked up taser pain level, gun shops and prepaid cell phones, investigators said.\nShe bought three prepaid, unregistered burner phones from her nearest Walmart in February. Days after Butler filed for more visits with her children in March, Adams bought five stun guns at a local gun shop.\nThen, on Easter weekend, Adams gave time off to the woman who usually supervised Butler's visits with her children. The young children went to spend the night with some acquaintances.\nAnd the next day, Saturday, March 30, their mother was murdered, the charging documents say.\nAdams, 54, often seems to have had physical custody of her grandchildren, though her son Wrangler Rickman is their father and legal guardian. At the time Butler and Kelley went missing, Rickman was confirmed to be in a rehabilitation facility in Oklahoma City, officials said.\nAdams, the court papers said, at times refused to let her son have his children. On one occasion when that happened, law enforcement was called.\nInvestigators also believe Adams was the last person to be in touch with Butler.\nAdams told officers she had called Butler to check if she was coming for the usual Saturday visit. She said Butler told her that something had come up and she could not make it.\nPhone records confirmed the call had been made at 9 a.m. but also showed that at that time Butler was already in Hugoton to pick up Kelley, a pastor's wife, who had agreed to supervise Butler with her children.\nKelley was a stand-in for the usual supervisor, Cheryl Brune, whom Adams preferred and said was unavailable that day. Brune, however, told investigators she had been available, but was told by Adams to take a couple of weeks off.\nButler told relatives she would collect her children from the Four Corners intersection of US-64 and State Route 95 over the state line in Oklahoma, and then go to a birthday party with family. When she did not arrive at the celebration, relatives Melissa and Joey Padilla went to look for her, and found her vehicle abandoned about five miles north of the planned rendezvous, at which point they called police.\nThe intersection of Oklahoma State Highway 95 and Road L is one of those desolate places where the land seems utterly flat and you can see for miles. There are no trees to soften the wind and the dust that whip across the Great Plains, and no homes or traffic cameras nearby to help an investigation.\nBut officers immediately knew something was wrong, Texas County Sheriff Matt Boley told reporters. 'They found some things that just weren't adding up,' he said. 'We felt this wasn't a random deal.'\nInvestigators believe Butler and Kelley were lured to the location, arriving there at about 9:40 a.m. They say the women were forced into another vehicle and confined there.\nOfficers found blood on the road and off to the side, and Butler's glasses were on the ground, near a broken hammer. A magazine for a pistol was found in Kelley's purse, but no gun.\nBoth their phones stopped sending signals at 9:42 a.m.\nThe 16-year-old daughter of Cora Twombly became a crucial witness to the investigators putting together the probable cause affidavit.\nShe said she was told that her mother, 44, and her mother's husband Cole Twombly, 50, would be out when she woke that Saturday, as they were going to be on a 'mission.'\nShe described her mother and stepfather, as well as Adams and her boyfriend Cullum, as being part of an anti-government group with a religious affiliation. The group, which the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI) said was called God's Misfits, met weekly at the Twombly house or the home of another couple.\nAll four accused lived in various tiny towns, dotted far apart around the Oklahoma panhandle, about as near to Texas as to Kansas and Colorado. The roads between them are straight and long, cutting through farmland and cattle ranches. Once you leave one town, it can be 15 minutes of highway-speed driving before you reach the next.

She told investigators Adams had provided burner phones to the other accused, so they didn't need to use their personal devices to communicate, and that she had seen two of the phones charging on her mother's nightstand.\nAnd she said her mother told her the two couples were involved in the killings.\nWhen the teenager got up at about 10 a.m. that Saturday, the Twomblys were out as they had said they would be. They came back around noon, driving a blue and gray Chevrolet pickup they owned, and a blue flatbed pickup owned by a relative.\nThe daughter was told to clean the interior of the Chevrolet pickup. When she asked what had happened, she was told that things had not gone as planned but that they would not have to worry about Butler again.\nShe heard that her mother and stepfather blocked the road to stop Butler and Kelley in their vehicle and diverted them to where the others were waiting. She named another person who she said was involved, but authorities have said they are not looking for other suspects.\nShe said she asked about Kelley, the woman Butler had asked to accompany her to supervise the visit, and why she had to die.

She was told: 'Something like that.'\nAdams went to the home of the other couple who hosted God's Misfits meetings, where her grandchildren had spent the night, and picked them up at about the same time as the Twomblys had arrived home, the affidavit said.\nThe previous evening, Adams' boyfriend Cullum, 43, had been working on a property where he rented a pasture for cattle grazing. The property owner said Cullum had asked if he could do some work there with his skid steer, a kind of bulldozer. He had wanted to cut down a tree, remove a stump and bury some concrete, he said, according to the landowner's conversations with officials.\nThe owner agreed and told investigators that Cullum brought his equipment and did the work on Friday, March 29, possibly into the early hours.\nHe said the skid steer was left on his property that night and it was gone when he woke up at about noon on Saturday.\nInvestigators tracked all three of the burner phones to the area where Butler and Kelley disappeared \u2013 and at the time they disappeared \u2013 and two of them to the pasture used by Cullum, below a dam. A hole had been dug, filled back in and covered with hay.\nThe affidavit states the pasture was about 8.5 miles from where Butler's car was found empty. The drive time between the two points was 'well within' the 34 minutes between when the victims' phones stopped transmitting and the burner phones arrived at the pasture, it added.\nAll the prepaid burners stopped transmitting on the morning of March 30, either near the Twomblys' home or the rented pastureland.\nTwo sets of remains recovered from Texas County, Oklahoma, were confirmed to be those of Veronica Butler, 27, and Jilian Kelley, 39, on Tuesday evening.\nButler's relatives became emotional outside the Texas County Courthouse after attending Wednesday's initial appearance by the suspects.\n'How can you hate the mother of your grandchildren so much that you would end her life?' her aunt said between sobs to CNN affiliate KFDA.\nButler's younger siblings held back tears as they described the 'beautiful soul' that was taken from them too soon.\n'She's just like a sunflower, just like a beautiful sunflower looking in the sun.

The children's mother, Veronica Butler, however, wanted more access to her kids than the court-ordered supervised Saturday visits she was allowed.\nIt was the latest flash point in a custody fight that had already gone on for five years.\nThese are some of the details investigators laid out in probable cause affidavits submitted as part of requests for warrants for the arrest of Adams, her boyfriend Tad Cullum and married couple Cole and Cora Twombly. Each has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of kidnapping and a count of conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the killings of Butler, who had children with Adams' son, and another woman, Jilian Kelley. This story uses the statements from the affidavits and other official statements to unravel how investigators say the murders happened.\nThe four suspects were walked separately into the Texas County Courthouse on Wednesday, each shackled and wearing a striped jail jumpsuit and protective vest.\nAll four defendants were denied bond during their initial court appearance, according to the court docket. They were assigned court-appointed attorneys with the Oklahoma Indigent Defense System, according to Charles Laughlin, the agency's executive director. The agency's policy is not to speak to the media regarding pending cases, Laughlin told CNN in an email.\nThe two victims, Butler and Kelley, disappeared in the empty, open landscape of Oklahoma's panhandle while traveling from Kansas to pick up Butler's children from Adams late last month.\nInvestigators say they were deliberately killed by Adams, Cullum and the Twomblys. And it wasn't the first time Butler had been in their sights.\nIn February, Adams, her boyfriend and the couple traveled to Butler's home near Hugoton, Kansas, intending to kill her, a witness told investigators.\nThey planned to throw an anvil through Butler's windshield while she was driving, reasoning that it would look like an accident, as anvils regularly fall off work vehicles, the witness added.\nBut Butler did not leave her home.\nAt about that time, Adams did an online search for how to get someone out of their house. She also looked up taser pain level, gun shops and prepaid cell phones, investigators said.\nShe bought three prepaid, unregistered burner phones from her nearest Walmart in February. Days after Butler filed for more visits with her children in March, Adams bought five stun guns at a local gun shop.\nThen, on Easter weekend, Adams gave time off to the woman who usually supervised Butler's visits with her children. The young children went to spend the night with some acquaintances.\nAnd the next day, Saturday, March 30, their mother was murdered, the charging documents say.\nAdams, 54, often seems to have had physical custody of her grandchildren, though her son Wrangler Rickman is their father and legal guardian. At the time Butler and Kelley went missing, Rickman was confirmed to be in a rehabilitation facility in Oklahoma City, officials said.\nAdams, the court papers said, at times refused to let her son have his children. On one occasion when that happened, law enforcement was called.\nInvestigators also believe Adams was the last person to be in touch with Butler.\nAdams told officers she had called Butler to check if she was coming for the usual Saturday visit. She said Butler told her that something had come up and she could not make it.\nPhone records confirmed the call had been made at 9 a.m. but also showed that at that time Butler was already in Hugoton to pick up Kelley, a pastor's wife, who had agreed to supervise Butler with her children.\nKelley was a stand-in for the usual supervisor, Cheryl Brune, whom Adams preferred and said was unavailable that day. Brune, however, told investigators she had been available, but was told by Adams to take a couple of weeks off.\nButler told relatives she would collect her children from the Four Corners intersection of US-64 and State Route 95 over the state line in Oklahoma, and then go to a birthday party with family. When she did not arrive at the celebration, relatives Melissa and Joey Padilla went to look for her, and found her vehicle abandoned about five miles north of the planned rendezvous, at which point they called police.\nThe intersection of Oklahoma State Highway 95 and Road L is one of those desolate places where the land seems utterly flat and you can see for miles. There are no trees to soften the wind and the dust that whip across the Great Plains, and no homes or traffic cameras nearby to help an investigation.\nBut officers immediately knew something was wrong, Texas County Sheriff Matt Boley told reporters. 'They found some things that just weren't adding up,' he said. 'We felt this wasn't a random deal.'\nInvestigators believe Butler and Kelley were lured to the location, arriving there at about 9:40 a.m. They say the women were forced into another vehicle and confined there.\nOfficers found blood on the road and off to the side, and Butler's glasses were on the ground, near a broken hammer. A magazine for a pistol was found in Kelley's purse, but no gun.\nBoth their phones stopped sending signals at 9:42 a.m.\nThe 16-year-old daughter of Cora Twombly became a crucial witness to the investigators putting together the probable cause affidavit.\nShe said she was told that her mother, 44, and her mother's husband Cole Twombly, 50, would be out when she woke that Saturday, as they were going to be on a 'mission.'\nShe described her mother and stepfather, as well as Adams and her boyfriend Cullum, as being part of an anti-government group with a religious affiliation. The group, which the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI) said was called God's Misfits, met weekly at the Twombly house or the home of another couple.\nAll four accused lived in various tiny towns, dotted far apart around the Oklahoma panhandle, about as near to Texas as to Kansas and Colorado. The roads between them are straight and long, cutting through farmland and cattle ranches. Once you leave one town, it can be 15 minutes of highway-speed driving before you reach the next.

Her book, 'From India with Love,' was published in 2015. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion . When news broke of a stabbing, and mass killing, at a Sydney shopping mall in which a baby was attacked, right-wing commentators overseas were quick to falsely diagnose the motive.\n'Another day. Another terror attack by another Islamist terrorist. Six dead, others seriously injured, including a baby,' tweeted the British right-wing commentator Julia Hartley-Brewer.\nBut Hartley-Brewer was wrong. And she later acknowledged the post was incorrect.\nThe motive was not Islamist but an everyday threat for women: gendered violence.\nIt was 'obvious' said the New South Wales Police Commissioner Karen Webb, that now-deceased attacker Joel Cauchi, a diagnosed schizophrenic according to his family, had a specific kind of victim in mind when he entered the beach suburb of Bondi's busy Westfield shopping center on Saturday.\n'The videos (of the attack) speak for themselves don't they?' Webb told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).\n'It's obvious to me, it's obvious to detectives, that that seems to be an area of interest, that the offender had focussed on women and avoided the men.\n'Five of the (six) deceased are women and the majority of victims in hospital are also women,' she said.\nWebb added that police didn't know what was in the mind of Cauchi when he launched his attack.\nDetectives will certainly be trawling through his online activity to see if he belonged to any hate groups that operate in the darkest corners of the web.\nCauchi's father Andrew Cauchi \u2014 who appeared devastated \u2014 believes his 'monster' son may have deliberately set out to kill women, he told Australian media.\n'Because he wanted a girlfriend, and he has no social skills, and he was frustrated out of his brain,' added the visibly distraught father.\nLike Cauchi's father, the nation is also traumatised. Multiple people, including a new mother, slaughtered in daylight in an affluent suburb is something Australians read about in the news when it happens in other countries.\nRarely does it occur in their backyard. When it did in 1996 after the Port Arthur Massacre when a lone gunman killed 35 people, then-prime minister John Howard, a Conservative leader, acted - with bipartisan support that has remained rock solid ever since.\nHe enacted strict gun control laws and initated a massive buyback scheme. He had to stare down political opposition from his own supporters at the time, but his tough stance has been vindicated by the lack of mass shootings ever since.\nBut restricting public access to weapons with the capability of mass lethality cannot stop hateful ideologies mixing with other noxious ingredients including radicalisation and mental health issues.\nThis includes misogyny.\nAustralian women live with some of the most sexist attitudes in the world, according to research presented to the London-based Global Institute for Women's Leadership, chaired by Australia's former and only female prime minister, Julia Gillard.\nAccording to Our Watch, Australia's leading national violence prevention organisation which provided me with the following statistics, two in five women have experienced violence since the age of 15, but it is far more likely \u2014 35% versus 11% \u2014 to be at the hands of someone they know, rather than a complete stranger.\nThis is partly why the Bondi attack was so shocking.\nOur Watch CEO Patty Kinnersly told me that while the motivating factors in Saturday's attack were complex and still not determined, the case showed why addressing sexist attitudes was critical to women's safety.\nWhile we cannot speak directly about the causes or motives for this specific incident, we know that more broadly, evidence does not point to mental illness being a driver of violence against women.\nPatty Kinnersly\n'While we cannot speak directly about the causes or motives for this specific incident, we know that more broadly, evidence does not point to mental illness being a driver of violence against women,' she said.\n'The evidence consistently shows that the underlying causes of violence directed toward women are rigid gender stereotypes, sexism and disrespect.\n'The sad reality is that when men hold unequal and sexist views about women, women are not safe.'\nThe city was rocked again by a second and shockingly violent attack on Monday night, when a teenager stabbed worshippers, including Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel giving mass at the Assyrian Orthodox Christ The Good Shepherd Church.\nUnlike Cauchi's deadly rampage, the church attack was declared a terrorist act.\nRoman Quaedvlieg, who worked in Australian law enforcement for decades, including on counterterrorism, told me the motivations behind the types of attacks witnessed in Sydney in the space of just a few days were often driven by a complex set of factors.\n'These can be rooted in deep-seated emotional or psychological causes and are often accompanied by mental ill-health, and/or substance abuse,' he said.\n'Lone actor terrorists in non-conflict areas like Australia usually are young males with emotional or psychological vulnerabilities, who are often social misfits as a result of those vulnerabilities,' he added.\nQuaedvlieg said technology meant that the path to radicalisation was so swift, it could go unnoticed.\n'I do believe that the evolution of technology, online connectivity, and the proliferation of video images, particularly when they lionize violence, does inspire, embolden, normalise and instruct those who have a disposition to extremism and violence,' he said.\nHe added that the motivations for attacks didn't need to be the same for them to inspire other radicals.\n'Considering the attacks occurred in the same city, the short span of time between the attacks and the wide publicity dedicated to the Bondi Junction attack, it is possible that the Wakeley attacker was either motivated to seek similar notoriety, or the Bondi Junction attack gave him confidence to act on an intent he had previously harboured,' he said.\nBut one commonality between the two males was their history with knives.\nJoel Cauchi had a fixation with blades and kept a collection of them, his father told the newspaper The Australian.\nAnd the 16-year-old boy arrested for the church attack was charged with possessing a knife, in November last year, according to the ABC.\nThe ABC also reported that the boy used a switchblade, an illegal weapon in Australia. His attack inside the church did not kill anyone.\nImagine if they'd been obsessed with guns.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook If he had been living in the United States, might Cauchi have been able to slaughter many many more women because of that country's much easier access to assault rifle-style semi-automatic firearms?\nBecause of technology, the ability for self-radicalization \u2014 whatever the combination of motivating factors \u2014 is speedier now than in the days when Howard had the foresight to ban weapons capable of causing mass casualties in seconds.\nAustralia is rocked by the tragedy. Mums and Dads will be holding their children a little tighter this week.\nThe twin attacks are horrifying, distressing and shocking but partly why it is so especially shocking is that unlike the US where mass shootings sadly never feel out of the headlines for long, violence in Australia at the scale witnessed these past few days has been rare.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Opinion Latika Bourke,Latika Bourke","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-04-16t083403z-1909137027-rc2h77a1d4va-rtrmadp-3-australia-crime-2.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@CNNOpinions","_score":5.9723306,"_id":"17e32d43676c6565f725dbaf63cb99c9"},{"title":"At least 2 killed, 14 injured in shooting at Memphis block party, police say","author":"Paradise Afshar","published_date":"2024-04-21 03:38:27","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/20/us/memphis-shooting-orange-mound-block-party","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Two people were killed and at least 14 others were injured in a block party shooting in Memphis, Tennessee, late Saturday, police said.","summary":"Two people were killed and at least 14 others were injured in a block party shooting in Memphis, Tennessee, late Saturday, police said.\nThree of those injured were taken to hospitals in critical condition and 11 more arrived at hospitals in private vehicles, according to the Memphis Police Department.

But she made sure everyone heard the line she's come up with: 'Trump abortion bans.'\nAnd not one pro-Palestinian protester interrupted her that day, or, for that matter, over her four-day campaign swing West.\nThe vice president is clearly feeling energized these days. She is more engaged. She is looser. Aides say she was the one who pushed to explicitly call out former President Donald Trump as responsible for every rollback in abortion rights, and she is clearly feeding on the old prosecutorial rush of tearing apart the opposition's argument.\nIn a conference room in the back of a campaign office in a Las Vegas strip mall, Harris said she is finding the last few months, on the attack and able to zero in on the contrast with Trump, 'very liberating.'\n'You can't forget that for the first probably year and a half, we were landlocked. It was basically me and Joe and a Zoom screen,' she told CNN, in an exclusive interview at the end of the multiday campaign swing, built in part around getting her to battlegrounds Arizona and Nevada, and around what staff has found to be helpful downtime back home in Los Angeles cooking Sunday dinner. 'Being out and being able to just have real conversations and not soundbites in an interview \u2014 it is liberating.'\nNo one in the vice president's orbit, including Harris herself, needs to be reminded how the disappointment and disenchantment from her first years on the job still hang over her, or how odd it is that some voters say in interviews with CNN and outside focus groups they are inclined toward Biden but are turned off by Harris.\nCNN's conversations with two dozen aides to the vice president, the reelection campaign and other top Democrats also show the paradox that even the most Biden-centric aides have been forced to grudgingly admit: There is another swath of voters turned off by the president \u2014 and their internal data shows Harris will be critical to getting them if Biden wants to win a second term.\nAfter years of being shunted to politically toxic and fruitless parts of the administration portfolio, such as overseeing migration negotiations with Central American leaders, or clearly junior varsity ones like chairing the National Space Council, these days are so full of plum assignments for Harris that her trip to Arizona was originally supposed to be to promote the latest round of student loan debt cancellation \u2014 only to get quickly changed when the state Supreme Court ruled that Arizona must adhere to its 1864 abortion ban.\n'She has been front and center on so many of the most politically potent issues right now,' said Julie Chavez Rodriguez, who was a top aide to Harris for years before becoming the Biden reelection campaign manager, calling these 'new opportunities to speak to the coalitions we know she already has a deep affinity to, but on issues that are top of mind for those voters.'\n'As a former prosecutor, she can prosecute the case on so much,' Rodriguez said.\nIt means getting to talk about gun control and reaching out to younger voters like the gym full of high schoolers in Vegas who cheered even more loudly for her than they did when Marvel actress Xochitl Gomez took the stage first. ('She's killing it!' an excited 15-year-old in a Barbie-pink denim jacket exclaimed after pushing up to take a photo with Harris as Aretha Franklin's 'Respect' played on the speakers.)\nWhile Biden talks about threats to democracy, Harris talks about 'freedom' under assault \u2014 a way of thinking that she said feels rooted in her life and in the lives of the voters she is after. It's the stories she used to tell about being taken to civil rights protests when she was in her stroller. It's showing up at the Cow Palace in San Francisco when she was district attorney to join the chants to close the 'gun show loophole' \u2014 as Biden did earlier this month in a new action to crack down on buyers at gun shows avoiding background checks.\n'I grew up the child of parents who fought for civil rights and freedoms,' she said, 'so this really does cut at the core for me around what's important about our country and what's at stake in the country.'\nMore often these days, she's invoking the 'prosecutor for president' framing that defined her own presidential campaign more than four years ago. She likes facts, she says. She likes using them to show she is right and has been right all along about what she says Trump is after.\n'The prosecutor approach is really about just deconstructing an issue,' she said. 'It's presenting and reminding folks about the empirical evidence that shows us exactly how we arrived at this point. \u2026 He can't hide from this stuff.'\nJust before coming on stage in Arizona, Harris and a few aides scrambled to add in a line to go right at what Trump had said minutes before \u2014 that the US Supreme Court's Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade is 'working the way it is supposed to.'\nDobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade is 'working the way it is supposed to.' 'Here's what a second Trump term looks like: More bans, more suffering and less freedom,' she told those gathered in Tucson, warning a national abortion ban and restrictions on abortion medications loom.\n'Shame! Shame! Shame!' the crowd started chanting.\nBy that evening, at a $1.5 million fundraiser in 'Family Guy' creator Seth MacFarlane's tree-filled living room in a Beverly Hills house with a 360-degree view of Los Angeles, and then in front of a luncheon for Black women in power the next day, she had started building that into a pursed lip, lowered voice Trump impression of her own, mocking the former president as saying, 'Well, you know, the states will do what they want to do.'\nDuring her own run for president, Harris was often derided as having no core and just chasing situational politics. By the end of the swing through Nevada, she was the one coming at Trump for being a weathervane on even the most fundamental issues of belief and politics.\n'It's not as though he has any real explanation. There's a lot of what he's doing that is just to suggest that he took a different tact,' she said of Trump's shifting arguments about whether and when to have abortion bans. 'There's a lot of benefit to being unburdened by ideology.'\nHarris' small staff has struggled since her inauguration to keep up with a scrutiny no previous vice president has faced, so even with the significantly stepped-up travel schedule these days, they have been grateful for help from new campaign hires in fielding press requests or just handling event logistics.\nFor the candidate herself, the shift has been more existential.\nBiden's personality fit the unstructured ambiguity of the modern vice presidency. He could be the presidential adviser, or the chummy cheerleader schmoozing hours after the conversations were scheduled to end.\nNot Harris. She likes a plan. She thrives with a goal. Left to her own, people who know her and were sometimes involved say she often let a small circle of friends and advisers into her head, getting into agonizing spirals of what else she should be doing, but also why she wasn't doing more, but also what would happen if she did try to do more.\nThree years of telling Harris she was supposed to establish herself led to more stress over what that could mean more than any actual progress.\n'It took me way longer than two years how to figure out how to be a good United States senator, and her job is a lot harder than mine,' said Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a longtime leader on the gun safety movement who has often talked about how engaged he has found Harris to be. 'There's no doubt she's better at the job today than she was in Year 1.'\nRunning for vice president has the definition that being vice president lacks. It's tactics, strategy, a target, a goal. Given a mission, aides have found Harris to be an extremely effective performance player, whether pressuring interest group leaders dragging their feet to support Biden or helping deliver the battlegrounds where she is shining more.\n'What business do we need to accomplish?' is a line Harris tends to use and that staff have learned to use themselves to prod her.\nWith Harris hyperaware of the filters she believes go over her every word and move, aides know better than to use the phrase 'attack dog' in a planning meeting with her. She won't risk being seen as an angry Black woman. She won't be the traditional running mate all-purpose battering ram.\nAt her first event in Las Vegas last week, Harris asked students to raise their hands if they were ever in an active shooter drill; dozens of hands went up. She told them about the blood stains on the floor and abandoned valentines still strewn around the preserved Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School she toured in Parkland, Florida, last month, and about a student from another school who confided that she didn't like going to fifth period because there was no closet in that room to hide in.\nHarris has a way of telling stories like these that spark audible reactions of shock and outrage from the crowd. She did it there, and again an hour later while talking about abortion, decrying how having no exception for rape is 'immoral,' resulting in a survivor of 'violence to their body \u2014 that they don't have the right to determine what happens to their body next.'\n'There's a certain level of authority that comes with having a uterus and being a woman,' said New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, praising how Harris has been leading the charge for the administration on reproductive rights.\n'They have the potential to tell a really interesting story and vision that connects with younger people, but there's a long way to go from here to there,' said John Della Volpe, a pollster who specializes in younger voters and is not affiliated with the reelection campaign. 'She can translate that in a more emotional and evocative way that resonates with young people.'\nFor Harris, it's at least the feeling, for the first time in a long time, of standing up and standing out on her own. These days, Trump campaign aides don't talk much about her, despite past Republicans' attempts to make her a liability for Biden. But she's eager to take on whoever Trump picks as his own running mate.\n'I am ready,' she threw down, 'for whoever has the, fill in the blank, to do it.'\nFor all the efforts, the campaign and Harris' own staff still aren't quite sure what people make of her. In the last few months, they invested in asking voters about her, including having the Democratic National Committee pay for focus groups in Milwaukee run by an operative who has long worked for her.\nThe bad news: Several people said Harris rubs them the wrong way, in all the ways that are familiar from criticism of her. A few specifically cited her laugh \u2014 a frequent target of Republican operatives who flood clips of it on social media, which defenders say plays into sexism.\nThe good news, as described to CNN by several people familiar with the findings: People said they would much rather hear from Harris than Biden on abortion, guns, student loans and Gaza.\nMultiple people asked said they didn't think Harris had been treated well. They questioned whether Biden actually likes her.\nHarris has internalized skepticism about campaign data \u2014 'I give polls only so much credit,' she said in the interview \u2014 but around her, the responses were validation of years of grumbling that Biden should have been better setting up his heir apparent, and that perhaps they are now both in danger of paying the price.\nYet the rivalry still bubbles up. Some Biden aides greeted the findings with frustration, annoyed by the suggestion that the president will need to lean on her more. Questions about where Harris is more resonant immediately lead Biden aides to stress that they are complementary components of the campaign, and that the president, not her, is the one who can do things like go to Pittsburgh to propose new tariffs on Chinese steel.\nHarris has integrated so much into the work of the administration that Air Force Two sat on the tarmac for an hour recently, delaying a campaign-geared trip to North Carolina as she listened in on Biden's call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which she has done without public announcement throughout the Israel-Hamas war.\nBut in a March speech in Alabama, Harris called for 'an immediate ceasefire,' waited for applause, and only then added, 'for at least the next six weeks' to get the Israeli hostages out of Gaza. West Wing aides fumed both at the noticeable pause \u2014 even though the position was the same as Biden's \u2014 and at hearing that Harris' aides had alerted reporters ahead of time that they should watch the speech.\nLikewise, when CNN reported in February that Harris had been holding private meetings with top Democratic officials to discuss campaign strategy, top Biden aides spread word to several who attended that they had not realized these were happening.\n'There's so many ways in which they are able to complement one another and speak to our core audiences from different perspectives that reinforce who we are as a campaign and as an administration at this unique moment in time,' said Rodriguez, the Biden campaign manager.\nThe solution for Harris, aides believe, is exposure. Though many leading Democrats think she'd have a hard path to a future presidential nomination, aides believe they can at least boost her numbers by getting her out more.\nBut the day job still gets in the way. A long-anticipated appearance on Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show was postponed last week, according to people familiar, rather than risking a setback to being taken seriously by laughing it up on a comedy show in the midst of a crisis.\nWith under 200 days until the election, they are not sure when she will get back.\nShe's already scripted some bits, though.\nWhen MacFarlane asked her at the fundraiser who her favorite Trump is, she knew the question was coming. No purposeful pause this time.\n'Alec Baldwin,' she shot back.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Edward-Isaac Dovere","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2147839782.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":5.7731457,"_id":"b5307d80194ea2d7c06c3c8dd6dfd957"},{"title":"Former Philadelphia police officer pleads guilty over fatally shooting 12-year-old in the back","author":"Zenebou Sylla","published_date":"2024-04-21 00:39:21","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/20/us/philadelphia-police-tj-siderio-shooting","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"A former Philadelphia police officer pleaded guilty Friday over fatally shooting a 12-year-old boy in the back in March 2022, according to court documents.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 A former Philadelphia police officer pleaded guilty Friday over fatally shooting a 12-year-old boy in the back in March 2022, according to court documents.\nEdsaul Mendoza, 28, pleaded guilty to third-degree murder and possession of an instrument of crime, according to a criminal docket seen by CNN. Third-degree murder can carry a sentence of up to 40 years.\nMendoza was initially charged with first-degree murder but the charge has since been dismissed.\nCNN has reached out to Mendoza's attorney, Charles Gibbs, for comment.\nMendoza was one of four plainclothes officers on patrol who pulled up to 12-year-old Thomas 'TJ' Siderio and a 17-year-old identified as 'NK,' Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said.\nTJ then 'likely' fired at the vehicle and a bullet entered the rear window, Krasner told CNN previously. While three of the officers took cover, Mendoza engaged in a 'tactically unsound' foot chase of the boy and shot at him three times, even though he had thrown away the gun, Krasner said.\n'Justice must be evenhanded. Everyone must be accountable under the law,' Krasner told CNN Saturday.\nWhen Mendoza was charged in 2022, Krasner said the boy was unarmed and on the ground when the officer fired.\nSergeant Eric Gripp from the Philadelphia Police Department called the incident a 'tragedy' in a statement Friday.\n'It is compounded by the fact that a life was taken by someone who swore an oath to uphold the law and protect the community,' Gripp said. 'The Philadelphia Police Department's duty is to serve this city with honor and integrity, and the actions of an individual officer don't represent the professionalism and commitment of the thousands of dedicated Philadelphia Police officers who put on this uniform each and every day.'\nThe former police officer is expected to be sentenced in late July.\nMendoza was fired by Danielle M.

This is our worst nightmare come true. And our thoughts right now are with the families of those two officers, those heroes,' Mayor Ben Walsh said at a news conference.\nThe police deaths add to the at least 38 law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty so far this year, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page. Last year, 136 officers died in the line of duty across the US, according to a report from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, a 39% decrease from 224 deaths in 2022.\nThe incident in upstate New York began just after 7 p.m., when two Syracuse Police Department officers tried to pull over a suspicious vehicle, Chief Joseph Cecile said at the news conference. The driver didn't stop and the officers lost sight of the vehicle, Cecile said, but they used the license plate to link it to a home in nearby Liverpool.\nThe officers asked for assistance from the Onondaga County Sheriff's Office after learning the person driving the vehicle may be armed, Cecile said. Members of each department arrived at the home around the same time.\n'While they were inspecting the vehicle and saw what looked to be guns inside, they heard what sounded like someone manipulating a firearm from inside the residence,' Cecile said. 'Moments later, there was an exchange of gunfire between at least one suspect and the officers and the deputies.'\nAn officer, a deputy and the suspect were all shot and pronounced dead at a hospital, Cecile said, noting the investigation is ongoing.\nThe identities of the fallen officers and the suspect haven't been released.\nThe officer had been on the job for about three years, Cecile said.

Eight people remained in hospital Monday in conditions ranging from critical to stable with four discharged in the past 24 hours, according to New South Wales' Minister for Health Ryan Park.\nThe stabbing spree only ended when Cauchi was shot dead at the scene by an officer who single-handedly pursued him through the mall.\nNew South Wales Police Commissioner Karen Webb told ABC Breakfast News Monday that while police do not yet know the attacker's motivation, the fact he appeared to target women is 'certainly a line of enquiry for us.'\n'The videos (of the attack) speak for themselves don't they,' Webb said. 'It's obvious to me, it's obvious to the detectives that that seems to be an area of interest, that the offender had focused on women and avoided the men.'\nAuthorities warned the investigation could take weeks and police will continue to interview witnesses and follow different lines of enquiry.\nPolice had earlier said Cauchi, from the neighboring state of Queensland, was known to authorities and had 'suffered from mental health [issues]' though he had not been prosecuted or charged with any previous criminal offense in the state.\nThe state's Premier Chris Minns declared Monday a national day of mourning and said Australian national flags will be flown at half-mast on government buildings. Sydney's Opera House will be lit up in black ribbon to commemorate those killed in the attack.\n'Families are in mourning today, lives have been devastated as a result of these criminal actions,' Minn said. 'The people who were killed were\u2026 innocent people who had their entire lives ahead of them. The community is devastated in the knowledge of their loss.'\nPolice said Monday they had concluded their examinations of the shopping mall and the crime scene was being handed back to Westfield. More than 100 pieces of evidence were removed and will be forensically examined as part of the investigation, said Yasmin Catley, New South Wales Minister for Police.\nMore details are emerging about the six people killed in Saturday's attack, including a mother whose baby was also stabbed, a Chinese student, and a security guard who was on his first day keeping watch at the mall that was struck.\nAmong the victims is Ashlee Good, 38, who was described by her family in a statement as 'a beautiful mother, daughter, sister, partner, friend, all round outstanding human and so much more.'\nGood was rushed to hospital in critical condition but later died from her injuries. Her nine-month-old daughter was also stabbed in the attack and received emergency surgery overnight.\n'We can report that after hours of surgery yesterday our baby is currently doing well,' the family said in the statement.\nMinister for Health Park said the whole country had been 'holding its breath' for news of the baby's condition. He said she had moved from critical to serious, which was 'a significant improvement' and doctors hoped to move the baby onto a ward in the coming days.\n'In the darkest of times comes sometimes the brightest of lights,' he said. 'Staff have literally performed miracles and people are alive because of their efforts.'\nThe Good family said that 'words cannot express our gratitude' to the 'two men who held and cared for our baby when Ashlee could not.'\nTwo brothers had earlier told CNN affiliate 9 News they tried to help by compressing the bleeding after they saw the mother and baby had been stabbed.\n'We were holding the baby and trying to compress the baby,' one said.\nFaraz Tahir, 30, was also identified as among those killed. He was described in a statement from the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community of Australia as an 'integral member of our community, known for his unwavering dedication and kindness.'\nTahir was on duty as a security guard at the mall at the time of the attack, the statement said, and is the only male victim.\nIt was his first day on the job in that location, his friend Adnan Qadir told CNN affiliate 7 News.\n'He was really excited. He had a lot of ambition for his future, just settling into his new country\u2026 He was looking forward to a stable career to make a family up here. And it's just sad how it all ended up.'\nThe community said Tahir was a refugee who had fled persecution in his home country of Pakistan and sought refuge in Australia a year ago.\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told KIIS 1065 radio on Monday that the sixth victim was identified as Yixuan Cheng, a Chinese national who was studying in Australia.\nThe Chinese Embassy in Australia confirmed that one Chinese national had died and another was seriously injured in the attack.\nMeanwhile, the officer who shot the mall attacker has been praised as a hero for her actions, which authorities said undoubtably saved more lives.\nSenior police inspector Amy Scott arrived on the scene first and was alone when she engaged the attacker. She shot him when he lunged at her with a knife, police said.\nRelated card Witnesses describe scenes of pandemonium\nRelated card Witnesses describe scenes of pandemonium Video on local media showed Scott administering CPR on the attacker after he was shot.\nScott is a highly trained officer who 'did what she was trained to do\u2026 We are very grateful to her,' said Yasmin Catley, New South Wales Minister for Police.\nPolice Commissioner Webb told ABC news that Scott was 'doing ok' and 'spending some time with her family.'\n'She's an experienced officer. I've known Amy for many years, she's been operational her whole career,' Webb said.\nAustralia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called Scott a hero who 'no doubt saved lives.'\nAuthorities described the mall attacker Cauchi as an 'itinerant' who had moved from place to place over the past few years, often sleeping rough or in his vehicle.\nThe last interaction Queensland Police had with him was in December 2023, when he was 'street checked,' Queensland Police Assistant Commissioner Roger Lowe said Sunday.\n'We believe he has been sleeping in a vehicle or out of backpacks\u2026 His family don't have regular contact with their son,' he said.\nLowe said Cauchi had 'not been prosecuted or charged with any criminal offense in Queensland or found in possession of knives in the street checks.'\nCauchi's family released a statement saying he 'has battled with mental health issues' since he was a teenager.\n'Joel's actions were truly horrific, and we are still trying to comprehend what has happened,' the family said.\n'We are in contact with both the New South Wales Police Force and Queensland Police Service and have no issues with the Police Officer who shot our son as she was only doing her job to protect others, and we hope she is coping alright,' the statement said.\nAn $AU 18 million independent public inquiry has been launched to look at the police response and criminal investigation into the attack, as well as the attacker's interactions with the state government and health agencies, New South Wales Premier Minns said Monday.\nMass casualty events are rare in Australia and gun ownership was strictly controlled following the 1996 Port Arthur mass shooting when a lone gunman killed 35 people.\nHowever, many campaigners and criminologists say violence against women remains stubbornly prevalent and often overlooked.\nThe number of women killed by violence in Australia has ranged between 43 and 84 each year since Counting Dead Women began tallying deaths in 2012. Already in 2024, 24 women have died violently, the group said.\nIn the aftermath of Saturday's rampage, the government said it was also looking at potential changes to restrictions on security guards in major crowded centers such as shopping centers and hospitals.\nMinn ruled out allowing security guards to carry stun guns or firearms though, and gave no further details.\n'The government is not considering policy changes in relation to stun guns or firearms,' he said. 'We don't believe that more firearms in the community is a good decision, but we're looking at the current restrictions that are in place for equipment, for security guards, and the resulting training that would be required if there was to be a policy change.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Sandi Sidhu,Slept Rough,Helen Regan","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2147763242.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":5.6131144,"_id":"37a5d7e9613f981d5e54fc2b4fc748ef"},{"title":"Rick Santorum Fast Facts","author":"Editorial Research","published_date":"2024-04-19 18:03:19","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2013/05/13/us/rick-santorum-fast-facts/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Read Rick Santorum Fast Facts on CNN.com and learn more about the former Pennsylvania congressman and former presidential candidate.","summary":"Here's a look at the life of Rick Santorum, former Pennsylvania congressman.\nBirth date: May 10, 1958\nBirth date: May 10, 1958 Birth place: Winchester, Virginia\nBirth place: Winchester, Virginia Birth name: Richard John Santorum\nBirth name: Richard John Santorum Father: Aldo Santorum, a psychologist\nFather: Aldo Santorum, a psychologist Mother: Catherine (Dughi) Santorum, a nurse\nMother: Catherine (Dughi) Santorum, a nurse Marriage: Karen (Garver) Santorum (1990-present)\nMarriage: Karen (Garver) Santorum (1990-present) Children: Isabella, 2008; Patrick, 2001; Peter, 1999; Sarah, 1998; Gabriel, born and died in 1996; Daniel, 1995; Richard Jr., 1993; Elizabeth, 1991\nChildren: Isabella, 2008; Patrick, 2001; Peter, 1999; Sarah, 1998; Gabriel, born and died in 1996; Daniel, 1995; Richard Jr., 1993; Elizabeth, 1991 Education: Pennsylvania State University, B.A., Political Science, 1980; University of Pittsburgh, M.B.A., 1981; Dickinson School of Law, J.D., 1986\nEducation: Pennsylvania State University, B.A., Political Science, 1980; University of Pittsburgh, M.B.A., 1981; Dickinson School of Law, J.D., 1986 Religion: Roman Catholic\nReligion: Roman Catholic Member of the 'Gang of Seven,' a group that exposed and condemned scandals in Congress, when in the House of Representatives.\nFounded the Congressional Working Group on Religious Freedom.\nKnown for spearheading and helping to pass the welfare reform bill and a ban on partial-birth abortion.\n1981-1986 - Administrative assistant to Pennsylvania state Senator J.

The underwritten, somewhat messy results are broadly entertaining if not fully seaworthy from a dramatic point of view.\nGiven that Henry Cavill (having entered his spy phase, between this and 'Argylle') and Alan Ritchson ('Reacher') bring their considerable brawn to the festivities, it's somewhat ironic how thin and un-fleshed-out the characters are. While Ritchie might have been in a hurry to get into the action, it comes at the expense of an investment in the individuals beyond the dire nature of the plot.\nThat plot involves a secretive version of a nascent special-ops team \u2013 given the go-ahead by Winston Churchill himself (an unrecognizable Rory Kinnear) \u2013 a real group whose existence remained classified for decades before being detailed in a 2014 book. Adding a pinch of 'The Dirty Dozen,' the squad operated under the leadership of a bad-attitude agent, Cavill's Gus March-Phillipps, who had to be sprung from military prison to lead the group.\nKnown as Operation Postmaster, the mission played a vital role in the war effort, seeking to sideline the supply chain outfitting Germany's U-boats, knowing that the submarines' presence in the Atlantic had, among other things, helped keep the US out of the war. Specifically, March-Phillipps and company are tasked with blowing up a supply vessel that requires overcoming enormous odds, understanding that the British government will disavow them, and the Germans will torture and kill them.\n'The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare' takes on the Nazis\n01:53 - Source: CNN\n01:53 - Source: CNN The central quintet (rounded out by Henry Golding of 'Crazy Rich Asians,' Hero Fiennes Tiffin and Alex Pettyfer) also receives logistical help from a female spy ('3 Body Problem' star Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez) tasked with seducing and distracting the German commander ('Basterds'' Til Schweiger) and a resourceful businessman (Babs Olusanmokun) operating out of the port, on the Spanish island Fernando Po, where the boat is docked.\nFrom the opening sequence, Ritchie (who previously teamed with Cavill on 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.') works from the well-founded theory that the cathartic act of killing Nazis during World War II doesn't require explanation. In keeping with a long tradition of movies built around dangerous wartime assignments ('The Guns of Navarone' also comes to mind), the best-laid plans never quite follow the script and inevitably call for improvisation.\nStill, the desire to adapt the film to fit producer Jerry Bruckheimer's blockbuster filmography and Ritchie's kinetic style keeps dragging it in that direction and away from the grit that would bolster its historical underpinnings. The closing crawl provides a clearer sense of those, in a way that merely heightens a wish Ritchie and his script collaborators had toned down the embellishment.\nThose who choose to can enjoy the movie strictly for its red-carpet-friendly cast and muscular mix of a caper with check-your-brain-at-the-door-type action. Even so, a bit more brains to go with all that brawn would have improved things considerably, and maybe even made these gentlemen (and lady) operators seem a bit more special.\n'The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare' premieres April 19 in US theaters.

At least since the New Deal 90 years ago, Republicans have been the party most likely to frame their agenda as advancing 'freedom' and 'liberty' while Democrats have more often emphasized ideas such as 'equality' and 'justice.'\nRepublicans haven't abandoned their rhetorical efforts to claim the terrain of freedom. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for instance, used the word almost as a mantra the past few years to denounce the restrictions many states imposed to fight the spread of Covid-19 and to attack what he calls the left's effort to impose 'woke ideology.' And Trump disparages Biden's agenda to promote the deployment of electric vehicles as an attempt to deny Americans' freedom to continue purchasing gas-powered cars and trucks.\nBut the GOP push at every level of government to roll back the 'rights revolution' of the past six decades \u2013 symbolized by the proliferation of red-state laws limiting access to abortion and potentially other reproductive health care such as IVF \u2013 has provided Democrats a historic opportunity to reverse the direction of this long-running debate, many analysts agree.\n'Historically, Republicans have rooted their philosophical world view in liberty: for them it's about freedom to own guns, to practice religion as they see fit' or reducing government taxes, spending and regulation, said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute, which studies the intersection of culture and politics. 'What's new is Democrats are using the term in ways to reimagine what freedom really means.'\nTransforming the debate over freedom may be especially crucial for Biden because polls consistently show Trump with a double-digit lead when voters are asked who they trust more to handle the economy. That means that to win the election Biden will need to convince a substantial number of voters who believe Trump is better for their bottom line to vote against him anyway. The interrelated issues revolving around rights, values and democracy likely offer the president his best chance to do so. 'If any issue' is going to flip voters who express more confidence in Trump on the economy, 'it is going to be social issues like abortion,' said Deckman.\nBiden signaled the central role freedom would play in his campaign messaging from the outset, in the video he released last year announcing his plan to seek reelection. As an ominous piano key trills behind images of the January 6, 2021, insurrection, abortion rights protesters and the White House, Biden opens the video with a stark declaration: 'Freedom. Personal freedom is fundamental to who we are as Americans. There's nothing more important. Nothing more sacred.' Later he says: 'The question we're facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer. I know what I want the answer to be, and I think you do too.'\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security.\nRoe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security. Harris, who has been the administration's point person in delivering the freedom message, has likewise cast an expansive net. When Harris delivered a Martin Luther King Day speech to the NAACP this year that summarized the administration's case for another term, she cited all the issues Biden did in the video and others, such as the restrictions several red states have imposed on the teaching of the nation's racial history and the right 'to live free from the horror of gun violence.'\nWay to Win, a liberal group that funds organizations and campaigns focusing on voters of color, has been pushing the party for several years to emphasize the freedom argument. Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, the group's vice president and chief strategy officer, says linking all these other issues to abortion is key to portraying Trump and his allies as a threat to freedom.\n'If [abortion] was the only thing, it would feel different than if you are able to tick off all these other things that they are doing and that they will do,' she said. 'We can even say it with other kinds of repro [rights]: We can say it with IVF, or now they are going to come for your contraception. Abortion is an entry point: because it is so visceral for people, it is a way to connect to a larger story about rights and freedoms.'\nLauren Hitt, a senior spokesperson for the Biden campaign, argued freedom will be a powerful message for the president because it resonates with a broad range of voters. 'It \u2026 speaks to the values of traditional Republican voters, [Nikki] Haley primary voters, and suburban voters \u2013 as well as to our base who believe deeply that the government shouldn't be making personal decisions for people,' she said. 'It's a uniquely powerful idea grounded in traditional democratic values that will be critical in winning the swing voters we need to win in November.'\nThe Trump campaign pushed back on Biden's ad asking which freedom Trump would take away next. 'Under Joe Biden, Americans are less free, less safe, and less prosperous,' Karoline Leavitt, the campaign's national spokesperson, said in a statement.\nDaniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that broad changes in societal attitudes have encouraged both parties to emphasize their commitments to personal freedom. 'Each side recognizes this is something people care about,' Cox said. 'It's effective language at a time when we are increasingly individualistic. We are not as inclined to be communitarian and oriented toward the concerns of others. So I think it's not a surprise that we're seeing both political parties try to employ this language to their advantage.'\nEven with all the increased Democratic emphasis on protecting rights, Cox said, the issue remains 'contested ground' that can favor either party depending on how it is framed. While Republicans have been 'on their heels' defending abortion restrictions such as last week's Arizona ruling, he said, the party has benefited in other races from positioning itself as defending 'parent's rights,' as Republican Glenn Youngkin did while winning the Virginia governorship in 2021. (It's notable that when abortion rights and parental rights collided in the 2023 Virginia state legislative elections, Democrats stressing the former won control of both chambers over Republicans emphasizing the latter.)\nPolling suggests the public remains split over which party it trusts to defend basic rights and freedoms. To begin with, Democrats and Republicans hold very different priorities over which rights are most important to protect, PRRI found in unpublished national polling shared exclusively with CNN. In that survey, conducted late last year, Republicans were most likely to say their freedom to own guns, to practice their religion and to speak their mind was growing more restricted; Democrats were most likely to say that they were losing the freedom to control their own body. 'The parties are talking past each other,' Deckman said. 'Freedom is a word that is quintessentially American, but it depends on what freedoms you are referring to in the first place.'\nThe public returned a similar split verdict last fall in an NBC poll that asked voters which party they trusted more to handle different issues. In the poll, Democrats held a commanding 18 percentage point advantage on dealing with abortion. But when asked which party they trusted more on 'protecting our constitutional rights,' voters preferred Republicans by a margin of 43% to 35%. Even White women, who strongly preferred Democrats on abortion, split evenly over which party they trusted on the broader question of preserving core constitutional rights.\nThat GOP advantage may reflect the traditional political dynamic that conservative voters have been more likely than liberals to believe their rights are under siege and to view government actions as a threat to their liberty. In 2022 polling by Penn State University's McCourtney Institute for Democracy, Republicans were twice as likely as Democrats to say that they had lost rights and freedoms over the past decade. Republicans were also considerably more likely, though not by as lopsided a margin, to predict that they would lose more rights than they gain over the next decade.\nThe real-world consequence of that imbalance was on display in the 2016 presidential campaign, when Democratic-leaning voters largely shrugged about Hillary Clinton's warnings that a Trump victory would allow him to move the Supreme Court to the right in a way that would threaten basic rights, like abortion.\nChris Wilson, a GOP pollster who worked for the super PAC supporting DeSantis in the 2024 campaign, said the Penn State polling suggests that Biden still will face difficulty mobilizing key elements of the Democratic coalition with a message about rights and freedoms. He noted that such groups as Generation Z, Blacks and Latinos were much less likely than college-educated Whites or Republicans to express fears in the poll that they would lose rights in the decade ahead.\n'To whatever extent the Democrats are trying to make a rights argument, it's not as worrying to the youth and to minorities as it is to Whites, people with college degrees, and Boomers,' Wilson said. 'Biden's \u2018rights' argument might be a big hit with his peers, but might be the wrong note to strike if he wants to hold onto the parts of the Democratic coalition that are starting to look shaky.'\nBut the Penn State polling was conducted before the Dobbs decision ended the nationwide right to abortion. And many analysts believe that seismic shift has increased the relevance of questions revolving around rights and freedoms to key groups that Democrats rely on \u2013 with younger women especially focused on these threats. While Republicans traditionally responded more to these arguments, Deckman said, 'These times certainly have made freedom a more accessible, even an existential, issue for people on the left.'\nFernandez Ancona agrees to an extent with both Wilson and Deckman. The 2022 elections, she said, demonstrated how strongly many people react to the risk of losing rights they believed had been settled. 'When these things you take for granted are taken away in this very stark way, it's incredibly motivating,' she said. But she also believes that Democrats need to tie their case about defending personal freedom into a broader message that portrays the 2024 election less as a personal choice between Trump and Biden than as a fundamental crossroads over America's future priorities that will shape not only personal liberties but also economic opportunity.\n'We have to get people to shift their thinking about how this is a choice between two different futures,' she said. 'It can get people out of this one-to-one candidate-to- candidate [comparison] and asking, \u2018what I like, what I don't like' about Trump or Biden.'\nFor libertarians, the escalating struggle between Biden and Republicans over the idea of freedom is a source of both bemusement and frustration. Libertarians take a purist position that advocates for minimal government intervention in both personal behavior and the economy; they usually find Republicans deficient on the first count, and Democrats on the second.\nDavid Boaz, a distinguished senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, sees those flaws in both Biden and Trump. The Biden administration, Boaz said, is 'very big on reproductive freedom, and very big on a lot of aspects of LGBTQ freedom, but beyond those things, where's the freedom in the Biden-Harris plan?' And while Trump talks about promoting economic freedom by cutting taxes and regulation, Boaz continued, Republicans have also undermined such freedom by promoting high tariffs and using government policy to punish companies they disfavor, as DeSantis did with Disney in Florida.\nBut while Boaz believes both Biden and Trump have imperfect records when it comes to promoting freedom, he thinks one issue breaks the tie between them: Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election. \ufeff'I have friends who say Biden is the biggest spender ever and he's regulating and he's woke and how can anyone consider voting for him over Trump?' Boaz said.\n'And I'll say that one reason is that Biden has not tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power. That's a very fundamental issue. You can add up all these [other] issues and weigh them. But the big freedom issue that Biden has over Trump,' Boaaz added, 'is that Trump tried to steal an election.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ronald Brownstein,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bc56ff7a-5e96-468d-93c1-418068e7e891.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":4.848762,"_id":"29d5ef176fd69a8b984c85be46f5d200"},{"title":"Analysis: Why Biden and Democrats are talking so much about freedom","author":"Ronald Brownstein","published_date":"2024-04-17 04:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/abortion-democrats-freedom-messaging","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration:\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration: 'This fight is about freedom, and the freedom that is fundamental to the promise of America.'\nIn a new abortion-focused ad that the Biden campaign aired in Arizona last week, President Joe Biden somberly asks: 'If Donald Trump gets back in power, what freedom will you lose next?'\nFor Biden, Harris and other Democrats to lean so heavily on the word 'freedom' in this campaign is a historic reversal of roles.

Faris responded, 'I see my beloved country, I see it wonderful and beautiful as it truly is.' These words, though seemingly innocuous, marked the beginning of his downfall.\nIn a 2023 documentary aired on news network \ufeffAl Jazeera, Faris revealed he had chosen not to read a pre-written speech during the live phone call and ad-libbed instead, irking the Syrian dictator who was not used to sharing the limelight with another Syrian.\nnot to read a pre-written speech during the live phone call and ad-libbed instead, irking the Syrian dictator who was not used to sharing the limelight with another Syrian.

Faris countered, 'The Russians were not upset; it was a normal thing for them.' Faris lived a quiet life in Aleppo following his return to Earth. Following Hafez's death and the ascension of his son Bashar al-Assad to the presidency, Faris was supportive of the Syrian revolution that started in 2011. Faris decided in 2012 to defect and publicly oppose the Syrian regime, putting his family and himself in life-threatening danger.\n'When we decided to leave Syria, I scattered my children in different neighborhoods of Aleppo to meet at a particular point. We left in a car with the person who helped us escape,' Faris told Al Jazeera\ufeff in 2023.\n'There was a helicopter overhead, but as soon as we entered a town where the Free Syrian Army had machine guns, they withdrew,' Faris added.\nDays later, Faris moved to Turkey to live as a refugee.

Read more CNN Opinion . CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Bill Maher recently said on his show that the 2024 election was going to be fought over two issues: immigration and abortion. The party that best navigates these cultural battlefields is likely to prevail in November.\nEach party has an advantage, the Democrats on abortion and the Republicans on immigration. Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, energized generations of conservative voters who felt deeply on the issue but were also outraged that courts had taken the question out of the democratic process.\nNow, it's abortion rights voters who are energized, fueled by states like Arizona that are putting in place draconian restrictions on abortion. With the margins small in many swing states, abortion could be the issue that brings out suburban women, who could tilt those states blue in November.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook On the other hand, the Republican Party is now led by former President Donald Trump, who \u2014 on this issue as on many others \u2014 is supremely opportunistic. Trump, of course, proudly supported abortion rights for years until he started flirting with a political career within the Republican Party, at which point he reversed course fully.\nNow that he sees it is politically problematic, he is shifting his stance once again. He has criticized Arizona's abortion ban and has pledged not to sign a national abortion ban if re-elected.\nIt might seem hard for him to backtrack; he has loudly taken credit for the repeal of Roe v. Wade and touted his anti-abortion credentials. But Trump seems able to say anything, and even do anything, without losing the cult-like following he has with Republican voters. He can appeal to the middle ground, certain that his base will stay with him.\nPresident Joe Biden, on the other hand, does not have the fanatical following that Trump does. He has constructed a coalition carefully appealing to different groups with specific policies. If he loses one of those groups, his team fears that the math will not add up come Election Day.\nBut he needs to risk it and get tougher on immigration. It has become a proxy for all kinds of issues where people feel that elites simply don't get the concerns of average people. And the concern is rooted in real facts on the ground.\nThe US has taken in huge numbers of immigrants over the last five decades. In 1970, foreign-born people made up 5.7% of the country. As of 2020, that number was 15.3%. And it's not just America. In Sweden, that number went from 6.6% in 1970 to 19.8% in 2020; in the UK, from 5.3% to 13.8%. As I note in my new book, 'Age of Revolutions,' the Western world has seen a wave of unprecedented migration. Considering the numbers and the cultural diversity of the immigrants, people have been remarkably tolerant.\nIn both the EU and the United States, gangs and cartels have recognized that they can game the asylum system by bringing in migrants who are moving for economic reasons but who apply for asylum, claiming that they are being persecuted at home \u2014 and thus get the right to stay, have legal hearings and eventually work. Last fiscal year, nearly a million people applied for asylum in the US. In the EU last year, that number was more than 1.1 million.\nThe waves of recent migrants have produced problems as anyone on the ground can confirm, from New York City to El Paso to Stockholm. Sweden today is home to one of the highest gun crime death rates in Europe. And it is not a coincidence that its second largest political party is one that traces its roots to World War II-era fascism.\nThe Biden administration has made the case that it has put in place a set of well-crafted policies to limit asylum-seekers, that it needs Congressional action to do more and that Republicans want this problem to fester so that they can reap its electoral benefits. (They even tried to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on utterly bogus charges. The Democratic-majority Senate quickly put a stop to that effort.) All true.\nBut Biden must show he can fight. He should declare a national security emergency, send the National Guard to the border, work with Congress to suspend the asylum process and propose a new one that basically makes it impossible to get asylum if you just show up at the border. Many will scream, and it will all be challenged in court. But it will signal that Biden is taking the problem seriously.\nBill Clinton often says that the American people don't always need you to succeed, but they want to catch you trying. Joe Biden needs to be caught trying to solve the immigration crisis.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Fareed Zakaria","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2147862639-20240419041936989.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@CNNOpinions","_score":4.285431,"_id":"33be269bd1502c81ff09c7985ae297d6"},{"title":"Opinion: Shaking off the Trump effect","author":"Richard Galant","published_date":"2024-04-21 12:08:39","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/21/opinions/trump-followers-asleep-at-switch-opinion-galant","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"When a defendant nods off, it doesn't stop a trial from going forward.

We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.\nCNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 'We are most deeply asleep at the switch,' wrote Annie Dillard, 'when we fancy we control any switches at all. We sleep to time's hurdy-gurdy; we wake, if we ever wake, to the silence of God.'\nDillard's line \u2014 from her short meditative book titled 'Holy the Firm,' published in 1977, two years after she won the Pulitzer Prize at the age of 29 \u2014 invoked the role of the switchman, whose alertness was crucial in making sure trains got routed on the right track before the advent of automated switches.\nIf America's political leaders control any switches at all, some have been asleep at the switch for a while. When the Senate voted to send new aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan two months ago, House Speaker Mike Johnson took no action. The House leadership also refused to act on a bipartisan bill to address the surge of migrants across the southern border.\nIn both cases, Republicans in Congress were partly heeding the wishes of former President Donald Trump, who opposed more aid for Ukraine and wanted to prevent President Joe Biden from scoring any more legislative victories.\nThat was weeks before Trump went on trial in a Manhattan courtroom, where the man who labeled Biden 'Sleepy Joe' appeared to doze off several times Monday and Tuesday while the court started the process of selecting jurors.\nAnd it was also well before Iran directly attacked Israel for the first time. Israel responded, and while those strikes appeared to cause only limited damage, it showed the potential for wars to spiral out of control and made it even less politically tenable for the House leadership to be seen stalling on military aid measures.\nWhen a defendant nods off, it doesn't stop a trial from going forward. When a nation naps in the middle of international crises, the consequences can be profoundly scary.\nLast week, Johnson finally acted, making clear he supports the foreign aid package, though he broke it up into four bills and added a fifth on border security. With the help of Democrats, the House approved aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan on Saturday. 'Despite fierce opposition from MAGA Republicans within his caucus, Speaker Johnson has decided that the imperative of the US providing this assistance is more important than pleasing all the members of his caucus,' wrote Julian Zelizer .\nJulian Zelizer.\n'Without this support, international adversaries, including Russia, Iran and China, would read the failure of the US Congress to pass legislation as a sign that MAGA's America First agenda was triumphant. They might conclude that the age of internationalism, entrenched into American politics since World War II, had come to an end.'\n'The problem for Johnson is that his decision to move forward might very well cost him his job,' added Zelizer, noting Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's fierce criticism of Johnson and a House rule allowing just one member to bring about a vote to oust the speaker \u2014 which led to Kevin McCarthy's downfall six months ago.\nBiden backed bipartisan legislation on the border, but in the view of Fareed Zakaria , he has missed an opportunity to take firm executive action after House Republicans scuttled the bill and launched the doomed effort to impeach and remove Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\nFareed Zakaria, he has missed an opportunity to take firm executive action after House Republicans scuttled the bill and launched the doomed effort to impeach and remove Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

But no one should be surprised at the sight of a criminal defendant seeming to nod off, noted Elliot Williams , a former prosecutor who has logged countless hours in court.\nElliot Williams, a former prosecutor who has logged countless hours in court. 'Courtrooms don't lend themselves to keeping people awake. They are notoriously quiet places where people are required to remain seated almost all of the time. The air is often stagnant and the ever-so-distracting handheld devices that are our lifelines to (and barrier from) the world around us are strictly forbidden \u2026 the gears of justice are not made for the 24-hour news cycle. What might be resolved in an 8-minute final segment of an episode of \u2018Law and Order' might be drawn out over days of painstaking testimony. It can take months, if not years (even in cases in which a defendant is not deliberately attempting to slow proceedings down) before a matter finally gets to trial.'\nStill, the selection of the jury that will pronounce a verdict on the hush money trial moved faster than expected last week. There were speed bumps though, as Patrick T. Brown noted.\nPatrick T. Brown noted. 'One potential juror who underwent questioning \u2026 was subsequently struck for cause after Trump's team found social media posts from the juror referencing Trump that say, \u2018Get him out' and \u2018Lock him up.''\n'Indeed, it seems unlikely that this case would be being prosecuted with the same vigor and creative legal theorizing if Trump were an everyday citizen. After all, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg came into office promising to focus on the ongoing investigation of Trump, and would have likely felt political heat from New York Democrats had he decided to close the investigation without bringing charges.'\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook 'In the end, as The New York Times reported in March 2023, Bragg's office took a \u2018circuitous and sometimes uncertain road' to filing criminal charges, reviving a dying investigation that originally focused on Trump's business practices with a renewed focus on hush money payments.'\nWill the trial be fair? Jeffrey Abramson , author of a book on the jury system, noted, 'Impartiality is the key to jury justice, but we can hardly expect jurors to approach the case without strong opinions about Trump. Indeed, it would be disturbing to seat jurors whose only qualification was their ignorance about major news events of the day.'\nJeffrey Abramson, author of a book on the jury system, noted, 'Impartiality is the key to jury justice, but we can hardly expect jurors to approach the case without strong opinions about Trump.

We can find fair jurors who understand the difference between law and politics.'\nDon't call it a hush money trial, urged Norm Eisen .\nNorm Eisen. 'The core issue \u2026 is not the payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels in October 2016 to conceal her claimed affair with Trump (he denies the affair took place). The core issue is why Trump made them.\n'Paying hush money by itself is not a crime. The crime alleged in this case is felony document falsification, as the judge detailed. That requires intent to conceal, aid or commit another crime. Here, the prosecution alleges that the intent was to violate federal campaign finance laws and also the state statute prohibiting the \u2018unlawful influence' of an election \u2014 i.e., election interference.'\n'No one can seriously dispute,' Eisen concluded, that the reason former Trump fixer Michael Cohen and Trump himself 'allegedly hatched the scheme was to deprive voters of information that could have changed the outcome of an extremely close election.'\nFor more:\nElie Honig : Which case is the biggest threat to Trump?\nElie Honig: Which case is the biggest threat to Trump?\nElie Honig: Which case is the biggest threat to Trump?\n02:13 - Source: CNN\n02:13 - Source: CNN The unimaginable is not a theory, wrote Frida Ghitis .

'Israel and Iran have fought a shadow war for decades. The notion that one day Iran would launch a direct attack against Israel may have seemed like a distant possibility: something that was bound to happen, but only at some elusive future date. The same was true of Hamas, a terrorist group that seized control of Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thought he could appease Hamas and preserve quiet in Gaza and safety for Israelis living in the south. Others worried that one day Hamas would attack with full force. Many have worried that Iran will one day attack with full force. October 7 and April 14 are reminders that the unimaginable, the barely-imaginable, can and does happen.'\nPeter Bergen wrote that 'Saturday's drone and missile attacks against Israel were designed to show Israel and the region that the Iranian regime can't be trifled with, and the Israeli attack on its military leaders in Damascus would be avenged. However, it might not trigger a major war since 99% of the 300 drones and missiles launched by Iran were intercepted, according to the Israeli military.

CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 War films often try to overwhelm you with authenticity. Movies like 'Saving Private Ryan,' (1998), 'Dunkirk,' (2017) or this year's 'Civil War' saturate viewers with the realism of their combat sequences and the gritty power of simulated trauma. That's why war movies are often treated as serious and important: They offer what seems to be unique, powerful access to a rare but important experience. Watch 'Apocalypse Now' (1979), 'Full Metal Jacket' (1987) or 'Platoon' (1986) and you should know what war really means.\nreally means.\nGuy Ritchie's 'The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare' claims to be based on true events; it's modeled on the 1942 World War II Operation Postmaster, in which a British team seized enemy ships in the Spanish harbor of Fernando Po. But even 10 minutes in, the connection to the real experience of war is tenuous.\nThe film is a rip-roaring, goofy adventure yarn. And while I wouldn't necessarily say that makes this a better movie than 'Apocalypse Now,' there is something refreshing, even honest, about Ritchie's willingness to toss pretension overboard, and let a fictional film own its fictional inauthenticity.\n'Ungentlemanly Warfare' features a disreputable band of riff raff brought together for a super-secret mission. That mission is to sink a key German vessel which resupplies German U-boats. The ship is in neutral waters off Fernando Po, and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (a frantically mugging Rory Kinnear) needs a team he can disavow. He turns to Gus March-Phillips (Henry Cavill in masses of insouciant facial hair) as a leader with subordinates including titanically cheerful Scandinavian murder machine Anders Lassen (Alan Ritchson) and the brave, elegantly sensuous, undercover operative Marjorie Stewart (Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez.)\nThe setting comes with ready-made villains in the Nazis and patriotic resonance, but the plot machinations barely matter; they're merely an excuse to show our heroes making dry quips about cricket and their own indomitability as they shoot fascists in the head, carve out their hearts and set off extremely large explosions.\nThe protagonists are so dashing, hypercompetent and destined for victory that there isn't even really any suspense. 'The Guns of Navarone' (1961) \u2014 an obvious precursor \u2014 was at least willing to acknowledge that in war, sometimes good people die. Ritchie makes no such concessions to authenticity in 'Ungentlemanly Warfare.'\nYou could argue that this kind of glib triumphalism ill prepares people for the realities of war, or for the reality of fascism. And, sure, you'd have a point. Our rag-tag band has no doubts as they swagger to victory; they literally giggle when Nazis threaten them and chat nonchalantly while being tortured by electroshock.\nDecency comes as easily as courage: Only the Nazis are prejudiced, while the good guys are untouched by the racism and sexism endemic in their era (as, for that matter, in ours). Churchill's history of colonial atrocities is of course never mentioned. Fighting fascism in others, and fascist sympathies on one's own side, looks easy. Which, as we know from our current threats to democracy, is not the case.\nYet the movie is so unremittingly silly that it's hard to imagine anyone taking it seriously as a blueprint for anything, let alone fascist-fighting. This deliberate unreality seems inspired by Quentin Tarantino's 2009 'Inglourious Basterds,' a film in which Hitler is killed in 1944, a year before the war actually ended, saving immeasurable suffering and misery. He's assassinated by a group of awesome Jewish fighters and plotters, providing a satisfying revenge arc and a violent orgy of poetic justice.\nso unremittingly silly that it's hard to imagine anyone taking it seriously as a blueprint for anything, let alone fascist-fighting.

Former President Donald Trump is set to return to a New York City courtroom for a second day as jury selection continues in his criminal hush money trial. A total of 96 New Yorkers were brought in Monday as prospective jurors but 50 were immediately dismissed when they said they couldn't be fair and impartial. The swift dismissal of the prospective jury pool underscores the difficulty in finding a jury when the defendant is a former president who elicits strong feelings on both sides of the aisle. A panel of 12 people and six alternates will ultimately be selected for a trial that could last six to eight weeks. The case stems from state charges related to a hush money payment to an adult film star in 2016. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied all wrongdoing.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson announced Monday evening that the House will take up separate bills this week to provide aid for Israel and Ukraine, heeding demands from the far right to keep the issues separate as the threat of a vote to oust him from the speakership looms. In the wake of Iran's unprecedented retaliatory strikes on Israel, Democrats have called on Johnson to bring up a Senate-passed foreign aid package that includes aid to Israel and Ukraine, but hardline conservatives have urged the Louisiana Republican against attaching Ukraine funding to any Israel aid package. Johnson predicted the House will vote Friday evening on the separate bills. But Republican leaders could still take procedural steps to send all those pieces as one package to the Senate, which could enrage the right-wing of the House GOP conference.\nFederal authorities have launched a criminal investigation into last month's ship crash that destroyed Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge and killed six people, according to a US official familiar with the matter. The bridge collapsed on March 26 after a massive cargo ship lost power, veered off course and struck the bridge. The ship's owner and manager have since filed a court document in an attempt to limit their financial liability. The FBI and the US Coast Guard are leading the probe to determine whether the crew failed to report an earlier issue with the ship that delayed its departure, the official said. Also on Monday, authorities confirmed the body of a fourth victim had been recovered from the collapse. Officials have not released the victim's identity, at the request of his family.\nHannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer of the film 'Rust' was sentenced to 18 months in prison Monday, the maximum possible punishment. She was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter last month for the 2021 on-set fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. The verdict comes more than two years after Hutchins, 42, was killed by a live round of ammunition fired from a prop gun held by actor Alec Baldwin. The film's director was also injured in the shooting. During the trial, prosecutors argued Gutierrez Reed, 26, repeatedly violated safety protocols and acted without caution in performing her duties, leading to Hutchins' death. Baldwin has also been charged with involuntary manslaughter and is expected to stand trial in July.\nTesla is set to cut more than 10% of its global staff of 140,000, CEO Elon Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees.

Other automakers, including General Motors and Ford, have also pulled back on their EV production in the face of lower demand.\nFire in Copenhagen rips through the old stock exchange\nA massive fire engulfed Denmark's historic old stock exchange today.

New York CNN \u2014\nNew York CNN \u2014 Eight years ago, when North Carolina tried regulate how transgender people use public bathrooms, Corporate America revolted.\nPayPal scrapped a planned expansion of one of its operations in the state. Musicians canceled performances. And the NCAA said it wouldn't let North Carolina host championships while the law was on the books. All in, the boycott cost the state's economy around $4 billion, according to an analysis by the Associated Press, which noted its tally was likely an underestimation.\nLately, though, Corporate America doesn't have the same stomach for a culture war.\nLast year, at least 510 anti-LGBTQ bills were introduced in US state legislatures \u2014 a new record, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, and nearly three times the number of such bills introduced in 2022. Nearly two dozen states have either banned or severely curtailed abortion rights since Roe v. Wade was overturned two years ago.\nWhile corporate giants from a range of industries pledged to provide support and financial assistance for employees seeking abortion care, few are wading into that political conversation with the kind of fervor we've seen on other issues in the recent past.\nThere doesn't appear to be a single, unified theory for why that's the case. Perhaps businesses were willing to take more risks in a zero-interest-rate environment, when their stocks were riding high and customers were unfazed by inflation. Perhaps the payoff of past progressive campaigns proved too costly in a deeply polarized country \u2014 no brand wants to be the next Bud Light.\nAnother possibility: Customers and businesses simply have outrage fatigue, says Cait Lamberton, professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.\n'People can only stay enraged for so long,' Lamberton told me. 'We are actually very good at adapting to psychological discomfort. Very quickly, our rationalization mechanisms kick in, and we are able to find a way to reframe the actions of a brand, or our own actions, in ways that don't create massive internal conflict.'\nI spoke to Lamberton about the changing winds of corporate activism and the dilemma leaders find themselves in.\nThe following interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nThe following interview has been edited for length and clarity. Nightcap: There was a real trend, starting around 2016, of companies taking a political or moral stand on cultural fights. But in the past year or so, that seems to have gone out of vogue.

And that idea is that every brand needs to have a social and ideological purpose.\nLamberton: What we've seen is the natural life cycle of an idea. And that idea is that every brand needs to have a social and ideological purpose. For at least six years, we saw pretty strong numbers related to people's interest in brand activism.\nConsumers wanted not only to have their own personal needs met, but for brands to more generally provide value to society as a whole. But in the last few years, we've seen that position softening.\nSince 2016, we've had anger about politics. We've had anger about Ukraine, about abortion rights, the list goes on. And it's not a place where most people can stay for extended periods of time.\nNightcap: It felt like we'd come full circle a year ago, when Bud Light angered some folks by partnering with a trans social media influencer. It was such a small, seemingly innocuous ad, but the reaction was enormous. \ufeff(The brand's parent company Anheuser-Busch said it lost about $1 billion in sales as a result of the backlash.)\nNightcap: It felt like we'd come full circle a year ago, when Bud Light angered some folks by partnering with a trans social media influencer.

Lamberton: I think a few things happened there.\nLamberton: I think a few things happened there. When people get into a room, it's very easy to start thinking that they represent the rest of the world. 'Brand purpose' often takes an internal turn, so it comes to be defined by what the employees and the leadership believe in. But if you lose sight of your customer, you can make huge mistakes.\nSo, I think there was a disconnect there, which isn't to say that all Bud Light drinkers were anti-trans. But there may have been a vocal segment that was going to respond negatively.\nThe other thing that they did that caused some problems is that they backed off from it. Bud Light took a position that had a cost, and then they immediately ran away when they realized the cost, and that added insult to injury.\nThere certainly were ways that aligning with a historically excluded population could benefit the brand. But you can't do it without anticipating the potential effects.\nNightcap: So are we just reverting back to the old model of shareholder capitalism, everything focused on the bottom line and steering clear of politics?\nNightcap: So are we just reverting back to the old model of shareholder capitalism, everything focused on the bottom line and steering clear of politics? Lamberton: It depends very much on the kind of brand we're talking about.\nLamberton: It depends very much on the kind of brand we're talking about. Brands are in a difficult position, in some ways. On one hand, they can choose to be an activist about something that won't harm them, and shareholders should like that.\nThe problem is that when there's no cost, it's not seen as credible. So on the other hand, you can take an activist stance that has a cost, and then some stakeholders are going to be mad at you for doing so.\nBrands' hesitation may be quite rational in that they're caught between these two poles \u2014 do we do something costless, that will not make any difference? Or do we do something costly and risk creating real damage, not only to our bottom line, but also potentially alienating some of our consumers?\nIt's not an easy decision to make.\nNightcap: When Georgia had restrictive voting bills on the ballot in 2021, a bunch of companies, including Coca Cola and Delta, spoke out about it. We haven't seen quite the same pushback in the wake of Roe being overturned last year and all the subsequent abortion bans that have been put in place since.\nNightcap: When Georgia had restrictive voting bills on the ballot in 2021, a bunch of companies, including Coca Cola and Delta, spoke out about it.

There is, I believe, a sense that there isn't a huge payoff to be had from courting public opinion. At the end of the day, the courts are going to make these calls.\nCompanies may recognize that they don't have as much power as they might in other areas. Corporations directly affect the environment with the products they make. They directly affect pay equity. They can directly affect gun-related issues. But they don't have a direct connection to abortion. The only way that they can do anything is by guaranteeing reproductive rights for their employees. Probably the best thing that corporations could do is give people voting day off.\nNightcap: Have we seen this play before?

Here in Philadelphia, the most vivid example is Wanamaker's department store (established in 1861). John Wanamaker was an evangelical Christian who felt that a business' job in the world was to morally uplift people.\nThe general idea was that this company should be part of the set of forces that shape society. So we have had companies taking ideological positions for a long time. But I do think we're in a slightly different environment now.\nTechnology has created a high level of transparency about what companies do. People have new ways of connecting and sharing information that didn't previously exist. Politically, we've certainly become more polarized. Economically, we've seen a great deal of volatility just in the last half decade. So it would be very hard to say there's a historical analog that maps onto this context.\nNightcap: Right.

'There is no level playing field in this election.'\nRelated article What to know about the world's biggest election\nRelated article What to know about the world's biggest election It echoed a similar rally more than 40 years earlier on the same spot, when opposition leaders fired up huge crowds to help change the course of the 1977 election \u2013 ending the 10-year rule of India's powerful third prime minister and political scion Indira Gandhi.\nGandhi had imposed a state of emergency, jailed key opposition leaders and curtailed civil freedoms. To some, India's future was perched on a needle point between autocracy and democracy. She lost the election and, in the eyes of many, India's democracy was saved.\nTo many supporters in the crowd three weeks ago, India is now at a similar crossroads with this high-stakes election deciding which path the country follows.\n'Our democracy is being murdered, India is becoming a dictatorship,' Hazari Lal Rajput, a resident from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, told CNN at the Ramlila Maidan.\nUnless there is a major upset, Modi's BJP is set to win its third straight five-year term thanks to his potent, populist mix of economic empowerment and Hindu nationalism.\nAccording to 2023 Pew research, about eight in 10 Indian adults have a favorable view of Modi, including 55% who have a very favorable view. Such levels of popularity for a two-term incumbent prime minister defy all modern conventions, both in India and throughout much of the democratic world.\nBut India's opposition leaders accuse Modi's right-wing government of becoming an electoral autocracy by attempting to rig the vote, weaponizing state agencies to stifle, attack and arrest opposition politicians, and undermining democratic principles ahead of elections, which began on April 19 and run until June 1, with results counted on June 4.\nThey also warn Modi's brand of Hindu nationalism is uncorking dangerous religious divides in a country with a long and tragic history of sectarian bloodletting.\nModi and the BJP have denied political interference, with one senior party leader saying it was a 'process of law' to take 'appropriate action against corruption.'\nTo counter the BJP, the opposition has formed a 27-member bloc \u2014 the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, or INDIA.\nBut so far that alliance has proved lackluster, observers say. It has been beset by ideological differences, has seen a host of defections to the BJP and, even with the election in full swing, has yet to even name a prime ministerial candidate.\n'What kind of a democracy can you have if you don't have a vibrant opposition, a robust opposition that can question the government?' asks Arati Jerath, an independent political commentator and journalist.\n'That's why it's not really a question of whether Modi wins or not, it's a question of keeping the opposition alive to fight another day so that democracy in India survives.'\nAmong those leading the charge for the opposition alliance is Rahul Gandhi, longtime face of the Congress and the latest member of his family to bid for power.\nHe is the son of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. His grandmother Indira was India's first female leader, and his great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the country's founding prime minister.\n'If the BJP wins these fixed elections and changes the constitution, the country will be on fire. Remember this,' Rahul Gandhi told the crowd in Delhi last month.\nThe BJP and its allies are gunning for a supermajority of more than two-thirds of the seats in India's parliament, the Lok Sabha. A rising fear among critics is that this would give the BJP the power to change India's constitution, which is rooted in the democratic principles of justice, liberty, equality and \u2013 crucially \u2013 secularism.\nThe BJP has repeatedly denied it has plans to change the constitution.\n'When I say that I have big plans, no one should be scared. I don't take decisions to scare or run over anyone, I take decisions for the wholesome development of the nation,' Modi said in an interview with Indian news agency ANI earlier this week.\nBut the party has already begun publicly pulling India's government away from its secular foundation and leading BJP figures have openly advocated for the country to be declared a Hindu nation.\n'There shouldn't be politics on the basis of religion in any country, they should talk about real issues. Until people's financial situation improves, there won't be any social reform,' said voter Mohammad Irfan at the opposition rally in Delhi.\nOpposition parties have found themselves facing a slew of legal and financial challenges in the run-up to this year's election.\nGandhi's Congress \u2013 the largest party in the INDIA alliance \u2014 has accused the BJP of 'tax terrorism' and crippling its ability to campaign after its accounts were frozen by the tax department, leaving it unable to use some $20 million in funds. It has also been landed with a $218 million tax bill.\nThen came the arrest of Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi chief minister and head of the popular Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).\nKejriwal's detention on graft allegations came after the announcement of the general election last month, sparking protests in the capital. Analysts say it's the first time in post-independence history that an Indian chief minister has governed from behind bars.\nKejriwal has denied the allegations, claiming they are politically motivated. He is just one of several prominent members of the opposition, including three other senior AAP leaders, that have also been arrested or investigated by state agencies in moves decried as political by their parties.\n'I think there are very serious concerns about how free and fair the elections are going to be in India this time around,' said Atishi, Delhi minister of education for the AAP, who goes by one name.\nReports have emerged of opposition party members being coerced into joining the BJP with the threat of arrest, while they were under investigation by state agencies. Other reports suggest politicians have had their probes dropped after switching sides.\nAtishi said she was also approached to switch to the BJP. 'Either you join the ruling party, and then the cases are closed or put into cold storage or if you don't, like the Aam Aadmi Party leaders, then the cases go ahead and you're arrested and put into jail,' she said, without specifically naming who approached her.\nCNN cannot independently confirm the incidents and has reached out to the BJP for comment.\nIn his interview with ANI, Modi denied any sliding of democracy under his rule and emphasized the independence of the Election Commission and state agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate, saying political leaders make up just 3% of cases.\n'Shouldn't we let the ED work independently when it is supposed to do so?' he said. 'I am convinced that corruption has destroyed the country. We should fight against corruption with our full strength.'\nAnalyst Jerath said a BJP-led campaign to weaken the opposition was part of Modi's 'scorched earth policy.'\n'Just wipe out whatever comes in your way so that this juggernaut can move on without any kind of challenge, without any obstruction,' she said.\nModi is enduringly popular, analysts say, appealing to both the poor and the affluent, especially among much of the roughly 80% of India's population who are Hindu.\nDuring his 10 years in power, he has launched a raft of welfare policies including free food handouts, housing, cheap gas cylinders for women and infrastructure projects.\nIndia is also the world's fastest-growing major economy and Modi's presence on the world stage \u2014 including hosting the G20 \u2014 has cemented the country as a modern global power, along with a history-making moon landing.\nAuthor Christophe Jaffrelot told CNN Modi makes people feel 'proud again of being Indian.'\n'There is a sense in India, a constant sense, of vulnerability, a lack of self-esteem. So to be recognized as a great power in spite of everything, (that) is attributed to him,' he said.\nThat does not mean there aren't key issues the opposition could rally around, analysts say, including the BJP's failure to increase education opportunities or improve health infrastructure \u2013 especially following the coronavirus pandemic, which hit India especially hard.\nYouth unemployment also remains a huge problem, close to 50% among 20-to-24-year-olds.\nBut the INDIA alliance has failed to capitalize on these weak spots, Jerath said.\n'They haven't been able to weave together a cohesive kind of campaign, come up with a catchy slogan that will fire the imagination of the voting public,' she said.\nCongress leader Gandhi is one of the few opposition figures considered to have the kind of star power and name recognition to stand against Modi.\nBut though he may have the name, Gandhi lacks leadership skills, some analysts say.\nRasheed Kidwai, journalist and author of '24 Akbar Road,' a history of the Congress party, said it's a winner-takes-all election and there is 'no silver medal in politics.'\n'The problem with INDIA alliance is there is nobody who has that kind of hunger, who has that kind of personal(ity), who has that kind of inner sense of belonging or ownership to go in this election.

'There is no level playing field in this election.'\nIt echoed a similar rally more than 40 years earlier on the same spot, when opposition leaders fired up huge crowds to help change the course of the 1977 election \u2013 ending the 10-year rule of India's powerful third prime minister and political scion Indira Gandhi.\nGandhi had imposed a state of emergency, jailed key opposition leaders and curtailed civil freedoms. To some, India's future was perched on a needle point between autocracy and democracy. She lost the election and, in the eyes of many, India's democracy was saved.\nTo many supporters in the crowd three weeks ago, India is now at a similar crossroads with this high-stakes election deciding which path the country follows.\n'Our democracy is being murdered, India is becoming a dictatorship,' Hazari Lal Rajput, a resident from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, told CNN at the Ramlila Maidan.\nSupporters of India's opposition party, Indian National Congress, during an election rally in Puducherry on April 15, 2024\nSupporters of India's opposition party, Indian National Congress, during an election rally in Puducherry on April 15, 2024\nR. Satish Babu/AFP/Getty Images\nDemocracy under threat?\nUnless there is a major upset, Modi's BJP is set to win its third straight five-year term thanks to his potent, populist mix of economic empowerment and Hindu nationalism.\nAccording to 2023 Pew research, about eight in 10 Indian adults have a favorable view of Modi, including 55% who have a very favorable view. Such levels of popularity for a two-term incumbent prime minister defy all modern conventions, both in India and throughout much of the democratic world.\nBut India's opposition leaders accuse Modi's right-wing government of becoming an electoral autocracy by attempting to rig the vote, weaponizing state agencies to stifle, attack and arrest opposition politicians, and undermining democratic principles ahead of elections, which began on April 19 and run until June 1, with results counted on June 4.\nThey also warn Modi's brand of Hindu nationalism is uncorking dangerous religious divides in a country with a long and tragic history of sectarian bloodletting.\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking during a rally in Sydney, Australia, on May 23, 2023.\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking during a rally in Sydney, Australia, on May 23, 2023.\nMatthew Abbott/The New York Times/Redux Narendra Modi was born in 1950, three years after India's independence, to mother Hiraben and father Damodardas, a teaseller, in the western state of Gujarat.

It has been beset by ideological differences, has seen a host of defections to the BJP and, even with the election in full swing, has yet to even name a prime ministerial candidate.\n'What kind of a democracy can you have if you don't have a vibrant opposition, a robust opposition that can question the government?' asks Arati Jerath, an independent political commentator and journalist.\n'That's why it's not really a question of whether Modi wins or not, it's a question of keeping the opposition alive to fight another day so that democracy in India survives.'\n\u2018Scorched earth'\nAmong those leading the charge for the opposition alliance is Rahul Gandhi, longtime face of the Congress and the latest member of his family to bid for power.\nHe is the son of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. His grandmother Indira was India's first female leader, and his great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the country's founding prime minister.\n'If the BJP wins these fixed elections and changes the constitution, the country will be on fire. Remember this,' Rahul Gandhi told the crowd in Delhi last month.\nThe BJP and its allies are gunning for a supermajority of more than two-thirds of the seats in India's parliament, the Lok Sabha. A rising fear among critics is that this would give the BJP the power to change India's constitution, which is rooted in the democratic principles of justice, liberty, equality and \u2013 crucially \u2013 secularism.\nThe BJP has repeatedly denied it has plans to change the constitution.\nCongress party leader Rahul Gandhi speaks during a press conference in New Delhi on March 25, 2023.\nCongress party leader Rahul Gandhi speaks during a press conference in New Delhi on March 25, 2023.\nMoney Sharma/AFP/Getty Images\n'When I say that I have big plans, no one should be scared. I don't take decisions to scare or run over anyone, I take decisions for the wholesome development of the nation,' Modi said in an interview with Indian news agency ANI earlier this week.\nBut the party has already begun publicly pulling India's government away from its secular foundation and leading BJP figures have openly advocated for the country to be declared a Hindu nation.\n'There shouldn't be politics on the basis of religion in any country, they should talk about real issues. Until people's financial situation improves, there won't be any social reform,' said voter Mohammad Irfan at the opposition rally in Delhi.\nOpposition parties have found themselves facing a slew of legal and financial challenges in the run-up to this year's election.\nGandhi's Congress \u2013 the largest party in the INDIA alliance \u2014 has accused the BJP of 'tax terrorism' and crippling its ability to campaign after its accounts were frozen by the tax department, leaving it unable to use some $20 million in funds. It has also been landed with a $218 million tax bill.\nThen came the arrest of Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi chief minister and head of the popular Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).\nKejriwal's detention on graft allegations came after the announcement of the general election last month, sparking protests in the capital. Analysts say it's the first time in post-independence history that an Indian chief minister has governed from behind bars.\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal speaks during a protest against alleged attacks on federalism by the federal government, in New Delhi, India, on February 8, 2024.\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal speaks during a protest against alleged attacks on federalism by the federal government, in New Delhi, India, on February 8, 2024.\nAltaf Qadri/AP\nKejriwal has denied the allegations, claiming they are politically motivated. He is just one of several prominent members of the opposition, including three other senior AAP leaders, that have also been arrested or investigated by state agencies in moves decried as political by their parties.\n'I think there are very serious concerns about how free and fair the elections are going to be in India this time around,' said Atishi, Delhi minister of education for the AAP, who goes by one name.\nReports have emerged of opposition party members being coerced into joining the BJP with the threat of arrest, while they were under investigation by state agencies. Other reports suggest politicians have had their probes dropped after switching sides.\nAtishi said she was also approached to switch to the BJP. 'Either you join the ruling party, and then the cases are closed or put into cold storage or if you don't, like the Aam Aadmi Party leaders, then the cases go ahead and you're arrested and put into jail,' she said, without specifically naming who approached her.\nCNN cannot independently confirm the incidents and has reached out to the BJP for comment.\nIn his interview with ANI, Modi denied any sliding of democracy under his rule and emphasized the independence of the Election Commission and state agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate, saying political leaders make up just 3% of cases.\n'Shouldn't we let the ED work independently when it is supposed to do so?' he said. 'I am convinced that corruption has destroyed the country. We should fight against corruption with our full strength.'\nAnalyst Jerath said a BJP-led campaign to weaken the opposition was part of Modi's 'scorched earth policy.'\n'Just wipe out whatever comes in your way so that this juggernaut can move on without any kind of challenge, without any obstruction,' she said.\nGandhi \u2018not a contender'\nModi is enduringly popular, analysts say, appealing to both the poor and the affluent, especially among much of the roughly 80% of India's population who are Hindu.\nDuring his 10 years in power, he has launched a raft of welfare policies including free food handouts, housing, cheap gas cylinders for women and infrastructure projects.\nIndia is also the world's fastest-growing major economy and Modi's presence on the world stage \u2014 including hosting the G20 \u2014 has cemented the country as a modern global power, along with a history-making moon landing.\nAuthor Christophe Jaffrelot told CNN Modi makes people feel 'proud again of being Indian.'\n'There is a sense in India, a constant sense, of vulnerability, a lack of self-esteem. So to be recognized as a great power in spite of everything, (that) is attributed to him,' he said.\nThat does not mean there aren't key issues the opposition could rally around, analysts say, including the BJP's failure to increase education opportunities or improve health infrastructure \u2013 especially following the coronavirus pandemic, which hit India especially hard.\nYouth unemployment also remains a huge problem, close to 50% among 20-to-24-year-olds.\nBut the INDIA alliance has failed to capitalize on these weak spots, Jerath said.\n'They haven't been able to weave together a cohesive kind of campaign, come up with a catchy slogan that will fire the imagination of the voting public,' she said.\nCongress leader Gandhi is one of the few opposition figures considered to have the kind of star power and name recognition to stand against Modi.\nBut though he may have the name, Gandhi lacks leadership skills, some analysts say.\nRasheed Kidwai, journalist and author of '24 Akbar Road,' a history of the Congress party, said it's a winner-takes-all election and there is 'no silver medal in politics.'\n'The problem with INDIA alliance is there is nobody who has that kind of hunger, who has that kind of personal(ity), who has that kind of inner sense of belonging or ownership to go in this election. Rahul is doing it but is not a contender,' he said.\nGandhi recently completed a 6,713-kilometer (4,200-mile) walk across the country, starting in the violence-hit northeastern state of Manipur, to raise issues of poverty, unemployment, diversity and democracy with voters.\nDespite these efforts, the BJP has dominated the campaign narrative.\nA key gauge of opposition strength will be in those parts of India where the BJP has historically failed to make inroads.\nSupporters of the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) participate in an election campaign rally on Hill Cart Road in Siliguri, India, on April 16, 2024.\nSupporters of the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) participate in an election campaign rally on Hill Cart Road in Siliguri, India, on April 16, 2024.\nDiptendu Dutta/NurPhoto/Getty Images\nRegional opposition heavyweights, such as the West Bengal chief minister and All India Trinamool Congress head Mamata Banerjee and the south's Tamil Nadu chief minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin, will be vying to block a BJP takeover in their respective states.\nBut the only other major national party is the Congress, which has been the main opposition since 2014.\nCongress governed the country for much of the 77 years since independence, and while it was once a powerful political force with its legacy rooted in the formation of modern India, it now finds itself in the doldrums, dogged by infighting and accusations of corruption within the party.\n'In the Congress, the best and brightest are not fighting the election,' Kidwai said.\nAnalysts say that during a decade in opposition, Congress has failed to rebuild its organization and political machinery to effectively take on the BJP.\nThe Congress organization has 'decayed and almost died over the years, particularly in north India, and particularly in Uttar Pradesh, which is the largest, most populous state,' Jerath said.\n'There was a time after independence, and for many years after independence, that they used to say that you would find a Congress flag in every single village in India,' she said.
