            "summary": "ROME — Italy's lower house passed an amendment allowing antiabortion activists into abortion clinics as part of the right-wing government's new health-care package, raising fears that women's right to choose could be under threat in the country.\nAccording to the amendment, 'non profit groups with qualified experience in supporting maternity' will be given access to the abortion counseling centers that issue the certificates needed to obtain an abortion.\nPrime Minister Giorgia Meloni's right-wing government maintains that the amendment doesn't really change anything, just clarifies aspects of the 1978 Law 194 legalizing abortion — by allowing the activists into the centers where they weren't permitted before.\n'This was already included in the letter of the law, which we haven't touched,' said Raffaele Nevi, a lawmaker with the prime minister's coalition. 'That's the whole reason it got so easily approved: It changes nothing. … It's just about applying it.'\nItaly's opposition says the latest national amendment has dealt women's rights a 'heavy' blow, noting how some regions, including Umbria and Marche, have already restricted access to the abortion pill.\nAdvertisement\n'The right keeps on showing its nostalgic nature and its patriarchal and obscurantist vision, seeking every time to erode women's rights,' said Silvia Roggiani, an opposition lawmaker with the center left Partito Democratico. 'While other countries progress in the protection of gender rights, it's only shameful that Italy should be taking steps back.'\nThere has been a renewed focus on the issue of abortion in Europe following the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade , resulting in restrictions to abortion access in many parts of the country.\nRoe v. Wade, resulting in restrictions to abortion access in many parts of the country.\nIn February, France became the first country in the world to enshrine abortion rights in its constitution, while the European Parliament voted last week in favor of including access to abortion in its Charter of Fundamental Rights. The resolution is nonbinding, but has been welcomed by abortion rights groups nonetheless.\nAdvertisement\nMeloni, who became prime minister in 2022, has promised to not change Italy's abortion legislation, but finding a facility providing safe abortions is becoming increasingly difficult.\nItaly legalized abortion in 1978, when the country was still staunchly Catholic, and under the law women are able to seek a termination in the first 90 days of pregnancy. After that an abortion can only be performed if there is a risk to the woman's life or there are serious issues with the fetus.\nDoctors can refuse to perform an abortion for reasons of conscience, and according to 2021 Italian Health Ministry data, more than 60 percent of gynecologists won't carry out the procedure.\nItaly's biggest antiabortion organization, Pro Vita e Famiglia (Pro-Life and Family), is among the groups that would be allowed to enter consultation clinics under the amendment. The groups have called for doctors who provide abortions to first have their patient see the fetus and then have them hear its heartbeat before carrying out the procedure.\nAdvertisement\nThe organization has links to the U.S. antiabortion organization Heartbeat International, from which it has received nearly $100,000 in funding since 2014.\nJacopo Coghe, a spokesperson for Pro Vita, said that while the group has no intention of entering abortion consultation clinics, they should 'return to their original function of helping women find concrete alternatives to abortion.'\nWhile the amendment must still be approved by the Senate, there is little hope among opposition lawmakers that the measure can be halted.",

            "summary": "For many Americans, November's presidential election is about one issue: abortion. President Biden hopes that a pro-abortion rights message will carry him to reelection, and Donald Trump regularly brags about his role in the end of Roe v.

Wade, the Supreme Court decision that protected abortion rights nationwide.\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., the longshot independent hopeful with a famous family name whose candidacy has centered heavily on his skepticism of vaccines, barely mentions abortion. When he does, he often sends mixed signals.\nKennedy has said he believes the decision to seek an abortion should be left to women and their doctors. But he has held just one campaign event focused on abortion, an October visit to an Atlanta facility founded by Angela Stanton King — an anti-abortion and criminal justice reform activist and former Trump supporter whom the ex-president pardoned for her role in a car theft ring. In the months that followed Kennedy's appearance at Stanton King's facility, which aims to convince women to carry their pregnancies to term, he has repeated her false and inflammatory claims that abortion providers systematically target Black women.\nAdvertisement\nKennedy has avoided taking a concrete stance on the nation's patchwork of abortion bans and U.S. House Republicans' efforts to pass federal restrictions, calling abortion a 'culture war issue' used to divide people. He has said that 'every abortion is a tragedy,' but has few plans to take on the issue in the White House.\nKennedy mentioned abortion just twice in the 11 speeches and campaign events that appear on his YouTube page. He mentioned the word 'vaccine' 10 times. On X, formerly Twitter, he's mentioned the word 'abortion' five times since the start of last year. He posted the word 'vaccine' 64 times in the same period.\nTwitter, he's mentioned the word 'abortion' five times since the start of last year. He posted the word 'vaccine' 64 times in the same period.\n'He's trying to avoid what's probably the most salient issue right now,' Roy Behr, the author of 'Third Parties in America: Citizen Response to Major Party Failure.\"\nKennedy's ambiguity on abortion — an issue many voters say is a major motivator for them this race — may not hurt him in November. Kennedy, the nephew of a former president and son of a former U.S. attorney general, has appealed to a politically diverse group of supporters with nuanced views, including some who identify as conservative but weary of Trump and others who describe themselves as liberals unenthused with Biden. Outlining a clearer abortion position could hurt his standing with one or more of those groups.\nAdvertisement\nKennedy doesn't focus on abortion in speeches because it is a divisive issue, his campaign told The Washington Post.\n'Mr. Kennedy does not want to add fuel to the fire,' campaign spokeswoman Stefanie Spear wrote in an email, citing issues including chronic disease, infrastructure, disarmament and farming practices that protect the environment. 'These issues also have the potential to unify the country, unlike abortion, which is fundamentally divisive. So, Mr. Kennedy makes his position plain, but does not dwell on the subject.'\nSpear said Kennedy, who has not previously shared his thoughts on Arizona's state Supreme Court decision to revive a near-total ban on abortion earlier this month, opposes the ruling. She said he also disagreed with Trump's proposal to leave abortion restrictions up to the states.\nAdvertisement\nAfter The Post enquired about Kennedy's abortion position, the campaign added a new abortion policy page to its website, proposing 'a massive subsidized daycare initiative' paid for by funds Kennedy would reroute from Ukraine war aid. The page doesn't provide any more information about how Kennedy would respond to abortion bans in states.\nTwelve percent of voters, including two-thirds of Democrats, say abortion is the 'most important issue' in their 2024 vote, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll last month. Down the ballot, voters have signaled their disapproval of strict bans on abortion, supporting statewide referendums and candidates that would protect or expand abortion access.\nThis election marks the first time many voters will be able to weigh in post-Roe, and Kennedy's opponents could use his near-silence on abortion rights to cast doubt on his commitment to them, Democratic pollster Nancy Zdunkewicz said. New stories of women in dangerous, difficult circumstances who are unable to get abortions resonate with voters, she argued.\nAdvertisement\n'It's all way too real for people in a way that it just wasn't before,' Zdunkewicz said.\nKennedy is likely to attract voters who agree with him on vaccines and feel disaffected with the two major political parties, but will face more difficulty attracting people who aren't interested in one of his primary concerns such as vaccine safety, said Bernard Tamas, a political science professor at Valdosta State University and author of 'The Demise and Rebirth of American Third Parties.'\nvaccines and feel disaffected with the two major political parties, but will face more difficulty attracting people who aren't interested in one of his primary concerns such as vaccine safety, said Bernard Tamas, a political science professor at Valdosta State University and author of 'The Demise and Rebirth of American Third Parties.'\n'I don't think that very many people are going to make decisions for or against Kennedy based on abortion,' he said.\nKennedy's lone campaign stop focused on abortion was an October visit to Auntie Angie's House, a center for pregnant women in a Black community in Atlanta run by Stanton King. When Trump pardoned Stanton King, he cited her advocacy for people reentering society after being released from prison.\nAdvertisement\nKennedy's campaign says he 'misspoke' when he referred to the percent of Black women receiving abortions, but neither of the claims he repeated is correct according to multiple research studies.\nMore than 6 in 10 abortion clinics were located in predominantly White neighborhoods and about 1 in 10 clinics were in predominantly Black neighborhoods, according to a 2014 report from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy group that favors abortion rights. The group told The Post that post-Roe abortion bans in states with large Black populations have likely led to fewer clinics in Black neighborhoods since that analysis was completed.\nAdvertisement\nStanton King told The Post she did not ask Kennedy during his visit when he believes life begins, whether he would sign an abortion ban or his thoughts on the abortion restrictions passed in neighboring states. But Stanton King came away with the belief that Kennedy could do a better job than the major party candidates in bridging the partisan divide, and she later joined his campaign as an advisor. She said she appreciated Kennedy's promise to invest the same amount of federal resources that are committed to abortion services in social safety net programs for new mothers who need aid.\nMany of Kennedy's rare comments about abortion have come during media interviews, providing a patchy view of his policy and personal beliefs.\nAt the Iowa State Fair in August 2023, Kennedy said he would support a federal ban on abortion after 15 weeks of gestation, then said he would not 'personally' restrict abortion but added, 'I think the states have a right to protect a child once the child becomes viable, and that right, it increases.' (His campaign later clarified that he would not sign a ban.)\nIn an interview with PBS News in November, Kennedy said he didn't know what Biden could do to help protect women's access to abortions.\nAdvertisement\nIn a video released the same day as Biden's State of the Union address, in which the president called for Congress to restore Roe , Kennedy didn't mention abortion rights at all.\nRoe, Kennedy didn't mention abortion rights at all.\nBiden's allies have emphasized the president's efforts to expand access to contraception, abortion medication and emergency abortion care and point out the stark contrast with Trump's work to restrict abortion access. When Kerry Kennedy, Kennedy's sister, endorsed Biden along with more than a dozen other members of her family at a campaign rally Thursday, she cited Biden's support for abortion rights as one of the main reasons to back him.\nKennedy's running mate, Nicole Shanahan, funded research into the longevity of women's reproductive health and criticized in-vitro fertilization as 'one of the biggest lies that's being told about women's health today.' In a lengthy post on X on April 9, after Arizona's state Supreme Court decision, Shanahan wrote she 'can hold both beliefs,' suggesting bans are 'coercive' and 'wrong' but that women should carry pregnancies to term unless the mother or baby's health is at risk.\nMost voters who have already said they plan to vote for Kennedy said he talks about abortion enough.\nMike Roy, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel in Annapolis, Md., said he is voting for Kennedy because he believes the independent can keep America out of other countries' wars, close the Southern border and more aggressively regulate polluters. Abortion is not a top issue for the 46-year-old, but he agrees with Kennedy that women should have the right to choose the procedure. Still, he sees little point in Kennedy focusing on the topic.\nAdvertisement\n'I don't think he needs to talk about it more,' Roy said. 'It's such a polarizing issue and the theme of the campaign is to heal the divide.'\nLori Spencer, a Kennedy campaign volunteer in Oklahoma City who voted for the libertarian candidates in the last two presidential elections, disagrees. The 54-year-old was once a loyal Democratic voter but she left the party in 1996 after she felt like its leaders weren't keeping their promises, arguing Democrats could have protected Roe when they had the chance. Biden is no different, she believes.\nRoe when they had the chance. Biden is no different, she believes.\n'He talks the talk, but he doesn't walk the walk,' she said.\nSpencer said Kennedy might benefit from talking about abortion rights more and appealing more to voters like her who believe the government should not be involved in medical decisions.\n'I personally would like to see him be more vocal about his pro-choice beliefs,' Spencer said. 'But he'll talk about it when asked and he'll give you a clear answer. I don't think there's any ambiguity or misunderstanding of his position. He's very clear. So I'm happy enough with that.'\nKennedy's campaign has also used his abortion position to appeal to conservative voters. Rita Palma, who worked for Kennedy gathering ballot access signatures in New York, told voters in this month that the candidate's position was comparable to Trump's. Palma was later fired after being caught on video saying Kennedy could help Trump win.\n'Bobby believes and I heard this out of his own mouth: ‘Every abortion is a tragedy,'' she said in the video. 'He's definitely not, you know, 100% pro-life. But none of the candidates are. Even Trump is saying that they have to find that, quote-unquote sweet spot in order to win elections.' Palma declined to comment for this story.",

            "summary": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said Sunday he would introduce legislation that would help Arizonans get abortions in his state, a move that comes after the Arizona Supreme Court this month ruled that a near-total abortion ban from 1864 can take effect in the coming weeks.\nThe court decision has already had a notable impact on the politics in Arizona, a pivotal battleground state for the November election. It is also testing the limits of Republican support, especially after the GOP-controlled Arizona legislature last week failed to repeal the Civil War-era law.\nNewsom announced the proposal during an appearance on MSNBC's 'Inside with Jen Psaki,' saying it was time for those who support access to abortion to respond to Republican-led bans on the procedure with assertiveness.\nThe California governor also unveiled a new ad targeting proposed legislation in Alabama that would make it illegal for people to help minors get abortion care without informing a parent or legal guardian. Newsom's political action committee, Campaign for Democracy, is paying for the ad as part of its focus on abortion rights.\nAdvertisement\n'This is happening in real time,' Newsom said of Republican-led attacks on abortion access.

'Our response must be in real time to be more assertive and proactive.'\nThe emergency legislation would expedite the licenses of Arizona abortion providers to let them treat their patients in California. It will be introduced in the statehouse this week through the legislature's women's caucus, Newsom added.\n'We're now doing that as it relates to being a good neighbor, not just to those that seek reproductive care and reproductive freedom, but also to our neighbors, particularly in Arizona,' he said. 'We've got some ideas to help those that seek to get their care in California to have their back as well.'\nIn a statement to The Washington Post, Brandon Richards, a spokesman for Newsom, said the governor's office has worked closely with California state lawmakers to 'quickly and effectively' respond to the Arizona Supreme Court's decision.\nAdvertisement\nRichards did not provide details on how quickly this emergency legislation could become a law, but said additional details will be shared in the coming days.\nNewsom's office worked alongside Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs (D) and Attorney General Kris Mayes (D) to develop a plan that would expedite Arizona abortion providers' abilities to provide reproductive care to their constituents in California.\nA near-total abortion ban first enacted in 1864 is expected to go into effect in Arizona as soon as June 8 if the state legislature does not intervene . The law forbids the procedure except to save a mother's life and punishes providers with prison time. The decision supersedes Arizona's current law, which permits abortions up to 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n.

Lake, who has long been a staunch antiabortion politician, suggested that Arizonans seeking abortions should travel across state lines into California.\n'We took that quite literally and quite seriously,' Newsom said of Lake's words.\nAdvertisement\nWhile former president Donald Trump and other top Republicans have celebrated the overturning of Roe, which was made possible with the help of three conservative Supreme Court justices appointed by Trump, the former president and other Republicans running for office this November have also sought distance from the decision and its repercussions, after it became clear that restricting abortion access was not popular among most American voters.\nRoe, which was made possible with the help of three conservative Supreme Court justices appointed by Trump, the former president and other Republicans running for office this November have also sought distance from the decision and its repercussions, after it became clear that restricting abortion access was not popular among most American voters.\nTrump has recently shifted to promoting the idea that laws on abortion access should be left up to the states. But, like other Democratic leaders nationwide, Newsom said he doesn't believe Trump when he says he won't sign a national abortion ban.\n'He's a liar,' Newsom said. 'He'll say whatever he needs to say on any day of the week.'\nKaroline Leavitt, press secretary for Trump's campaign, shot down his claim.\nAdvertisement\n'President Trump has repeatedly said he will not sign a federal abortion ban and has long been consistent in supporting the rights of states to make decisions on abortion,' Leavitt said in a statement, adding Newsom and Democrats were 'out of touch' with most Americans on their stance on the issue.\nDuring his MSNBC appearance, Newsom said he's focusing on neighboring Arizona and Nevada — swing states — electorally, arguing that both states 'will play, potentially, an outsized role in this election.' The California governor, widely seen in the Democratic Party as a likely 2028 presidential contender, said he will campaign there on the issue of abortion, hoping that the two states will help deliver a presidential win to Biden and help Democrats keep the Senate.",

            "summary": "INDIANAPOLIS — Indiana allows so few abortions that health officials stopped releasing individual reports to protect patient privacy — a move some Republicans are now fighting to reverse.\nThe Republicans, including prominent candidates for office this year, want access to reports detailing each abortion still performed in the state. Advocates for abortion rights and some state officials warn that would jeopardize the privacy of physicians and patients who can only receive abortions under strict circumstances.\nThe state bans abortions except within limited time frames in cases of rape, incest, lethal fetal anomaly and serious health risks to the patient. Like many states, Indiana has long collected data on abortions, but the Department of Health last year decided to keep the individual reports from public record and only release its regular summary data four times a year to make it harder to potentially identify patients.\nAdvertisement\nIndiana law requires physicians to submit 'terminated pregnancy reports' with demographic and medical history information to the health department. The reports do not name patients but can list their zip code and county of residence, and they're rarely released in states that collect them, according to experts.\nIn the days following the overturn of Roe v. Wade, an individual record obtained by the Indianapolis Star through a public records request confirmed an abortion provided to a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio.\nThe topic has gradually become a political football as Indiana's competitive primary for governor approaches in early May.\nIn January, Republican gubernatorial candidate and former Attorney General Curtis Hill called on the health department and Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb to allow the release of individual reports. Republican Lt. Gov. and gubernatorial candidate Suzanne Crouch pledged in a March post to X to make the reports public record if she is elected.\nAdvertisement\nAnd on Thursday, Attorney General Todd Rokita, who is running for reelection, issued an advisory opinion arguing the reports should be public record. The opinion doesn't change any practices but was in response to an inquiry from state Sen. Andy Zay, a congressional candidate, Rokita's office said.\nVoters should ask the field of gubernatorial candidates to take a stance, Rokita said during a Thursday news conference.\nAfter Rokita released his opinion, the health department said the reports are not public record, and pointed to an informal opinion written by an appointed open records official in December.\nRokita argued the reports are not medical records and could show whether an abortion was performed legally. Without the reports, he said, 'there is no effective way' to enforce the state's near-total ban.\nAdvertisement\nThe Legislature should act next year if the department doesn't, Zay said Thursday.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'We can use them as tools to hold those around the periphery of abortion clinics and abortion doctors accountable,' Zay said of the reports.\nThe individual reports ask patients for information including zip code, age, race, ethnicity, educational attainment, marital status, previous pregnancies, the date of their last period and the father's age, according to the most recent quarterly summary. Patients may refuse to answer questions, the department said.\nPhysicians report information on the type of procedure, the reason for the abortion and an estimate of the length of the pregnancy. The individual reports also include the name of the physician, the name of the facility and the date of the abortion.\nIndiana's ban went into effect in August. From October to December, 46 terminated pregnancy reports were filed with the health department compared to 1,724 in the same period in 2022.\nAdvertisement\nIt is not common for states to release individual abortion reports, said Rachel Jones, principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a science-based research group that supports abortion rights.\nJones said seeking individual reports is an effort to intimidate health care providers and patients.\n'There's no public health or even legal purpose for trying to impose this,' Jones said.\nRokita denied that the small number of reports makes it easier to identify patients and said that the health department can redact some information before making reports public.\nThe attorney general has taken up multiple legal battles focused on abortion. He gave a televised interview criticizing an Indianapolis OBGYN who provided an abortion to the 10-year-old from Ohio. The Indiana Supreme Court found last year that some of Rokita's statement violated rules of professional conduct for attorneys.\nRokita is weaponizing the reports, said Rebecca Gibron, CEO of the Planned Parenthood region that includes Indiana.",

The truth is, an overwhelming majority of Americans believe in a woman's right to choose.\nAbortion has been on the ballot in some form in seven states since the Supreme Court struck down Roe .

Many other states will hopefully have their say on abortion rights in November. One is Missouri, my home state.\nGrowing up in St. Louis with three sisters and a dad who is a doctor, I didn't see reproductive health as a political issue. It was real life. And policymakers were making women's lives harder by limiting access to care. Even under Roe , it became virtually impossible to get an abortion in Missouri because of strategically placed hurdles to accessing care and requirements so narrow that eventually only one abortion clinic remained open in the entire state. Then the Trump administration appointed justices to the Supreme Court who ultimately overturned Roe . Minutes later, Missouri became the first state to ban abortion without exceptions for rape or incest — only for a few medical emergencies such as 'imminent death.'\nRoe, it became virtually impossible to get an abortion in Missouri because of strategically placed hurdles to accessing care and requirements so narrow that eventually only one abortion clinic remained open in the entire state.

Missouri now has the chance to protect it. Missourians for Constitutional Freedom is working to get an abortion amendment to the state constitution on the November ballot. But anti-choice Republicans are trying to make it harder for that to happen by weakening direct democracy.\nFirst, Missouri's secretary of state tried to add overtly partisan and misleading language to the ballot initiative to restore abortion rights. Thankfully, the Missouri Supreme Court stopped him. Now state Senate Republicans are overriding 200 years of precedent by significantly raising the threshold for constitutional amendments to pass. Under their new scheme, a simple majority of voters statewide would no longer be enough to pass an amendment. Instead, an amendment would need to win a majority in five of the state's eight congressional districts (five of which are deeply conservative).\n200 years of precedent by significantly raising the threshold for constitutional amendments to pass. Under their new scheme, a simple majority of voters statewide would no longer be enough to pass an amendment. Instead, an amendment would need to win a majority in five of the state's eight congressional districts (five of which are deeply conservative).\nThis is all part of a nationwide playbook to rip away our freedoms. In Kansas, antiabortion politicians tried to confuse voters with convoluted language on an abortion referendum. In Ohio, they tried to make it harder for a majority of voters to change the state's constitution to protect abortion rights. Their efforts failed spectacularly, but that isn't stopping lawmakers in Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi, Florida and Montana from trying similar tactics. Activists in those states are trying to give voters a voice on abortion this November, and politicians are trying to silence them.\nto silence them.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nFor most people, reproductive health care isn't about politics — it's deeply personal. It's fundamentally about freedom, dignity and bodily autonomy. That's why I've been engaged on this issue since I was a teenager. In 2012, I trained as a clinic escort to protect patients arriving for appointments at Planned Parenthood in St. Louis. Years later, I became involved with the incredible team at CHOICES in Carbondale, Ill. — across the state line from Missouri — and dozens of other clinics. When Roe fell, these clinics were overwhelmed. To help fill the gap, I launched an organization called Gateway Coalition to direct funding to various Midwest groups to provide accessible abortion care. And I continue to learn from organizations such as the Abortion Bridge Collaborative Fund advisory council and Abortion Care Network.\nRoe fell, these clinics were overwhelmed. To help fill the gap, I launched an organization called Gateway Coalition to direct funding to various Midwest groups to provide accessible abortion care. And I continue to learn from organizations such as the Abortion Bridge Collaborative Fund advisory council and Abortion Care Network.\nThrough clinic visits and meetings with providers, center operators, and movement leaders across the country, I've learned how desperately patients need abortion care and what clinics go through to provide it. Clinics are being closed down, doctors are being blocked from providing care, and women are being forced to carry pregnancies against their will.\nAdvertisement\nThe Missouri I know supports freedom. Missourians know that decisions around pregnancy — including abortion, birth control, IVF and miscarriage care — are personal and private, and should be left up to patients and their families. As a mother, sister, daughter, friend and someone who cares deeply about the dignity of others, I'm working toward a future where everyone has the freedom to access abortion affordably and on a timeline that meets their needs. The Missouri Right to Reproductive Freedom Amendment is an important step toward that future. We have to pass it, and then we have to build on it. I'm committed to staying in this fight until abortion is safely and affordably available for every patient nationwide.\nIf you agree that patients, not politicians, should make their own health-care decisions — or simply that a small minority should not prevent a majority from winning at the ballot box — make your voice heard this election cycle.\nIf you're in Missouri, that means signing the petition for the Missouri Right to Reproductive Freedom Amendment by May 5, volunteering to gather signatures from others and then voting for the ballot initiative in the general election. Across the country, that means showing up at the polls when politicians try to twist the rules to serve their anti-choice agenda. And, this November, it means voting for candidates for president and Congress who will codify the protections of Roe v. Wade into federal law — and rejecting those promising to further restrict our reproductive rights.\nRoe v.

Shawnna Bolick and Reps. Tim Dunn and Matt Gress — as well as Arizona U.S. Senate candidate Kari Lake — lays bare a larger crisis within the Republican party over how to handle the abortion issue ahead of November. The U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade passed the practical decision of whether to allow access to abortion to state lawmakers, and many Republicans are now caught between long-held, often religiously rooted views that have defined the GOP for generations and a more practical desire to win elections.\nRoe v. Wade passed the practical decision of whether to allow access to abortion to state lawmakers, and many Republicans are now caught between long-held, often religiously rooted views that have defined the GOP for generations and a more practical desire to win elections.\nIn recent days, Lake, who once described the 160-year-old measure as a 'great law,' has been personally lobbying some Republicans to repeal the ban, highlighting the political stakes of the looming vote. According to one lawmaker who received such a call and spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, Lake made it clear that she 'understands [the pre-Roe ban] will be bad for her and for Trump.' They discussed how Arizona is essential for Trump to secure the presidency, the lawmaker said. Trump lost the state to President Biden in 2020 by only 10,457 votes.\nThe dilemma facing Republicans on abortion has grown even more acute since last Wednesday, when Trump said Arizona's abortion ban goes too far and promised it would be 'straightened out' by 'the governor and everybody else.' Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee who has bragged about his role in the overturning of Roe, made a similar promise about a pending six-week abortion ban in Florida, even as he has argued the abortion issue should be left to the states.\nthe abortion issue should be left to the states.\nAdvertisement\nTwo Republicans in the Arizona House of Representatives and two in the Senate would have to join all of both chambers' Democrats to repeal the ban, which could take effect as early as June 8 without legislative action. If the legislature agrees to repeal the 1864 ban, the current law banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy prevails, legislative staffers and lawmakers said.

One received what they described as 'threats' from a leading state antiabortion advocate.\n'This is the most difficult decision that I've made in the eight years that I've been there,' said Rep. David Cook (R), a longtime abortion foe who, as of Tuesday, said he had not decided how he would vote. 'You're faced with the personal convictions of protecting … an innocent life.'\nAdvertisement\nSen. Ken Bennett (R), who represents a red area and once presided over the chamber as president and also served as secretary of state, predicted that several Republicans would not 'have a chance' of getting reelected if the pre-Roe ban is allowed to stand.\nwho represents a red area and once presided over the chamber as president and also served as secretary of state, predicted that several Republicans would not 'have a chance' of getting reelected if the pre-Roe ban is allowed to stand.\n'I'm expecting Wednesday to be one of the hardest days the Arizona legislature has ever had,' he said.\nThe question of the 1864 law has deeply divided the caucus, with some staunch antiabortion advocates urging their colleagues to hold firm against repeal — and lobbing personal attacks at those who are considering voting for it.\n'Anybody who would allow innocent people to be killed to preserve their political career to win an election does not deserve to win,' said Rep. Alex Kolodin (R), who sees the 1864 law as a victory for the party's core ideological position as well as a major humanitarian triumph.\nAdvertisement\nSeveral GOP lawmakers and operatives said Trump's comments could ease the decision to vote for a repeal for some Republicans who were on the fence, granting them permission to go against their values for a better chance at securing victory in November.\n'It gave them cover,' said one prominent Arizona Republican who supports the repeal and spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss internal party dynamics. Trump's statements would have been even more helpful, the person added, if some antiabortion members were not 'virtue signaling' about the pre-Roe ban and 'trying to force everybody to be pilloried for representing their constituents.'\nSome Republican resistance to the state Supreme Court ruling emerged almost immediately. Soon after the court made its decision on April 9, several GOP lawmakers issued statements condemning the move, including Gress, Bolick and Sen. T.J. Shope — who all hail from districts that could be competitive in November.\nAdvertisement\nBolick, who is married to an Arizona Supreme Court justice, urged fellow Republicans to 'find common ground of common sense' and 'repeal the territorial law.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nGress made a similar argument on the House floor last Wednesday, after he moved to suspend the chamber's rules to bring forward the motion to repeal the law — a maneuver that surprised and angered many of his Republican colleagues.

Gress declined to comment.)\nGress declined to comment.)\nAlmost all of the GOP lawmakers who are now considering a repeal voted in the spring of 2022 — before Roe was overturned — for a law that banned abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy and included an explicit endorsement of the 1864 ban, specifying that the new 15-week law would not preclude the near-total abortion ban from taking effect if the U.S. Supreme Court acted.

Katie Hobbs (D) stressed that Republicans in the legislature 'asked for this.'\n'They own this. They voted for a bill that had this explicit language in it,' she said. 'They had the ability to not vote for this law in the first place.'\nHobbs and her team have talked to key GOP lawmakers about the repeal effort, assuring them she would sign repeal legislation if it passes, according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose private deliberations.\nSome Republicans started to recognize the shifting political winds soon after Roe was overturned — especially after voters in conservative Kansas voted overwhelmingly to protect abortion rights in August 2022. In Arizona, Gress sent out mailers ahead of the midterms that year saying he opposed the pre-Roe ban, despite sponsoring several bills during his time in the legislature designed to recognize a fetus as a person.\nsaying he opposed the pre-Roe ban, despite sponsoring several bills during his time in the legislature designed to recognize a fetus as a person.\nAdvertisement\nSome Republicans maintain that a vote to repeal the 1864 law would not be at odds with their antiabortion beliefs because they are trying to be strategic about choosing a path forward that would prevent the most abortions. Democrats are trying to get an initiative on the November ballot that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution and allow the procedure to the point of fetal viability, or about 24 weeks. These Republicans argue that supporting the repeal could demonstrate they are attuned to voter sentiments while lending credibility to GOP opposition to the ballot measure.\n'What's going to save the most lives?

            "excerpt": "Workers are entitled to time off and other job accommodations for abortions under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, according to finalized federal regulations published Monday",
            "summary": "NEW YORK — Workers are entitled to time off and other job accommodations for abortions — along with pregnancy-related medical conditions like miscarriage, stillbirth and lactation — under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, according to finalized federal regulations published Monday.\nThe regulations provide guidance for employers and workers on how to implement the law, which passed with robust bipartisan Congressional support in December 2022 but sparked controversy last year when the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission included abortions in its draft rules. The language means that workers can ask for time off to obtain an abortion and recover from the procedure.\nThe EEOC says its decision to keep the abortion provisions in its final rules despite criticism from some conservatives is consistent with its own longstanding interpretation of Title VII, as well as court rulings. The federal agency added that the new law does not obligate employers or employer-sponsored health plans to cover abortion-related costs, and that the type of accommodation that most likely will be sought under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act regarding an abortion is time off to attend a medical appointment or for recovery, which does not have to be paid.\nAdvertisement\nThe act requires most employers with 15 or more employees to provide 'reasonable accommodations' for a worker's known limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions — including fertility and infertility treatments in some cases — unless the accommodation will cause the employer an undue hardship. The EEOC's regulations, which will be used as a framework to enforce the law, will go into effect on June 18.\nLabor advocates hailed the new law as especially important for women of color who are most likely to work in low-wage, physically demanding jobs but are often denied accommodations for everything from time off for medical appointments to the ability to sit or stand on the job. Major business groups also supported the law, citing the need for clarity about the accommodations that employers are required to give pregnant workers.\n'No one should have to risk their job for their health just because they are pregnant, recovering from childbirth, or dealing with a related medical condition,' said EEOC Chair Charlotte A. Burrows on Monday.\nAdvertisement\nBut Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion activists denounced the EEOC's inclusion of abortion after the agency first released its proposed rule in August for a monthslong public commentary period. Abortion rights proponents, meanwhile, applauded the provision as critical at time when abortion rights have been curtailed in many states following the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The EEOC is composed of three Democratic commissioners and two Republican commissioners.\nSen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the lead Republican sponsor of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Law, accused the Biden administration on Monday of 'shocking and illegal' disregard of the legislative process to promote a political agenda. The Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal organization, said the Biden administration was trying to 'smuggle an abortion mandate' into the law.\nBut in comments submitted to the EEOC, the American Civil Liberties Union applauded the agency for 'recognizing that abortion has for decades been approved under the law as a ‘related medical condition' to pregnancy that entitles workers to reasonable accommodations, including time off to obtain abortion care.'\nAdvertisement\nThe EEOC said it had received 54,000 comments urging the commission to exclude abortion from its definition of medical condition related to pregnancy, but it also received 40,000 comments supporting its inclusion. While the commission said it understood that both sides were expressing 'sincere, deeply held convictions,' it cited numerous federal cases that it said supported its interpretation that abortion is a pregnancy-related condition deserving of protection.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe new rules include extensive details on the types of accommodations that pregnant workers can request, from temporary exemption from jobs duties like heavy lifting to considerations for morning sickness.\nWomen's right advocates had campaigned for years for the law, arguing that the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act offered inadequate protection for pregnant workers. The 1978 law, which amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibited discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and marked a major shift for gender equality at time when pregnant women were routinely denied or pushed out of jobs.\nAdvertisement\nBut in order to receive workplace accommodations, pregnant women had to demonstrate that co-workers had received similar benefits for comparable needs, since the act stated only that pregnant workers must be treated similarly to other employees, not that they deserved special consideration. That put a burden of proof that many women found impossible to meet, forcing them to work in unsafe conditions or quit their jobs, according to A Better Balance, one of the most vocal advocates for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.\nThe new law makes clear that that pregnant workers are entitled to accommodations to keep doing their jobs, mirroring the process for workers with disabilities. It places the burden on employers to prove 'undue hardship' if they deny requests for modifications.\nThe EEOC typically handles between 2,000 and 4,000 pregnancy discrimination charges a year, many involving denial of workplace accommodations. A study conducted by A Better Balance found that in two-thirds of pregnancy discrimination cases that followed the 2015 Supreme Court ruling, courts determined the employers were allowed to deny accommodations under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.\nAdvertisement\nIn a prepared statement, A Better Balance Co-President Dina Bakst applauded the EEOC 'for issuing robust final regulations that appropriately recognize the broad scope of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.'\n____",

            "excerpt": "Health officials said rules would protect the privacy of women seeking abortions from GOP prosecutors who have threatened to crack down on the procedure.",
            "summary": "The Biden administration on Monday announced new rules intended to protect the privacy of patients seeking abortions, and the health workers who may have provided them, from Republican prosecutors who have threatened to crack down on the procedure.\nThe rules strengthen a nearly 30-year-old health privacy law — known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA — to offer more robust legal protections to those who obtain or provide reproductive health care in a state where it is legal to do so. The final policy prohibits physicians, insurers and other health-care organizations from disclosing health information to state officials for the purposes of conducting an investigation, filing a lawsuit or prosecuting a patient or provider. It covers women who cross state lines to legally terminate a pregnancy and those who qualify for an exception to their state's abortion ban, such as in cases of rape, incest or a medical emergency.\nUnder previous rules, organizations were allowed to disclose private medical information to law enforcement in certain cases, such as a criminal investigation. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services said they had heard from patients and providers who were confused about their legal risks or had even deferred care amid GOP threats in the nearly two dozen states with abortion restrictions.\nAdvertisement\n'People feel scared to confide in their providers. People are worried in this new climate about how their medical information might be used,' said Melanie Fontes Rainer, director of the civil rights office at HHS, which revamped the rules. 'The goal here is to reinstate trust into the provider medical relationship. … The goal here is that people don't stay home if they're too scared to get care.'\nMonday's announcement is the latest effort by the Biden administration intended to safeguard reproductive health care, a central element of President Biden's reelection bid. However, the swell of criminal prosecutions that many abortion rights advocates and Democrats feared hasn't materialized since the Supreme Court's ruling nearly two years ago in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , which overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated the constitutional right to abortion. State abortion bans explicitly exempt those seeking abortions from prosecution.\nDobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated the constitutional right to abortion. State abortion bans explicitly exempt those seeking abortions from prosecution.\nBut doctors can face steep fines and jail time, and many health workers have said they are confused about the current legal landscape governing abortion access, such as whether a federal emergency care law takes priority over state abortion bans, as the Biden administration has argued. HHS and reproductive rights advocates have also cited cases such as the arrest of Brittany Watts as examples of the need for stronger privacy protections. Watts, an Ohio medical receptionist, has said she miscarried at home last year and told a nurse, who then reported the situation to police.\nAdvertisement\nSome GOP leaders have insisted they need access to patients' reproductive health information to ensure that their states' abortion restrictions are effective. Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita (R) this month said his state's terminated pregnancy reports, which offer some identifying information about individual abortions, should be released as public records.\nNineteen Republican attorneys general last year bashed the Biden administration's efforts to overhaul HIPAA as unnecessary and unconstitutional.\nBiden officials have 'pushed a false narrative that States are seeking to treat pregnant women as criminals or punish medical personnel who provide lifesaving care,' the attorneys general wrote in a June 2023 letter to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. 'Based on this lie, the Administration has sought to wrest control over abortion back from the people in defiance of the Constitution and Dobbs .'\nDobbs.'\nAdvertisement\nThe White House has countered that federal privacy laws were insufficient for a post- Roe world.\nRoe world.\nUnder new state abortion restrictions, 'it's going to be a crime, which means that it is very likely if law enforcement requests your personal and private medical records, they may be entitled to receive them,' Vice President Harris said at an administration meeting on reproductive health care last year. 'Part of the conversation that we are having today is what we can do … to reinforce protections for patients' privacy.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nFontes Rainer said the effort is personal to her. The HHS civil rights official said she was pregnant last year with twins before miscarrying and needing an abortion.\n'It is my absolute duty to share my story, and to do everything I can to [help] the millions of women across the country who don't have a voice,' Fontes Rainer said in an interview Sunday, adding that her office worked 'pretty quickly' to overhaul the federal health privacy rules.",

            "summary": "PHOENIX — Democrats in the Arizona Senate cleared a path to bring a proposed repeal of the state's near-total ban on abortions to a vote after the state's highest court concluded the law can be enforced and the state House blocked efforts to undo the long-dormant statute.\nAlthough no vote was taken on the repeal itself, Republican Sens. T.J. Shope and Shawnna Bolick sided with 14 Democrats in the Senate on Wednesday in changing rules to let a repeal proposal advance after the deadline for hearing bills had passed. Proponents say the Senate could vote on the repeal as early as May 1.\nIf the proposed repeal wins final approval from the Republican-controlled Legislature and is signed into law by Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, the 2022 statute banning the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy would become the prevailing abortion law.\nAdvertisement\nThe move by the Senate came after Republicans in the Arizona House, for the second time in a week, blocked attempts on Wednesday to bring a repeal bill to a vote. One Republican joined 29 Democrats in the Arizona House to bring the repeal measure to a vote Wednesday, but the effort failed twice on 30-30 votes.\nThe state's near-total ban, which predates Arizona's statehood, permits abortions only for saving the woman's life and provides no exceptions for rape or incest. It carries a sentence of two to five years in prison for doctors or anyone else who assists in an abortion.\nLast week, the Arizona Supreme Court drastically altered the legal landscape for terminating pregnancies in the state, concluding the 1864 law can be enforced and suggesting doctors can be prosecuted under the statute.\nThe debate in the House over whether to allow a vote on the repeal proposal was much fierier than in the Senate. Members from pro-life groups packed the House's gallery and gave a standing ovation after efforts to bring the repeal bill to a vote was defeated.\nAdvertisement\nHouse Speaker Ben Toma said those wanting to repeal the law were demanding action too soon, noting the court decision to revive the law came only a week ago. He said the only way he would bring the repeal bill to a vote would be if his fellow Republicans wanted it.\n'We have deeply held beliefs,' Toma said. 'And I would ask everyone in this chamber to respect the fact that someone wants to believe that abortion is in fact the murder of children.'\nDemocratic Rep. Alma Hernandez of Tucson said Republicans are failing to act on a matter of great importance to Arizonans. 'This is what we are arguing about right now: whether or not we should overturn something that is archaic, something that is going to really impact women in Arizona,' Hernandez said. 'And yet we want to talk about a process or the right process.'\nAdvertisement\nRep. Matt Gress, the Phoenix Republican who joined with Democrats in trying to bring the repeal measure to a vote, said the 160-year-old law doesn't reflect the values of most people living in the state.\n'We need to get that taken care of and get it taken care of as soon as possible,' Gress said. 'I think the eyes of the nation are on Arizona.'\nIn a statement, Hobbs, who supports a repeal of the law, said, 'Republican extremists in the House have yet again failed to do the right thing. In just one week living under this new reality, women, doctors, and healthcare providers have already begun to feel the devastating effects of living under a total abortion ban. We cannot go on like this.'\nThe Center for Arizona Policy, a longtime backer of anti-abortion proposals before the Legislature, released a statement saying, 'Today was a victory for life, even if only temporarily. Most pro-life lawmakers kept their promise today to protect the unborn and their mothers and not repeal Arizona's pre-Roe law.'\nAdvertisement\nThe Civil War era law had been blocked since the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision guaranteed the constitutional right to an abortion nationwide.\nAfter Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022, then-Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, persuaded a state judge to lift an injunction that blocked enforcement of the 1864 ban. Brnovich's Democratic successor, Attorney General Kris Mayes, urged the state's high court to hold the line against it.",

On one hand, I believe deeply in personal autonomy. That said, even with restrictions, the danger for abuse (as seen in the Netherlands) remains. Moreover, given the rapid strides in medicine, I don't know how doctors can be so certain about a six-months-to-live prognosis. I also worry about the slippery slope (expanding assisted suicide from terminal patients to chronically ill ones). While I support giving patients the full range of palliative care at the end of life, I remain deeply conflicted about assisted suicide laws.\nAnswer: The bill under consideration in the British Parliament would allow a patient to request life-ending medication under very strict circumstances (e.g., two independent doctors and a judge to verify that the patient has a terminal illness with six months or less to live, and is not under duress).

The judge on Monday methodically struck down Trump's objections to evidence demonstrating his fear that the alleged sexual encounters would ruin his election chances in 2016. Oh, and a hearing on whether he should be held in contempt for his ongoing Truth Social threats against witnesses will be held next week.\nAdvertisement\nThis is what justice looks like: slow but effective, imperfect but satisfying. When the rule of law operates as it should, it's something to behold.\nJournalism 101\nPeople on social media and other critics justifiably mocked, derided and denounced the New York Times for the headline, 'Two Imperfect Messengers Take On Abortion.' The sub-headline was nearly as bad: 'Neither side of the abortion divide would probably design the exact candidate they have in 2024.' This could be the crown jewel of 'both-sidesism,' accomplishing that feat in multiple ways.\nFor starters, it blurs the distinction between Biden's clear and unwavering position (to write Roe v. Wade into a federal statute) with Trump's well-documented inconsistencies, deflections and contradictions. These two men simply are not equally deficient communicators. That imbalance in clarity and sincerity actually might determine the campaign's outcome.\nRoe v.

You could not imagine a 1942 headline: 'Two imperfect messengers take on world war.' Awarding style points, as the story does, trivializes the abortion issue.\nFinally, the Times headline amounts to a self-parody of gamified political coverage: 'Neither side of the abortion divide would probably design the exact candidate they have in 2024.' (Well, neither team in the World Series would design the exact lineup they have.) In essence, the Times tells us, 'No one's perfect!' — an empty platitude. Journalists owe readers an accurate depiction of the candidates' vast differences in consistency, clarity and moral seriousness on abortion. Alas, such precision would demand truth-telling in lieu of feigned 'balance.'\n— an empty platitude.

            "summary": "In their first televised primary debate, Rep. David Trone and Prince George's County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks each sought to position themselves as the Democratic Party's best chance of defeating the state's popular, two-term former Republican governor in November.\nWith similar stances on key issues such as education and reproductive rights, the leading Democrats in the race for U.S. Senate emphasized contrasting experience in making their pitch to primary voters — all while agreeing on the stakes. The race is one of a handful of contests across the country with the power to determine control of the chamber in November, which Democrats currently hold by a razor-thin margin.\nTrone, a multimillionaire founder of Total Wine & More, highlighted his record in Congress, his business experience and a challenging upbringing over the course of an hour-long live program on Fox45 and WJLA7. Alsobrooks, who was previously Prince George's state's attorney, pointed to her own experiences as a woman and mother, her criminal justice background and her record leading the state's second-most populous county.\nAdvertisement\nTrone swiftly declared victory in a news release after the debate. Alsobrooks hailed her 'standout performance.' Each claimed momentum heading into the next phase of the contest.\nAs May 14 approaches, attention is building on what had largely been seen as a sleepy contest for a reliably blue seat until Hogan launched a surprise bid two months ago. Endorsements are flying, yards signs are popping up and airwaves are thrumming with campaign messaging — and money.\nThis week alone saw the liberal super PAC Fight Corporate Monopolies launch the cycle's first negative ad, swiping at Trone's business practices and comparing him to former Republican president Donald Trump. On Wednesday, Hogan deployed a nearly $1 million television ad buy half bankrolled by national Republicans eager to flip the open Senate seat red.\nAdvertisement\nNational dollars are flowing into a contest that had been largely shaped by Trone's deep pockets. He has loaned his campaign at least $41.7 million since the start of the primary race, campaign finance records show.\nAlsobrooks, an underdog in the race, according to recent polls, repeatedly focused attention on Trone's fortunes and interrogated his argument that self-funding helps insulate him from special interests — repeating a line of attack she and her surrogates have raised about him 'buying' the seat.\nDuring the debate, she took aim at contributions Trone has made in a personal capacity and through his company, Total Wine & More, to conservative leaders such as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) who have worked to quash abortion access.\nThat fact, she said, contrasts with a record of giving that Trone has touted. He helped establish an abortion clinic in Western Maryland near the border with West Virginia after that state effectively shut down the procedure.\nAdvertisement\n'He cannot claim credit for the good his company does and distance himself from the bad that it does,' Alsobrooks said.\nTrone, in turn, swatted at her accusations by insinuating her interests would lie with companies that have supported her campaign, referencing by name Exxon, Pfizer and Cigna.\n'When you take the money … then they must expect something [of politicians],' Trone said. 'They're not charities.'\nAlsobrooks has brought in more individual contributions than any other candidate so far, and filings show she has just under $3.2 million on hand. Still, Alsobrooks's performance Friday carried extra weight in a race with lopsided resources at a time when she is seeking to boost name recognition.\nPolls released over the past six weeks show Trone consistently leading her, and Hogan, who left office last year with high favorability ratings, leading them both.\nHogan has maintained that he is an underdog in a state where registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans 2 to 1. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll conducted in March found that while Hogan is better known than Trone and Alsobrooks, he faces a crosscurrent Democrats hope to exploit: Maryland voters said by a 20-point margin that they prefer Democratic control of the U.S. Senate.\nHogan was out front in a poll released this week by FOX45 News, the Baltimore Sun and the University of Baltimore and conducted by OpinionWorks. The results show Trone leading Alsobrooks, 49 percent to 28 percent.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Trone on Friday detailed a bipartisan spirit he said helped him compete with Hogan, Alsobrooks took the opportunity to question a record of political giving to the man he hopes to beat. In 2014, eight of Trone's businesses gave $30,000 to Hogan in an effort to help him get rid of campaign debt, The Post reported.\n'What we don't need is a Larry Hogan donor trying to take on Larry Hogan in the fall,' Alsobrooks said.\nAmong the sharpest jabs Friday was an exchange on endorsements, with Trone noting he had secured the support of prominent politicians from the county Alsobrooks represents.\nOn Thursday, he received an endorsement from Aisha Braveboy (D), the Prince George's County state's attorney who holds Alsobrooks's former position. Democratic Prince George's County Council members Krystal Oriadha and Edward Burroughs III — both of whom have endorsed Trone and been critical of Alsobrooks in the past — were in the studio Friday, at times huddling around Trone during commercial breaks.\nAdvertisement\n'The folks that really matter the most are those that know you the best,' Trone said. 'Prince George's County supports us. The list goes on and on and on.'\nAlsobrooks has picked up Democratic heavyweights from the local to the federal level. Among her supporters are Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Rep. Jamie Raskin and former Prince George's county executive Rushern Baker IV.\nThe pair didn't spar over topics such as the Israel-Hamas war, on which they both agree that Hamas should be defeated, a cease-fire is needed and that hostages must be released. They also said cities should have access to federal data currently withheld from the public to enhance law enforcement's ability to trace guns and quell crime.\nand that hostages must be released.

Hogan said he would not vote for a national abortion ban, but he also said he would not take a position on hypothetical legislation that would codify Roe v. Wade .\nRoe v. Wade.\nCracks in their positions appeared when asked about repealing the death penalty.\nAlsobrooks supported the death sentence of a man convicted of killing four people including two children when she was Prince George's state's attorney, a panelist noted. But as the federal government reconsiders the death penalty, Alsobrooks noted that she, too, has evolved on the issue.\nMarylanders have decided that the death penalty is no longer the law of the land in Maryland, 'and I agree with Maryland voters,' Alsobrooks said. I can tell you that I would also not support the death penalty on the federal level. … Having said that, what I believe is that anyone who harms a child or who murders a child in particular deserves the stiffest penalty available to that person. And right now in Maryland, that penalty is life without parole.\nIn his rebuttal, Trone emphasized his steadfast opposition to it. 'It's clearly cruel and unusual punishment, and it's clearly racist,' he said.\nEarly voting in Maryland's Democratic and Republican primaries begins May 2.",

And that's not just a story of Democrats and liberals leaving faith. The number of Republicans who attend church weekly and consider religion a core part of their lives is also shrinking.\nYet many policies enacted by local, state and federal Republican elected officials and conservative judges are straight from the religious right's agenda: vouchers and other initiatives to make it easier for parents to send their children to religious schools; limits on reproductive rights that ban abortion and could even threaten in vitro fertilization; restrictions on gay and particularly transgender Americans; provisions allowing religious Americans to cite their faith in declining to participate in various activities, such as getting vaccinated.\nAdvertisement\nLouisiana's House of Representatives last week passed a bill requiring the state's public schools and universities to display the Ten Commandments.

Some Republican operatives likely to play major roles in a second Trump term have openly stated that they believe government policies should be shaped in accordance with Christianity.\nFollow this author Perry Bacon Jr. 's opinions\nFollow this author\nPerry Bacon Jr.\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nHow are these trends — a secularizing America, a party increasingly tied to its religious wing — happening at once? In some ways, they are causal. Many Americans on the political left and center say they stopped identifying themselves as Christians in part because of the faith's vocal conservative bloc, particularly its anti-LGBTQ+ agenda. On the flip side, Robert P. Jones, founder of the Public Religion Research Institute (now known as PRRI), argues White Christians have become more radical in their policy goals and more deeply embedded in the Republican Party because of their alarm at how quickly America is becoming more racially diverse and secular.\nBut with a growing number of Republicans saying they aren't Christian or religious, another explanation is important: internal party politics. Polls suggest there are many Republican voters who would prefer a GOP that wasn't trying to make abortions impossible and ban books written by LGBTQ+ authors from public schools and libraries.\nRepublicans saying they aren't Christian or religious, another explanation is important: internal party politics. Polls suggest there are many Republican voters who would prefer a GOP that wasn't trying to make abortions impossible and ban books written by LGBTQ+ authors from public schools and libraries.\nAdvertisement\nBut those Republicans aren't organized into well-funded activist groups working at the local, state and federal levels. And the portion of the party wary of the religious right overwhelmingly falls in line and backs GOP candidates in general elections, even if those candidates have adopted the religious right's agenda.\nIn contrast, the party's religious bloc defends its priorities fiercely — and in moral terms. Groups such as the Family Research Council and the Alliance Defending Freedom are constantly pushing bills in state legislatures and filing lawsuits. They are creative and relentless in exploring methods to execute their agenda, such as their effort to get a future Republican president to invoke a once-obscure law from 1873 (the Comstock Act) to limit abortion.\nThose on the religious right argue that abortion, same-sex marriage, people changing their gender identities and other actions condoned by liberals are violations of core religious tenets. So they aren't willing to set aside those views just because they poll badly. It's hard for nonreligious Republicans to win intraparty arguments when the religious bloc is speaking with such passion.\nAdvertisement\nSo while America and even the Republican electorate is significantly less religious than in Ronald Reagan's or George W. Bush's heyday, the GOP is still dominated by the same two groups that have controlled it for decades: wealthy individuals and businesses who donate millions to conservative organizations and Republican campaigns because they want to keep taxes low and regulations limited; and religious groups that want to keep American culture conservative.\nOf course, the religious right has changed over time. Though the term 'evangelical' once described religious conservatives of prior eras, it was more precisely a movement led by White, male Southern Baptist leaders and activists. Today's religious right has a bigger role for Catholics, women and people of color, as well as Protestants who aren't Southern Baptists, including Pentecostals and those from America's growing ranks of nondenominational churches. (This is why I use the term 'religious right' rather than, say, 'Christian nationalists' or 'evangelicals.' There are many Christians who argue that the religious right's stances are a perversion of the faith. The exact meanings of 'Christian nationalism' and 'evangelicalism' are contested, but everyone agrees there is a bloc on the right that claims to be acting out of religious beliefs.)\nNevertheless, winning Republican primaries still requires courting both the party's business and religious wings. The former provides money for a campaign; the other voters and local organizers.\nAdvertisement\nThese two groups have an informal détente. Wealthy conservatives who are more interested in keeping taxes low don't trash the party's religious conservatives for being focused on abortion and school vouchers. And the religious conservatives go along with tax cuts for the wealthy.\nTrump is beholden to religious conservatives, too. The business wing of the party tried to break with him after the 2020 election and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, spending much of the past three years trying to elevate other potential Republican presidential nominees, particularly Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. But Trump's strong support among religious voters helped him easily win the Republican primaries this year.\nFor the general election, Trump's attempts to distance himself from recent antiabortion rulings from conservative judges in Arizona and Florida show he understands the problem: The religious right's agenda might be unacceptable to the rest of the country.\nAdvertisement",

            "excerpt": "Larry Hogan has transformed Maryland's sleepy Senate race into a top-tier contest in the fight for the Senate majority",
            "summary": "STEVENSVILLE, Md. — Andy DePaola welcomed Larry Hogan to his family's restaurant with a big smile and a handshake. The warning came a few minutes later.\nDePaola, the 64-year-old namesake of DePaola's Bagel and Brunch here in Maryland's conservative Eastern Shore, whispered to a reporter that Hogan better avoid disparaging former President Donald Trump.\n'I'm a Trumper,' DePaola said as Hogan posed for pictures and made small talk with the excited breakfast crowd on a recent Friday morning. 'I think Larry would be better off if he kept how he felt about Trump under his breath.'\nThe brief exchange during a weeks-long bus tour illustrates a stark political reality for the popular Republican former governor, who has single-handedly transformed Maryland's sleepy Senate race into a top-tier contest in the national fight for the Senate majority. Hogan, who was perhaps the most outspoken anti-Trump Republican governor in the nation, can ill afford to lose any pieces of his delicate and diverse political coalition.\nAdvertisement\nHe's hoping to become the first Republican in more than 40 years to win a Senate seat in this deep-blue state, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1 statewide, with much of the Democratic support in Baltimore and the suburbs of Washington. Over the next six months, Hogan will have to fend off political threats from all sides.\nAs Trump loyalists eye the 67-year-old businessman with skepticism, Democrats are counting on abortion rights to make Hogan's historic challenge even harder. But the R after his name may ultimately prove the most serious liability for Hogan in a state Trump lost by 33 points four years ago.\nIf Hogan wins Maryland's open Senate seat, Republicans would almost certainly claim the majority in the U.S. Senate — and with it, the power to control the agenda and judicial nominations for the next two years, at least.\nAdvertisement\nIn an interview, Hogan confirmed that he would caucus with Republicans in Washington, despite his concerns about Trump's grip on the party. He also vowed not to leave the GOP after the election, even if Trump returns to the White House.\n'I'm a real Republican,' Hogan told The Associated Press, noting that he does not identify with Trump's 'Make America Great Again' movement.\nWhen pressed to explain his concerns about MAGA, and whether he views Trump as a threat to U.S. democracy, Hogan parsed his words carefully.\n'I think certainly there has been some threats,' Hogan said. 'But you know, I think that's not what this campaign is really all about.'\nMeanwhile, Hogan's opponents on the left are only just beginning to organize as Democrats wade through their own nomination process. While Hogan faces token opposition in the GOP, Democrats will pick Hogan's general election opponent next month.\nAdvertisement\nOn Tuesday, a coalition of labor, immigration and progressive groups gathered in the state capital to criticize the former governor for using his veto powers to block legislation to increase abortion access while undermining other Democratic priorities, including health care, environmental protection and education funding.\nThe anti-Hogan event was a reminder that voters in his gubernatorial elections may have been more willing to overlook party affiliation than they will be in a Senate contest that could tilt the balance of power in Washington toward Republicans.\n'Despite him claiming to be a moderate, we know his actions show that he's a staunch Republican,' said 1199 SEIU political director Ricarra Jones, who slammed Hogan's veto of legislation to increase the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour.\nAdvertisement\n'The Senate race in November is bigger than just Maryland,' she continued. 'A Republican-dominated Senate would pursue a drastically different agenda, one that could unwind years of progressive achievements and reshape Maryland's policy landscape in ways that could take generations to reverse.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nMeanwhile, Hogan is trying to avoid divisive political disputes as he reintroduces himself to Maryland voters during a low-profile 'Back to Work' bus tour across the state.\nPerhaps the nation's most vocal anti-Trump Republican governor while in office, Hogan barely mentions Trump's name unless asked about him. He's just as eager to ignore abortion, even though Maryland is among the states that will vote on an abortion referendum this fall — a winning issue for Democrats in red and blue states alike where ballot questions have appeared since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022.\nAdvertisement\nDemocrats suggest he would support a federal abortion ban, but Hogan insisted in an interview that he would not.\nHe also said he strongly supports in-vitro fertilization and would introduce legislation to protect the practice, an apparent attempt to clarify his position after he declined to say in an Axios interview last month whether he would support such federal protections.\nHe also said he 'would consider voting for' a Maryland ballot measure this fall that would preserve abortion rights, although he argues that it's unnecessary.\nHogan said abortion doesn't comes up much on the campaign trail. He predicted it wouldn't be 'a deciding issue' in the election.\nAsked about the issues that matter most to him, Hogan said he's most focused on ending the divisiveness in Washington, followed by the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, crime and the economy.\nAdvertisement\nBut Hogan largely avoided talking politics at all on his weekend bus tour, preferring to connect with voters on a personal level. He was eager to jump behind restaurant counters to chat with the kitchen staff or pose for pictures welcoming small business owners. And voters, regardless of their party affiliation, embraced him enthusiastically at nearly every stop.\nLanda Mitchell, a 46-year-old old African American woman from Hanover, Maryland, flagged down the governor as he toured small business booths at a weekend boat show. She had met him years ago at a fundraiser for the homeless.\nMitchell said she's not a Republican, but she'd likely vote for Hogan.\n'He's not far right wing. He's over there, but he's not far far over there,' Mitchell said with a laugh, adding that she's not sure whether she'll support President Joe Biden this fall because of the state of the economy. 'I'm far from a Trump supporter, but I go into the grocery store today and I cry.'\nAdvertisement\nCaroline County Sheriff Donald Baker, who welcomed Hogan on a tour through his office, said he also appreciates the former governor's strong support for law enforcement, noting that the sheriff's office didn't get a single applicant for a recent job posting.\n'It's gonna be a tough road for him to navigate,' Baker said of Hogan's political challenge. 'If anybody can do it, I believe Larry Hogan can do it. Why? Because he is a middle-of-the-road kind of guy. He knows how to work with people.'\nAnd as Democrats fight to link him to Trump's Republican Party, Hogan will take pains to distance himself from Trump — but not too far.\n'We don't want to alienate Trump voters,' Hogan told the AP. 'We need Trump voters. And we need a lot of Biden voters. Maryland is tough.'\nBut he doesn't expect Trump or any other MAGA celebrities to campaign in Maryland on his behalf in the coming months. He said he's not sure if he'll even attend this summer's Republican National Convention, where Trump will formally become the GOP presidential nominee; Hogan skipped Trump's last two nominating conventions as well.\n'I don't think Trump would help me at all. I ran 46 points ahead of him,' Hogan said, noting that Trump lost Maryland in 2020 by a bigger margin than any other state in the nation. 'I don't think he needs to campaign in Maryland.'\n___",

            "summary": "Regarding the April 14 editorial, 'A ‘climate club' could get China to clean up faster':\nWhy doesn't the Editorial Board want to hold heavy polluters such as China accountable without letting politics get in the way? There are two major misconceptions in the piece.\nFirst and foremost, the board assumes that the World Trade Organization requires a domestic carbon tax for compliance. The claim that a carbon price limited to imports would face insurmountable legal challenges and provoke retaliatory actions remains untested and relies on narrow interpretations of WTO policy. Analyses conducted by the Climate Leadership Council suggest that a climate and trade policy without a domestic carbon tax would comply with WTO regulations by leveraging existing domestic environmental regulations and addressing international emergencies.\nAdvertisement\nSecond, the board assumes Republicans resist engaging on climate even if it's through market-based mechanisms and trade policy. Democrats don't have a monopoly on environmental policy. The Foreign Pollution Fee Act, which I co-introduced with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), proposes a fee on certain imported industrial and energy products based on their emissions intensity relative to similar domestically produced goods. Former U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer, who served multiple Republican administrations, has been a consistent champion in leveraging U.S. trade policy to make China pay for its pollution.\nThe Foreign Pollution Fee Act would not only reduce global emissions but would also stimulate job creation, foster innovation, strengthen global supply-chain security and promote fair competition for U.S. companies on the international stage — all without imposing a domestic carbon tax, which I adamantly oppose.\nGiven the myth-busting above, it is essential to avoid needlessly politicizing the issue by maligning Republicans. Such actions undermine the potential for cooperation in Congress to develop meaningful policies that advance America's national economic interests and hold the world's largest polluters accountable.\nAdvertisement\nBill Cassidy , Washington\nBill Cassidy, Washington\nThe writer, a Republican, represents Louisiana in the U.S. Senate.\nThe writer, a Republican, represents Louisiana in the U.S. Senate.\nA change in perspective\nA recent family trip to Washington had a much more powerful effect on me than usual. I am always inspired when I go to D.C., but this trip was special.\nLike a lot of people over the past few years, I had absorbed the negativity and cynicism projected by many politicians and much of the media, but being in Washington changed my perception. Everyone I saw seemed so vibrant and positive and hopeful. There was something in the air and it wasn't just the cherry blossoms (which were magnificent!).\nThat something was something deeply American: Possibility. Cooperation. Innovation. Hope. Renewal. Transformation.\nIn one intersection, there were dozens of naval bronzes, alive with the bravery, fortitude and creative genius of Americans in the face of mortal danger. And the buildings all around me — the steps and the pillars and the tall windows — radiated a history of obstacles overcome, of compromises made, of forward positive movement toward a more inclusive nation.\nAdvertisement\nD.C. spoke to me. It transformed my perspective, from small and full of fear to large and full of hope.\nAnd my newly made and more hopeful perspective has led me to believe we can overcome our country's problems. We have overcome much greater threats.\nWe are not destined to bow down to tyrants. We are not destined to lose our democratic soul. We are not destined to the dustbin of history, as many would have us believe. America has power in reserve that we can draw on because that power is based on confidence and diversity and hope.\nThe primary task then is to project this confidence outward and reach those who do not feel it.\nToday, a lot of working-class people feel forgotten. They don't have this hope. They do the day-to-day, hands-on work of our country but do not feel they receive credit or are appreciated. This atmosphere fuels division, acrimony and distrust.\nAdvertisement\nWith the election almost here, President Biden can make workers feel less invisible and make them feel appreciated, but I think he has to talk about them every day.\nThe more Mr. Biden points out what workers contribute, the more he highlights their value to our country, the more he emphasizes how important they are, the more remembered workers will feel. The more appreciated they will feel. Feeling appreciated is powerful. It could help to lift our country up, to push back against our division and acrimony.\nI believe we can pull ourselves together as a nation and create a positive, innovative and fulfilling future. A future in which all of our children can achieve their full potential.\nDaniel Wasik , Fanwood, N.J.\nDaniel Wasik, Fanwood, N.J.\nThe climate is everyone's family business\nIt's little wonder that Kathryn Murdoch 'steers clear of discussing family business,' as reported in the April 10 Style article 'A climate of optimism.' She is concerned that today's youths have 'the sense that the future is doomed and we're helpless to do anything about it.' One reason scientists have been raising the alarm about the dangers of climate change is to counter the climate denialism of Fox News.\nAdvertisement\nOver the years, Fox News hosts such as Tucker Carlson, Jesse Watters, Laura Ingraham and others have tried to debunk the scientific consensus on climate change. According to Media Matters, 'On a near-daily basis, Fox News hosts, anchors, and guests spew misinformation and false narratives aimed at tanking efforts to address the climate crisis.' Perhaps Ms. Murdoch could work on her own family to encourage them to stop their climate denialism and start working on presenting positive solutions to the most important problem we face today.\nBruce Wright , Reston\nBruce Wright, Reston\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe abortion double-standard\nI have become increasingly incensed at the perspective on the abortion issue. At the moment, the theme of the abortion debate seems to be about punishing women. We have lost sight of the man (or the sperm donor).\nAdvertisement\nYou could reduce this discussion to a completely scientific one if we were talking about creating only test-tube babies, but then there would be no need to 'punish' anyone, except maybe the scientists involved. That could happen yet.\nWomen do not experience immaculate conception except in the Bible. So, what about the men?\nWhat if we propose legislation that makes it illegal for men over 50 to impregnate anyone? How about making it illegal for men to receive erectile-dysfunction medications? If a man is convicted of rape, incest or sexual assault, should he be required to get mandatory castration?\nPreventing pregnancy is almost always looked upon as a woman's responsibility. But we know it is not. There is no way measures such as those mentioned above would ever pass our mostly male legislatures — either at the state or federal levels.\nAdvertisement\nSuch measures would treat men as punitively as women are treated in the context of reproduction. And, reproduction is the subject, not abortion.\nJulie Van Egmond , Naples, Fla.\nJulie Van Egmond, Naples, Fla.\nI don't understand why the Arizona Supreme Court is punishing women for having an abortion but isn't punishing the men for impregnating them. Under the circumstances, I think that it's only fair that Viagra should be banned immediately.",

Trump has argued that the case is an attempt to interfere with the 2024 election, claiming without evidence that Biden has orchestrated it in the run-up to their November rematch.\nAdvertisement\nTrump's campaign fired back at the Biden campaign Friday, calling the Times report 'fake news from a reporter who wasn't even in the courtroom.'\n'Contrast that with Biden falling asleep constantly at meetings, and tripping and busting his ass while falling down numerous times,' Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement.\nThe Times reporter who wrote the blog post, Maggie Haberman, said in an email that she was watching from an overflow room outside the courtroom 'along with other reporters, could see [Trump's] entire face on a very large monitor through closed-circuit camera.'\nThe trial is the first of four that Trump faces with the 2024 election looming. In New York, he faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a 2016 hush money payment meant to keep an adult-film actress quiet about an alleged sexual tryst.\nAdvertisement\nTrump is required to attend every day of the trial, which started Monday with jury selection.\nIt is not entirely clear if Trump has fallen asleep in court. Washington Post reporters have been watching the trial from inside the courtroom — but seated behind Trump — and from the overflow room where there is a video feed. They have seen his eyes close multiple times this week.\nOn Tuesday, during questioning of the jurors, Trump closed his eyes and his head occasionally dipped down. In another moment, Trump leaned back and his eyes appeared to be closed as his head occasionally tilted.\nOn Thursday, Trump appeared to be resting his eyes while the judge, Juan Merchan, read extended jury instructions.\nWhen there were first reports that Trump was apparently dozing off in court — on the trial's Opening Day — the Biden campaign responded playfully, using it to highlight a top issue for Democrats this election cycle.\nAdvertisement\n'Wake Up Donald: After Stormy Abortion Ban Coverage, Trump Poll Memo Attempts to Hush Panic,' read the subject line of a Biden campaign news release.\nThe news release referred to a Trump campaign memo that downplayed the political potency of the issue of abortion in Arizona after a state Supreme Court upheld a near total abortion ban there last week.\nBiden's campaign told The Washington Post that it remained focused on issues beside Trump's trial.\n'Our campaign and the President are focused on the American people — not Donald Trump's trials and tribulations,' Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement. 'We're also not sleeping on the fact that campaigns are won by the candidate who remains focused on fighting for the American people — not distracted by their own grievances or pursuit of revenge and retribution.'\nAdvertisement\nStill, the criticism of Trump comes as part of a sustained effort by the Biden campaign to amplify examples of the former president mixing up people, misstating facts or slipping over his words, as Biden officials fight back against concerns about Biden's own mental fitness. Even though Biden, 81, is only a few years older than Trump, 77, polls show voters are more concerned about Biden's age.\nAt the White House, officials have repeatedly declined to comment on the case and suggested Biden is not paying close attention.\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday, the first day of the trial, that she expected Biden to 'get an update at some point today' but that he was focused on meetings with foreign leaders that day. Asked about the trial the next day, she said Biden was focused on a three-day tour of Pennsylvania that he was starting that day.\nJury selection in Trump's trial concluded Friday afternoon, and opening statements are expected Monday.\nThe trial, Trump said Friday afternoon on social media, 'is a Long, Rigged, Endurance Contest.'",

            "summary": "Changing course, a Democratic Florida prosecutor suspended from office by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday he will seek reelection while a court battle continues over his 2022 removal from the post.\nAndrew Warren had said in January he would not run this year. But that was before a federal appeals court ruled that a lower court should consider Warren's argument that statements he made about hot-button issues such as abortion were political advocacy protected by the First Amendment. That case remains pending.\nDeSantis cited those statements in suspending Warren, contending he was improperly refusing to uphold and enforce certain laws. The governor appointed Republican Suzy Lopez to replace Warren, and she is running for the position that prosecutes cases in Tampa and surrounding Hillsborough County.\nAdvertisement\nIn his announcement in a video posted on social media, Warren said the governor 'illegally forced me from office' and that he decided to seek a third term even as a judge in Tallahassee considers whether to order his reinstatement later this year. Qualifying for the election ends next week.\n'I'm running to protect our values, for a woman's right to choose, for a fair and just system and — above all — for freedom and democracy,' Warren said in a statement. 'I'm running to do what's right.'\nThe governor's office said after the 11th U.S. Circuit Court ruling in favor of Warren that it sets a 'dangerous precedent' that could permit politically motivated prosecutors to ignore laws they oppose.\nThe appeal will eventually go before U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle, who previously ruled that Warren's statements were protected by the First Amendment but that he lacked authority to reinstate the prosecutor. The appeals court said Hinkle does have that authority.",

            "excerpt": "Mark Houck's campaign to unseat Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick in Pennsylvania's GOP primary could offer hints about swing-district party sentiment in a heated presidential election year",
            "summary": "NEW HOPE, Pa. — Mark Houck makes a potent appeal to conservative Republicans in this corner of eastern Pennsylvania when he describes his arrest and subsequent acquittal on federal charges that he pushed a Planned Parenthood volunteer outside a Philadelphia abortion clinic.\nThe account has become a staple of Houck's first-time bid for the U.S. House in suburban Philadelphia, a central battleground of the 2024 election, from the presidency on down.\n'I'm telling you this because this is how I became a target of the federal government — the weaponization of the government,' he said at a meeting last week of the New Hope Solebury Republican Club.\nHouck's campaign to unseat fourth-term Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick in Tuesday's primary could offer hints about swing-district Republican sentiment in one of the most volatile White House races in years.\nAdvertisement\nWith few truly competitive House seats in play, the 1st Congressional District that Fitzpatrick represents is one of 16 districts nationwide that Democrat Joe Biden carried in the 2020 presidential election where voters also sent Republicans to Washington. By comparison, five seats won that year by Donald Trump, then the incumbent and now his party's presumptive 2024 nominee, are now held occupied by a Democrat.\nThe Republicans' House majority is so slim that Democrats need to flip just four seats in November to retake control. That makes the 'Biden 16' a significant group of competitive seats and they could go a long way in determining whether the next president has a friendly or hostile House next year.\nFifteen of those seats are in states that Biden won in 2020. The exception is Nebraska's 2nd District, represented by GOP Rep. Don Bacon. There are five seats in California, four in New York, two in Arizona and one apiece in New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia.\nAdvertisement\nSeveral of the 'Biden 16' are like Fitzgerald, winning year after year by tightrope-walking between challengers in primaries and general elections. Nine of them won a first term in in 2022, when Republicans took control of the House for the first time in four years.\nIn the fall, many will face the same Democrat they beat last time, sometimes narrowly.\nThe Fitzpatrick-Houck winner will face Democrat Ashley Ehasz, a former Army helicopter pilot who is uncontested in her primary. Fitzpatrick, a former FBI supervisory agent who beat Ehasz by 10 percentage points in 2022, is outraising Houck and Ehasz by millions of dollars, combined.\nBefore November, several others among the 'Biden 16' must beat back primary challenges from the conservative wing of the GOP.\nIn Nebraska, Bacon is facing perhaps his strongest primary test yet. If he wins, he will take on the same Democratic opponent, state Sen. Tony Vargas, whom he defeated two years ago by fewer than 3 percentage points.\nAdvertisement\nBacon has been a vocal supporter of sending more military aid to Ukraine, something opposed by his primary opponent, second-time congressional candidate Dan Frei.\nFrei, who contends the GOP base is fed up with Bacon, accuses the incumbent of flouting campaign promises by voting to increase spending and for bills that do nothing to stem the flow of immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.\nNearly all of the 16 races are considered toss-ups.\nRepublicans intend to hammer home a message about lax border security and high inflation under Biden. Democrats are warning that Republicans will pursue a national abortion ban as Democrats invoke an issue that has consistently worked in their favor at the ballot box since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022.\nAdvertisement\nNorth Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson, chair of the House Republicans' campaign arm, said the 'Biden 16' have formed strong identities in their districts and are emphasizing local issues.\nHudson said Biden's unpopularity and presidential turnout models are increasingly giving an edge to Republicans, with the GOP attracting more working-class voters who more likely to vote in presidential elections and help flip these districts to Trump.\n'The presidential turnout dynamics actually favor Republicans,' Hudson said in an interview. 'And then if you look, state by state, where our battlegrounds are, the presidential turnout is going to help us.'\nWashington Rep. Suzan DelBene, who leads the House Democrats' campaign arm, said Democrats will highlight what they say is the chaos at the highest levels of government when Republicans are charge of the House and Trump is in the White House. They will say Trump is a threat to democracy and Republicans are extremists and hypocrites who voted against major spending bills under Biden and then tried to take credit for the projects that landed in their districts.\nAdvertisement\nVoters 'want folks who are there to govern,' DelBene said in an interview. 'They're not looking for extremism. And so all we have to do is make sure that voters are aware of what they're doing. ... Holding them accountable for their actual votes, even though their rhetoric sometimes tries to be more moderate.'\nIn Pennsylvania, Houck's bid to unseat Fitzpatrick, who is backed by some labor unions and business groups, has a visceral feel that some Republicans say resonates with them.\nAt the Solebury Republicans' meeting on the grounds of a luxury hotel and wedding venue, Houck unwound the story of his arrest, describing federal agents with guns drawn as they descended on his Bucks County home in 2022.\nThey arrested him, in connection with the incident outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Philadelphia. Houck defended his actions, saying he acted to protect his 12-year-old son from abusive comments made by the clinic volunteer. The trial ended in an acquittal in 2023, and Houck, who runs a Catholic ministry group, said he began fielding requests to run for office.\nAdvertisement\nHouck's story struck a chord with Rose Cipriano, who came to hear him speak. Her husband picked up a Houck yard sign and Cipriano, who had previously supported Fitzpatrick, said Houck has changed her mind in the approaching primary.\n'I'm looking for fresh ideas, and I'm willing to take a chance and vote for him on Tuesday,' Cipriano said 'I've known his story since it happened, and I support him.'\nHouck's campaign echoes Trump's own defense against the criminal cases against him. It centers on the slogan 'Faith Family Freedom' while Houck talks about defunding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the federal departments of Agriculture, Education and Justice, calling them all unconstitutional.\nHouck has raised more campaign cash than any previous Fitzpatrick primary challenger. But he is well behind Fitzpatrick's fundraising and name recognition in a county where his brother previously held the congressional seat.\nAdvertisement\nFitzpatrick has the support of the county party and the backing of police and fire unions, whose large campaign signs endorsing him crop up every two years.\nBob Brooks, president of the Pennsylvania Professional Firefighters Association, said Fitzpatrick represents blue-collar workers like his union members.\n'And, if there was more blue-collar legislators, I think they would find more support from firefighters,' Brooks said in an interview. 'We support those who support us, and Brian has supported us on many levels.'\nRepublicans at the Solebury meeting encouraged Houck to stay involved in party politics.\nHouck said he will back Fitzpatrick in the general election if Fitzpatrick wins the primary but won't campaign for him, put off by what he said was Fitzpatrick failure to check on Houck's family after his arrest. Fitzpatrick didn't respond to interview requests.\nCipriano said she is disappointed in Fitzpatrick but said the stakes are too high for the party to be divided in November. She pledged to support Fitzpatrick should he win the primary.\n'I am behind the Republican Party 100%,' she said. 'So whoever's running, from the top down, gets my support.'\n___",

            "summary": "The federal government will for the first time require nursing homes to have minimum staffing levels after the COVID-19 pandemic exposed grim realities in poorly staffed facilities for older and disabled Americans.\nVice President Kamala Harris is set to announce the final rules Monday on a trip to La Crosse, Wisconsin, a battleground state where she is first holding a campaign event focused on abortion rights, a White House official said.\nPresident Joe Biden first announced his plan to set nursing home staffing levels in his 2022 State of the Union address but his administration has taken longer to nail down a final rule as health care worker shortages plague the industry. Current law only requires that nursing homes have 'sufficient' staffing, leaving it up to states for interpretation.\nThe new rule would implement a minimum number of hours that staff spend with residents. It will also require a registered nurse to be available around the clock at the facilities, which are home to about 1.2 million people. Another rule would dictate that 80% of Medicaid payments for home care providers go to workers' wages.\nAdvertisement\nAllies of older adults have sought the regulation for decades, but the rules will most certainly draw pushback from the nursing home industry.\nThe event will mark Harris' third visit to the battleground state this year and is part of Biden's push to earn the support of union workers. Republican challenger Donald Trump made inroads with blue-collar workers in his 2016 victory. Biden regularly calls himself the ' most pro-union' president in history and has received endorsements from leading labor groups such as the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.\nHarris will gather nursing home care workers at an event Monday joined by Chiquita Brooks-Lasure, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and April Verrett, secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union.\nAdvertisement\nThe coronavirus pandemic, which claimed more than 167,000 nursing home residents in the U.S., exposed the poor staffing levels at the facilities, and led many workers to leave the industry. Advocates for the elderly and disabled reported residents who were neglected, going without meals and water or kept in soiled diapers for too long. Experts said staffing levels are the most important marker for quality of care.\nThe new rules call for staffing equivalent to 3.48 hours per resident per day, just over half an hour of it coming from registered nurses. The government said that means a facility with 100 residents would need two or three registered nurses and 10 or 11 nurse aides as well as two additional nurse staff per shift to meet the new standards.\nThe average U.S. nursing home already has overall caregiver staffing of about 3.6 hours per resident per day, including RN staffing just above the half-hour mark, but the government said a majority of the country's roughly 15,000 nursing homes would have to add staff under the new regulation.\nAdvertisement\nThe new thresholds are still lower than those that had long been eyed by advocates after a landmark 2001 study funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, recommended an average of 4.1 hours of nursing care per resident daily.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe government will allow the rules to be introduced in phases with longer timeframes for nursing homes in rural communities and temporary exemptions for places with workforce shortages.",

It consists of nearly every Democrat and about half of Republicans.\nThe pattern was reinforced this weekend with a vote to pass Ukraine aid, but it has played out over and over again this Congress with the passage of major pieces of legislation.\nThe Republican majority has been unable to unite around must-pass bills and has thus repeatedly relied on Democrats to push bills past the finish line.\nAdvertisement\nThis weekend's vote on $60 billion for Ukraine: 112 Republicans opposed it.

(Forty-six Democrats opposed it.)\nThe group of Republicans who have joined with Democrats is slightly different each time, but the pattern is the same. What holds the coalition together is a desire to avoid government shutdowns and, in the case of the Ukraine and FISA votes, a commitment to traditional national security priorities.\n'House Democrats have risen to the occasion. President Biden has risen to the occasion. Traditional conservatives led by Speaker Mike Johnson have risen to the occasion,' House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said, touting the bipartisan coalition ahead of Saturday's passage of four national security bills.\nPresident Biden has risen to the occasion.

Democrats also control the Senate and the White House.\nAdvertisement\nSome hard-right House Republicans have tried to ignore that reality. They defeated procedural rules, a tactic that was nearly unheard of until this Congress. They kicked out one speaker and are threatening another for daring to pass bills with big bipartisan majorities.\n'This is a sellout of America,' said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who is leading the effort to depose Johnson from his job as speaker.\nRep.

The House turned a portion of the Ukraine funding — the 20 percent that goes directly to the Ukrainian government — into a loan, and the House passed a fourth bill that seizes Russian assets and would ban TikTok if it isn't sold by its Chinese parent.\nAdvertisement\nWhile the House passed the four parts separately, the bills are combined into one in the Senate. It will hold a vote Tuesday at 1 p.m. to move on the measure.\nThe earlier package received 70 votes in February. The vote tally this week should be similar.\nWhat happens next on that effort to oust Johnson\nThe House adjourned for the week without Greene trigging her motion to remove Johnson from the speakership. She continues to insist that she will do it but hasn't provided a timeline.\nBased on her comments, it appears she doesn't have widespread support beyond the definitive other two Republicans who have signed on: Reps.

            "summary": "COLUMBIA, S.C. — At first glance, the all-male South Carolina Senate subcommittee deciding whether to approve a proposal to remove the sales tax from feminine hygiene products was a reminder that as recently as 2012 the state had no women in its Senate.\nBut progress is being made. The election of a sixth woman to the 46-member Senate in January pulled South Carolina up from last place in the U.S. in the percentage of women in its upper chamber.\nNo one noted the composition of the all-male Senate Finance subcommittee and they listened to five women speak in favor of the bill before ceding the floor to Republican Sen. Katrina Shealy, who broke the chamber's four-year run with no women in 2013.\n'I know we have a lot to do, but we can always do one more thing,' said Shealy, who spoke about how important it is to keep products like pads and tampons affordable and available, especially for younger women already struggling in poverty.\nAdvertisement\nThe bill, which was approved 114-0 in the House last year, passed through the subcommittee unanimously Wednesday. It now heads to the Senate floor. There are only three weeks left in session, but if anyone has a shot in making sure it gets to the governor's desk, it's Shealy, who got 11 bills where she was primary sponsor passed last session — twice as many as any other senator.\nSouth Carolina women have started organizing to get more of them into political office, from the General Assembly down to school boards.\nSC Women in Leadership is in its sixth year encouraging women to run for office, training them to be better candidates and supporting them when they get elected. The group helps Democrats and Republicans.\nIt's an uphill climb. Just 27 out of the 170 senators and House members in South Carolina are women. That 15.9% is above just West Virginia (11.9%), Tennessee (15.2%) and Mississippi (15.5%), according to the Center for American Women and Politics. Just the addition of Democratic Sen. Tameika Isaac Devine in January boosted South Carolina past a few of those states.\nAdvertisement\nThe five women in the Senate in 2023 — three Republicans and two Democrats — banded together to keep South Carolina from passing a near-total ban on abortions. They picked up the nickname the Sister Senators.\nShealy said it shows women can disagree when their political beliefs differ and still come together when their common experiences match.\nWomen in Leadership said women's experiences are different than men and it's vital their voices are in leadership so they not only get heard, but incorporated into policy. And the group also helps women find spots to serve on government boards and commissions\n''Feminine' traits like empathy, collaboration, and altruism, which women have long been told are weaknesses are, in fact, precisely the traits we need in our leaders,' the group says.\nThey hold sessions like Presenting Yourself in Person and in the Media, Building Your Campaign Team and Lead Like a Woman.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2016 in South Carolina, just seven women ran for state Senate and less than 10 ran for the House. This year, there are 26 women running for Senate and 63 running for the House.\nAt Wednesday's meeting, University of South Carolina students Thrisha Mote and Anusha Ghosh spoke in favor of the bill. They created a group called No Periods Left Behind.\nThe group found women who can't afford feminine hygiene products using whatever they have, like a sock, or not changing the items as frequently as necessary, increasing chances for infections, Ghosh said.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'It's time to acknowledge that mistral hygiene products are not luxury items but essential necessities for the health and liberty of individuals,' Mote said.\nThere was more data. South Carolina is one of 21 states that still tax feminine hygiene products. The state would lose about $6 million in revenue.\nAdvertisement\nAnd after the subcommittee vote, Ghosh and Mote took photos with Shealy, subcommittee Chairman Republican Sen. Tom Davis and others.\nThere are plenty of other bills that the women of the South Carolina General Assembly said can use their perspective. Republican Sen. Sandy Senn got a bill through the Senate that would allow for cosmetologists to do hair styling and make up in mobile studios or homes. Currently, those services have to be done in permanent structures.\nThe state allowed barbers, who are more often male, to open mobile hair cut shops in 2021. Senn said plenty of women preparing for weddings or other formal events would prefer to have their hairdressers come to them.\nSenn's bill is awaiting action in the House.",

            "summary": "RICHMOND — Democratic leaders and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) remain at loggerheads as Virginia lawmakers return to the state Capitol on Wednesday to take action on the budget and other bills the governor has proposed changing, barreling toward a June 30 deadline to adopt a two-year spending plan or begin shutting down the state government.\nDemocrats have said repeatedly in recent days that they are in no mood to compromise with Youngkin, who welcomed the legislature's budget in March by calling it 'backward' and going on a tour around the state proclaiming how misguided it was. Since the governor unveiled a package of 233 proposed amendments on April 8 that essentially rewrote the spending plan the General Assembly passed with bipartisan support, Democrats who control both chambers of the legislature have reacted angrily.\n'We passed [an] on-time, structurally sound, balanced budget, which is required of us by the constitution,' House Speaker Don L. Scott Jr. (D-Portsmouth) said Tuesday in remarks to a small group of reporters. 'The governor immediately then began to run a campaign against the budget, a full-fledged campaign. … He's not a middle-ground, bipartisan governor. He has been an extreme — I call him MAGA-in-disguise — governor.'\nAdvertisement\nOn Tuesday, Scott debuted a sharp message of his own with an ad on social media, touting elements of the General Assembly's budget and urging residents not to 'let Pretending Glenn shut down the government.' Scott said his message was different from Youngkin's because it was aimed at setting the record straight about what the legislature's budget would deliver for the state.\na sharp message of his own with an ad on social media, touting elements of the General Assembly's budget and urging residents not to 'let Pretending Glenn shut down the government.'

He then could become the first governor in modern Virginia history to veto an entire budget. Youngkin would probably call a special legislative session so lawmakers could start all over, racing to get a budget plan finished before the new fiscal year starts July 1.

'This is new territory for us all, and it should be interesting. This place never fails to surprise.'\nIn addition to his proposed budget changes, Youngkin issued a record 153 vetoes — more in one year than the 120 the next most veto-heavy governor, Democrat Terry McAuliffe, issued in his entire four-year term. Democrats said over the past few days that they probably don't have enough Republican support to muster the two-thirds majorities needed to override those vetoes, which included legislation to create a legal market for recreational marijuana, raise the minimum wage, and prevent other states where abortion is illegal from extraditing someone who has or performs the procedure legally in Virginia.\n120 the next most veto-heavy governor, Democrat Terry McAuliffe, issued in his entire four-year term.

He proposed eliminating the Assembly's plan to expand the sales tax to digital downloads — an idea that Youngkin initially proposed — and in return offered to retreat from his own insistence on tax cuts, which were dead anyway because lawmakers left them out of the budget.\nAdvertisement\nHe also said he would accept the legislature's plan to increase spending in several key areas, including providing 3 percent pay raises in each of the next two years for public school teachers and state employees, increasing funding for higher education and boosting the state's contribution to the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority, though at a lower level than the General Assembly approved. Youngkin argued that Virginia can afford those expenditures without raising taxes.\nAs if to underscore that point, the administration released a monthly revenue estimate Tuesday evening that showed tax collections up and the state surging toward a surplus of funds. As of March, state coffers are on track for a surplus of more than $1 billion for the year, Youngkin's office said.\nevening that showed tax collections up and the state surging toward a surplus of funds.

His plan for Metro, for instance, boosts the state's contribution by tapping into federal dollars that had been set aside for localities in Northern Virginia — an approach several Democrats said was not acceptable.\nDemocratic leaders who accuse Youngkin of divisive rhetoric and aggressive treatment of their bills see him as punishing them for rejecting his plan to build a $2 billion, publicly financed arena in Alexandria for the Washington Wizards and Capitals.

Surovell (D-Fairfax) told The Washington Post on Monday.\nAdvertisement\nSurovell characterized Youngkin's amendments as not just aggressive but also as a misreading of his role in government. 'The governor seems to approach governor's amendments as if he's an actual member of the legislature,' he said, noting that Youngkin had essentially rewritten the budget and introduced new concepts to some bills after it was too late to vet them through the 'committee process and take broad input into whether it's good policy or not.'\nOne example: complex legislation to allow slot machine-like 'skill games' in convenience stores that Youngkin drastically rewrote, suggesting amendments that effectively ban the games in many metropolitan areas.\nSome Democrats have fanned the rhetorical flames. In addition to Scott's digital ad, Senate Finance and Appropriations Chairwoman L.

Amendments to bills are a bit more complicated.\nIf a simple majority of both chambers approves all amendments on a bill, it becomes law as amended with no further action. If legislators approve some or none of the amendments, the bill goes back to Youngkin with only the amendments they have accepted for him to sign or veto. The governor gets the last word, since the General Assembly does not get another chance to override him.\nBut the legislature can head off a potential veto by taking a second vote on a bill after rejecting some or all of the governor's amendments. A legislator would have to make a motion to enroll the bill as law 'notwithstanding the governor's [anticipated] veto.' If that motion wins a two-thirds vote in both houses, the measure becomes law.\nAdvertisement\nTwo bills that could be ripe for a challenge, according to several legislators: the skill-games bill that the governor rewrote, and a measure that would allow localities to impose a 1 percent local sales tax to fund school construction, a bipartisan bill that Youngkin vetoed.\nBut reconciling the positions staked out by both sides on the budget is going to take more time than is available in Wednesday's session, even if it extends for more than one day, said Stanley, the Republican senator. 'How do you find middle ground? I don't think you find it in the veto session,' he said. 'After the dust settles, we have to have a budget by July 1.

McDougle (R-Hanover) said he expects that some of Youngkin's budget amendments will pass. 'There are a number of actions the governor took that I think everybody thinks are reasonable and they'll be supported,' he said.\nAdvertisement\nSen. R. Creigh Deeds (D-Charlottesville), a senior member of the Finance and Appropriations Committee, agreed that the legislature will probably accept some of Youngkin's technical amendments to the budget, but he predicted it will reject the substantive ones.

'He'll have to make a choice at that point,' he said.\nIf Youngkin opts to veto the budget, Deeds said, he expects the legislature would quickly go into a special session to pass another budget — probably similar to the one that it just sent to Youngkin. He predicted one change: The new budget might find ways to spend about $100 million freed up by Youngkin's vetoes.\n'It's not going to get any better,' Deeds said of the next spending plan. 'It could get worse from his perspective.'\nThe Virginia Constitution gives the legislature 10 days to take up the governor's vetoes and amendments, but it is rare for the reconvened session to extend beyond one day.

            "summary": "RICHMOND, Va. — Gambling regulations, school construction and the state budget were on the agenda for Virginia lawmakers returning to Richmond on Wednesday to consider Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's proposed amendments to legislation and his record number of vetoes.\nDemocrats who control the General Assembly don't have the numbers to override Youngkin's vetoes without GOP support, but their leaders have signaled that they plan to reject many of his proposed changes, including most of those he made to the two-year budget bill. Youngkin's rewrite of the spending plan — he's submitted more than 200 amendments — was so extensive, it exceeded the governor's authority, legislative leaders say.\n'If you think of the governor as a surgeon, the Constitution authorizes nips and tucks, but not organ transplants. And his 233 amendments are trying to give the budget a new heart, lungs and kidneys,' said Senate Democratic Majority Leader Scott Surovell, who predicted lawmakers would reject the vast majority of Youngkin's proposed changes to that bill.\nAdvertisement\nPrior to Wednesday's so-called reconvened session, Democratic lawmakers spent weeks publicly at odds with the governor over the budget that they sent him in a bipartisan vote on the final day of their regular session.\nYoungkin embarked on a series of public events during which he blasted what he called the 'backward budget,' criticizing lawmakers for including a sales tax expansion to digital products that he initially proposed at the start of the process in December but had paired with an income tax cut that Democrats rejected. The governor has said unequivocally that he won't sign a budget that increases taxes.\nDemocrats criticized Youngkin for his tour but then launched one of their own to defend their budget plan, which would increase K-12 education spending and pay for teachers and other public workers.\nAdvertisement\nWith his budget amendments, the governor has proposed sticking with the tax policy status quo, which required him to also suggest spending cuts and other accounting maneuvers to account for the revenue that would be lost by eliminating the new digital sales tax.\nDemocratic Del. Luke Torian, who chairs the House of Delegates' budget-writing committee, signaled in an interview Tuesday that his caucus has no intention of going along with that proposal from the governor.\n'The new digital economy (tax), as we call it, is something that's important to us,' he said.\nLawmakers' objections to Youngkin's budget changes could very well result in a version that he ends up vetoing, something longtime government observers say would be unprecedented.\n'My thinking is, we're just at the beginning of the battle,' said Bob Holsworth, a veteran political analyst and commentator.\nAdvertisement\nThe governor has said he hopes to avoid that option, however. He struck an optimistic tone in a statement Tuesday, saying he was encouraged by extensive discussions with legislators from both chambers and both parties.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'Tomorrow is another step towards our destination, which is to pass and sign a common ground budget,' Youngkin said.\nLawmakers will also be working through dozens of other bills Youngkin returned to them with suggested changes, including a heavily lobbied measure dealing with so-called skill games, gambling machines that proliferated in convenience stores and other small businesses around the state before lawmakers passed a ban in 2020.\nThis year's legislation would legalize, regulate and tax the machines, though the changes Youngkin suggested would implement far stricter limits and a higher tax rate than the version the Assembly sent him. Convenience stores around the state staged demonstrations this week, briefly halting lottery ticket sales Monday and closing for an hour on Tuesday, in an effort to draw attention to the issue and urge lawmakers to reject the governor's amendments.\nAdvertisement\nSurovell said he saw the skill-games bill as one of two that could potentially face a veto override, the other being a measure that would have allowed all localities to hold a referendum on raising sales taxes to help fund school construction. The bill passed with strong bipartisan support and has been supported by school officials in red-leaning rural areas.\nIn remarks Tuesday with reporters, House Speaker Don Scott said he's gotten calls from school superintendents in southwest Virginia who questioned the veto. Scott also criticized the governor for a proposed amendment that would ban state funding for abortions in cases of severe fetal abnormalities.\nBetween Youngkin's proposed amendments and his record number of vetoes — more this year alone than in any of the complete four-year terms of the state's past seven governors, according to the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project — the governor showed he's no moderate, Scott said.\nAdvertisement\n'He went after the most vulnerable citizens again,' Scott said. 'And so we're just saying that he's not a middle-ground, bipartisan governor. He has been an extreme — I call him MAGA-in-disguise — governor,' Scott said, referring to the 'Make America Great Again' slogan of former president and presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.",

            "summary": "Earlier this week, I was asked a question for which I didn't know the answer: What could President Biden do to firm up his support among younger voters?\nRecent polling has shown that Biden is performing more poorly than expected with Americans under 30, though, as I've written, that varies depending on the poll and whether it screens for the likelihood that the respondents will vote.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nConsider, for example, new polling from the Harvard Institute of Politics that considers only the views of adults 18-29. Overall, Biden leads former president Donald Trump by eight points, 45 percent to 37 percent. Among registered voters, though, he's up 13 points — 50 percent to 37 percent. And among those who say they're most likely to vote, he's up 19 points. Biden has 56 percent of support and Trump, again, 37 percent.\nThat Trump doesn't gain ground as the pool of respondents is narrowed is important. It suggests that indifference to the candidates and voter apathy are linked — and that there's potentially an opportunity for Biden if his campaign can compel more young Americans to vote.\nAdvertisement\nThis comes back to the initial question: What's the pitch?\nRecent YouGov polling conducted for the Economist included a battery of issues on which respondents were asked to offer their opinions. This allows us to see where Americans stand on the election and also how younger (those under 30) voters differ from older ones.\nWhat we find is that there are only a handful of issues to which younger voters ascribe more importance than older ones, whether we're considering issues respondents identify as the most important (red, below), very important (purple) or at least somewhat important (orange). Younger Americans are more likely to point to jobs and abortion as the most important issue to them, but the gap between younger voters and voters overall is wider when describing climate change or civil rights as very important issues.\nThe issue that scored the highest in importance to younger Americans? Inflation, same as everyone else.\nThat holds in the Harvard Youth Poll as well. Its methodology was different, presenting respondents with two options from a lengthy list and asking them to identify which was more important. The issue that was most commonly selected as most important relative to alternatives was, once again, inflation.\nBy virtue of focusing on younger respondents, the Harvard poll allows a breakdown by gender. You can see that, on several issues, there's a substantial difference in the views of young men and women, like reproductive rights. The three issues on which there's the widest difference by gender are three of the most commonly associated with liberal politics: reproductive rights, climate change and gun violence. Young women were at least 10 points more likely to identify those issues as important than were young men.\nA key finding in the Harvard poll centers on the divide by gender. Support for Biden is higher among likely voters than among young people overall — but among young men who are likely to vote his advantage is only six points compared with a 33-point advantage with young women who are likely to vote.\nSince 2020, the Harvard Youth Poll has seen the partisan advantage for Democrats evaporate among young men. In 2020, men and women were about 20 points more likely to identify as Democrats than as Republicans. Now, women are 26 points more likely to, while among men, there's virtually no difference.\n(It's worth noting that Gallup polling of partisan identity shows a rightward shift among young voters that comports with the data above.)\nAdvertisement\nOn the issue importance question, the views of young women correlate strongly to the views of young Democrats. The views of young men correlate slightly less strongly to the views of young Republicans.\nThe question of how Biden appeals to these voters, though, remains unanswered. He's put a big focus on student loan relief, as you're probably aware, and it's the issue on which Harvard found the highest level of approval for Biden from younger Americans. It is also the issue that was least likely to be identified as important in Harvard's battery. On inflation and gun violence, issues seen as more important, his approval rating was around 25 percent. On the issue of Israel — which was also surprisingly low on the importance list — his approval was under 20 percent.\nYouGov found that younger Americans were more critical of Biden across the board than Americans overall, including on education and civil rights, issues that they were more likely to identify as important.\nThe situation, then, is that the issues important to young people and those important to Americans overall don't differ that much as Biden's party has lost ground with young men. (A plurality of young men in the poll identified as independent.) Analysis from Pew Research Center found that voters under 30 backed Biden by a 26-point margin in 2020, down from the 30-point margin Hillary Clinton enjoyed four years before. If the margin had instead matched that seen in this poll — 19 points — it would have meant a shift of more than 4 million votes from Biden to Trump.",

            "summary": "Several Kennedy family members plan to endorse President Biden for reelection at a campaign event in Philadelphia on Thursday, saying that Biden reflects the values and 'moral leadership' of their clan's most celebrated members, in a move intended in part to counter the independent campaign of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nMore than a dozen Kennedys — including siblings of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — will be on hand during Biden's remarks. The event comes at the end of the president's three-day sprint through the battleground state of Pennsylvania, where he has tried to paint himself as a champion of the American middle class in the Kennedy mold.\nThe endorsement from about a dozen members of America's most famous political family is intended to showcase Biden as the figurative torchbearer of the legacy of President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1963, and of Robert F. Kennedy, who was shot down as he sought the presidency in 1968. It is an unusually personal rebuke to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is portraying himself as the true heir to the Kennedy tradition, and reflects the Biden campaign's concern that he could siphon at least a small number of votes from the president.\nwho is portraying himself as the true heir to the Kennedy tradition, and reflects the Biden campaign's concern that he could siphon at least a small number of votes from the president.\nAdvertisement\n'A vote for Joe Biden is a vote to save our democracy and our decency,' Kerry Kennedy, the elder Robert F. Kennedy's daughter and the current candidate's sister, plans to say, according to remarks released by the campaign. 'It is a vote for what my father called, in his own presidential announcement in 1968 … ‘our right to the moral leadership of this planet.''\nKerry Kennedy also plans to stress that Biden stands for the core values of her father and her family: 'Daddy stood for equal justice, human rights, and freedom from want and fear. Just as President Biden does today.'\nIt is not clear if any of the Kennedys will mention their family member's candidacy, and the endorsement is in line with the clan's long, if informal, support of Biden. On St. Patrick's Day, Kerry Kennedy posted a picture on X, formerly Twitter, showing Biden surrounded by a sea of Kennedys.\nBiden was a senior in high school when John F. Kennedy became president, and he sometimes traces his interest in politics to the former president.\nAdvertisement\nJohn F. Kennedy was the nation's first Irish Catholic president; Biden is the second. And both contended with questions about how their faith would inform their role as commander in chief. Kennedy was asked whether he felt he would answer to the pope, while Biden faced questions about where his political views veered away from Catholic doctrine, particularly on abortion.\nBiden also had a long friendship with the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), John F. Kennedy's younger brother. The two served together for decades in the Senate, including on the high-profile Judiciary Committee. Years later, as Biden sought the presidency in 2020, he modeled his effort to eradicate cancer on President Kennedy's push to put Americans on the moon.\nBiden's campaign hopes Thursday's endorsement gives the president a boost in Pennsylvania — a state he sorely needs to win in November — and beyond.\nAdvertisement\nThe candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has thrown an unexpected twist into this year's presidential battle. He is the son and namesake of a legendary figure in the Democratic Party, one who spoke passionately about injustice, was brother to an idealized president and was martyred by an assassin's bullet.\nHis ultimate effect on the presidential race remains unclear, including whether he will draw more votes from Biden or former president Donald Trump, but his candidacy makes many Biden supporters nervous. He has embraced unorthodox and even conspiratorial ideas — for example, questioning the efficacy of vaccines and the role of those involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol — but he seems to draw some support from older Democrats nostalgic about the Kennedy era.\nIn addition, some Democrats have a deep-seated fear of third-party campaigns. Some in the party believe that Green Party candidate Ralph Nader cost Al Gore the presidency in 2000, and that Green Party candidate Jill Stein cost Hillary Clinton the White House in 2016. This year, Biden faces not only Kennedy and Stein, but also Cornel West, a scholar and activist.\nAdvertisement\nThe Kennedys, however, do not appear likely to focus on the dissenting member of their family Thursday, but instead will aim their fire at Trump, who Kerry Kennedy plans to say is 'attacking the most basic rights and freedoms that are core to who we are as Americans.'\n'attacking the most basic rights and freedoms that are core to who we are as Americans.'\n'I can only imagine how Donald Trump's outrageous lies and behavior would have horrified my father, Robert F. Kennedy, who proudly served as attorney general of the United States and honored his pledge to uphold the law and protect the country,' she will say, according to the prepared remarks.\nAmong those expected to attend Thursday's event are Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a former lieutenant governor of Maryland; Rory Kennedy, a documentary filmmaker; and former congressman Joseph P. Kennedy II (D-Mass.) — all children of the elder Robert F. Kennedy and siblings of the current candidate. Another former congressman, Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.), also plans to be there.",

Bob Graham, who gained national prominence as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks and as an early critic of the Iraq war, has died. He was 87.\nGraham's family announced the death Tuesday in a statement posted on X by his daughter Gwen Graham.\n'We are deeply saddened to report the passing of a visionary leader, dedicated public servant, and even more importantly, a loving husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather,' the family said.\nGraham, who served three terms in the Senate, made an unsuccessful bid for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, emphasizing his opposition to the Iraq invasion.\nBut his bid was delayed by heart surgery in January 2003, and he was never able to gain enough traction with voters to catch up, bowing out that October. He didn't seek reelection in 2004 and was replaced by Republican Mel Martinez.\nAdvertisement\nGraham was a man of many quirks. He perfected the 'workdays' political gimmick of spending a day doing various jobs from horse stall mucker to FBI agent and kept a meticulous diary, noting almost everyone he spoke with, everything he ate, the TV shows he watched and even his golf scores.\nGraham said the notebooks were a working tool for him and he was reluctant to describe his emotions or personal feelings in them.\n'I review them for calls to be made, memos to be dictated, meetings I want to follow up on and things people promise to do,' he said.\nGraham was among the earliest opponents of the Iraq war, saying it diverted America's focus on the battle against terrorism centered in Afghanistan. He was also critical of President George W. Bush for failing to have an occupation plan in Iraq after the U.S. military threw out Saddam Hussein in 2003.\nAdvertisement\nGraham said Bush took the United States into the war by exaggerating claims of the danger presented by the Iraqi weapons of destruction that were never found. He said Bush distorted intelligence data and argued it was more serious than the sexual misconduct issues that led the House to impeach President Bill Clinton in the late 1990s. It led him to launch his short, abortive presidential bid.\n'The quagmire in Iraq is a distraction that the Bush administration, and the Bush administration alone, has created,' Graham said in 2003.\nDuring his 18 years in Washington, Graham worked well with colleagues from both parties, particularly Florida Republican Connie Mack during their dozen years together in the Senate.\nAs a politician, few were better. Florida voters hardly considered him the wealthy Harvard-educated attorney that he was.\nAdvertisement\nGraham's political career spanned five decades, beginning with his election to the Florida House of Representatives in 1966.\nHe won a state Senate seat in 1970 and then was elected governor in 1978. He was re-elected in 1982. Four years later, he won the first of three terms in the U.S. Senate when he ousted incumbent Republican Paula Hawkins.\nGraham remained widely popular with Florida voters — winning reelection by wide margins in 1992 and 1998 when he carried 63 of 67 counties. In that latter election, he defeated Charlie Crist, who later served as a Republican governor from 2007 to 2011.\n'He blew me out of the water, and I came to know even more so why during the course of the campaign,' Crist said Tuesday night. 'I learned to respect him even more than I already had, and love him for the good, decent man that he was.'\nAdvertisement\nCrist, who has since switched parties and most recently served as a U.S. representative, said Graham was an influence on him.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'I always felt that when he was governor, that he was trying to govern for the people of Florida — not in any way political or partisan — and I took that to heart and tried to, in some small way, emulate it,' Crist said.\nHouse Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi called Graham 'a patriotic American' and thanked him for his 'distinguished public service.' She highlighted his work on the inquiry into 9/11 and said he 'bravely opposed entry into the war in Iraq.'\n'He brought his love for his family and for his state of Florida to the Senate, where he served with immense dignity and courage,' she said in a statement Tuesday.\nEven when in Washington, Graham never took his eye off the state and the leadership in Tallahassee.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Gov. Jeb Bush and the Republican-controlled Legislature eliminated the Board of Regents in 2001, Graham saw it as a move to politicize the state university system. He led a successful petition drive the next year for a state constitutional amendment that created the Board of Governors to assume the regents' role.\nDaniel Robert Graham was born Nov. 9, 1936, in Coral Gables, where his father, Ernest 'Cap' Graham, had moved from South Dakota and established a large dairy operation. Young Bob milked cows, built fences and scooped manure as a teenager. One of his half-brothers, Phillip Graham, was publisher of The Washington Post and Newsweek until he took his own life in 1963, just a year after Bob Graham's graduation from Harvard Law.\nGraham was president of the student body at Miami Senior High School and attended the University of Florida, graduating in 1959.\nAdvertisement\nIn 1966 he was elected to the Florida Legislature, where he focused largely on education and health care issues.\nGraham got off to a shaky start as Florida's chief executive, and was dubbed 'Gov. Jello' for some early indecisiveness. He shook that label through his handling of several serious crises.\nAs governor he also signed numerous death warrants, founded the Save the Manatee Club with entertainer Jimmy Buffett and led efforts to establish several environmental programs.\nGraham pushed through a bond program to buy beaches and barrier islands threatened by development and started the Save Our Everglades program to protect the state's water supply, wetlands and endangered species.\nGraham also was known for his 408 'workdays,' including stints as a housewife, boxing ring announcer, flight attendant and arson investigator. They grew out of a teaching stint as a member of the Florida Senate's Education Committee and then morphed into a campaign gimmick that helped him relate to the average voter.\nAdvertisement\n'This has been a very important part of my development as a public official, my learning at a very human level what the people of Florida expect, what they want, what their aspirations are and then trying to interpret that and make it policy that will improve their lives' said Graham in 2004 as he completed his final job as a Christmas gift wrapper.\nAfter leaving public life in 2005, Graham spent much of his time at a public policy center named after him at the University of Florida and pushing the Legislature to require more civics classes in the state's public schools.",

If so, sign up here. You can also hear Aaron's Campaign Moment podcast weekly on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.)\nThe big moment\nA former president of the United States is on criminal trial for the first time in American history as of this week. It's been a long time coming.\nAnd while the early proceedings in Donald Trump's Manhattan 'hush money'/election-interference case have been somewhat sleepy — quite literally if you're Trump — the stage is being set for one of the most consequential legal clashes in American political history. As a quick reminder: The case has to do with hush money payments Trump's lawyer made to an adult-film actress to keep her quiet weeks ahead of the November 2016 election and whether he falsified business records to cover it up.\nAdvertisement\nYou can read the blow-by-blow of all the significant legal maneuverings during jury selection from Monday, Tuesday and Thursday.\nAs for the politics? Here are my early thoughts.\nTrump's antics threaten to boil over, with major political — and societal — implications.\nTrump's antics threaten to boil over, with major political — and societal — implications.\nThe verdict is obviously important, for reasons we'll get to. But how we get there could also reverberate greatly.\nThe trial is quickly shaping up to be the culmination of Trump's years-long assault on a justice system that has long scrutinized him. And there's increasing reason to believe the situation could get ugly:\nWe're already seeing how all of this could matter. A juror whose biographical details were aired by media outlets — and scrutinized by Watters — raised concerns Thursday, citing how people were able to identify her. (Jurors in the case are being kept anonymous.) She was dismissed from the panel.\nThe play here is obvious. Trump wants to make clear that he will make life hard for anybody who might help deliver an adverse verdict. And Trump will push limits in ways that leaves the judge in the case with some very difficult decisions; imagine a situation in which the judge feels compelled to actually jail Trump. (As has been noted, Trump's actions probably wouldn't be tolerated by basically any other defendant.)\nAdvertisement\nTo the extent this can be turned into a circus, perhaps people will dismiss it. Or perhaps it will draw even more interest and people will see in Trump's actions what they previously found unappealing in him.\nAmericans by and large don't buy into Trump's claims that this is a 'witch hunt,' as I wrote this week. But even some who don't believe that do harbor some concerns about the process, and this case in particular . Trump is now forcing the issue in a major way, and how Americans regard the legal process and his conduct could matter greatly.\neven some who don't believe that do harbor some concerns about the process, and this case in particular. Trump is now forcing the issue in a major way, and how Americans regard the legal process and his conduct could matter greatly.\nThis case is less of a threat than the others. But.\nThis case is less of a threat than the others. But.\nThis case is objectively the one that Americans are the least concerned about. A poll this week showed just one-third thought Trump had broken the law — double-digits less than in his other three indictments. And about the same number regard the charges as 'very serious.'\nAdvertisement\nBut voters are also being reminded about a situation they have overwhelmingly found to be unsavory. About 8 in 10 said Trump at least did something wrong when the 2016 hush money payments to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels were first in the news back in 2018. And polling has shown as many as 7 in 10 say it's a crime to pay someone to remain silent about an issue that could affect an election (which is basically the substance of the charges).\nAlso, even that Associated Press-NORC poll showed 50 percent of voters said a conviction in this case would render Trump unfit for office. Just 29 percent said it wouldn't matter.\nWe've also seen in polls that a potentially decisive number of Americans say they'd flip their votes if Trump is convicted of a crime. Whether that would hold — and on this case, specifically — is a huge question.\nAdvertisement\nDemocrats' hands-off approach could be tested.\nDemocrats' hands-off approach could be tested.\nThere is a remarkable asymmetry in the political debate over Trump's criminal trial. While Trump and his allies are all over it, Democrats and the Biden campaign are basically ignoring it.\nAbout the closest the Biden campaign has come to weighing in was a news release this week which slyly included the words 'stormy' and 'hush' and alluded to Trump nodding off. But it was about abortion.\nThis is all in keeping with Democrats' general approach to Trump's criminal cases. While Republicans have leaped to decry things such as Trump's indictments and the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago in August 2022 — often before they know much of anything about the situations — Democrats have generally been content to merely say that 'no one is above the law' and leave it at that.\nAdvertisement\nBut that's going to be tested moving forward. The legal system is limited in how it can defend itself, with litigators and judges generally letting their work and courtroom remarks speak for themselves. And at some point, you'd think Democrats would want to drive home Trump's behavior at the trial and how it's symptomatic of his chaotic presidency.\nOf course, they also might not want to bet too heavily on the outcome of a trial the American people haven't shown they're overly concerned about.\nA momentous — and somewhat counterintuitive — poll\nOne of the most consequential facets of the 2024 election is how Americans have warmed to Trump's first term. Call it 'amnesia' or anything else, but it's a significant factor. To the extent people continue to remember the grass being greener, that's likely to weigh significantly on who wins in November.\nAdvertisement\nBut it will apparently only take Trump so far.\nA new Yahoo News/YouGov poll provides some interesting findings on this front. It finds 49 percent of people retrospectively approve of Trump's presidency — higher than that number was at virtually any juncture of his actual presidency — and just 40 percent approve of President Biden's. Voters were more likely by double digits to say Trump accomplished things than that Biden did. And asked to choose directly whether they were better off under Trump or Biden, voters chose Trump 45 percent to 34 percent.\nAnd yet! The poll shows the race deadlocked — 44-44 in a head-to-head, and 42-42 if you include third-party candidates.\nPart of that imbalance is probably polarization and Democrats not being enthusiastic about Biden's presidency — but still opposing Trump. But it's logical to think it might also owe to Trump's legal problems and other personal factors.\nWhatever the case, it's worth keeping an eye on — particularly if Democrats can, in fact, drive home what voters disliked about Trump before and drive the above numbers down.",

            "summary": "'I was like, that's my goal, exactly that!' Taub, who plays Paul, said from her dressing room later. 'Do everything I can to make you fall in love with these women, root for them, care about them. So that was a really satisfying moment to witness.'\nAdvertisement\nSatisfying but sobering, too. Fact is, few audience members know much about the American suffrage movement. So the all-female creative team behind 'Suffs,' which had a high-profile off-Broadway run and opens Thursday on Broadway with extensive revisions, knows they're starting from zero.\nIt's an opportunity, says Taub, who studied social movements — but not suffrage — at New York University. But it's also a huge challenge: How do you educate but also entertain?\nOne member of the 'Suffs' team has an especially poignant connection to the material. That would be producer Hillary Clinton.\nShe was, of course, the first woman to win the U.S. presidential nomination of a major party, and the first to win the popular vote. But Clinton says she never studied the suffrage movement in school, even at Wellesley. Only later in life did she fill in the gap, including a visit as first lady to Seneca Falls, home to the first American women's rights convention some 70 years before the 19th Amendment gave women the vote.\nAdvertisement\n'I became very interested in women's history through my own work, and writing and reading,' Clinton told The Associated Press. And so, seeing 'Suffs' off-Broadway, 'I was thrilled because it just helps to fill a big gap in our awareness of the long, many-decades struggle for suffrage.'\nIt was Taub who wrote Clinton, asking her to come on board. 'I thought about it for a nanosecond,' Clinton says, 'and decided absolutely, I wanted to help lift up this production.' A known theater lover, Clinton describes traveling often to New York as a college student and angling for discounts, often seeing only the second act, when she could get in for free. 'For years, I'd only seen the second act of ‘Hair,'' she quips.\nClinton then reached out to Malala Yousafzai, whom Taub also hoped to engage as a producer. As secretary of state, Clinton had gotten to know the Pakistani education activist who was shot by a Taliban gunman at age 15. Clinton wanted Yousafzai to know she was involved and hoped the Nobel Peace Prize winner would be, too.\nAdvertisement\n'I'm thrilled,' Clinton says of Yousafzai's involvement, 'because yes, this is an American story, but the pushback against women's rights going on at this moment in history is global.'\nYousafzai had also seen the show, directed by Leigh Silverman, and loved it. She, too, has been a longtime fan of musicals, though she notes her own acting career began and ended with a school skit in Pakistan, playing a not-very-nice male boss. Her own education about suffrage was limited to 'one or two pages in a history book that talked about the suffrage movement in the U.K.,' where she'd moved for medical treatment.\n'I still had no idea about the U.S. side of the story,' Yousafzai told the AP. It was a struggle among conflicting personalities, and a clash over priorities between older and younger activists but also between white suffragists and those of color — something the show addresses with the searing 'Wait My Turn,' sung by Nikki M. James as Wells, the Black activist and journalist.\nAdvertisement\n'This musical has really helped me see activism from a different lens,' says Yousafzai. 'I was able to take a deep breath and realize that yes, we're all humans and it requires resilience and determination, conversation, open-mindedness … and along the way you need to show you're listening to the right perspectives and including everyone in your activism.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nWhen asked for feedback by the 'Suffs' team, Yousafzai says she replied that she loved the show just as it was. (She recently paid a visit to the cast, and toured backstage.) Clinton, who has attended rehearsals, quips: 'I sent notes, because I was told that's what producers do.'\nClinton adds: 'I love the changes. It takes a lot of work to get the storytelling right — to decide what should be sung versus spoken, how to make sure it's not just telling a piece of history, but is entertaining.'\nAdvertisement\nIndeed, the off-Broadway version was criticized by some as feeling too much like a history lesson. The new version feels faster and lighter, with a greater emphasis on humor — even in a show that details hunger strikes and forced feedings.\nOne moment where the humor shines through: a new song titled 'Great American Bitch' that begins with a suffragist noting a man had called her, well, a bitch. The song reclaims the word with joy and laughter. Taub says this moment — and another where an effigy of President Woodrow Wilson (played by Grace McLean, in a cast that's all female or nonbinary) is burned — has been a hit with audiences.\n'As much as the show has changed,' she says, 'the spine of it is the same. A lot of what I got rid of was just like clearing brush.'\nMost of the original cast has returned. Jenn Colella plays Carrie Chapman Catt, an old-guard suffragist who clashed with the younger Paul over tactics and timing. James returns as Wells, while Milholland, played by Phillipa Soo off-Broadway, is now played by Hannah Cruz.\nAdvertisement\nGiven its parallels to a certain Lin-Manuel Miranda blockbuster about the Founding Fathers, it's perhaps not a surprise that the show has been dubbed 'Hermilton' by some.\n'I have to say,' Clinton says of Taub, 'I think she's doing for this part of American history what Lin did for our founders — making it alive, approachable, understandable. I'm hoping ‘Suffs' has the same impact ‘Hamilton' had.'\nThat may seem a tall order, but producers have been buoyed by audience reaction. 'They're laughing even more than we thought they would at the parts we think are funny, and cheering at other parts,' Clinton says. A particular cheer comes at the end, when Paul proposes the ERA. 'A cast member said, ‘Who'd have ever thought the Equal Rights Amendment would get cheers in a Broadway theater?'' Clinton recalls.\nAdvertisement\nOne clear advantage the show surely has: timeliness. During the off-Broadway run, news emerged the Supreme Court was preparing to overturn Roe vs. Wade, fueling a palpable sense of urgency in the audience. The Broadway run begins as abortion rights are again in the news — and a key issue in the presidential election only months away.\nTaub takes the long view. She's been working on the show for a decade, and says something's always happening to make it timely.",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Some Democrats are entertaining the prospect of coming to House Speaker Mike Johnson's rescue should Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., force a vote seeking his ouster, though it will likely depend on his ability to deliver an emergency aid package focused on Ukraine and Israel.\nDemocratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has suggested that Democrats would help Johnson if the speaker faced retribution from within his own party for holding votes on the $95.3 billion package. But he's also encouraging his colleagues to take a wait-and-see approach to apply maximum leverage.\n'Do not box yourself in with a public statement,' Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark, the No. 2-ranking House Democratic leader, told colleagues in a closed-door session Thursday, according to a person familiar with the private remarks.\nAdvertisement\nStill, Johnson's future been a much discussed topic on Capitol Hill — even more so after Republican leadership on Thursday floated the possibility of changing the House rules to make it easier for a speaker to withstand a challenge from members of their own party. With or without the rule change, Johnson may need Democratic support to remain as speaker if Greene or someone else forces a vote.\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., said if the aid package makes it over the finish line, 'I think a lot of people are not going to want to punish him for doing the right thing.'\nGreene has threatened to try to oust Johnson and warned that advancing funding for Ukraine would help build her case that GOP lawmakers should select a new speaker. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., tweeted this week that he told Johnson during a closed-door Republican conference meeting that he would be co-sponsoring Greene's motion. Massie suggested Johnson 'should pre-announce his resignation' and give Republicans time to select a successor.\nAdvertisement\nThe vast majority of Republicans are distancing themselves from Greene's effort, wary of repeating the chaos the House endured last fall when eight Republicans joined with Democrats in removing then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., from the post. It's likely that Johnson would not need a large number of Democratic lawmakers to help him remain in the speaker's office, but it would depend on how many Republicans voted to remove him.\nRep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., said that if Johnson would put the Senate-passed measure on the floor, 'I would do what I had to do to make sure he does not lose his job for that.' Johnson made the decision to take the Senate measure and break it into three separate bills. He's also added a fourth bill focused on national security priorities.\nBreaking up the package into parts gives lawmakers the ability to vote against military assistance to Ukraine or Israel without tanking the entire measure.\nAdvertisement\nJohnson said he has not asked a single Democrat to 'get involved in that at all' when asked about a possible motion to vacate.\n'I do not spend time walking around thinking about the motion to vacate,' Johnson said. 'I have a job to do here and I'm going to do the job, regardless of personal consequences.'\nRep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., said he would consider voting present during a speaker vote if Johnson allowed the Ukraine aid to be voted on.\n'Why in the world would I want to go along with Marjorie Taylor Greene if Mike Johnson just gave us a vote I've been advocating for for more than six months?' Boyle said. 'I think a number of Democrats would be in the same position — not necessarily a vote for him, but just make clear this is a Republican issue and we're not going to aid and abet Marjorie Taylor Greene to cause even more chaos.'\nAdvertisement\n'I hope he will have some sort of conversation with Hakeem, but either way, yes, I'm one of those who would save him if we can do Israel, Taiwan, Ukraine and some reasonable border security,' said Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas.\nOther Democrats said helping Johnson must come as part of a package deal. They said he shouldn't expect Democratic support just by putting the Senate-passed package up for a vote. He'll need to have coordinated with Jeffries as well.\n'We're just not going to go and bail out one of the most conservative Republican speakers in American history. But what Kevin McCarthy failed to do is even entertain a conversation to try to make a deal. Democrats were ready to deal. Kevin McCarthy refused to,' said Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass. 'If Speaker Johnson cares about doing the right thing as well as keeping his job, then he ought to make a deal with Democrats.'\nAdvertisement\nRep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., said there is a 'powerful instinct' among Democrats that it's not their job to rescue Johnson from the chaos in his party. But he's willing to help Johnson on the motion to vacate if he were to 'do the right thing' on the aid package and coordinate that with Jeffries.\n'I will defer to getting things done as opposed to tying myself up in partisan knots, but it's going to be Hakeem who decides how we act,' Himes said. 'We're not going to let the Republicans sort of chip off a number of us. This will be negotiated with our leadership.'\nRep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, said he's unlikely to help Johnson and is not sure how long the speaker would be around anyway if he has to rely on Democratic votes to continue on the job.\n'I've listened to what Mr. Jeffries said and I won't rule it out, but I'm inclined to vote as I normally would. I am very concerned about how long he's delayed Ukraine. We count the days. They count the lives lost,' Doggett said.\nAdvertisement\nAnd then there are scores of Democrats who are in the hard 'no' camp.\nRep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., for example, said there was no way he would vote to keep Johnson as speaker.\n'I think his worldview is very dangerous. I think there's no scenario where I'm going to reward someone like that, who allows this level of chaos to happen in the House.'\nAnd Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., also is a hard no on helping Johnson, calling it a well-intentioned idea that is fundamentally flawed.\n'Bad on guns, bad on gays, bad on abortion and bad on voting rights,' Connolly said. 'He litigated the overturning of the (2020) election. He didn't just vote the wrong way. He signed up for a lawsuit. That's who you want to save? Go home and explain that to Democrats.'\nMassie warned that if Democrats help Johnson stay on a speaker, 'they would doom him, they won't save him.'\n'It's not a stable situation if a Republican speaker is speaker only by virtue of Democrats fighting for him,' Massie said.\n___",

            "summary": "PITTSBURGH — Rep. Summer Lee, a freshman Democrat who faces a primary challenge Tuesday from an opponent who has characterized her as extreme on foreign policy, was one of the first members of Congress to criticize Israel's military response to the Oct. 7 attacks in which Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages.\nLee, a member of the 'Squad' of lefty Democrats, called for a cease-fire a little over a week after the attack and suggested Israel was guilty of 'blatant human rights violations.'\nThat reaction initially set Lee apart from many in her party. But as Israel has continued its retaliatory assault on Hamas-run Gaza, U.S. public opinion has shifted. Approval of Israel's military actions among Democrats nationwide dropped from 36 percent in November to 18 percent in March, according to a recent Gallup poll.\nAdvertisement\nSome in this community, which is home to the Tree of Life synagogue, the site of the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history, have come around to their congresswoman's position.\nLee made 'some missteps with the Jewish community' in the early days after Oct. 7, making statements that some people here viewed as sympathetic only to Palestinians, Annie Weidman said as she shopped for Passover groceries this weekend.\nIn the months that followed, Lee 'calmed down her rhetoric,' said Weidman, 63. 'And I do understand her position of being very much for the Palestinian people because it's really, really awful, and I totally get it.'\n'Everybody has sort of moved to her position rather than the other way around,' Weidman, who voted early for Lee, added later.\nSince October, some 34,000 Palestinians, including 13,000 children, have been killed in Gaza, according to local health authorities. And although the House of Representatives approved a new tranche of aid for Israel on Saturday over the objections of 58 members, including Lee, top Democratic leaders, including President Biden and Sen.

Schumer (N.Y.), have sharpened their criticism of the Israeli government in recent weeks.\nAdvertisement\n'What we're seeing slowly but surely is not voters catching up to the Squad — it is other Democratic politicians catching up to where voters have been for months,' said Usamah Andrabi, the communications director for Justice Democrats, which works to elect liberals to Congress and has supported Lee's reelection campaign.\nBoth Lee and her opponent, Edgewood Borough council member Bhavini Patel, dispute the idea that Tuesday's election is primarily about the war. But voters here volunteer their thoughts on the topic without prompting. In Squirrel Hill, home to Patel's campaign office, lawn signs bearing her name appear frequently next to ones reading 'we stand with Israel.'\nPatel has continued to criticize Lee's position on the conflict.\n'She's clearly picked a side in this situation and completely disregards her entire district,' Patel said in an interview Saturday. 'I think it's important that any call for a cease-fire should acknowledge that hostages are still being held,' she added.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Lee first ran for this seat two years ago, pro-Israel outside groups, including Democratic Majority for Israel and a PAC associated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) spent heavily in an attempt to defeat her, holding her to a 1,000-vote victory in the primary.\nBut neither the AIPAC-affiliated group nor Democratic Majority for Israel have intervened in this year's primary, according to the most recent federal campaign finance filing data. Asked about the race, an AIPAC representative said the group is 'already involved in several races, and we will be engaged in additional campaigns where we can have the greatest impact.' A representative for DMFI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nInstead, the Moderate PAC, a group backed by Republican megadonor Jeffrey Yass, has intervened in the race, airing television ads attacking Lee for 'opposing Biden' as images of pro-abortion-rights protests and the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection played on-screen.\nAdvertisement\nPatel has denounced Yass and said that she considers herself 'a principled progressive Democrat,' but Lee and her allies have worked to make the billionaire's involvement in the race a liability for Patel. At a Sunday rally with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), supporters of Lee waved black-and-yellow signs reading 'Move, Yass! Get out of the way' and 'Stop Republican billionaires.'\nOcasio-Cortez characterized the Moderate PAC's involvement as 'an attempt to purchase and buy the seat back.' Attendees booed as she mentioned Yass and AIPAC. She stressed the importance of showing the world and 'the people in that big White House' that Lee 'is not alone,' and reminded voters that Tuesday's primary is the first of several challenges to members of the Squad, including Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri.\nVoters here frequently bring up their faith when describing their vote, and religious leaders have expressed strong opinions about the candidates. Last fall, 40 Pittsburgh rabbis and cantors wrote an open letter denouncing Lee for being one of only nine Democrats to vote against a resolution avowing support for Israel and condemning Hamas. In a follow-up letter in March, many of the same rabbis and cantors accused her of using 'divisive language, which, at times, we have perceived as openly antisemitic.'\nAdvertisement\nIn Squirrel Hill, home to a politically active and sizable Jewish community, the 14th Ward Independent Democratic Club, a local group that's not formally affiliated with the party, endorsed Patel this year after backing Lee two years ago.\n'Some people are not interested in combating antisemitism, and they're not interested in hearing and talking with and representing the Jewish community in the same way they necessarily are other communities,' said Jeremy Kazzaz, a member of the club's board and the president of the Beacon Coalition, a recently launched organization that aims to provide 'voter education on issues of concern to the Jewish American community' and that has endorsed Patel.\nBut the city's religious communities are far from united behind either candidate.\n'This has been a very, very painful couple of years for the Pittsburgh Jewish community,' said Jared Magnani, 55. He is supporting Lee, noting he was 'proud of her for the rapidity of her response calling for a cease-fire' because 'just because we're American Jews, it doesn't mean that Israel merits an exemption from allegations of significant human rights abuses and crimes against humanity.'\nWeidman's husband, Larry, 71, said he seriously considered supporting Patel before deciding to vote for Lee. 'But it was never because of comments that Summer Lee made right after Oct. 7,' he said. 'Some of the comments that she made, they're not so out of the mainstream now.'",

            "excerpt": "The Biden administration finalized sweeping Title IX rules barring discrimination against transgender students and ordering a new system for sexual assault claims.",
            "summary": "The Biden administration on Friday finalized sweeping new rules barring schools from discriminating against transgender students and ordering significant changes for how schools adjudicate claims of sexual harassment and assault on campus.\nThe provisions regarding gender identity are the most politically fraught, setting up an election-year culture clash with conservative states and school boards that have limited transgender rights in schools, banned discussion of gender identity in classrooms and removed books with LGBTQ+ themes. Mindful of the politics, the administration is delaying action on the contentious issue of whether transgender girls and women should be allowed to compete in women's and girls' sports.\nThe long-awaited regulation represents the administration's interpretation of Title IX, a 1972 law that bars sex discrimination in schools that receive federal funding. Title IX is best known for ushering in equal treatment for women in sports, but it also governs how schools handle complaints of sexual harassment and assault, a huge issue on many college campuses.\nAdvertisement\nNow the Biden administration is deploying the regulation to formalize its long-standing view that sex discrimination includes discrimination based on gender identity as well as sexual orientation, a direct challenge to conservative policies across the country.\nTen states, for instance, require transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their biological sex identified at birth, according to tracking by the Movement Advancement Project. Some school districts will not use the pronouns corresponding with a trans student's gender identity. Both situations might constitute violations of Title IX under the new regulation. In addition, if a school failed to properly address bullying based on gender identity or sexual orientation, that, too, could be a violation of federal law.\n'No one should face bullying or discrimination just because of who they are or who they love. Sadly, this happens all too often,' Education Secretary Miguel Cardona told reporters in a conference call.\nAdvertisement\nThe Education Department's Office for Civil Rights investigates allegations of sex discrimination, among other things, and schools that fail to come into compliance risk losing federal funding. A senior administration official said that the office could investigate cases where schools were potentially discriminating, even if they were following their own state's law.\nThe final regulation also includes provisions barring discrimination based on pregnancy, including childbirth, abortion and lactation. For instance, schools must accommodate students' need to attend medical appointments, as well as provide students and workers who are nursing a clean, private space to pump milk.\nThe combination of these two issues — sexual assault and transgender rights — drew enormous public interest, with some 240,000 public comments submitted in response to the proposed version published in 2022. The new rules take effect Aug. 1, in time for the start of next school year.\nAdvertisement\nThe final regulation unravels a Trump-era system for handling sexual assault complaints, discarding some of the rules that bolstered due process rights of the accused. Supporters said those rules were critical to ensuring that students had the opportunity to defend themselves; critics said they discouraged sexual assault survivors from reporting incidents and turned colleges into quasi-courtrooms.\nEducation Department officials said they had retained the elements that made sense but created a better overall framework that gave equal treatment and balanced the rights of all involved. 'A fair process will help ensure that investigations lead to accurate, reliable and effective resolution of sex discrimination complaints,' Cardona said.\nUnder the Trump administration's regulation, finalized in 2020, colleges were required to stage live hearings to adjudicate complaints, where the accused could cross-examine witnesses — including the students who were alleging assault. Supporters said that live hearings were critical to ascertaining what actually happened when facts are contested, but others argued cross-examination could retraumatize assault survivors.\nAdvertisement\nUnder the new Biden rules, colleges will have more flexibility. The investigator or person adjudicating the case may question witnesses in separate meetings or employ a live hearing.\nThe new rules also will allow schools to use a lower bar for adjudicating guilt. In weighing evidence, they are now directed to use a 'preponderance of the evidence' standard, though they may opt for a higher standard of 'clear and convincing evidence' if they use that standard in other similar proceedings. Under the Trump version, universities had a choice, but they were required to use the higher standard if they did so in other settings.\nThe proposal also expands the definition of what constitutes sexual harassment, discarding a narrower definition used under President Donald Trump, and broadens who on campus has a responsibility to respond to allegations.\nAdvertisement\nSome of the Trump provisions were retained. Schools, for instance, will continue to have the option to use informal resolution of discrimination complaints, unless the allegation involves an employee of a K-12 school.\nThe Biden administration's approach was welcomed by advocates for sexual assault survivors.\nThe rules 'will make schools safer and more accessible for young people, many of whom experienced irreparable harm while they fought for protection and support,' said Emma Grasso Levine, senior manager of Title IX policy and programs at Know Your IX, a project of the advocacy group Advocates for Youth.\n'Now, it's up to school administrators to act quickly to implement and enforce' the new rules, she added.\nSexual assault has been a serious issue on college campuses for years, and in releasing the regulation, the Biden administration said the rates were still 'unacceptably high.'\nAdvertisement\nBut the most controversial element of the regulation involves the rights of transgender students, and it came under immediate fire.\nAdministration officials point to a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that sex discrimination in employment includes gender identity and sexual orientation to bolster their interpretation of the law. But conservatives contend that Title IX does not include these elements and argue that accommodations for transgender students can create situations that put other students at risk. They object, for instance, to having a transgender woman — someone they refer to as a 'biological man' — using women's bathrooms or locker rooms.\nRep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), chairwoman of the House Education Committee, called the regulation an escalation of Democrats' 'contemptuous culture war that aims to radically redefine sex and gender.' The department, she said, has put decades of advancement for women and girls 'squarely on the chopping block.'\n'Evidently, the acceptance of biological reality, and the faithful implementation of the law, are just pills too big for the Department to swallow — and it shows,' she said in a statement.\nAdvertisement\nStill, the administration sidestepped the contentious issue of athletics, at least for now. A separate regulation governing how and when schools may exclude transgender students from women and girls teams remains under review, and administration officials offered no timetable for when it would be finalized. People familiar with their thinking said it was being delayed to avoid injecting the matter into the presidential campaign, where President Biden faces a close race against Trump.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nA senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in a briefing with reporters Thursday, declined to comment on the politics of this decision but noted that the athletics rule was proposed after the main Title IX regulation.\nPolling shows that clear majorities of Americans, including a sizable slice of Democrats, oppose allowing transgender athletes to compete on girls' and women's teams. Twenty-five states have statewide bans on their participation.\nAdvertisement\nThe proposed sports regulation disallows these statewide, blanket bans, but it allows school districts to restrict participation more narrowly defined — for instance on competitive high school or college teams. The main Title IX regulation does not address the issue, and an administration official said the status quo would remain. Still, some have argued that the new general ban on discrimination could apply to sports even though the administration does not intend it to.\nThe rules governing how campuses deal with harassment complaints have changed repeatedly in recent years.\nThe Obama administration issued detailed guidance in 2014 for schools in handling complaints, but that was later tossed out by Trump Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Her department went through its own laborious rulemaking process to put a new system in place.\nAs a candidate for president in 2020, Biden promised to put a 'quick end' to that version if elected, saying it gave colleges 'a green light to ignore sexual violence and strip survivors of their rights.' Friday's action makes good on his promise.",

            "summary": "History may be written by the victors, but Neil J. Young's excellent new book, 'Coming Out Republican,' is a sympathetic look at one of the past century's losers: the gay conservative. Young, a historian by training, has spent his career explaining the heterogeneity of the conservative movement. His first book, 'We Gather Together,' was about the alliances and rivalries among Catholics, Mormons and evangelicals that birthed the Christian right, and Young has written about religion and politics for the New York Times and CNN.\n'Coming Out Republican' moves from the 1950s to the present, telling the stories of the closeted operators and buttoned-up political clubs that often served as the Myrtle Wilson to the Christian right's Daisy Buchanan, their sense of entitlement out of proportion to the way their supposed allies treated them. Sometimes these gay men acted gallantly to expand the individual freedoms of their queer countrymen. But there are also many instances in the book of them selling out the other civil rights movements in whose wake they traveled. 'Coming Out Republican' is less about an interest group than a self-interest group, one that has long been unable to envision a liberation project more ambitious than expanding the sexual prerogatives of White men.\nmoves from the 1950s to the present, telling the stories of the closeted operators and buttoned-up political clubs that often served as the Myrtle Wilson to the Christian right's Daisy Buchanan, their sense of entitlement out of proportion to the way their supposed allies treated them. Sometimes these gay men acted gallantly to expand the individual freedoms of their queer countrymen. But there are also many instances in the book of them selling out the other civil rights movements in whose wake they traveled. 'Coming Out Republican' is less about an interest group than a self-interest group, one that has long been unable to envision a liberation project more ambitious than expanding the sexual prerogatives of White men.\n'Coming Out Republican' is at its best when using profiles of individual men to depict the eras in which they lived. Leonard Matlovich, a Vietnam War hero, came out in 1975 and sued the federal government to reenlist after he was kicked out of the military. Conservative and macho, Matlovich claimed that 'everything I am and everything I hope to be I owe to the United States Air Force.' He relied on Frank Kameny, of the gay advocacy group the Mattachine Society, and a lawyer from the ACLU to sue on his behalf. Appearing on the cover of Time magazine, he had a dark mustache from central casting, but he was an imperfect poster boy, all-American but naive about gay life. He once bashfully asked a reporter from the Advocate — an eminent gay magazine — what the publication was.\nAdvertisement\nIn his study of Matlovich, Young deftly, if a little dryly, parses the cross currents of imperialism, respectability and internecine gay resentment. His prose is at times as vanilla as the men he writes about, relying on ventriloquism of vulgar gay patois for color. In other illuminating sketches, we meet figures such as Jon Hinson, the Bible-thumping congressman from Mississippi who resigned after getting caught performing oral sex on a Black Library of Congress technician in a bathroom in the Capitol, and Terry Dolan, Ronald Reagan's whiz kid pollster who bragged about purging moderates from Congress, bulldozing a path for the Christian right's ascension in the 1980s. They are but two of the legions of closeted Republicans who believed in privacy for a man's sex life but not, among other things, a woman's right to an abortion. Young takes so much care describing the different ways Matlovich, Hinson and Dolan conceived of themselves, and the roles they played in the politics of their era, that their deaths feel like a gut-punch. Each one died of AIDS.\nLess successful are Young's sections on gay Republican groups — the Log Cabin Republicans, the Teddy Roosevelt Republican Club, the Lincoln Republican Club, Concerned Republicans for Individual Rights, GOProud — whose sheer number of names reflects how often they split off from one another. Most of the book's colorful characters were better at acting out and working covertly than they were at building large coalitions, so the stakes of their collective action — like persuading a few thousand San Francisco Republicans to oppose a California ballot initiative — feel low.\nYoung also has the credulous habit of, for example, describing a group whose membership 'doubled that year to over 150' and citing the growth as evidence of its strength, when such crowds would barely match a modest gay bar's Saturday night or a Baptist church's Sunday services. In instances when gay Republican groups have wielded influence in a decisive way — say, by whipping up a handful of votes to pass civil rights protections in the California legislature and marriage equality in the New York legislature — it is not because they had power that could not be ignored. It is because in the eyes of Republican lawmakers in very liberal states, gay Republicans could, like a mistress that doesn't ask or expect too much, be indulged from time to time.\nBut that's state politics. At the national level, gay Republicans have been betrayed and insulted by every Republican presidential candidate since Reagan. In 1980, they had reasons for optimism. Despite Reagan's conservative bona fides, two years earlier he helped defeat a California referendum that would have barred gay people from teaching in public schools. But as president, his embrace of the religious right was so close, and his administration's antipathy for people with AIDS so pronounced, that it further stained the Republican Party's reputation with gay people. George H.W. Bush ran as a moderate and even signed gay-friendly legislation like the Ryan White Care Act and the Americans With Disabilities Act before abandoning tolerance to court the religious right. Less than a decade after he left office, his son campaigned as a compassionate conservative, and then ran for reelection supporting a constitutional amendment to forbid same-sex marriage. Donald Trump also seemed to embrace LGBTQ people as he campaigned for the 2016 election, but as president he nominated judges hostile to LGBTQ rights and supported policies that made it easier for people claiming religious exemptions to discriminate against sexual minorities.\nAdvertisement\nYoung makes a persuasive case that gay Republicans contributed to the civil rights progress of the last few decades. Intellectuals like Andrew Sullivan and operators like Ken Mehlman, who ran George W. Bush's 2004 campaign from the closet, contributed to the push for marriage equality and military participation. But neither man — or really any conservative advocate — did nearly as much as Evan Wolfson, the Lambda Legal lawyer, who articulated the intellectual foundations of same-sex marriage and executed the political strategy to make it a reality. The simple fact is that liberal gays have been more clear-eyed about power than their conservative counterparts, better at building coalitions and more wary of placating the Christian conservatives who do not believe there is a place for sexual minorities in public life.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nYoung could have more forcefully thought through the reluctance of gay Republicans to find common cause with members of other minority groups. The obvious answer is the most uncomfortable one: Gay Republicans see themselves as having more in common with other White people, rich people and men. Unfortunately, the only way that the numerically few can wield power is through solidarity with other minorities, but that requires insight that does not always come easily to White gay men, especially conservative White gay men: None of us is that special, and trying to be 'not that kind of gay' comes at a cost. One of the most heartbreaking themes of 'Coming Out Republican' is how unfamiliar many conservative gays are with the varying joys of gay life — writing it off as too 'PC' or too promiscuous. Being gay can be quite fun, not despite but because of our endless squabbles and struggles over how to keep this life distinct and ours, and open to as many people as want to partake.\nAnyone could benefit from reading this book. Straight people will learn how the puritanical impulse to control other people's ' sex lives has defined politics for nearly a century, an impulse as old as it is futile. Queer people — who often must teach ourselves our own history — will learn how respectability remains an empty promise. But it is gay Republicans themselves who most need to read Young's book. If they are not too vain, the Peter Thiels and George Santoses of the world might find in these pages a warning that having power is not the same thing as being tolerated until you are no longer useful.\nNathan Kohrman is a writer covering medicine, politics and culture.

            "summary": "It was with wonder and great interest that I read Monica Hesse's April 11 Style column, 'Tradwives, stay-at-home girlfriends and ‘a thing called ease.'' As the president of a college for women, I found myself wondering why so many people are entranced by the spectacle of young women making a highly questionable choice — though it's absolutely their choice to make — instead of lifting up the many women who are, in fact, striving to change their lives by getting an education and tackling the travails of the world.\nThe only mentions of higher education came in an anecdote about a teenage girl who would rather husband-hunt than go to college and Ms. Hesse's obligatory dig about the cost of tuition: 'If college weren't so ghastly expensive here, maybe that one lady's daughter wouldn't be so keen on the patriarchy as a route to leisure that bypasses the long, uphill road to financial independence.' But there is no better road to intellectual freedom and ease of life than education.\nU.S. women's colleges know and address this every day. We serve young women who are eager to lead despite messages that they lack the value or the resources to be successful. More than 93 percent of our students receive financial aid to go to college, and many women's colleges serve the most financially vulnerable young people in the nation. Yet we endeavor to equip young women to pursue their educational ambitions in support of a more just world.\nAdvertisement\nTo be clear: I don't object to the suggestion that what many young women — or really, all people — want today is more leisure or a sense of ease. I and my students would like a nap, too. What keeps us awake? A deep sense of purpose. We recognize that the same world that prevents 'ease' needs us to change it; that the miseries women face in the world will not go away while we rest. We know we have a purpose in this world and that this purpose is to fashion a better experience for us all. Women don't have to compromise their own sense of self to achieve that.\nMary Dana Hinton , Roanoke\nMary Dana Hinton, Roanoke\nThe writer is president of Hollins University.\nThe writer is president of Hollins University.\nWas it intentional irony that the April 11 Style section paired 'Nick Adams wants you to man up,' a profile of the misogynistic provocateur, with Monica Hesse's column on the appeal and pitfalls of the tradwife lifestyle? Perfect! Now there's a real GOP platform.\nAdvertisement\nPamela Kincheloe , Manassas\nPamela Kincheloe, Manassas\nJust when I thought there was no way The Post could foist Donald Trump on me more often, the April 11 Style section led with a profile of Nick Adams, an off-putting Trump surrogate.\nAs the writer eventually pointed out, there are genuine problems facing men and boys but women coming for their testicles isn't one of them. How ironic and insulting that while women are the ones under policy assaults such as the resurrection of Arizona's ancient ban on abortion, The Post chose to devote space to another con man tapping into anger.\nNaomi Salus , Washington\nNaomi Salus, Washington\nSlow down those pitches\nAs a longtime baseball observer and fan, I read Chelsea Janes's April 11 Sports analysis, 'No easy fix after rash of injuries to pitchers,' with interest.\nWith the increasing emphasis on pitch velocity, spin rates and other measures of force, Major League Baseball teams are effectively 'killing their young.' Potentially great pitching careers are being sacrificed at the altar of money as pitchers try to master throws such as the sweeper.\nAdvertisement\nAs a result, professional baseball risks becoming a niche sport like thoroughbred racing, in which horses are driven to the point of exhaustion and ghastly injury for the entertainment of gamblers, with whom Major League Baseball and other professional sports leagues have aligned themselves. Sadly, America's pastime has become a sign of the times.\nArthur Edward Schwartz , Arlington\nArthur Edward Schwartz, Arlington\nGolf is not ‘sustainable'\nI had to laugh ruefully when I read the word 'sustainable' in reference to the sport of golf in the April 10 front-page article 'On eve of Masters, chasm still divides golf.' The fragile balance between the competing golf tours might be sustainable. But when it comes to the environment, golf is anything but.\nAcres of land are cleared of forests or fields to be turned into grassy lawns that are ecological dead zones. Swaths of fairways and greens sequester little carbon and fail to support the food chain or pollinators. Courses require massive quantities of water, competing with people and agriculture for scarce resources even in the most drought-prone parts of the world. Polluting and toxic weed killers and chemical fertilizers flow into groundwater and streams, endangering wildlife and people. The carbon footprint for manicuring golf courses with armies of gas-powered equipment is huge.\nAdvertisement\nGolfers say they enjoy 'being in nature,' but that's like comparing a water park wave pool to the ocean. About the only thing sustainable about a golf course might be an electric cart — or maybe an organic beer.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nSally Kelly , Chevy Chase\nSally Kelly, Chevy Chase\nSave the Circulator\nI read with dismay the April 12 Metro article 'Circulator bus service might end in March 2025.'\nOur family has resided in D.C. for decades and became aware of the services of the Circulator bus system just two years ago. The atmosphere on the bus is festive and friendly, in large part because of the drivers and the excited tourists who ride it. It provides an invaluable service to tourists and residents alike who want to get around the National Mall at a reasonable price or to Georgetown conveniently from Union Station.\nDon't shut down routes, raise prices or eliminate the Circulator altogether. Just advertise it more. So many residents are unaware of its routes or their convenience. Get fliers out to all the hotels that tourists frequent. Get information to the public in general. People love a bargain, and at $1 per ride, the Circulator is the best bargain in D.C.\nAdvertisement\nKathleen Wood , Washington\nKathleen Wood, Washington\nTax rich D.C. residents like me\nTaxes support thriving communities where people want to live. They fund quality schools and reliable public transportation, in addition to providing food and shelter for people who have hit hard times. Right now, D.C. faces major budget pressures that jeopardize these vital programs and services. But lawmakers can meet this moment by raising taxes on wealthy people, including me.\nI came to the city more than a decade ago as a student at George Washington University (Raise High!) and fell in love with D.C. I enjoy a car-free life with convenient access to friends, stores and cultural activities. D.C. Minyan provides a robust Jewish community. Playing softball on the National Mall never gets old. I can't imagine living anywhere else. But as a frequent cheerleader for D.C., I have never even considered discussing my relatively low tax burden as a draw to encourage friends and family to move here.\nAdvertisement\nMy financial situation is not out of the ordinary for White residents of D.C. An Urban Institute study found that as of 2016, White households in D.C. had a net worth 81 times greater than that of Black households and 22 times that of Latinx households.\nOur tax system does little to correct the historic injustices that have contributed to this wealth inequality. Instead, tax preferences and loopholes protect and further concentrate wealth.\nFor example, D.C.'s property tax system uses a single rate for residences, meaning I pay the same property tax rate as someone who owns a small studio far away from public transit and other amenities.\nAnd Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) has now proposed an increase to the sales tax, which takes a larger percentage of income from low- and middle-income earners than high-income earners. Combined with Ms. Bowser's proposal to halt the planned increase to D.C.'s earned-income tax credit, which helps people with low incomes keep more of what they earn, this would raise the effective tax rate on D.C. residents with the lowest incomes relative to the current baseline.\nAdvertisement\nRaise taxes on me and other wealthy residents instead. I say this with confidence that the marginally higher taxes I would pay would not materially affect my quality of life.\nBut the investments the District could make in public services with a little more of my tax money would be life-changing for others. By taxing D.C.'s concentrated wealth, the D.C. Council can ensure that child-care workers are paid fairly, rental assistance programs are fully funded and transformative initiatives such as the earned-income tax credit aren't gutted. I can afford to pay more in taxes so everyone can have their basic needs met.\nWe all agree D.C. faces major budget pressures and needs more revenue, so let's find a way to raise it. Why not increase the tax rate on capital gains — profits from selling assets such as stocks that overwhelmingly flow to the top 1 percent? And why not increase taxes on homes valued at more than $1.5 million, instead of taxing them at the same rate as lower-value homes?\nAdvertisement\nBefore being disrupted by business lobbyists, D.C.'s Tax Revision Commission laid out other proposals to raise revenue that, unlike the mayor's proposals, wouldn't put the burden on D.C. residents who are already struggling. We all contribute to the strength of D.C.'s economy, but only a few households see the most benefits. The D.C. Council should make the wealthy pay more, so D.C. can be a place where everyone can share in the growth and enjoy a good life.",

            "excerpt": "The bid to oust Republican Rep. Scott Perry has centered on his involvement in Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.",
            "summary": "CAMP HILL, Pa. — Democratic congressional candidate Mike O'Brien had only been knocking on doors in a leafy suburban neighborhood here for about 20 minutes when he came upon a house with a sign featuring his opponent's face in the window. He smiled.\n'WANTED for crimes against the CONSTITUTION,' the sign read. 'Scott Perry for Prison. Traitor. Insurrectionist. Criminal.'\n'That's one of the reasons why I'm running,' O'Brien, one of six Democrats vying to unseat Perry, a GOP congressman, told the couple who answered the door. 'You can't let Trump and Perry overthrow democracy under the guise of patriotism anymore.'\nIt's a message that Democrats, including President Biden, hope will resonate in places like Camp Hill, a middle-class suburb outside Pennsylvania's capital, Harrisburg. The area was once a Republican stronghold but has become more politically independent in recent years due to population growth and moderate Republicans alienated by Trump's norm-busting behavior.\nAdvertisement\nThe competitive Democratic primary here Tuesday offers a preview of how Democrats intend to make democracy a central issue in competitive races for seats such as Perry's, which could help determine control of the narrowly divided U.S. House. It also provides a glimpse of the case Biden will make in battleground states like Pennsylvania.\nBiden has said his reelection is above all else about preserving democracy, which he warns is under threat if Trump wins a second term. In his first campaign speech of 2024, on the day before the anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, Biden stood less than 100 miles from here in Valley Forge.\n'Whether democracy is still America's sacred cause is the most urgent question of our time, and it's what the 2024 election is all about,' he said.\nIt remains unclear whether voters will see it that way. Beyond the defense of democracy, Americans will be asked to weigh more tangible issues, including inflation, immigration and abortion. The age of the candidates — Biden is 81 and Trump is 77 — will also loom large in a presidential rematch that polls show many Americans didn't want.\nAdvertisement\nBut there's also reason to believe democracy as an issue will carry more weight than it did four years ago. This is the first presidential vote since Trump and his allies spread false claims about the 2020 election results, a violent mob besieged the U.S. Capitol to stop the certification of Biden's victory and Trump declared that he would be a 'dictator' — if only on 'day one' of his second term.\nSince the 2020 vote, there has been additional evidence that campaigns built on the defense of democracy can resonate in the Trump era. In his campaign for governor in 2022, Democrat Josh Shapiro eviscerated Republican Doug Mastriano, who played a key role in the effort to challenge Biden's win in Pennsylvania and paid to bus Trump supporters to Washington for the 'Stop the Steal' rally on Jan. 6. Shapiro ultimately beat Mastriano by 15 percentage points.\nDemocrats say a similar pitch will work in the 10th Congressional District race against Perry, who was a key liaison between House Republicans and the White House in efforts to overturn the election.\nAdvertisement\nThe House select committee investigating Jan. 6 found that Perry took part in White House meetings where strategies to try to undermine the transfer of power were discussed. He also pressed the Justice Department to investigate wild and unfounded claims that military satellites had been used to flip votes from Trump to Biden. After Trump supporters attacked the Capitol, Perry formally objected to the counting of Pennsylvania's electoral votes.\nIn 2022, the FBI seized Perry's cellphone as part of its investigation into attempts to thwart certification of the 2020 election. The Jan. 6 committee subpoenaed the congressman to testify, but he refused. He later denied assertions by former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson that he had asked for a preemptive pardon.\nNationally, Democrats see Perry, who is running for his seventh term in Congress, as one of their best shots at toppling a prominent election denier and are expected to invest heavily in trying to flip the seat.\nAdvertisement\nWhile most Republicans who voted against certifying the 2020 results represent safe red districts, Perry's district is more of a bellwether. Under the boundaries of the 10th District, Trump would have won by four percentage points over Biden. Shapiro won the district by 12 percentage points in 2020, while Perry won reelection by eight points. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the district 'lean Republican.'\nDemocrats say they can beat Perry this time with a stronger candidate and a more targeted message tying the congressman to extremism and Jan. 6, as Shapiro successfully did against Mastriano. Perry's campaign said it sees that as a fantasy.\n'They say insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result. Democrats tried and failed to make the events that followed the 2020 election an issue in the 2022 midterm elections. Congressman Perry earned reelection in 2022 by an even larger margin than he did in 2020 because the voters of south-central Pennsylvania know he is fighting for them each and every day,' said Matt Beynon, spokesman for the Perry campaign.\nSome public polling suggests that Democrats are significantly more worried about threats to democracy than other voters. A USA Today-Suffolk poll conducted in March asked respondents to choose the issue most important to them in their presidential vote. Among Democrats, 44 percent said threats to democracy were their top issue versus 20 percent of independents and 6 percent of Republicans. For Democrats, no other issue came close.\nA Washington Post-Schar School poll also conducted in March found that a majority of Americans were very or extremely worried about threats to democracy in the United States, including 58 percent of Democrats and 47 percent of Republicans.\nAdvertisement\nStephen Medvic, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College, said democracy is clearly a factor for voters in the Democratic primary. But he said he's skeptical of its power to move swing voters in the general election against Perry.\nThe Democratic nominee, he said, will have to 'connect a bunch of dots that this candidate had a role, and that Jan. 6 was a real threat and going forward that Trump and Perry would continue to put democracy at risk.'\nDemocrats are getting some help on that front from anti-Trump Republicans. A new group, Republicans Against Perry, placed a billboard this month on a major interstate through the district. The ad shows photos of Mastriano and Perry, both with red Xs over their faces.\nCraig Snyder, who served as chief of staff to then-Republican Sen. Arlen Specter, started the group and said he's received thousands of inquires from people who want to be involved.\nAdvertisement\n'When you look at the responses we've had, the people wanting to come to events, it's enough Republicans in the district to form a pro-democracy coalition,' he said.\nFirst, Democrats need to pick a candidate to run against Perry.\nO'Brien, a 42-year-old retired TOPGUN fighter pilot, said voters are most enthusiastic when he alleges that Perry, who is also a veteran, violated his oath of office to uphold the Constitution by siding with Trump after the 2020 election.\nAs O'Brien knocked on doors in the district one recent day, a couple in their 80s told him that they were deciding between him and Janelle Stelson, a longtime local TV news anchor whose name recognition has made her the presumptive front-runner in the race. O'Brien told them that his message is 'very focused on democracy and making sure that Trump and Perry aren't in a position to overthrow it again.'\nAdvertisement\nThe couple said they had long been registered Republican but recently became Democrats because of their deep aversion to Trump. Electing him again, Kathy Vollmer, 83, said, 'would be like vindicating him.' Her husband, Phil Vollmer, 85, chimed in, saying, 'Perry's an idiot. Trump is dangerous.'\nStelson was also a longtime registered Republican but switched to become a Democrat in January 2023. If she can convince traditional Democrats to vote for her in the primary, she said she thinks her past political affiliation will help her win over the independents and Republicans needed to beat Perry.\nWalking through a suburban neighborhood in York County one recent day, Stelson said Perry's role in Jan. 6 is part of her message. 'He tried to overturn all of our votes,' she said.\nBut she's also focusing heavily on reproductive rights and Perry's support for legislation that would make it federal law that life begins at conception.\nAdvertisement\nHours before the last debate of the primary, O'Brien went to get a fade at the barbershop in Harrisburg he frequents. Inside, over the low hum of razors, he debated politics with owner Johnny Butler, a registered Democrat who said he has backed Trump because he finds the former president to be authentic — even if he's lying.\nButler said issues such as inflation are on his mind as he makes his choices for 2024. Asked if he was worried that Trump would attempt to subvert democracy, Butler said that 'it's impossible' because of the Constitution.\nLater that night, Butler was in the debate's audience to support O'Brien, who was the only candidate on the stage to mention democracy in his opening and closing remarks. In their questions, the moderators didn't bring it up.",

That night, at his hotel, a group of similarly minded demonstrators banged drums, played loud music and used a loudspeaker until 12:15 a.m., yelling slogans including, 'Wake up, sleepy Joe!' and 'I am your nightmare, Biden!'\nAt a another site where Biden was speaking in Scranton, a very different group of demonstrators assembled, these backing Donald Trump.

One group held a sign reading 'Scranton Loves Joe!'\nAdvertisement\nThe question for Biden, as he throws himself in earnest into winning a state that means an enormous amount to him personally and politically, is how all these roiling sentiments will play out in November, in Pennsylvania and across the country. In many ways, Pennsylvania is a microcosm of the United States — a Democratic operative once famously described it as two metropolitan areas with Alabama in between — and strategists will be paying close attention to the state's Democratic and Republican primaries Tuesday for clues on which party has momentum.\n'Look, you're my ticket to the White House: you, Pennsylvania,' Biden told a group of campaign workers in Philadelphia on Thursday. 'No, it's not hyperbole. You're the ticket to the White House.'\nPolls show the race essentially tied between Biden and Trump, and both campaigns expect the state — which went for Trump by 0.72 percent in 2016 before swinging to Biden by 1.17 percent in 2020 — to come down to the wire in 2024.\nIn a recent memo on Pennsylvania, Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez stressed that Democrats have won statewide races there in 2018, 2020 and 2022, as voters turned sharply against Trump' policies from abortion to election denialism.\nAdvertisement\nBut Biden's visit highlighted his challenge as an incumbent at a time when many voters are worried about the economy and the country's direction, while others oppose his position on Gaza, and the nation overall is deeply polarized. Speaking to supporters in Scranton on Tuesday, Biden mused about the level of animus he has faced around the country.\n'I've never thought I'd see a time when I'm going through a neighborhood, or a rural town that's in the West, and see big signs that have a Trump sign in the middle that says ‘F Biden,' and having a little kid standing with his middle finger — 7 years old, 8 years old,' Biden said. 'Well, I promise, it happens all the time. It's not who we are.'\nDavid Urban, a Republican strategist who led Trump's successful effort to flip Pennsylvania in 2016, said his travels through the state have convinced him that Biden is struggling with its residents, many of whom blame him for the high cost of living and for policies they see as hostile to the local energy industry.\n'The current president is pushing a big rock up a hill, trying to convince people things aren't as bad as they are,' Urban said.\nLast week, Biden was pushing hard.\nAdvertisement\nHe unleashed a populist speech in Scranton. He embraced unions while addressing steelworkers in Pittsburgh. He made stops at Sheetz and Wawa, a nod to the hometown convenience stores whose respective merits are hotly debated, as well as to the kind of retail politicking aides say will be pivotal to helping the 81-year-old president connect with skeptical voters.\nAnd Biden ended his trip Thursday by visiting a majority-Black neighborhood in Philadelphia, where he accepted an endorsement from family members of his most prominent third-party rival, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nAs Biden's birthplace and the largest battleground state — home to a crucial 19 electoral college votes — Pennsylvania looms large in the president's personal and political backstory. It's a state both Democrats and Republicans view as crucial to victory, and it stands as a key a test of whether everyday Americans believe his performance as president warrants another term.\nAdvertisement\nThat's a big part of the reason Biden has spent so much time in Pennsylvania, which has the added benefit of being close to both Washington and his home state of Delaware.\nLike Biden, who has already traveled to the state a handful of times this year, Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has also prioritized Pennsylvania. His aides and allies see it as a central pillar in their push to knock down Democrats' venerated 'blue wall' of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — as Trump did in 2016 but not in 2020.\nWith a population of about 13 million consisting of large urban centers, fast-changing suburbs, millions of blue-collar workers and vast rural stretches, Pennsylvania reflects many of the trends upending the nation's political landscape. Since 1960, no Democrat has won the presidency without carrying the state.\nAdvertisement\nAt a recent rally ahead of his criminal trial in New York, Trump told a large crowd in Schnecksville, Pa., that Biden is responsible for high inflation, global instability and a general malaise hanging over the country.\n'All of America knows that the real blame for this nightmare lies with one person: Crooked Joe Biden,' Trump said. 'That's why the people of Pennsylvania are going to tell Crooked Joe, ‘You're fired. Get out. You're fired.''\nBiden's swing through the state offered a glimpse at how he will respond to such attacks, as aides noted that he made a point of addressing several constituencies that helped propel him to the White House in 2020.\nOn Tuesday, the president visited his childhood home after giving a speech contrasting his view on taxes with that of Trump, saying he represents the scrappy values of Scranton while Trump reflects the money-focused morals of Mar-a-Lago in Florida. His pitch to the United Steelworkers union Wednesday featured a populist pledge to protect American industry from unfair foreign competition, including by tripling tariffs on Chinese-made steel if necessary. He also took a jab at Trump, joking that the former president — who was in New York facing a court trial — was 'busy right now.'\nAdvertisement\nHis speech at the Martin Luther King Jr. Recreation Center in Philadelphia on Thursday targeted the city's large population of Black voters. John White Jr., a former state representative and civil rights leader, introduced Biden by praising his record of boosting 'Black livelihoods,' and the president was accompanied around town by Mayor Cherelle Parker (D).\nThroughout the trip, Biden played up his personal connection to the state, where first lady Jill Biden grew up — she often mentions her attachment to Philadelphia sports teams — and where the Bidens had their first date. He talked about launching his 2020 campaign in Pittsburgh and turning to Philadelphians to bolster his Senate campaigns over the years. He said he had been dubbed Pennsylvania's 'third senator' because of how often he was on the news in Philadelphia, which shares a media market with his hometown of Wilmington.\nAt the same time, the Biden campaign unleashed a blitz of advertising targeting key groups in the state, including Black residents and Hispanic voters from Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, as well as a ramped-up ground operation aimed in part at holding down Trump's margins in rural and exurban parts of the state. The Trump campaign's on-the-ground presence is more limited than Biden's effort, which now includes more than a dozen offices and a mix of paid staff and volunteers.\nAdvertisement\nThat advantage in fundraising and campaign infrastructure will pay dividends for Biden down the road, said Brendan McPhillips, a senior campaign adviser who managed Biden's 2020 race in Pennsylvania and the successful campaign of Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) in 2022.\n'The gap is huge between what the president's campaign has been doing and is doing right now, versus Trump, who has come into the state once or twice for very brief visits,' McPhillips said, adding that the Biden campaign plans to open another dozen Pennsylvania offices, including in some Trump-friendly areas, in the coming months.\nBut for Trump's allies, the negative emotions sparked by Biden during his visit suggest he will struggle to hit his marks in the parts of the state where he needs a strong turnout to overcome Republicans' dominance in rural counties.\nAdvertisement\n'This '24 race feels way more like '16 than '20,' Urban said. 'The antipathy toward Biden — I won't say it's the same as it was toward Clinton, but it's definitely present. The chants of ‘FJB' are louder than they've ever been.'\nLike Hillary Clinton, Biden has faced public blowback from progressive voters. His support for Israel's military campaign in Gaza, in particular, has cost him support from key voting groups, including many young people, Arab Americans and some Black voters.\nIn Pennsylvania, organizers are aiming to convince some 40,000 voters to write in 'uncommitted' rather than voting for Biden during Tuesday's primary. Given Pennsylvania's tight margins, even a small number of defections in November could tip the race.\nBiden's team hopes the state's voters are listening more to other voices, like those of the Kennedy family members who gathered to support him in Philadelphia on Thursday.",
