But the move only intensified infighting among House Republicans, who split sharply on the strategy to deliver assistance to foreign allies including Ukraine and Israel.\nIn social media posts and TV interviews afterward, House Republicans took aim at one another \u2014 in unusually sharp terms \u2014 over the events that led up to the vote. Ultimately, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) had to rely on a majority of Democrats to push through the most controversial piece of the package \u2014 $60 billion in aid to Ukraine for its war against Russia \u2014 in a gamble that could cost him his speakership.\n\u2014 in unusually sharp terms \u2014 over the events that led up to the vote.

Tony Gonzales (R-Tex.) said Sunday on CNN's 'State of the Union,' calling out two GOP colleagues \u2014 Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.) and Bob Good (Va.) \u2014 who have broken with Johnson and voted against other legislation proposed by the GOP majority.\nAdvertisement\nGaetz and Good have also endorsed Gonzales's primary challenger, something Johnson has warned members against doing. Gonzales's CNN comments prompted a third hard-line GOP colleague, Rep. Eli Crane (Ariz.), to announce his support for Gonzales's opponent, Brandon Herrera, a gun enthusiast with a large YouTube following.\nMost House Republicans have grown weary of colleagues who consistently vote against legislation that must be addressed rather than work to seek compromise within the party. Since eight Republicans voted with all Democrats to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), more pragmatic Republicans have become irate at the 'no' bloc of the conference and encouraged GOP leadership to punish those members.\nof colleagues who consistently vote against legislation that must be addressed rather than work to seek compromise within the party.

But in voting against conservative measures they do not believe go far enough, other Republicans say, hard-liners are weakening Johnson's hand in negotiations because the conference is not united around a set of demands.\nBut in voting against conservative measures they do not believe go far enough, other Republicans say, hard-liners are weakening Johnson's hand in negotiations because the conference is not united around a set of demands.\nAdvertisement\nThe hard-line bloc has long objected to considering further Ukraine aid without legislation to secure American borders. In a nod to such demands, Johnson proposed voting on a border security bill Saturday that largely mirrors a tough conservative proposal House Republicans passed last year. But in protest of Johnson's foreign aid proposal, three hard-liners on the House Rules Committee \u2014 GOP Reps. Chip Roy (Tex.), Ralph Norman (S.C.) and Thomas Massie (Ky.) \u2014 prevented the bill from being considered under rules that would require only a simple majority for passage.\nOther Republicans urged Johnson to still put the bill up for a vote under rules that would require two-thirds of the House for passage. The measure fell short.\n'Those who voted to fund Ukraine's borders instead of America's KNEW for certainty that the separate (unattached to Ukraine) border security was going to die in the Senate, and are now dying for cover \u2014 so they're casting blame,' Roy said after the vote on X. 'Own it.'\nAdvertisement\nRep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) shot back at Roy on X, saying the 'isolationist Republicans' were standing in the way of at least forcing Senate Democrats to take a politically difficult vote on border security.\non border security.\nRep. Dan Bishop (R-N.C.) came to Roy's defense.\n'After each sellout, once the fury of Republican voters sets in, the self-serving lies begin,' Bishop said in his own post directed at Barr.\nMassie told Barr, a fellow Kentucky Republican, to 'quit blaming conservatives for your votes.'\nThe intraparty fights have spilled over on to the campaign trail, where Gaetz has taken the lead in ignoring Johnson's warnings and campaigning against GOP colleagues. Gaetz visited San Antonio last month to hold a rally with Herrera where he bashed Gonzales and pushed for a more aggressive GOP conference.\nThere is no love lost with Gonzales.\nAdvertisement\n'Matt Gaetz, he paid minors to have sex with him at drug parties,' Gonzales claimed Sunday, referencing allegations against Gaetz that the Department of Justice investigated but declined to prosecute last year.\nbut declined to prosecute last year.\nThe House Ethics Committee is still investigating Gaetz, who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and said Sunday on X that Gonzales was 'laundering lies on CNN.'\nGonzales also targeted Good for his support of Herrera, apparently referencing a report by Jewish Insider that cited instances of Herrera posting videos 'replete with imagery, music and jokes about the Nazi regime and the Holocaust.'\n'Bob Good endorsed my opponent, a known neo-Nazi,' Gonzales said. 'These people used to walk around with white hoods at night; now they're walking around with white hoods in the daytime.'\nAfter Gonzales's CNN interview, Herrera objected to the congressman's characterization of him as a 'neo-Nazi,' writing on X: 'This is the death spiral ladies and gentlemen. He has to cry to his liberal friends about me, because Republicans won't listen anymore.'\nAdvertisement\nFor Johnson, the infighting looms over his fate as speaker.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) had promised to try to remove Johnson from the speakership if he moved Ukraine aid, but she held back in hopes that her colleagues hear from angry constituents before returning to Washington.\nMassie, who co-sponsored Greene's resolution to oust Johnson, said he hopes Johnson resigns and predicted that if he does not, someone could trigger a 'motion to vacate' even though much of the Republican conference does not want to devolve into chaos again.\nIn a tense Tuesday evening meeting with Johnson and several rank-and-file Republicans, Gaetz told the speaker that if he moved ahead with his foreign aid plan that GOP colleagues would seek to oust him. He also threatened others in the room, saying the far-right bloc would target them on social media and campaign against them.\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, some GOP critics of the hard-line faction have advocated for leadership to take harsher measures against the bloc.\nLast week during a meeting with the speaker and lawmakers of the conservative Main Street Caucus, who prioritize governing, conversations revolved around how to punish members based on what could improve House functions. Several members suggested removing the three hard-liners \u2014 Roy, Massie and Norman \u2014 who sit on the House Rules Committee.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Patrick Svitek,Marianna Sotomayor","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MCDE5UWWCNXUIP5QD2SRTUX6YI_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.6621246,"_id":"e7e971bb3dc94b3dbba0f02f0daf5ffb"},{"title":"Speaker Johnson moves on foreign aid, possibly triggering vote to oust him","author":"Marianna Sotomayor","published_date":"2024-04-17 16:36:05","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/17/house-speaker-mike-johnson-ukraine-israel-motion-to-vacate","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The speaker has introduced a complex five-part plan requiring separate floor votes on Israel and Ukraine, as well as a stand-alone proposal to assuage far-right members who want to strengthen the U.S. southern border. Success is far from guaranteed.","summary":"Speaker Mike Johnson is moving ahead on a foreign aid plan that has roiled his conference and prompted two Republicans to push an effort to oust him from the chamber's top job.\nBut instead of the complex four-part plan he floated earlier this week, Johnson now intends to try to pass five bills \u2014 one each for aid to Ukraine; Israel; and Indo-Pacific allies; as well as a GOP wish list of foreign policy priorities and a fifth stand-alone bill to address widespread Republican demands to strengthen the southern U.S. border.\nThe new approach is risky and could blow up on the speaker, whose six-month-old hold on the gavel is being threatened by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's (Ga.) promise to move a motion to topple Johnson (R-La.) if he puts Ukraine aid on the floor, something many far-right Republicans object to.\nAdvertisement\nJohnson told Republicans in a letter to colleagues Wednesday morning, 'After significant Member feedback and discussion' this week, the House will move ahead with his plan, with some significant changes. He intends to release bill text on Ukraine, Israel and for Indo-Pacific allies earlier Wednesday, and language for the GOP wish list and border later Wednesday.\nSuccess is anything but guaranteed, both on the foreign aid package and keeping his job. Timing on the votes, also, is up in the air \u2014 even as members were slated to head home for a one-week recess on Thursday.\nThis is all happening against the backdrop of an extremely slender House majority that Republicans argue should be expanded by voters in November to better their chances of advancing a conservative agenda. The GOP currently has a two-vote majority, meaning that if Democrats do not help keep Johnson in the speaker role, only three Republicans would be needed to wrest his gavel. But two Republicans suddenly become enough after Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) resigns. He was supposed to leave Friday, putting the GOP majority at just one vote, but now is expected to leave once foreign aid bill passes.\nAdvertisement\n'The congressman has the flexibility to stay and support the aid package on Saturday,' his office said on Wednesday.\nIt is clear Republicans are growing increasingly fed up with Johnson's leadership, and the far-right flank had already signaled they will not support Johnson's plan even before text of the legislation was released. It's unclear how they will respond to the idea of moving a separate border package \u2014 which will, according to the speaker's office \u2014 will include the 'core components of H.R. 2,' a harsh immigration bill restricting migrants from entering the United States.\nEarly signals were not good.\nThe House Freedom Caucus has already panned the proposal. Johnson is 'surrendering' on the border, the far-right group tweeted in response to Johnson's plan. 'This flies in the face of every promise Republicans have told you' and they care more about 'funding Ukraine than they do securing our own borders.'\nAdvertisement\nYet Johnson is moving the separate border package in an attempt to appease his unruly conference, many of whom have demanded the border be secure before funding is sent to Ukraine and other allies. Republicans did have a chance to consider a tough bipartisan security bill earlier in the year, but declined to do so as Donald Trump vocally attacked it.\nKeeping border security separate from the foreign aid package may give both pieces of legislation a greater chance of passing. The national security bill will likely need Democratic support because of the large number of Republicans who don't want to fund Ukraine \u2014 while Johnson aims to pass the border security bill with just Republican support, hoping to satisfy demands from all corners of his conference and send all bills to the Senate.\nBut in an almost four-hour meeting between Johnson and his allies Tuesday night \u2014 before this latest plan was released \u2014 Republicans left demoralized after failing to concoct a plan that would ensure enough of them support sending the package to the floor without having to rely on Democrats. Multiple people familiar with the meeting, who were granted anonymity to discuss internal dynamics, said the meeting enlightened them and Johnson about what moving on his plan would mean for his future.\nAdvertisement\nWhile Johnson is officially moving on his foreign aid plan, it could all lead to his ouster.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'The battle lines were very clear at the end,' one Republican said.

Young's 'Coming Out Republican' offers the history of a movement that may not have actually been that influential.","summary":"History may be written by the victors, but Neil J. Young's excellent new book, 'Coming Out Republican,' is a sympathetic look at one of the past century's losers: the gay conservative. Young, a historian by training, has spent his career explaining the heterogeneity of the conservative movement. His first book, 'We Gather Together,' was about the alliances and rivalries among Catholics, Mormons and evangelicals that birthed the Christian right, and Young has written about religion and politics for the New York Times and CNN.\n'Coming Out Republican' moves from the 1950s to the present, telling the stories of the closeted operators and buttoned-up political clubs that often served as the Myrtle Wilson to the Christian right's Daisy Buchanan, their sense of entitlement out of proportion to the way their supposed allies treated them. Sometimes these gay men acted gallantly to expand the individual freedoms of their queer countrymen. But there are also many instances in the book of them selling out the other civil rights movements in whose wake they traveled. 'Coming Out Republican' is less about an interest group than a self-interest group, one that has long been unable to envision a liberation project more ambitious than expanding the sexual prerogatives of White men.\nmoves from the 1950s to the present, telling the stories of the closeted operators and buttoned-up political clubs that often served as the Myrtle Wilson to the Christian right's Daisy Buchanan, their sense of entitlement out of proportion to the way their supposed allies treated them. Sometimes these gay men acted gallantly to expand the individual freedoms of their queer countrymen. But there are also many instances in the book of them selling out the other civil rights movements in whose wake they traveled. 'Coming Out Republican' is less about an interest group than a self-interest group, one that has long been unable to envision a liberation project more ambitious than expanding the sexual prerogatives of White men.\n'Coming Out Republican' is at its best when using profiles of individual men to depict the eras in which they lived. Leonard Matlovich, a Vietnam War hero, came out in 1975 and sued the federal government to reenlist after he was kicked out of the military. Conservative and macho, Matlovich claimed that 'everything I am and everything I hope to be I owe to the United States Air Force.' He relied on Frank Kameny, of the gay advocacy group the Mattachine Society, and a lawyer from the ACLU to sue on his behalf. Appearing on the cover of Time magazine, he had a dark mustache from central casting, but he was an imperfect poster boy, all-American but naive about gay life. He once bashfully asked a reporter from the Advocate \u2014 an eminent gay magazine \u2014 what the publication was.\nAdvertisement\nIn his study of Matlovich, Young deftly, if a little dryly, parses the cross currents of imperialism, respectability and internecine gay resentment. His prose is at times as vanilla as the men he writes about, relying on ventriloquism of vulgar gay patois for color. In other illuminating sketches, we meet figures such as Jon Hinson, the Bible-thumping congressman from Mississippi who resigned after getting caught performing oral sex on a Black Library of Congress technician in a bathroom in the Capitol, and Terry Dolan, Ronald Reagan's whiz kid pollster who bragged about purging moderates from Congress, bulldozing a path for the Christian right's ascension in the 1980s. They are but two of the legions of closeted Republicans who believed in privacy for a man's sex life but not, among other things, a woman's right to an abortion. Young takes so much care describing the different ways Matlovich, Hinson and Dolan conceived of themselves, and the roles they played in the politics of their era, that their deaths feel like a gut-punch. Each one died of AIDS.\nLess successful are Young's sections on gay Republican groups \u2014 the Log Cabin Republicans, the Teddy Roosevelt Republican Club, the Lincoln Republican Club, Concerned Republicans for Individual Rights, GOProud \u2014 whose sheer number of names reflects how often they split off from one another. Most of the book's colorful characters were better at acting out and working covertly than they were at building large coalitions, so the stakes of their collective action \u2014 like persuading a few thousand San Francisco Republicans to oppose a California ballot initiative \u2014 feel low.\nYoung also has the credulous habit of, for example, describing a group whose membership 'doubled that year to over 150' and citing the growth as evidence of its strength, when such crowds would barely match a modest gay bar's Saturday night or a Baptist church's Sunday services. In instances when gay Republican groups have wielded influence in a decisive way \u2014 say, by whipping up a handful of votes to pass civil rights protections in the California legislature and marriage equality in the New York legislature \u2014 it is not because they had power that could not be ignored. It is because in the eyes of Republican lawmakers in very liberal states, gay Republicans could, like a mistress that doesn't ask or expect too much, be indulged from time to time.\nBut that's state politics. At the national level, gay Republicans have been betrayed and insulted by every Republican presidential candidate since Reagan. In 1980, they had reasons for optimism. Despite Reagan's conservative bona fides, two years earlier he helped defeat a California referendum that would have barred gay people from teaching in public schools. But as president, his embrace of the religious right was so close, and his administration's antipathy for people with AIDS so pronounced, that it further stained the Republican Party's reputation with gay people. George H.W. Bush ran as a moderate and even signed gay-friendly legislation like the Ryan White Care Act and the Americans With Disabilities Act before abandoning tolerance to court the religious right. Less than a decade after he left office, his son campaigned as a compassionate conservative, and then ran for reelection supporting a constitutional amendment to forbid same-sex marriage. Donald Trump also seemed to embrace LGBTQ people as he campaigned for the 2016 election, but as president he nominated judges hostile to LGBTQ rights and supported policies that made it easier for people claiming religious exemptions to discriminate against sexual minorities.\nAdvertisement\nYoung makes a persuasive case that gay Republicans contributed to the civil rights progress of the last few decades. Intellectuals like Andrew Sullivan and operators like Ken Mehlman, who ran George W. Bush's 2004 campaign from the closet, contributed to the push for marriage equality and military participation. But neither man \u2014 or really any conservative advocate \u2014 did nearly as much as Evan Wolfson, the Lambda Legal lawyer, who articulated the intellectual foundations of same-sex marriage and executed the political strategy to make it a reality. The simple fact is that liberal gays have been more clear-eyed about power than their conservative counterparts, better at building coalitions and more wary of placating the Christian conservatives who do not believe there is a place for sexual minorities in public life.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nYoung could have more forcefully thought through the reluctance of gay Republicans to find common cause with members of other minority groups. The obvious answer is the most uncomfortable one: Gay Republicans see themselves as having more in common with other White people, rich people and men. Unfortunately, the only way that the numerically few can wield power is through solidarity with other minorities, but that requires insight that does not always come easily to White gay men, especially conservative White gay men: None of us is that special, and trying to be 'not that kind of gay' comes at a cost. One of the most heartbreaking themes of 'Coming Out Republican' is how unfamiliar many conservative gays are with the varying joys of gay life \u2014 writing it off as too 'PC' or too promiscuous. Being gay can be quite fun, not despite but because of our endless squabbles and struggles over how to keep this life distinct and ours, and open to as many people as want to partake.\nAnyone could benefit from reading this book. Straight people will learn how the puritanical impulse to control other people's ' sex lives has defined politics for nearly a century, an impulse as old as it is futile. Queer people \u2014 who often must teach ourselves our own history \u2014 will learn how respectability remains an empty promise. But it is gay Republicans themselves who most need to read Young's book. If they are not too vain, the Peter Thiels and George Santoses of the world might find in these pages a warning that having power is not the same thing as being tolerated until you are no longer useful.\nNathan Kohrman is a writer covering medicine, politics and culture.

We have less religion but still very religiously influenced politics.\nwithin the Republican Party. We have less religion but still very religiously influenced politics.\nYou've no doubt read articles over the past two decades about the declining numbers of Christian Americans and the growing contingent who have no religious affiliation. And that's not just a story of Democrats and liberals leaving faith. The number of Republicans who attend church weekly and consider religion a core part of their lives is also shrinking.\nYet many policies enacted by local, state and federal Republican elected officials and conservative judges are straight from the religious right's agenda: vouchers and other initiatives to make it easier for parents to send their children to religious schools; limits on reproductive rights that ban abortion and could even threaten in vitro fertilization; restrictions on gay and particularly transgender Americans; provisions allowing religious Americans to cite their faith in declining to participate in various activities, such as getting vaccinated.\nAdvertisement\nLouisiana's House of Representatives last week passed a bill requiring the state's public schools and universities to display the Ten Commandments. Trump is promising to create a federal task force to root out what he describes as 'anti-Christian bias' in America. Some Republican operatives likely to play major roles in a second Trump term have openly stated that they believe government policies should be shaped in accordance with Christianity.\nFollow this author Perry Bacon Jr. 's opinions\nFollow this author\nPerry Bacon Jr.\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nHow are these trends \u2014 a secularizing America, a party increasingly tied to its religious wing \u2014 happening at once? In some ways, they are causal. Many Americans on the political left and center say they stopped identifying themselves as Christians in part because of the faith's vocal conservative bloc, particularly its anti-LGBTQ+ agenda. On the flip side, Robert P. Jones, founder of the Public Religion Research Institute (now known as PRRI), argues White Christians have become more radical in their policy goals and more deeply embedded in the Republican Party because of their alarm at how quickly America is becoming more racially diverse and secular.\nBut with a growing number of Republicans saying they aren't Christian or religious, another explanation is important: internal party politics. Polls suggest there are many Republican voters who would prefer a GOP that wasn't trying to make abortions impossible and ban books written by LGBTQ+ authors from public schools and libraries.\nRepublicans saying they aren't Christian or religious, another explanation is important: internal party politics. Polls suggest there are many Republican voters who would prefer a GOP that wasn't trying to make abortions impossible and ban books written by LGBTQ+ authors from public schools and libraries.\nAdvertisement\nBut those Republicans aren't organized into well-funded activist groups working at the local, state and federal levels. And the portion of the party wary of the religious right overwhelmingly falls in line and backs GOP candidates in general elections, even if those candidates have adopted the religious right's agenda.\nIn contrast, the party's religious bloc defends its priorities fiercely \u2014 and in moral terms. Groups such as the Family Research Council and the Alliance Defending Freedom are constantly pushing bills in state legislatures and filing lawsuits. They are creative and relentless in exploring methods to execute their agenda, such as their effort to get a future Republican president to invoke a once-obscure law from 1873 (the Comstock Act) to limit abortion.\nThose on the religious right argue that abortion, same-sex marriage, people changing their gender identities and other actions condoned by liberals are violations of core religious tenets. So they aren't willing to set aside those views just because they poll badly. It's hard for nonreligious Republicans to win intraparty arguments when the religious bloc is speaking with such passion.\nAdvertisement\nSo while America and even the Republican electorate is significantly less religious than in Ronald Reagan's or George W. Bush's heyday, the GOP is still dominated by the same two groups that have controlled it for decades: wealthy individuals and businesses who donate millions to conservative organizations and Republican campaigns because they want to keep taxes low and regulations limited; and religious groups that want to keep American culture conservative.\nOf course, the religious right has changed over time. Though the term 'evangelical' once described religious conservatives of prior eras, it was more precisely a movement led by White, male Southern Baptist leaders and activists. Today's religious right has a bigger role for Catholics, women and people of color, as well as Protestants who aren't Southern Baptists, including Pentecostals and those from America's growing ranks of nondenominational churches. (This is why I use the term 'religious right' rather than, say, 'Christian nationalists' or 'evangelicals.' There are many Christians who argue that the religious right's stances are a perversion of the faith. The exact meanings of 'Christian nationalism' and 'evangelicalism' are contested, but everyone agrees there is a bloc on the right that claims to be acting out of religious beliefs.)\nNevertheless, winning Republican primaries still requires courting both the party's business and religious wings. The former provides money for a campaign; the other voters and local organizers.\nAdvertisement\nThese two groups have an informal d\u00e9tente. Wealthy conservatives who are more interested in keeping taxes low don't trash the party's religious conservatives for being focused on abortion and school vouchers. And the religious conservatives go along with tax cuts for the wealthy.\nTrump is beholden to religious conservatives, too. The business wing of the party tried to break with him after the 2020 election and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, spending much of the past three years trying to elevate other potential Republican presidential nominees, particularly Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. But Trump's strong support among religious voters helped him easily win the Republican primaries this year.\nFor the general election, Trump's attempts to distance himself from recent antiabortion rulings from conservative judges in Arizona and Florida show he understands the problem: The religious right's agenda might be unacceptable to the rest of the country.\nAdvertisement","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Perry Bacon Jr.","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JNJIMEWDPYI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.449719,"_id":"235e951307a61e3e878b109fa61294e2"},{"title":"Pennsylvania race previews Democrats' plan to focus campaign on democracy","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-22 10:00:06","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/22/scott-perry-democrats-pennsylvania-primary-democracy","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The bid to oust Republican Rep.

He smiled.\n'WANTED for crimes against the CONSTITUTION,' the sign read. 'Scott Perry for Prison. Traitor. Insurrectionist. Criminal.'\n'That's one of the reasons why I'm running,' O'Brien, one of six Democrats vying to unseat Perry, a GOP congressman, told the couple who answered the door. 'You can't let Trump and Perry overthrow democracy under the guise of patriotism anymore.'\nIt's a message that Democrats, including President Biden, hope will resonate in places like Camp Hill, a middle-class suburb outside Pennsylvania's capital, Harrisburg. The area was once a Republican stronghold but has become more politically independent in recent years due to population growth and moderate Republicans alienated by Trump's norm-busting behavior.\nAdvertisement\nThe competitive Democratic primary here Tuesday offers a preview of how Democrats intend to make democracy a central issue in competitive races for seats such as Perry's, which could help determine control of the narrowly divided U.S. House. It also provides a glimpse of the case Biden will make in battleground states like Pennsylvania.\nBiden has said his reelection is above all else about preserving democracy, which he warns is under threat if Trump wins a second term. In his first campaign speech of 2024, on the day before the anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, Biden stood less than 100 miles from here in Valley Forge.\n'Whether democracy is still America's sacred cause is the most urgent question of our time, and it's what the 2024 election is all about,' he said.\nIt remains unclear whether voters will see it that way. Beyond the defense of democracy, Americans will be asked to weigh more tangible issues, including inflation, immigration and abortion. The age of the candidates \u2014 Biden is 81 and Trump is 77 \u2014 will also loom large in a presidential rematch that polls show many Americans didn't want.\nAdvertisement\nBut there's also reason to believe democracy as an issue will carry more weight than it did four years ago. This is the first presidential vote since Trump and his allies spread false claims about the 2020 election results, a violent mob besieged the U.S. Capitol to stop the certification of Biden's victory and Trump declared that he would be a 'dictator' \u2014 if only on 'day one' of his second term.\nSince the 2020 vote, there has been additional evidence that campaigns built on the defense of democracy can resonate in the Trump era. In his campaign for governor in 2022, Democrat Josh Shapiro eviscerated Republican Doug Mastriano, who played a key role in the effort to challenge Biden's win in Pennsylvania and paid to bus Trump supporters to Washington for the 'Stop the Steal' rally on Jan. 6. Shapiro ultimately beat Mastriano by 15 percentage points.\nDemocrats say a similar pitch will work in the 10th Congressional District race against Perry, who was a key liaison between House Republicans and the White House in efforts to overturn the election.\nAdvertisement\nThe House select committee investigating Jan. 6 found that Perry took part in White House meetings where strategies to try to undermine the transfer of power were discussed. He also pressed the Justice Department to investigate wild and unfounded claims that military satellites had been used to flip votes from Trump to Biden. After Trump supporters attacked the Capitol, Perry formally objected to the counting of Pennsylvania's electoral votes.\nIn 2022, the FBI seized Perry's cellphone as part of its investigation into attempts to thwart certification of the 2020 election. The Jan. 6 committee subpoenaed the congressman to testify, but he refused. He later denied assertions by former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson that he had asked for a preemptive pardon.\nNationally, Democrats see Perry, who is running for his seventh term in Congress, as one of their best shots at toppling a prominent election denier and are expected to invest heavily in trying to flip the seat.\nAdvertisement\nWhile most Republicans who voted against certifying the 2020 results represent safe red districts, Perry's district is more of a bellwether. Under the boundaries of the 10th District, Trump would have won by four percentage points over Biden. Shapiro won the district by 12 percentage points in 2020, while Perry won reelection by eight points. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the district 'lean Republican.'\nDemocrats say they can beat Perry this time with a stronger candidate and a more targeted message tying the congressman to extremism and Jan. 6, as Shapiro successfully did against Mastriano. Perry's campaign said it sees that as a fantasy.\n'They say insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result. Democrats tried and failed to make the events that followed the 2020 election an issue in the 2022 midterm elections. Congressman Perry earned reelection in 2022 by an even larger margin than he did in 2020 because the voters of south-central Pennsylvania know he is fighting for them each and every day,' said Matt Beynon, spokesman for the Perry campaign.\nSome public polling suggests that Democrats are significantly more worried about threats to democracy than other voters. A USA Today-Suffolk poll conducted in March asked respondents to choose the issue most important to them in their presidential vote. Among Democrats, 44 percent said threats to democracy were their top issue versus 20 percent of independents and 6 percent of Republicans. For Democrats, no other issue came close.\nA Washington Post-Schar School poll also conducted in March found that a majority of Americans were very or extremely worried about threats to democracy in the United States, including 58 percent of Democrats and 47 percent of Republicans.\nAdvertisement\nStephen Medvic, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College, said democracy is clearly a factor for voters in the Democratic primary. But he said he's skeptical of its power to move swing voters in the general election against Perry.\nThe Democratic nominee, he said, will have to 'connect a bunch of dots that this candidate had a role, and that Jan. 6 was a real threat and going forward that Trump and Perry would continue to put democracy at risk.'\nDemocrats are getting some help on that front from anti-Trump Republicans. A new group, Republicans Against Perry, placed a billboard this month on a major interstate through the district. The ad shows photos of Mastriano and Perry, both with red Xs over their faces.\nCraig Snyder, who served as chief of staff to then-Republican Sen. Arlen Specter, started the group and said he's received thousands of inquires from people who want to be involved.\nAdvertisement\n'When you look at the responses we've had, the people wanting to come to events, it's enough Republicans in the district to form a pro-democracy coalition,' he said.\nFirst, Democrats need to pick a candidate to run against Perry.\nO'Brien, a 42-year-old retired TOPGUN fighter pilot, said voters are most enthusiastic when he alleges that Perry, who is also a veteran, violated his oath of office to uphold the Constitution by siding with Trump after the 2020 election.\nAs O'Brien knocked on doors in the district one recent day, a couple in their 80s told him that they were deciding between him and Janelle Stelson, a longtime local TV news anchor whose name recognition has made her the presumptive front-runner in the race. O'Brien told them that his message is 'very focused on democracy and making sure that Trump and Perry aren't in a position to overthrow it again.'\nAdvertisement\nThe couple said they had long been registered Republican but recently became Democrats because of their deep aversion to Trump. Electing him again, Kathy Vollmer, 83, said, 'would be like vindicating him.' Her husband, Phil Vollmer, 85, chimed in, saying, 'Perry's an idiot. Trump is dangerous.'\nStelson was also a longtime registered Republican but switched to become a Democrat in January 2023. If she can convince traditional Democrats to vote for her in the primary, she said she thinks her past political affiliation will help her win over the independents and Republicans needed to beat Perry.\nWalking through a suburban neighborhood in York County one recent day, Stelson said Perry's role in Jan. 6 is part of her message. 'He tried to overturn all of our votes,' she said.\nBut she's also focusing heavily on reproductive rights and Perry's support for legislation that would make it federal law that life begins at conception.\nAdvertisement\nHours before the last debate of the primary, O'Brien went to get a fade at the barbershop in Harrisburg he frequents. Inside, over the low hum of razors, he debated politics with owner Johnny Butler, a registered Democrat who said he has backed Trump because he finds the former president to be authentic \u2014 even if he's lying.\nButler said issues such as inflation are on his mind as he makes his choices for 2024. Asked if he was worried that Trump would attempt to subvert democracy, Butler said that 'it's impossible' because of the Constitution.\nLater that night, Butler was in the debate's audience to support O'Brien, who was the only candidate on the stage to mention democracy in his opening and closing remarks. In their questions, the moderators didn't bring it up.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RI55GNNQKO7TPZMXWE3PN6OTME_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.4130583,"_id":"4f48d25ab8bbe695615cddb093db1856"},{"title":"Facing a Republican revolt, House Speaker Johnson pushes ahead on US aid for Ukraine, allies","author":"Lisa Mascaro","published_date":"2024-04-16 16:05:13","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/16/ukraine-israel-house-republicans/1b74a9ce-fc0b-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Defiant and determined, House Speaker Mike Johnson has pushed back against mounting Republican anger over his proposed U.S. aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other allies","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Defiant and determined, House Speaker Mike Johnson pushed back Tuesday against mounting Republican anger over his proposed U.S. aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other allies, and rejected a call to step aside or risk a vote to oust him from office.\n'I am not resigning,' Johnson said after a testy morning meeting of fellow House Republicans at the Capitol\nJohnson referred to himself as a 'wartime speaker' of the House and indicated in his strongest self-defense yet he would press forward with a U.S. national security aid package, a situation that would force him to rely on Democrats to help pass it, over objections from his weakened majority.\n'We are simply here trying to do our jobs,' Johnson said, calling the motion to oust him 'absurd ... not helpful.'\nTuesday brought a definitive shift in tone from both the House Republicans and the speaker himself at a pivotal moment as the embattled leader tries, against the wishes of his majority, to marshal the votes needed to send the stalled national security aid for Israel, Ukraine and other overseas allies to passage.\nAdvertisement\nJohnson appeared emboldened by his meeting late last week with Donald Trump when the Republican former president threw him a political lifeline with a nod of support after their private talk at Trump's Mar-A-Lago resort in Florida. At his own press conference Tuesday, Johnson spoke of the importance of ensuring Trump, who is now at his criminal trial in New York, is re-elected to the White House.\nJohnson also spoke over the weekend with President Joe Biden as well as other congressional leaders about the emerging U.S. aid package, which the speaker plans to move in separate votes for each section \u2014 with bills for Ukraine, Israel, the Indo-Pacific region. He spoke about it with Biden again late Monday.\nIt's a complicated approach that breaks apart the Senate's $95 billion aid package for separate votes, and then stitches it back together for the president's signature.\nAdvertisement\nThe approach will require the speaker to cobble together bipartisan majorities with different factions of House Republicans and Democrats on each measure. Additionally, Johnson is preparing a fourth measure that would include various Republican-preferred national security priorities, such as a plan to seize some Russian assets in U.S. banks to help fund Ukraine and another to turn the economic aid for Ukraine into loans.\nThe plan is not an automatic deal-braker for Democrats in the House and Senate, with leaders refraining from comment until they see the actual text of the measure, due out later Tuesday.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nHouse Republicans, however, were livid that Johnson will be leaving their top priority \u2014 efforts to impose more security at the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 on the sidelines.

The U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade passed the practical decision of whether to allow access to abortion to state lawmakers, and many Republicans are now caught between long-held, often religiously rooted views that have defined the GOP for generations and a more practical desire to win elections.\nRoe v. Wade passed the practical decision of whether to allow access to abortion to state lawmakers, and many Republicans are now caught between long-held, often religiously rooted views that have defined the GOP for generations and a more practical desire to win elections.\nIn recent days, Lake, who once described the 160-year-old measure as a 'great law,' has been personally lobbying some Republicans to repeal the ban, highlighting the political stakes of the looming vote. According to one lawmaker who received such a call and spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, Lake made it clear that she 'understands [the pre-Roe ban] will be bad for her and for Trump.' They discussed how Arizona is essential for Trump to secure the presidency, the lawmaker said. Trump lost the state to President Biden in 2020 by only 10,457 votes.\nThe dilemma facing Republicans on abortion has grown even more acute since last Wednesday, when Trump said Arizona's abortion ban goes too far and promised it would be 'straightened out' by 'the governor and everybody else.' Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee who has bragged about his role in the overturning of Roe, made a similar promise about a pending six-week abortion ban in Florida, even as he has argued the abortion issue should be left to the states.\nthe abortion issue should be left to the states.\nAdvertisement\nTwo Republicans in the Arizona House of Representatives and two in the Senate would have to join all of both chambers' Democrats to repeal the ban, which could take effect as early as June 8 without legislative action.

Alex Kolodin (R), who sees the 1864 law as a victory for the party's core ideological position as well as a major humanitarian triumph.\nAdvertisement\nSeveral GOP lawmakers and operatives said Trump's comments could ease the decision to vote for a repeal for some Republicans who were on the fence, granting them permission to go against their values for a better chance at securing victory in November.\n'It gave them cover,' said one prominent Arizona Republican who supports the repeal and spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss internal party dynamics.

Democrats are trying to get an initiative on the November ballot that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution and allow the procedure to the point of fetal viability, or about 24 weeks.

The far-right is fiercely against Ukraine aid \u2014 112 Republicans, just over half of the conference, opposed it on the House floor Saturday and he had to rely on unanimous Democratic backing \u2014 and Johnson's decision to greenlight a floor vote could come at great political cost.

He made the difficult decision despite threats from an angry and vocal minority of hard-right Republicans \u2014 ironically, the ones who helped catapult him into power \u2014 who are using their conservative bully pulpit to challenge Johnson and threaten his job.\nHe seems to have accepted his fate.\n'Look, history judges us for what we do,' said an emotional Johnson, holding back tears and with a quivering lip at a news conference this week in response to a question from The Washington Post. 'This is a critical time right now, critical time in the world stage. I could make a selfish decision and do something that's different, but I'm doing here what I believe to be the right thing.'\nAdvertisement\nJohnson's son will be headed to the U.S. Naval Academy in the fall. 'To put it bluntly, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine, then American boys,' he said. 'This is a live-fire exercise for me and for so many American families.'\nThe speaker's torturous path to embracing Ukraine aid is the result of many factors: high-level intelligence briefings as a House leader; his faith; the counsel of three committee chairs named Mike; and a realization the GOP would never unite on Ukraine.

A portion of the $60 billion bill for Ukraine would be a loan. A second bill would provide about $17 billion in weapons for Israel, as well as just over $9 billion in humanitarian aid for Gaza and elsewhere.

Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) said. 'Not all politicians make that same choice. That was not a foregone conclusion on the day he was elected speaker.'\nPath to yes\nEarly this year, Johnson started to suggest in conference meetings that he was open to funding Ukraine, making statements about being a 'Reagan Republican' who believed in 'peace through strength.' That's when a far-right whisper campaign started as early as January about ousting Johnson if he dared move on Ukraine without first securing the southern border.\nMeanwhile, the Senate was haggling over a bipartisan border security measure as part of its foreign aid package, including help for Ukraine. Those months-long negotiations bought Johnson time. But when Republicans in both the House and the Senate, led by Trump, immediately rejected the bipartisan border security plan, it became clear there was no chance such a measure could pass Congress.\na measure could pass Congress.\nThat meant Johnson would have to choose whether to rely on support from the sizable pro-foreign aid faction of House Republicans and Democrats to back Ukraine aid or acquiesce to demands by his right flank and do nothing.\nThe Senate passed a $95 billion foreign aid bill in February with 70 votes, significant bipartisan support omitting any border security component.

They would rather indulge right-wing media consumers with baseless impeachments, motions to vacate the speaker's chair (again!), fruitless hearings and parroting Russian propaganda. None of these activities serves the interests of the voters; none improves U.S. national security. For these minions of Donald Trump, chaos and paralysis appear to be the goal. Fortunately for the country, Democrats have figured out how to short-circuit the antics and humiliate Republicans.\nMy Post colleague Aaron Blake described the Republicans' impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for his handling of the U.S.-Mexico border as 'troubled from the start \u2014 in ways that sharply undercut the claim that Democrats are derelict in shrugging off an impeachment trial.' Additionally, Blake wrote, many Republicans admitted that 'Mayorkas's actions weren't impeachable' and that 'the party wound up lacking complete unity in both chambers in historic ways.'\nProblems started in the House. The Republicans' star legal witness and an even smattering of House and Senate Republicans conceded that there was no constitutional basis for impeaching Mayorkas. Jonathan Turley, a frequent Trump legal defender, readily acknowledged, 'I don't think they have established any of those bases for impeachment. ... The fact is, impeachment is not for being a bad Cabinet member or even a bad person. It is a very narrow standard.' Republicans never remotely reached the constitutional standard of 'high crimes and misdemeanors.'\nAdvertisement\nIn February, not long before announcing his retirement, Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal that 'incompetence doesn't rise to the level of high crimes or misdemeanors.' He added that 'if we are to make underenforcement of the law, even egregious underenforcement, impeachable, almost every cabinet secretary would be subject to impeachment.' When the impeachment vote came, Gallagher's irrefutable reasoning drew only two other Republican 'no' votes.\nIn the Senate on Wednesday, few expected the impeachment to go anywhere. Several Republicans openly disparaged the effort. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) affirmed there was no constitutional basis for Mayorkas's impeachment, yet voted against dismissing the unconstitutional measure for fear of creating a bad precedent(!). Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) voted 'present' on one of the two groundless articles:\nOn a point of order that the Article I charges were unconstitutional because they do not rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors, I voted present. I did so because the allegations outlined in Article I \u2014 that Secretary Mayorkas, by executing the policies of the Biden administration, committed high crimes that rose to the level of impeachable offenses, needed real debate and deliberation. We were not afforded the opportunity to debate the constitutionalities of the charges in Article I, so I was not in good conscience able to vote in the affirmative or against.\nShe most certainly could have determined the charge did not meet the standard of 'high crimes and misdemeanors,' but a solid display of independence on an impeachment vote was, perhaps, too much to ask.\nAdvertisement\nIn any event, Democrats \u2014 including moderates such as Sens. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) and Jon Tester (Mont.) \u2014 were in no mood to indulge Republicans. Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) understood that conducting a full-blown trial would give undeserved credence to the House's stunt. 'The charges brought against Secretary Mayorkas fail to meet the high standard of high crimes and misdemeanors,' he said. 'To validate this gross abuse by the House would be a grave mistake and could set a dangerous precedent for the future.'\nFollow this author Jennifer Rubin 's opinions\nFollow this author\nJennifer Rubin\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nIn dismissing the articles of impeachment with a party-line vote, Senate Democrats ignored crocodile tears from the likes of Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) \u2014 who voted against the most meritorious impeachment in history following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot \u2014 that dismissing an impeachment before trial would create a bad precedent (unlike letting an insurrectionist off the hook?).

Both districts are located just outside Detroit and are heavily Democratic, with the previous Democratic incumbents each having won by over 25 percentage points in 2022.\nThe lower chamber has been tied 54-54 between Democratic and Republican lawmakers since November, when two Democratic representatives vacated their seats after winning mayoral races in their hometowns. Democrats previously held a majority in both chambers along with control of the governor's office.\nAdvertisement\n'These special elections will determine who controls the House here in Michigan and set the tone for November, when we will decide whether Democrats hold on to the state House,' said Michigan Democratic Party Chair Lavora Barnes.\nDemocrats flipped both chambers in the 2022 midterms while maintaining control of the governor's office to win a trifecta for the first time in 40 years. They moved quickly to roll back decades of Republican measures and implement the party's agenda in their first year, including overhauling the state's gun laws.\nSince the House deadlocked, Republicans have pushed to pass legislation they say is bipartisan, such as a government transparency package, which would open the Legislature and governor's office up to public record requests. But very little legislation has been passed. Democrats have been unwilling to accept a joint power-sharing agreement proposed multiple times by Republican House Leader Matt Hall over the past few months.\nAdvertisement\nIf both Democratic candidates win Tuesday, the party will regain control through the end of the year, with each seat in the House up for reelection in November.

Whitmer used her January State of the State speech to propose an $81 billion budget that would provide free community college for all high school graduates and preschool for 4-year-olds.\nIn recent months, Democrats have also considered expanding the state's hate crime law and enacting a comprehensive school safety package spurred by the 2021 mass shooting at Oxford High School.

Brian Fitzpatrick in Pennsylvania's GOP primary could offer hints about swing-district party sentiment in a heated presidential election year","summary":"NEW HOPE, Pa. \u2014 Mark Houck makes a potent appeal to conservative Republicans in this corner of eastern Pennsylvania when he describes his arrest and subsequent acquittal on federal charges that he pushed a Planned Parenthood volunteer outside a Philadelphia abortion clinic.\nThe account has become a staple of Houck's first-time bid for the U.S. House in suburban Philadelphia, a central battleground of the 2024 election, from the presidency on down.\n'I'm telling you this because this is how I became a target of the federal government \u2014 the weaponization of the government,' he said at a meeting last week of the New Hope Solebury Republican Club.\nHouck's campaign to unseat fourth-term Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick in Tuesday's primary could offer hints about swing-district Republican sentiment in one of the most volatile White House races in years.\nAdvertisement\nWith few truly competitive House seats in play, the 1st Congressional District that Fitzpatrick represents is one of 16 districts nationwide that Democrat Joe Biden carried in the 2020 presidential election where voters also sent Republicans to Washington. By comparison, five seats won that year by Donald Trump, then the incumbent and now his party's presumptive 2024 nominee, are now held occupied by a Democrat.\nThe Republicans' House majority is so slim that Democrats need to flip just four seats in November to retake control. That makes the 'Biden 16' a significant group of competitive seats and they could go a long way in determining whether the next president has a friendly or hostile House next year.\nFifteen of those seats are in states that Biden won in 2020. The exception is Nebraska's 2nd District, represented by GOP Rep. Don Bacon. There are five seats in California, four in New York, two in Arizona and one apiece in New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia.\nAdvertisement\nSeveral of the 'Biden 16' are like Fitzgerald, winning year after year by tightrope-walking between challengers in primaries and general elections. Nine of them won a first term in in 2022, when Republicans took control of the House for the first time in four years.\nIn the fall, many will face the same Democrat they beat last time, sometimes narrowly.\nThe Fitzpatrick-Houck winner will face Democrat Ashley Ehasz, a former Army helicopter pilot who is uncontested in her primary. Fitzpatrick, a former FBI supervisory agent who beat Ehasz by 10 percentage points in 2022, is outraising Houck and Ehasz by millions of dollars, combined.\nBefore November, several others among the 'Biden 16' must beat back primary challenges from the conservative wing of the GOP.\nIn Nebraska, Bacon is facing perhaps his strongest primary test yet. If he wins, he will take on the same Democratic opponent, state Sen. Tony Vargas, whom he defeated two years ago by fewer than 3 percentage points.\nAdvertisement\nBacon has been a vocal supporter of sending more military aid to Ukraine, something opposed by his primary opponent, second-time congressional candidate Dan Frei.\nFrei, who contends the GOP base is fed up with Bacon, accuses the incumbent of flouting campaign promises by voting to increase spending and for bills that do nothing to stem the flow of immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.\nNearly all of the 16 races are considered toss-ups.\nRepublicans intend to hammer home a message about lax border security and high inflation under Biden. Democrats are warning that Republicans will pursue a national abortion ban as Democrats invoke an issue that has consistently worked in their favor at the ballot box since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022.\nAdvertisement\nNorth Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson, chair of the House Republicans' campaign arm, said the 'Biden 16' have formed strong identities in their districts and are emphasizing local issues.\nHudson said Biden's unpopularity and presidential turnout models are increasingly giving an edge to Republicans, with the GOP attracting more working-class voters who more likely to vote in presidential elections and help flip these districts to Trump.\n'The presidential turnout dynamics actually favor Republicans,' Hudson said in an interview. 'And then if you look, state by state, where our battlegrounds are, the presidential turnout is going to help us.'\nWashington Rep. Suzan DelBene, who leads the House Democrats' campaign arm, said Democrats will highlight what they say is the chaos at the highest levels of government when Republicans are charge of the House and Trump is in the White House. They will say Trump is a threat to democracy and Republicans are extremists and hypocrites who voted against major spending bills under Biden and then tried to take credit for the projects that landed in their districts.\nAdvertisement\nVoters 'want folks who are there to govern,' DelBene said in an interview. 'They're not looking for extremism. And so all we have to do is make sure that voters are aware of what they're doing. ... Holding them accountable for their actual votes, even though their rhetoric sometimes tries to be more moderate.'\nIn Pennsylvania, Houck's bid to unseat Fitzpatrick, who is backed by some labor unions and business groups, has a visceral feel that some Republicans say resonates with them.\nAt the Solebury Republicans' meeting on the grounds of a luxury hotel and wedding venue, Houck unwound the story of his arrest, describing federal agents with guns drawn as they descended on his Bucks County home in 2022.\nThey arrested him, in connection with the incident outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Philadelphia. Houck defended his actions, saying he acted to protect his 12-year-old son from abusive comments made by the clinic volunteer. The trial ended in an acquittal in 2023, and Houck, who runs a Catholic ministry group, said he began fielding requests to run for office.\nAdvertisement\nHouck's story struck a chord with Rose Cipriano, who came to hear him speak. Her husband picked up a Houck yard sign and Cipriano, who had previously supported Fitzpatrick, said Houck has changed her mind in the approaching primary.\n'I'm looking for fresh ideas, and I'm willing to take a chance and vote for him on Tuesday,' Cipriano said 'I've known his story since it happened, and I support him.'\nHouck's campaign echoes Trump's own defense against the criminal cases against him. It centers on the slogan 'Faith Family Freedom' while Houck talks about defunding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the federal departments of Agriculture, Education and Justice, calling them all unconstitutional.\nHouck has raised more campaign cash than any previous Fitzpatrick primary challenger. But he is well behind Fitzpatrick's fundraising and name recognition in a county where his brother previously held the congressional seat.\nAdvertisement\nFitzpatrick has the support of the county party and the backing of police and fire unions, whose large campaign signs endorsing him crop up every two years.\nBob Brooks, president of the Pennsylvania Professional Firefighters Association, said Fitzpatrick represents blue-collar workers like his union members.\n'And, if there was more blue-collar legislators, I think they would find more support from firefighters,' Brooks said in an interview. 'We support those who support us, and Brian has supported us on many levels.'\nRepublicans at the Solebury meeting encouraged Houck to stay involved in party politics.\nHouck said he will back Fitzpatrick in the general election if Fitzpatrick wins the primary but won't campaign for him, put off by what he said was Fitzpatrick failure to check on Houck's family after his arrest. Fitzpatrick didn't respond to interview requests.\nCipriano said she is disappointed in Fitzpatrick but said the stakes are too high for the party to be divided in November. She pledged to support Fitzpatrick should he win the primary.\n'I am behind the Republican Party 100%,' she said. 'So whoever's running, from the top down, gets my support.'\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Marc Levy,Mike Catalini","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BL5OW3H7DQI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.2925854,"_id":"bc3cc116dd966a745a3e21420062eaf8"},{"title":"They didn't want Trump.

Last summer he wrote that he himself would not be running for president because 'beating Trump is more important.' In January, when he was stumping for Nikki Haley, he said that Trump 'can barely keep a cogent thought' without a teleprompter. At an event in February, he explained his belief that Trump wouldn't be the party's standard-bearer forever by saying that 'a--holes come and go.'\nAs he said all this, he added a caveat: He'd support the eventual GOP nominee, even if it was Trump.\nAnd now, at the Gridiron, Sununu was accepting the inevitable, because it's happening.\n'My focus isn't about Trump.

And Sununu, for his part, would like to see that entity in the White House.\nAnd Sununu, for his part, would like to see that entity in the White House.\nA sight to behold: the slow parade of Trump-averse Republicans as they trudge toward supporting the nominee.\nAt the individual level, dusting off the old MAGA hat is a choice, not an inevitability. Former Vice President Mike Pence, the other half of Trump's previous ticket, has said he will not endorse him. Former Trump adviser John Bolton has said he will be writing in Dick Cheney, of all people. Other former members of the Trump administration, having seen firsthand what he did last time, are encouraging fellow conservatives to vote against him. Mark T.

'But I think, writ large, if you look at the policies he's implemented, I don't see how he's altered his policies in a way that has impacted American Jews \u2014 erased us in a way that Joe Biden is currently doing.'\nLevine had been torn about what to do after his preferred Republican alternatives to Trump fell away. Jan. 6, 2021, had been a breaking point. He thought about not voting for president. Or writing someone in, as he'd done in 2016. Then, on March 25, the United States abstained from vetoing a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. Three days later, Levine was at his keyboard typing an email to 1,600 of his contacts.\nAdvertisement\nSubject line: 'NEVER SAY NEVER; WHY I WILL VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP.'\n'I remain concerned about Trump's relationship with the truth,' Levine wrote in the email. 'I continue to cringe every time he tells the lie about a stolen election. The thought that he did nothing while rioters ran through the Capitol chanting \u2018hang Mike Pence' still haunts me.'\nAnd yet \u2026\n'... The question becomes: as between the two, who will leave a better, safer, and more prosperous America for my grandchildren? Hands down, the answer is Trump.'\nIn an interview, Levine cited a laundry list of Biden's shortcomings, beyond the U.N. vote, to justify his support of Trump: the 'catastrophic' withdrawal from Afghanistan, 'the open border,' 'failed Bidenomics,' and a 'social justice agenda' that's 'particularly damaging to America's Jews.' And he was upset about how the Biden administration had been trying to use its influence to undermine Israel's military offensive in Gaza. Biden lately has cautioned that a military assault on the city of Rafah would be a 'mistake' and has advocated for a freer flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n'When the Allies were firebombing Dresden, did anyone say let's stop and feed the civilians?' Levine says. 'When the United States dropped the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, did we say let's stop and feed the civilians? When we were marching our way to Berlin to defeat the Nazis, did we say we have to feed the civilians, let's stop and negotiate with Hitler?'\n(The aftermath of World War II did prompt a lot of moral soul-searching, leading to the Geneva Conventions of 1949.)\nAs for his uneasiness about Jan. 6, Levine said he hasn't really seen Trump make any changes that could quell his reservations.

'And once it became clear that there just is no Republican Party that is not led by Donald Trump, I think that forced the decision-making that you're seeing now.'\n'It's not a surprise that Sununu and damn near all but donors, and most every Republican elected official, is eventually gonna come home and support him this year, just like they have previously,' says Joe Walsh, the former tea party congressman who became a Trump apostate and ran against him in 2020. 'Because you don't want to kill your career and kill yourself and you want a seat at the table. So it makes all the sense in the world.'\nAdvertisement\nSununu has stood by his criticisms of Trump, and he assures us that he's not thinking about his seat at the table. 'My career's over. I'm leaving,' says the governor, who plans to enter the private sector after his current term ends. 'I'm not running again. My political career \u2014 I have no political career.' But as a Republican, who likes Republican policies and dislikes Democratic ones, what he really wants is Republicans occupying the seats at the top of administrative agencies \u2014 the Environmental Protection Agency, the Treasury, the Justice Department. If a Republican-led executive branch means putting Trump back in the Oval Office, well \u2026\n'You might vote for Trump,' he said in March, after the Gridiron dinner, 'but that means you're getting a whole package. Congress does very little, even the president ends up doing very little, but the agencies themselves have a huge impact on the lives, very quietly, when it comes to the rules and policies that they implement without congressional approval.'\nLiz Cheney blames the general Republican drift back to Trump on Kevin McCarthy, the former GOP leader who visited Trump's home in Palm Beach for lunch and posed for a photo with him a few weeks after the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n'What we saw happen was this notion that Republican elected officials excused the behavior, enabled the behavior' of Trump, said Cheney, the former Wyoming congresswoman who was essentially booted from Congress by fellow Republicans for criticizing Trump too much, at a talk in Iowa last month. 'And by doing that it created a situation where I think voters thought, \u2018Well, it must not be that he's that dangerous, because if he were, then you would have more people saying so.'' (McCarthy, who's also endorsed Trump, recently explained that visit by saying he just wanted to check up on Trump because 'when something bad happens in your life, everybody abandons you.')\nBut this all really may have started before Jan. 6, says Alyssa Farah Griffin, who worked in Trump's White House and later turned on him.\n'He was smart about consolidating power before he lost the election,' she says. 'He was so entrenched in the RNC, he was so entrenched in the party committees and at the state level, that I think for politicians who care first and foremost about self-preservation, it made it pretty much impossible to walk away from him.'\n'It used to be that Republicans fell in line with whoever the party chose,' Hemmer says. 'And now the party is following the base, and falls in line with whoever the base has fallen in love with.'\nIf Sununu wasn't in love before, he has fallen in line now. And ultimately, he doesn't think his opinion matters that much to voters who are sick of Biden and are considering the Republican nominee.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jes\u00fas Rodr\u00edguez","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H3PWEERWCFC35NZBXER4AYIV24.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.271896,"_id":"a7597cd031c74cbfe4439b45042febd1"},{"title":"Johnson delayed the Ukraine aid vote for months.

It could have been done long ago, when President Biden requested the aid in October, had Johnson simply ignored the histrionics from pro-Putin House members who take their cues from Donald Trump.\nA week \u2026 a month \u2026 six months ago, the vote to deliver critical aid could have prevented countless Ukrainian deaths. Just last week, Russian missiles struck an apartment building in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, killing 17 people and injuring at least 61. That was merely one strike among many Russia has successfully carried out in recent months while Ukraine has been hampered by munitions shortages and inadequate antimissile defenses.\nAdvertisement\nThe delay had serious, widespread consequences for Ukraine. Max Bergmann, a former State Department official and director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia program for the Center for Strategic and International Studies, tells me, 'Their power sector has been decimated by lack of air defense, which will be incredibly costly to repair.' He adds that on the front 'Ukrainians have lost a lot of soldiers because if you don't have artillery you have to hold the line with men.' In other words, Ukraine has 'lost a lot of people simply because we stopped providing them ammo.'\nAmnesty International, tracking one of Russia's many ongoing human rights violations, reported just days before the vote, 'In what may be cumulatively one of Russia's most destructive series of strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, several power facilities were attacked, resulting in further suffering and disruption to Ukrainian civilians.' The organization noted, 'Deliberately attacking civilian infrastructure, such as power stations and electricity supplies, and causing overwhelming harm to civilians is a violation of international humanitarian law.' Count that among the consequences of delayed U.S. aid.\nThe shortages of ammunition and antimissile systems for Ukraine meant Russia paid little price for continued aggression. The American Enterprise Institute's Kori Schake tells me that Ukrainian losses 'can be counted in bodies, in lost territory, in squandered momentum on the battlefield.' Those losses are at least in part attributable to Republicans' dithering.\nFollow this author Jennifer Rubin 's opinions\nFollow this author\nJennifer Rubin\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nAdvertisement\nThe damage, in part, can be quantified. 'We assess that Russian forces seized 583 square kilometers since Oct. 1, 2023, approximately 100 square kilometers more than what the Ukrainian forces liberated during the 2023 counteroffensive,' George Barros, head of the Russia and Geospatial Intelligence teams at the Institute for Study of War, tells me. He adds, 'We continue to assess that material shortages are forcing Ukraine to conserve ammunition and prioritize limited resources to critical sectors of the front, increasing the risk of a Russian breakthrough in other less-well-provisioned sectors and making the front line overall more fragile than the current relatively slow rate of Russian advances makes it appear.'\nGiven Ukraine's ammunition shortages, Barros says, Russia gained 'flexibility in how they conduct offensive operations,' which can lead to 'opportunities for Russian forces to make operationally significant gains in the future.' In particular, the Institute for the Study of War reported on Friday, 'Russian forces recently made confirmed advances near Bakhmut, Avdiivka, and Donetsk City.'\nMoreover, the damage attributable to this U.S. delinquency extends beyond Ukraine. 'The greater loss is that of U.S. credibility, to use that old term,' veteran diplomat Daniel Fried tells me. 'Trumpist Republicans have damaged it and that will not be easy to repair.' He says, 'Some countries may hedge, including in Asia. Russia and China are exploiting this new opportunity. Iran as well, likely.'\nAdvertisement\nThese losses to Ukraine and to U.S. national-security interests were entirely avoidable. Had Johnson simply listened to U.S. intelligence experts or even traveled to Ukraine, as several House and Senate members did, and witnessed the carnage, he would have quickly grasped the urgency of a vote.\nNot until last week did Johnson issue a full-throated defense of Ukraine aid. 'I think Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed,' he told reporters. 'I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys.' He stressed, 'This is a live-fire exercise for me as it is so many American families. This is not a game, this is not a joke.' And yet for months, Republicans let the fire rage; they treated their solemn obligations like a joke.\nAlthough Johnson insisted to Jake Tapper on CNN that Republicans 'know the urgency in Ukraine and in Israel,' they showed no concern for roughly six months for the price Ukraine paid for Republicans' dawdling.

But they were again undercut by their own.","summary":"In early February, congressional Republicans made a conspicuous choice. They decided to kill a bipartisan Senate deal that included tough border security measures. Instead, they pressed forward with what was essentially a messaging exercise: impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\nThe confluence of events was telling. Even by the accounts of several Republicans, their party preferred attacking the Biden administration over the crisis at the border to actually doing something about it.\nTwo months later, Mayorkas's impeachment is dead. The Senate dispatched with the trial quickly Wednesday afternoon shortly after finally receiving a pair of articles of impeachment against Mayorkas from the House.\nIt was predictable that the Democratic-controlled Senate would do this. But Republicans hope it will, at the very least, make Democrats look bad \u2014 as if they aren't interested in holding accountable a man who Republicans say is responsible for the chaotic border.\nAdvertisement\nAnd will it make the Democrats look bad?\nThere is no question the border is a major liability for President Biden. Mayorkas isn't exactly a sympathetic character, either; a recent poll showed that independents dislike him by a 2-to-1 margin.\nBut the GOP's impeachment effort was troubled from the start \u2014 in ways that sharply undercut the claim that Democrats are derelict in shrugging off an impeachment trial. Even many Republicans said Mayorkas's actions weren't impeachable, and the party wound up lacking complete unity in both chambers in historic ways.\nThere was, of course, the remarkable initial vote in which the GOP-controlled House somehow failed to impeach Mayorkas. Three House Republicans voted against it, and a Democrat whom the GOP didn't expect to be present returned to leave the GOP one vote shy. The GOP ultimately succeeded a week later, by one vote.\nAdvertisement\nFast-forward to Wednesday, and the GOP was again unable to keep its membership united. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) moved to vote on whether the articles against Mayorkas were unconstitutional \u2014 basically that they weren't high crimes or misdemeanors, per the Constitution's required standard. On the first article, Mayorkas's alleged 'willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law,' Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) voted 'present.'\nIt appears to be the first time in modern history that a senator from the impeaching party didn't vote with the party against dismissing charges. Republican senators were united in opposing such a motion in the 1999 Bill Clinton impeachment \u2014 even as 10 later voted to acquit Clinton \u2014 and Democratic senators were also united in opposing a motion to dismiss Donald Trump's post-Jan. 6 impeachment charges three years ago.\nSimilarly, it's the first time every senator from the president's party voted to dismiss the charges. A lone Democrat voted against dismissing Clinton's charges in 1999, and five Republicans voted against dismissing Trump's in 2021.\nAdvertisement\nThe handful of GOP defections undersell just how much concern there was about what their party was doing. Several GOP senators who voted against dismissing the charges nonetheless previously labeled the whole thing a waste of time. They said the House hadn't shown Mayorkas actually did anything impeachable. They said Mayorkas was basically just carrying out the administration's policy.\nThose senators can perhaps justify their votes against dismissing the charges by saying the Senate should hold an actual trial if the House impeaches. But it's also evident that such a trial might well have resulted in a remarkable number of defections on the impeaching party's side \u2014 if the GOP senators stayed true to their past comments about Mayorkas.\nAdvertisement\nOf course, the intricacies of Congress \u2014 and whether an alleged offense is technically impeachable or just bad \u2014 are generally of little concern to the American people. So Republicans will point to this as evidence that Democrats aren't taking the border seriously and hope the American people care about it.\nbad \u2014 are generally of little concern to the American people. So Republicans will point to this as evidence that Democrats aren't taking the border seriously and hope the American people care about it.\nWhat we can say right now is that it's not clear Americans care or can be made to care that much. That poll mentioned above, from the Economist and YouGov shortly after Mayorkas's impeachment, showed Americans approved of it 43 percent to 25 percent \u2014 a pretty large margin. And as mentioned, the poll also showed Mayorkas was unpopular.\nBut it also showed 4 in 10 Americans didn't even have an opinion of him \u2014 reflecting how few people were tuning in to the whole thing. And we don't have other good polling on this, in large part because it doesn't seem to have penetrated as a story.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Aaron Blake,Staff Writer","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D45FQKGUNLBNSL5JHORM3ER7ZY.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.230848,"_id":"9534a07c6ac5ecb96c1c1ee754c7d57c"},{"title":"Ukraine, Israel aid back on track as House pushes past hardliners toward weekend vote","author":"Stephen Groves","published_date":"2024-04-19 14:28:58","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/19/house-ukraine-speaker-johnson-mtg/28d93076-fe59-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The House is preparing to push a $95 billion national security aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies closer to passage","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 With rare bipartisan momentum, the House sidelined hard-right conservatives and prepared Friday to push a $95 billion national security aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies over a key procedural hurdle, closer to passage.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson had spent the past 24 hours making the rounds on conservative media working to salvage the wartime funding, particularly for Ukraine as it faces a critical moment battling Russia, but also for his own job as the restless right flank threatens to oust him over the effort.\n'There's a lot of misinformation about what we're doing here and why,' Johnson told the conservative host of The Mark Levin Show.\n'Ukrainians desperately need lethal aid right now. ... We cannot allow Vladimir Putin to roll through another country and take it,' he said about the Russian president's invasion of Ukraine. 'These are very serious matters with global implications.'\nAdvertisement\nAfter months of delay, the House worked slowly but deliberately once Johnson made up his mind this week to plough ahead. President Joe Biden sent a swift endorsement of the speaker's plan and, in a rare moment, Donald Trump, the Republican presumed presidential nominee who opposes most overseas aid for Ukraine, has not derailed the speaker's work.\n'The world is watching what the Congress does,' the White House said in a statement. 'Passing this legislation would send a powerful message about the strength of American leadership at a pivotal moment.'\nIn an extremely rare step, the members of the House Rules Committee joined forces late Thursday in a near midnight vote, the four Democrats giving their support on a procedural step, to push past the Republican majority's three hardline holdouts to send the package to the House floor for debate on a 9-3 vote. It was a moment unseen in recent House memory.\nAdvertisement\nJohnson will need to rely on Democrats again Friday to clear the next procedural vote and turn back amendments Republicans have offered that could kill the package. One from hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene would reduce spending for Ukraine to zero.\nGreene has filed the 'motion to vacate' the speaker from office, and has drawn at least one other Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky as a co-sponsor. It could launch a bid to evict Johnson from the speaker's office, should she call it up for a vote, much the way Republicans booted Kevin McCarthy from the position last fall.\nWith one of the most narrow House majorities in modern times, Johnson can only afford to lose a single vote or two from his Republican ranks to pass any bill. That dynamic has thrust him into the arms of Democrats as he searches for votes to pass the package.\nAdvertisement\nWithout his Republican majority fully behind him, Johnson cannot shape the package as the ultra-conservatives demand lest he lose Democratic backing. It has forced him to leave behind tough security measures to clamp down on migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border and other priorities.\nAt best, Johnson has been able to carve up a Senate-passed version of the bill into separate parts, as is the preference among House Republicans, and the final votes will be on distinct measures \u2014 for Ukraine, Israel and Indo-Pacific allies.\nThe package would also include a fourth provision that includes many Republican priorities that Democrats endorse, or at least are willing to accept. Those include proposals that allow the U.S. to seize frozen Russian central bank assets to rebuild Ukraine; impose sanctions on Iran, Russia, China and criminal organizations that traffic fentanyl, and potentially ban the video app TikTok if its China-based owner doesn't sell its stake within a year.\nAdvertisement\nPassing each bill, in votes expected Saturday, will require Johnson to form complicated bipartisan coalitions on each, with Democrats for example ensuring Ukraine aid is approved, but some left-leaning progressives refusing to back military aid for Israel over the destruction of Gaza.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Lisa Mascaro,Stephen Groves,Kevin Freking","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EZISKPX6LEI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.226272,"_id":"39582bf6fef670ac0154996a1c7ab279"},{"title":"Alabama lawmakers advance bills to ensure Joe Biden is on the state's ballot","author":"Kim Chandler","published_date":"2024-04-17 16:04:55","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/17/alabama-legislature-president-joe-biden-ballot/3b2645a6-fcd4-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Alabama lawmakers have advanced legislation to ensure President Joe Biden will appear on the state's November ballot","summary":"MONTGOMERY, Ala. \u2014 Alabama lawmakers advanced legislation Wednesday to ensure President Joe Biden will appear on the state's November ballot, mirroring accommodations made four years ago for then-President Donald Trump.\nLegislative committees in the Alabama House of Representatives and Senate approved identical bills that would push back the state's certification deadline from 82 days to 74 days before the general election in order to accommodate the date of Democrats' nominating convention.\nThe bills now move to to the full chambers. Alabama has one of the earliest candidate certification deadlines in the country which has caused difficulties for whichever political party has the later convention date that year.\n'We want to make sure every citizen in the state of Alabama has the opportunity to vote for the candidate of his or her choice,' Democratic Sen. Merika Coleman, the sponsor of the Senate bill, told the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nAdvertisement\nThe issue of Biden's ballot access has arisen in Alabama and Ohio as Republican secretaries of state warned that certification deadlines fall before the Democratic National Convention is set to begin on Aug. 19. The Biden campaign has asked the two states to accept provisional certification, arguing that has been done in past elections. The Republican election chiefs have refused, arguing they don't have authority, and will enforce the deadlines.\nDemocrats proposed the two Alabama bills, but the legislation moved out of committee with support from Republicans who hold a lopsided majority in the Alabama Legislature. The bills were approved with little discussion. However, two Republicans who spoke in favor of the bill called it an issue of fairness.\nRepublican Rep. Bob Fincher, chairman of the committee that heard the House bill, said this is 'not the first time we've run into this problem' and the state made allowances.\nAdvertisement\n'I'd like to think that if the shoe was on the other foot, that this would be taken care of. And I think that Alabamians have a deep sense of fairness when it comes to politics and elections,' Republican Sen. Sam Givhan said during the committee meeting.\nTrump faced the same issue in Alabama in 2020. The Republican-controlled Alabama Legislature in 2020 passed legislation to change the certification deadline for the 2020 election. The bill stated that the change was made 'to accommodate the dates of the 2020 Republican National Convention.' However, an attorney representing the Biden campaign and DNC, wrote in a letter to Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen that it was provisional certification that allowed Trump on the ballot in 2020, because there were still problems with the GOP date even with the new 2020 deadline.\nAllen has maintained he does not have the authority to accept provisional certification.\nAdvertisement\nSimilarly, in Ohio, Attorney General Dave Yost and Secretary of State Frank LaRose, both Republicans, rejected a request from Democrats to waive the state's ballot deadline administratively by accepting a 'provisional certification' for Biden.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIn a letter Monday, Yost's office told LaRose that Ohio law does not allow the procedure. LaRose's office conveyed that information, in turn, in a letter to Democratic lawyer Don McTigue. LaRose's chief legal counsel, Paul Disantis, noted it was a Democrats who championed the state's ballot deadline, one of the earliest in the nation, 15 years ago. It falls 90 days before the general election, which this year is Aug. 7.\nOhio Senate Democratic Leader Nickie Antonio said she is waiting to hear from the Democratic National Committee on how to proceed. One of her members, state Sen. Bill DiMora, said he has legislation for either a short- or long-term fix ready to go when the time comes.\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Kim Chandler","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.217882,"_id":"d7c8616392244c65220a7a8a2a8035ed"},{"title":"The House has a bipartisan governing coalition","author":"Leigh Ann Caldwell","published_date":"2024-04-22 10:16:51","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/22/house-has-bipartisan-governing-coalition","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"In today's edition \u2026 What happens next for Ukraine aid \u2026 How Trump has become angrier and more isolated on Truth Social.","summary":"Good morning, Early Birds.

The warning came a few minutes later.\nDePaola, the 64-year-old namesake of DePaola's Bagel and Brunch here in Maryland's conservative Eastern Shore, whispered to a reporter that Hogan better avoid disparaging former President Donald Trump.\n'I'm a Trumper,' DePaola said as Hogan posed for pictures and made small talk with the excited breakfast crowd on a recent Friday morning. 'I think Larry would be better off if he kept how he felt about Trump under his breath.'\nThe brief exchange during a weeks-long bus tour illustrates a stark political reality for the popular Republican former governor, who has single-handedly transformed Maryland's sleepy Senate race into a top-tier contest in the national fight for the Senate majority. Hogan, who was perhaps the most outspoken anti-Trump Republican governor in the nation, can ill afford to lose any pieces of his delicate and diverse political coalition.\nAdvertisement\nHe's hoping to become the first Republican in more than 40 years to win a Senate seat in this deep-blue state, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1 statewide, with much of the Democratic support in Baltimore and the suburbs of Washington. Over the next six months, Hogan will have to fend off political threats from all sides.\nAs Trump loyalists eye the 67-year-old businessman with skepticism, Democrats are counting on abortion rights to make Hogan's historic challenge even harder. But the R after his name may ultimately prove the most serious liability for Hogan in a state Trump lost by 33 points four years ago.\nIf Hogan wins Maryland's open Senate seat, Republicans would almost certainly claim the majority in the U.S. Senate \u2014 and with it, the power to control the agenda and judicial nominations for the next two years, at least.\nAdvertisement\nIn an interview, Hogan confirmed that he would caucus with Republicans in Washington, despite his concerns about Trump's grip on the party. He also vowed not to leave the GOP after the election, even if Trump returns to the White House.\n'I'm a real Republican,' Hogan told The Associated Press, noting that he does not identify with Trump's 'Make America Great Again' movement.\nWhen pressed to explain his concerns about MAGA, and whether he views Trump as a threat to U.S. democracy, Hogan parsed his words carefully.\n'I think certainly there has been some threats,' Hogan said. 'But you know, I think that's not what this campaign is really all about.'\nMeanwhile, Hogan's opponents on the left are only just beginning to organize as Democrats wade through their own nomination process. While Hogan faces token opposition in the GOP, Democrats will pick Hogan's general election opponent next month.\nAdvertisement\nOn Tuesday, a coalition of labor, immigration and progressive groups gathered in the state capital to criticize the former governor for using his veto powers to block legislation to increase abortion access while undermining other Democratic priorities, including health care, environmental protection and education funding.\nThe anti-Hogan event was a reminder that voters in his gubernatorial elections may have been more willing to overlook party affiliation than they will be in a Senate contest that could tilt the balance of power in Washington toward Republicans.\n'Despite him claiming to be a moderate, we know his actions show that he's a staunch Republican,' said 1199 SEIU political director Ricarra Jones, who slammed Hogan's veto of legislation to increase the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour.\nAdvertisement\n'The Senate race in November is bigger than just Maryland,' she continued. 'A Republican-dominated Senate would pursue a drastically different agenda, one that could unwind years of progressive achievements and reshape Maryland's policy landscape in ways that could take generations to reverse.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nMeanwhile, Hogan is trying to avoid divisive political disputes as he reintroduces himself to Maryland voters during a low-profile 'Back to Work' bus tour across the state.\nPerhaps the nation's most vocal anti-Trump Republican governor while in office, Hogan barely mentions Trump's name unless asked about him. He's just as eager to ignore abortion, even though Maryland is among the states that will vote on an abortion referendum this fall \u2014 a winning issue for Democrats in red and blue states alike where ballot questions have appeared since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022.\nAdvertisement\nDemocrats suggest he would support a federal abortion ban, but Hogan insisted in an interview that he would not.\nHe also said he strongly supports in-vitro fertilization and would introduce legislation to protect the practice, an apparent attempt to clarify his position after he declined to say in an Axios interview last month whether he would support such federal protections.\nHe also said he 'would consider voting for' a Maryland ballot measure this fall that would preserve abortion rights, although he argues that it's unnecessary.\nHogan said abortion doesn't comes up much on the campaign trail. He predicted it wouldn't be 'a deciding issue' in the election.\nAsked about the issues that matter most to him, Hogan said he's most focused on ending the divisiveness in Washington, followed by the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, crime and the economy.\nAdvertisement\nBut Hogan largely avoided talking politics at all on his weekend bus tour, preferring to connect with voters on a personal level. He was eager to jump behind restaurant counters to chat with the kitchen staff or pose for pictures welcoming small business owners. And voters, regardless of their party affiliation, embraced him enthusiastically at nearly every stop.\nLanda Mitchell, a 46-year-old old African American woman from Hanover, Maryland, flagged down the governor as he toured small business booths at a weekend boat show. She had met him years ago at a fundraiser for the homeless.\nMitchell said she's not a Republican, but she'd likely vote for Hogan.\n'He's not far right wing. He's over there, but he's not far far over there,' Mitchell said with a laugh, adding that she's not sure whether she'll support President Joe Biden this fall because of the state of the economy. 'I'm far from a Trump supporter, but I go into the grocery store today and I cry.'\nAdvertisement\nCaroline County Sheriff Donald Baker, who welcomed Hogan on a tour through his office, said he also appreciates the former governor's strong support for law enforcement, noting that the sheriff's office didn't get a single applicant for a recent job posting.\n'It's gonna be a tough road for him to navigate,' Baker said of Hogan's political challenge. 'If anybody can do it, I believe Larry Hogan can do it. Why? Because he is a middle-of-the-road kind of guy. He knows how to work with people.'\nAnd as Democrats fight to link him to Trump's Republican Party, Hogan will take pains to distance himself from Trump \u2014 but not too far.\n'We don't want to alienate Trump voters,' Hogan told the AP. 'We need Trump voters. And we need a lot of Biden voters. Maryland is tough.'\nBut he doesn't expect Trump or any other MAGA celebrities to campaign in Maryland on his behalf in the coming months. He said he's not sure if he'll even attend this summer's Republican National Convention, where Trump will formally become the GOP presidential nominee; Hogan skipped Trump's last two nominating conventions as well.\n'I don't think Trump would help me at all. I ran 46 points ahead of him,' Hogan said, noting that Trump lost Maryland in 2020 by a bigger margin than any other state in the nation. 'I don't think he needs to campaign in Maryland.'\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brian Witte,Steve Peoples","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XOXDTUH4OEI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.192073,"_id":"de1c62eb78be15b75d6ab364c61b7173"},{"title":"Hogan and GOP cast his Senate candidacy as \u2018a voice of common sense'","author":"Erin Cox","published_date":"2024-04-17 10:00:07","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/04/17/maryland-senate-hogan-ad","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"A nearly $1 million ad buy launches Wednesday, paid for in part by the National Republican Senatorial Campaign, which recruited Hogan to the race.","summary":"Former Maryland governor Larry Hogan is launching a nearly $1 million television ad campaign Wednesday, half bankrolled by national Republicans eager to flip the deep-blue state's open Senate seat red.\nA month before primary voters determine whom he faces in November, Hogan's early money tries to build on the brand he established as a pragmatic, two-term Republican governor who had no choice but to work with state Democrats.\nThe balance of power in the Senate hangs on a handful of races, Maryland's among them \u2014 even though a Republican has not represented Maryland in the Senate since 1987.

T.J. Shope and Shawnna Bolick sided with 14 Democrats in the Senate on Wednesday in changing rules to let a repeal proposal advance after the deadline for hearing bills had passed. Proponents say the Senate could vote on the repeal as early as May 1.\nIf the proposed repeal wins final approval from the Republican-controlled Legislature and is signed into law by Democratic Gov.

While that's been true for months, tensions have been particularly acute this week: The conflict itself escalated with Israel striking targets in Iran late Thursday, while protests against Israel's military action in Gaza led to a tumultuous scene at New York's Columbia University.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nIt's worth stepping back from the extreme manifestations of the debate and, instead, considering how Americans broadly view the conflict. Recent polling offers insights: Americans are more likely to say they sympathize with the Israeli people than they are to say the same of the Palestinian people, but they've also grown more skeptical of the Israeli military effort. Most Americans say humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza should be maintained or increased; a third say that military aid to Israel should be decreased.\nGallup asked Americans their view of the Israeli action in November and last month. Half of respondents said they supported the action five months ago; now fewer than 4 in 10 do. That support is heavily concentrated among Republicans, two-thirds of whom approve of the military action. Even among Republicans, though, that support has fallen since November.\nMeanwhile, polling from YouGov in November and this month shows that support for a cease-fire has increased, albeit subtly. About two-thirds of Americans say they support a cease-fire at least somewhat, and just under half of them strongly support one. More than three-quarters of Democrats say they support a cease-fire at least somewhat; so do a majority of Republicans.\nThe recent YouGov poll, conducted for the Economist, also asked whether military aid to Israel and humanitarian aid to Palestinians should be increased or decreased. A plurality of respondents said humanitarian aid should be increased; a plurality also said that military aid should be decreased. There's a wide partisan split here, too, with Republicans diverging from both Democrats and independents in their views.\nA CBS News poll conducted by YouGov and published over the weekend considered the question of how the United States should react if Iran struck Israel \u2014 which it subsequently did. The poll showed plurality support for standing by Israel without taking direct military action, the position adopted by the Biden administration. Here again Republicans were more aggressive, with a third supporting direct U.S. action against Iran. Only a quarter of respondents overall took that position.\nThat CBS poll also posed several questions meant to gauge support for possible actions by the U.S. government. Three options had the support of at least 6 in 10 respondents: sending humanitarian aid to Israelis and Palestinians and fostering a diplomatic resolution. Only among Republicans was there more support for providing weapons to Israel than providing humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza.\nYouGov polling has also tracked where American sympathies lie in the conflict. Both in October polling, conducted soon after the brutal attack by Hamas that triggered Israel's military action, and this month, more respondents said they sympathized with Israelis than Palestinians. Since October, though, those sympathies have shifted toward the Palestinians, most significantly among Democrats. Republicans overwhelmingly side with the Israeli people.\nWhen respondents were asked to indicate their level of sympathy for each side, Israelis again engendered more sympathy overall. Democrats were more likely to say they sympathized strongly or at least somewhat with the Palestinian people than they were to say the same of the Israeli people, though three-quarters offered at least some sympathy for the Israeli people. Among Republicans, about half offered at least some sympathy for the Palestinian people.\nThe partisan divides apparent above are inextricable from what's unfolding in response to the war. This week, the president of Columbia University appeared before a House Republican-led committee on Capitol Hill focused on antisemitism at the school. When the school subsequently called in police to dislodge pro-Palestinian protesters conducting a sit-in on campus, the political right praised the move.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Philip Bump,National Columnist","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MZCA2VD7UBR52ZDF3ZU7DBPLPQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.1678433,"_id":"0114014e8245c3ca6e0f4bc3c440759c"},{"title":"House leaders toil to advance Ukraine and Israel aid.

As the Republican speaker faced an outright rebellion from his right flank and growing threats for his ouster, it became clear that House Democrat Leader Hakeem Jeffries would have to lend help to Johnson every step of the way.\n'This is a very important message we are going to send to the world this week, and I'm anxious to get it done,' Johnson said earlier Wednesday announcing his strategy.\nAdvertisement\nThe growing momentum for a bipartisanship dynamic, a rarity in the deeply divided Congress, brought rare scenes of Republicans and Democrats working together to assert U.S. standing on the global stage and help American allies. But it also sent Johnson's House Republican majority into fresh rounds of chaos.\nJohnson's Republican leadership team, seizing on the opportunity to outflank hardline conservatives with Democratic support, raised the idea of quickly changing the procedural rules to make it harder to oust the speaker from office.\nThe idea being floated would be to tuck a rules change into the emerging national security package that would raise the threshold on the so-called 'motion to vacate' vote that right now can be called by any single lawmaker to remove the speaker.\nUltra-conservatives reacted with fury, angrily confronting Johnson on the House floor in a tense scene.\nAdvertisement\n'If he wants to change the motion to vacate, he needs to come before Republican conference that elected him and tell us of his intentions,' said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a top ally of Donald Trump, who is leading the campaign to oust him.\nGreene said if Johnson goes through with his plan, 'he's going to prove exactly what I've been saying is correct: He is the Democrat speaker.'\nFollowing the exchange with Johnson on the House floor, Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican who instigated the ouster of Rep. Kevin McCarthy as speaker last year but has so far refrained from joining Greene's effort, said it was pushing him towards also wanting Johnson out as speaker.\n'It's my red line now,' added Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Colorado Republican. 'I told him there's nothing that will get you to a motion to vacate faster than changing the threshold.'\nAdvertisement\nAt the same time, one floor above the turmoil in the House chamber a rare image of bipartisan statesmanship was on display as the procedural Rules committee began debate launching the steps needed to push the foreign aid package forward toward weekend voting.\nThe Republican chairmen of the powerful Appropriations and Foreign Affairs committees alongside their top Democratic counterparts spoke in evocative language, some drawing on World War II history, to make the case for ensuring the U.S. stand with its allies against aggressors.\nChairman Michael McCaul of the Foreign Affairs Committee cast this as a 'pivotal' time in world history, comparing the current images of people fleeing the conflict in Europe to the situation in 1939 as Hitler's Germany rose to power.\n'Time is not on our side,' he told the panel.\nAdvertisement\nThe top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Greg Meeks of New York, followed through on McCaul's urgency: 'The camera of history is rolling.'\nJohnson is trying to advance a complex plan to hold individual votes this weekend on the funds for Ukraine, Israel and allies in the Asia-Pacific, then stitch the package back together.\nThe package would also include legislation that allows the U.S. to seize frozen Russian central bank assets to rebuild Ukraine; impose sanctions on Iran, Russia, China and criminal organizations that traffic fentanyl; and potentially ban the video app TikTok if its China-based owner doesn't sell its stake within a year.\nWhile Johnson is trying to remain close to Trump, and positioning the national security package as a way to assert U.S. strength in the world in the mold of Ronald Reagan-era Republicans, that puts the speaker politically at odds with the anti-interventionists powering the former president's bid to return to the White House.\nAdvertisement\nEarlier, behind closed doors, Democratic leaders huddled with their caucus to discuss the foreign aid package and the extent to which they would help advance it through the procedural maneuvers in the Rules committee to bring it to the floor.\nDemocratic Whip Rep. Katherine Clark told reporters after the meeting that Democrats were 'open to helping.'\n'This is a moment in history where we need to ensure that at long last we are bringing this critical aid to Ukraine to the floor,' she said.\nRarely, if ever, does the minority party help the majority through the procedural hoops, particularly at the House Rules committee or during the various floor votes before final passage. It would be a level of bipartisanship unseen in this Congress, even as Republican leaders watched their own priority bills defeated on procedural votes by their own members.\nAdvertisement\nBut given the high stakes of the moment for Ukraine, Israel and other allies, and the inability of Johnson to marshal enough Republican support, the speaker will have no other choice if he intends to see the national security package to passage.\nYet Democrats were also trying to apply maximum leverage as Johnson's job comes under threat.\nPrivately, Clark advised rank and file lawmakers not to divulge their positions on whether they would vote to help defeat a motion to vacate Johnson as speaker, though a handful of Democrats have already publicly said they would likely do so.\n'Do not box yourself in with a public statement,' Clark told them according to a person familiar with the remarks.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Lisa Mascaro,Stephen Groves,Kevin Freking","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PHUP26X5WQI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.164345,"_id":"cace974fb9d0c6b96332de6d01a27cfd"},{"title":"One poll question summarizes eight years of Donald Trump","author":"Philip Bump","published_date":"2024-04-15 14:16:40","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/15/poll-ukraine-news-trump-honesty","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Asked who they trust for information about Ukraine, Republicans were most likely to point to the former president.","summary":"One presentation of the rise of Donald Trump focuses on the anti-establishment backlash that the Republican Party experienced during the presidency of Barack Obama. The tea party was one manifestation, and Trump's appearance as a presidential candidate in 2015 did attempt to leverage that frustration with establishment Washington.\nMore important, though, was the overlap between that anti-establishment sentiment and the embrace of outright false claims about political subjects. Part of the frustration with Republican leaders was that their actions and rhetoric were increasingly divergent from the rhetoric on Fox News and on fringier upstarts like Breitbart. Trump was both unattached to D.C. respectability and immersed in the fringe-right vernacular, and that's what he presented to Republican primary voters.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nThis was the origin of the idea that Trump speaks frankly while others don't. It wasn't that he was honest; far from it. It was that he said the things that his supporters were hearing from (dishonest) actors elsewhere because he didn't care about being seen as dishonest. His supporters saw this as unusual honesty, when it was in fact the opposite.\nAdvertisement\nTrump's dishonesty has been relentless ever since, often infecting his allies and his party. But he retains a perception of honesty and frankness among his supporters because they dislike and distrust those pointing out his dishonesty \u2014 his opponents, the media, etc. Trump is granted the benefit of the doubt, despite being perhaps uniquely undeserving of it.\nOver the weekend, CBS News published the results of a poll conducted this month by YouGov. It focused on views of the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, but included a telling question related to the point above.\nRespondents were asked to evaluate whether they viewed different sources of information about the war in Ukraine as trustworthy. Overall, only two sources were viewed as more trustworthy than not: the military/Pentagon and journalists and media operating in the war zone. Every other presented option was underwater, with more people saying they viewed them as untrustworthy than as trustworthy.\nAdvertisement\nIn part, that was because of broad skepticism from independents, who are generally more likely to indicate distrust when asked such questions. Only the military was viewed as more trustworthy than not on net among independents.\nBut it was also because, among Republicans, the only broadly trusted source of information about the war was \u2026 Donald Trump.\nPresident Biden was viewed as trustworthy by four times as many Democrats as deemed him not trustworthy. That was a similar ratio to other sources of information: the military, the State Department, the media. Among Republicans, though, only Trump earned that level of confidence. They were 58 points more likely to say they trusted Trump as a source of information than to say they didn't. The next closest source of information was the military, where the gap was only 20 points.\nAdvertisement\nSome of this is performative, a presentation by Republicans that they agree with Trump and don't agree with others on the specific issue of Ukraine. But, certainly, a substantial amount isn't. If the military says that Ukraine is at risk of being overrun by Russia in the absence of more support, and Trump says this is just neoconservative warmongering, a lot of Republicans are going to nod along with Trump.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBy itself, acceptance of this view of Ukraine is a demonstration of the triumph of Trump's politics. In separate questions, CBS News also asked whether the United States had a responsibility to do something about Ukraine or to defend democracy broadly. That latter idea would have been uncontroversial among Republicans 20 years ago. Now, fewer than half of Republicans say the United States has a global responsibility to defend democracy.\nInterestingly, the support among Democrats for defending Ukraine and democracy comes despite Democrats being more likely to say they don't remember the Cold War \u2014 largely because Democrats skew younger than Republicans.\nAdvertisement\nThe Trumpian resurrection of 'America First' leveraged hostility to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to broadly undermine the idea that the United States should retain its traditional alliances. This idea used to sit mostly on the right-wing fringe, too, but both Afghanistan and Americans' general uninterest in foreign policy made it a valuable position for Trump to embrace. That it also empowers the autocrats he seems to want to befriend and emulate is a reward on its own.\nThat initial CBS News poll question shows the extent to which dishonesty has become embedded in the expectations of Trump's party and his base of support. As was the case after the 2020 election, it can create friction in those places where his world intersects with the real world.\nOn Friday, for example, the judge overseeing his case in New York chastised Trump's attorneys.\nAdvertisement\nHe felt compelled, New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan wrote, to express his 'continuing and growing alarm over counsel's practice of making serious allegations and representations that have no apparent basis in fact \u2014 or at least are unsupported by a legitimate basis of knowledge.'\nWell, Trump's attorneys have to translate Trump's dishonest presentations into something palatable for the American legal system. This is hard to do. It is much easier for Trump to simply immerse in his own dishonesty and pull his supporters in with him.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"National Columnist,Philip Bump","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4F4RQBXEKAES3KPQM7L54II6IU_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.154011,"_id":"231f5bb57a23d4d7644d5616084fd462"},{"title":"Former Trump staffer who said to 'fan the flame' after 2020 loss hired to lead Wisconsin GOP","author":"Scott Bauer","published_date":"2024-04-15 17:07:08","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/15/wisconsin-republican-donald-trump-2020-election/9748ec7a-fb4a-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The director of Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign in Wisconsin who pushed allegations of widespread fraud that were ultimately debunked has been hired to run the Republican Party of Wisconsin heading into the November election","summary":"MADISON, Wis. \u2014 The director of Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign in Wisconsin, who pushed allegations of widespread fraud that were ultimately debunked, has been hired to run the Republican Party of Wisconsin heading into the November election.\nAndrew Iverson will serve as executive director of the Wisconsin GOP as it prepares to host the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July, the state party announced Friday. He takes over for Mark Jefferson, who left in February to serve as executive director of the Tavern League of Wisconsin.\nIverson, a graduate of Wisconsin Lutheran College, most recently worked as regional political director for the Republican National Committee. He previously worked on campaigns in Wisconsin for U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil. In 2020, Iverson was the state director for Trump Victory, a joint operation of the Trump campaign and the RNC.\nAdvertisement\nIt was in that role following Trump's narrow loss in Wisconsin in 2020 that Iverson told other operatives two days after the election to support claims that Trump had actually won. His comments came as Trump's campaign was suing in other battleground states and preparing to request a recount of the two largest Democratic counties in Wisconsin.\nBiden defeated Trump by nearly 21,000 votes in Wisconsin in 2020, a result that has withstood independent and partisan audits and reviews, as well as lawsuits and the recounts Trump requested.\n'Here's the drill: Comms is going to continue to fan the flame and get the word out about Democrats trying to steal this election. We'll do whatever they need (inaudible) help with. Just be on standby in case there's any stunts we need to pull,' Iverson said in the recording of a meeting two days after the November election that was obtained by The Associated Press.\nAdvertisement\nWisconsin was a big part of Trump's victory in 2016, when he smashed through the Democrats' 'Blue Wall' in the Upper Midwest, and his campaign fought hard to keep the swing state in his column four years later before his loss to Biden. Wisconsin is one of a few battleground states this year that could go either way in the rematch between Trump and President Joe Biden.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'At the end of the day, this operation received more votes than any other Republican in Wisconsin history,' Iverson said in the 2020 recording.

There's a lot that people can learn from this campaign.'\nIverson's comments came after Trump sued in other states and before be brought a case in Wisconsin seeking to overturn his loss. The Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected that case in December 2020.\nAdvertisement\nWisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming said in a statement that he was 'thrilled' with the hiring of Iverson.\n'His wide breadth of experience and ability will prove crucial for us winning in November,' Schimming said in a statement. 'Wisconsin will decide the 2024 race. Andrew Iverson is the right man for the job in this pivotal election.'\nIn addition to the presidential race, Wisconsin has a high-profile U.S. Senate race pitting Democratic incumbent Sen.

Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) is among a dying breed in Congress: Of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Donald Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, just Newhouse and one other remain in the chamber.\nIf Trump has his way, that won't be the case much longer.\nThe former president last week endorsed Jerrod Sessler, a conservative Republican who has never held public office but who is once again challenging Newhouse in the race for the 4th District in Washington state.\nIn a post shared on his social media site Truth Social, Trump said Sessler is 'MAGA all the way, and has my complete and total endorsement \u2014 he will never let you down.'\nNewhouse, Trump said, 'has to go.'\nSpeaking to The Washington Post this week, Newhouse declined to comment on Trump's endorsement of his challenger, suggesting only that he expected that the former president would do that. Newhouse, however, remained optimistic that he will prevail in the primary.\nAdvertisement\n'I'm going to win,' he said. 'I'll work as hard as I can.'\nOf the 10 House Republicans who voted with Democrats to impeach Trump after a mob of his supporters broke into the Capitol on Jan. 6, only Newhouse and Rep. David Valadeo (R-Calif.) remain in the House. Valadeo faces a difficult general election in the 22nd District of California \u2014 a district that President Biden won by about 13 points in 2020.\nTrump has long sought revenge against the Republicans who turned against him in the wake of the Capitol attack.\nIn 2022, four of the 10 Republicans \u2014 then-Reps. Tom Rice (S.C.), Jaime Herrera Beutler (Wash.), Liz Cheney (Wyo.) and Peter Meijer (Mich.) \u2014 lost their primary races to challengers from the right.\nFour others \u2014 then-Reps. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), John Katko (N.Y.), Anthony Gonzalez (Ohio) and Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) \u2014 chose to retire. Only Newhouse and Valadao were able to hold on to their seats.\nAdvertisement\nUpton \u2014 who did not run for reelection in 2022 after his Michigan district was redrawn in a way that would've likely pushed him out in the general \u2014 told The Washington Post on Wednesday that he's sure Trump's decision to endorse Newhouse's challenger is 'more vengeance.'\nUpton said that 'everyone had their own reason to vote the way that they did' on Trump's impeachment charges.\n'Some were worried for their own safety. Some said, 'You know, this is what my district would want' versus perhaps what I saw first hand,' he said. 'And some were, frankly, just scared of this bully.'\nNewhouse's district, Washington's 4th, is a solidly red seat. The congressman has easily won reelection there by wide margins since 2014, most recently in 2022, when he defeated his Democratic opponent by 35 points. Trump won the district by 19 points in 2020. These numbers probably make the primary election the de facto general.\nAdvertisement\nIn his endorsement of Sessler, Trump called Newhouse a 'weak and pathetic RINO' \u2014 short for 'Republican in name only.'\nThis is not the first time Sessler, a Navy veteran and businessman, has challenged Newhouse. In 2022, Sessler and five other Republicans tried to unseat Newhouse, a farmer, but Newhouse prevailed. This time, however, Sessler is the only candidate challenging Newhouse in the GOP primary.\nIn a post shared on X after Trump's endorsement, Sessler said, '#Honored.' Online, Sessler often shares messages from some of the most right-wing members of Congress and touts his credentials as a political firebrand.\nIn an interview with The Washington Post last month, Newhouse said that while many of his moderate Republican colleagues in the House are leaving Congress \u2014 citing their conference's inability to collaborate and strike successful legislative deals \u2014 he still has unfinished business in the chamber, and he will not let himself be discouraged from being in office by the more extreme wing of his party.\nAdvertisement\n'I've still got some things I want to accomplish, some issues that are important to me. It is a difficult environment, but it's always hard, it's never easy to get legislation through,' he said. 'One of my biggest priorities is making some positive changes to our agricultural labor laws, and we've been getting we've been making progress. I don't want to leave before that's done.'\nUpton said he is optimistic about his former colleague's chances and said he believes Newhouse is the type of lawmaker who should remain in Congress.\n'He's got an unblemished record. He's honest as the day is long. He's the type of people that voters ought to want in a responsible position like a member of Congress,' Upton said. 'He'll be able to sell that back home. But it's likely going to be a rough couple of months. And it raises questions on the personal side: Is it worth it?'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Mariana Alfaro","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OFTHCNOLGZ5JQLP5A2BDRFDAHI_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.127258,"_id":"aa0a87ee7aee43590cfc33893e2d9b8d"},{"title":"Momentum builds to oust Johnson from House speakership","author":"Marianna Sotomayor","published_date":"2024-04-16 15:53:41","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/16/mike-johnson-house-speaker-ukraine-israel-greene-massie","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"'The motion is going to get called, okay?

Democrats are trying to defend 23 seats in the Senate \u2014 including three held by independents who caucus with Democrats \u2014 while Republicans need to hold just 11. The Democratic Party's task is complicated by the fact that they are all but certain to lose the seat of retiring Sen. Joe Manchin III, a conservative Democrat in deep-red West Virginia\nAdvertisement\nDemocratic groups are pouring resources into Ohio and Montana to help incumbent Sens. Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester defend their seats in states Trump carried in 2016 and 2020. Democrats are also defending their Senate seats in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nevada \u2014 states that are key to the presidential race \u2014 as well as Michigan, where Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow is retiring. Both Michigan and Arizona are open seats.\nThe Senate Leadership Fund, which supports Republicans, posted strong numbers in the first quarter of the year \u2014 raising $26 million, nearly doubling their cash on hand ($59.5 million). But Senate Majority PAC, an independent group associated with Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, outperformed its Republican counterparts \u2014 raising nearly $38.9 million during the quarter and ending the three-month period with $92 million in cash on hand. Senate Majority PAC has reserved $239 million in ads to defend seats in seven states.\nCongressional Republicans have expressed concerns about their ability to hold to the party's slim House majority in November. Those fears have been amplified in recent weeks by Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's threat to try to oust Speaker Mike Johnson over a Ukraine funding dispute, as well as the looming departure of Rep.

That group also spent $400,000 on 'document hosting' fees that are often related to discovery in legal cases. Trump spent more than $55 million on legal fees in 2023, creating a strain on overall fundraising effort as he fights criminal charges in four cases.\nThe Biden campaign announced earlier this month that it raised more than $90 million in March and that broader Biden effort had about $192 million in cash at the end of the month \u2014 more than double what their rivals are holding in their war chest. Reports from some Biden committees, alongside Democratic super PACs, showed the generosity of top Democratic donors such as megadonor James Simons, who gave $2.5 million each to Future Forward super PAC and Senate Majority PAC in the first three months of the year. He was joined by businessman Fred Eychaner, Kenneth and Jennifer Duda, and others in writing seven-figure checks to Future Forward, which raised $20 million in the first quarter of the year and has promised to spend $250 million on ads supporting Biden.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nOne notable donor to Biden's effort was David Ellison, the CEO of Skydance Media, who gave the maximum of $929,600 to the Biden Victory Fund in the first quarter.

Trump is raising money jointly with the Republican National Committee after his contested primary race for the GOP nomination, and has immersed himself in the effort to close the gap with Democrats in recent months. Trump's new joint fundraising committee with the RNC, Trump 47 Committee, brought in $23.6 million, and nearly all of it in the month of March.\nPrior to a Palm Beach fundraiser this month that the Republican National Committee said raised more than $50.5 million, Trump held frequent calls with donors and kept close tabs on which donors had written a check for the maximum of more than $800,000. The money from those checks is divided among Trump's campaign, Save America, the RNC and more than three dozen state party committees.\nTrump's fundraising efforts appear to be paying off. The Trump 47 committee collected checks totaling more than $800,000 from Robert Mercer, the billionaire hedge fund magnate; Linda McMahon, the former professional wrestling executive who served as Trump's head of the Small Business Association; Casino mogul Phil Ruffin; Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, and his wife Suzanne; and Joe Ricketts, who is the founder of TD Ameritrade.\nThe Trump 47 committee collected checks totaling more than $800,000 from Robert Mercer, the billionaire hedge fund magnate; Linda McMahon, the former professional wrestling executive who served as Trump's head of the Small Business Association; Casino mogul Phil Ruffin; Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, and his wife Suzanne; and Joe Ricketts, who is the founder of TD Ameritrade.\nSenate GOP self-funded candidates spend big\nThough some Democratic incumbents posted an impressive total in hotly contested Senate races, Republicans have fielded several wealthy candidates who can fund their own campaigns including Tim Sheehy in Montana and Eric Hovde in Wisconsin, both of whom are backed by Trump.\nAdvertisement\nHovde, a banking executive who is challenging Baldwin, reported Monday that he had raised $9 million in the first quarter of this year \u2014 including $8 million that he loaned to himself. At the end of March, he reported $5.35 million in cash to Baldwin's more than $10 million. Baldwin raised $5.4 million over the first three months of the year and spent $3.1 million.\nTim Sheehy, the former Navy SEAL challenging Tester in Montana, loaned another $500,000 to his Senate campaign \u2014 bringing the total that he has loaned to his campaign to $1.45 million so far this cycle. The Republican candidate, who owns an aerial firefighting business, has been at the center of controversy in the Montana race after The Washington Post detailed the inconsistent accounts he has given over the years about his war wounds.\nSheehy reported $1.9 million in cash on hand at the end of the third quarter after raising $3 million and spending about $2.4 million.

Republicans in at least 20 states have sought to limit such initiatives, claiming they are discriminatory and enforce a liberal orthodoxy. Alabama and Utah enacted anti-DEI laws this year, and a ban enacted in Texas last year has led to more than 100 job cuts on University of Texas campuses.\nAdvertisement\nIn Kentucky, the issue generated contentious debates when the Senate and House passed different versions of anti-DEI bills. Opponents warned that proposed restrictions on campuses could roll back gains in minority enrollments and stifle campus discussions about past discrimination.\nState Sen. Gerald Neal, the top-ranking Democrat, said Tuesday that anti-DEI efforts were 'a shameless attempt to reverse the progress that our commonwealth has made.'\nWilson, who is the Senate majority whip, sponsored the bill passed by chamber Republicans in February. It would have prohibited 'discriminatory concepts' in non-classroom settings, such as training sessions and orientations, and would have barred schools from providing preferential treatment based on a person's political ideology. It also would have prohibited requiring people to state specific ideologies or beliefs when seeking admission, employment or promotions.\nAdvertisement\nAbout a month later, the House stripped away the Senate's language and inserted a replacement that took a tougher stance by also defunding DEI offices and officer positions. Wilson's original bill didn't call for dismantling those offices.\nSenate Republicans had concerns about portions of the House version, Wilson said Tuesday without offering specifics. Both versions died when the legislative session ended Monday night.\nDemocratic Gov. Andy Beshear denounced anti-DEI efforts last month while commemorating the 60th anniversary of a landmark civil-rights rally in Frankfort, the state's capital city.\n'DEI is not a four-letter word,' Beshear said.

In reality, there are profoundly dissonant chords in the democracy chorus.\nStart with the seemingly good news: A New York Times/Sienna poll from fall 2022, for example, found that 71 percent of Americans agreed that 'democracy is currently under threat.' There was hardly a wisp of difference across party lines: 74 percent of Democrats agreed, but so did 72 percent of Republicans and 71 percent of independents. Kumbaya, my lord!\nSuch data has encouraged conservatives to dismiss the effort of Democrats, starting with President Biden, to insist that in the 2024 election, 'democracy is on the ballot.' The Wall Street Journal's Holman W. Jenkins Jr., for instance, recently referenced a February NBC News poll showing Biden and Donald Trump essentially tied on the issue of who would best protect democracy \u2014 43 percent of voters preferred Biden, 41 percent picked the former president. He concluded, 'pollsters find Trump voters every bit as concerned about democracy as Biden voters.'\nAdvertisement\nIf only that were true. In reality, only on one side of politics is democracy a voting issue, and the other would render our system less democratic by making it harder for voters to cast ballots.\nThat Times/Sienna poll was instructive here. It asked voters what concerned them more about elections: 'that some people will cast votes illegally' or that 'some eligible voters won't have a fair chance to vote.'\nThe country split right down the middle: 46 percent worried about illegal voting, 48 percent about voter suppression. That's because partisans were entirely at odds: 82 percent of Republicans were more concerned about voters casting illegal ballots while 76 percent of Democrats were more concerned about voters not getting a fair chance to vote.\nThis divide has led to radically different voting policies, state by state, depending on which party holds sway. The Post's Patrick Marley reported that in Michigan, controlled by Democrats, voting will be easier in 2024 than it was in 2020, whereas North Carolina, where Republicans hold a veto-proof legislative majority, has erected new barriers to the ballot box.\nAdvertisement\nAnd during his recent pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago to earn kudos from Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) pitched a federal bill to require proof of citizenship from those who would register to vote. Since Trump believes that any election he loses must have been rigged, Johnson's effort must have warmed the former president's heart.\nFollow this author E.J. Dionne Jr. 's opinions\nFollow this author\nE.J. Dionne Jr.\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nThis is not some honest disagreement about whether voting should be easier or harder. New barriers to voting and voter purges are being rationalized to solve problems that don't exist because there is no evidence \u2014 zip \u2014 that fraud is a problem in our system.\nNoncitizen voting in federal and state elections is already illegal everywhere, and studies by the Brennan Center for Justice concluded that 'votes by non-citizens account for between 0.0003 percent and 0.001 percent of all votes cast.' A separate Brennan Center report estimated incident rates for overall voter fraud between 0.0003 percent and 0.0025 percent.\nAdvertisement\nWhen someone offers policy changes based on claims devoid of any factual support, it's fair to suspect that something other than solving a real problem is motivating their proposals. On this, the Times/Sienna poll provided an important clue: It found that while 95 percent of Democrats said Biden was the 'legitimate winner' in 2020, only 31 percent of Republicans said this. Their objection is to the outcome, not the process.\nBear in mind that the voting changes introduced to make it easier to vote during the pandemic \u2014 simpler early and mail voting, widely available ballot drop boxes and the like \u2014 produced by far the largest numerical turnout in our history. Holding a successful election in a health crisis was a great victory for democracy and, by the way, the emergency reforms helped Trump get 11.2 million more votes in 2020 than he got in 2016. Yet Republicans seem eager to roll back participation.\nThe acid test of whether both sides are equally concerned about an issue is the degree to which it motivates their respective electoral coalitions. And here, the data is unambiguous: Democracy is a core concern for Democrats in a way it is not for Republicans. It's not even close.\nAdvertisement\nIn a March Quinnipiac poll, voters who listed preserving democracy as the most urgent issue facing the country favored Biden over Trump in a head-to-head matchup by 85 percent to 12 percent. That's because 32 percent of Democrats listed preserving democracy as the campaign's most important issue; only 5 percent of Republicans did.\nIn his book 'Democracy and Its Critics,' the legendary political scientist Robert A. Dahl argued that democracy was inspired by 'the vision of people governing themselves as political equals, and possessing all the resources and institutions necessary to do so.' Tearing down barriers to participation is more consistent with this goal than erecting them.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"E.J.

Kennedy Jr. taking more votes from Trump than Biden. And they're not the only polls to suggest a changing dynamic.","summary":"It's been something approaching an article of faith on the left and in some corners of the media that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. poses a spoiler threat to President Biden's reelection.\nIt's never been quite clear that'll be the case, though, particularly given that Kennedy is much more popular among Republicans than Democrats.\nAnd now, there are growing signs that Kennedy and his fellow third-party candidates might not cost Biden after all. Indeed, they \u2014 and particularly Kennedy \u2014 could actually pull more from Trump.\nTwo new high-quality polls since Sunday bear this out.\nThe latest is from Marist College on Monday. It shows Biden at 51 percent and Trump at 48 percent in a national head-to-head contest. But when you factor in third-party candidates \u2014 Kennedy, Green Party candidate Jill Stein and independent Cornel West \u2014 Biden's lead goes to five percentage points, larger than the poll's 3.6-point margin of error.\nAdvertisement\nMarist has long been one of Biden's better polls. But that's his best showing in a high-quality poll for many months.\nAn NBC News poll Sunday showed a similar dynamic. While Biden trailed by two points head to head (44-46), he led by two points (39-37) when the question included the third-party candidates.\nBoth NBC results are within the margin of error, but the key here is the four-point shift toward Biden when you include third-party candidates. That's something we really haven't seen before.\nAnd a big reason for the shift is Kennedy. He takes twice as much of his support from voters who had previously picked Trump in the head-to-head question (15 percent of those voters) than those who had picked Biden (7 percent). Biden cedes more votes than Trump to Stein, but Kennedy is a larger factor given that he's been pulling more votes throughout the race.\nAdvertisement\n(That poll is also merely the latest to show Kennedy's image among right-leaning voters is vastly superior to his image among left-leaning ones. While Republicans like him 40 percent to 15 percent \u2014 a plus-25 split \u2014 Democrats dislike him 53-16 \u2014 a negative-37 split.)\ndislike him 53-16 \u2014 a negative-37 split.)\nThe Marist poll shows Kennedy pulling only slightly more from actual Republicans (10 percent) than Democrats (8 percent). But it suggests he's pulling more from Trump-leaning independents.\nWhile Biden and Trump are tied at 49 percent among independents in the head-to-head, Biden leads 34-30 among independents when you include third-party candidates.\nAs in the NBC poll, Kennedy pulls more from Trump head-to-head voters (17 percent) than Biden voters (11 percent).\nWhile these are perhaps the most compelling recent polls to suggest Kennedy and the broader third-party impact aren't hurting and could even help Biden, they're not the only ones:\nAdvertisement\nAll of it paints a picture of a dynamic situation with the third-party candidates.\nBiden has probably suffered more among them in the past because Democrats are less enthusiastic about his candidacy than Republicans are about Trump's. In addition, both Stein and West are clearly to Biden's political left, and Kennedy at the very least has a name that could resonate with more casual left-leaning independents.\nBut what generally happens as a general election proceeds is that voters gravitate toward the two major-party candidates because they actually have a shot at winning, and third-party candidates fade.\nPerhaps what we're starting to see is voters who don't like Trump migrating from flirting with third-party candidates to going for Biden. Perhaps Kennedy's far superior image among right-leaning voters or his tendency toward Republican-friendly conspiracy theories is starting to register.

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia force a vote seeking his ouster","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Some Democrats are entertaining the prospect of coming to House Speaker Mike Johnson's rescue should Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., force a vote seeking his ouster, though it will likely depend on his ability to deliver an emergency aid package focused on Ukraine and Israel.\nDemocratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has suggested that Democrats would help Johnson if the speaker faced retribution from within his own party for holding votes on the $95.3 billion package. But he's also encouraging his colleagues to take a wait-and-see approach to apply maximum leverage.\n'Do not box yourself in with a public statement,' Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark, the No. 2-ranking House Democratic leader, told colleagues in a closed-door session Thursday, according to a person familiar with the private remarks.\nAdvertisement\nStill, Johnson's future been a much discussed topic on Capitol Hill \u2014 even more so after Republican leadership on Thursday floated the possibility of changing the House rules to make it easier for a speaker to withstand a challenge from members of their own party. With or without the rule change, Johnson may need Democratic support to remain as speaker if Greene or someone else forces a vote.\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., said if the aid package makes it over the finish line, 'I think a lot of people are not going to want to punish him for doing the right thing.'\nGreene has threatened to try to oust Johnson and warned that advancing funding for Ukraine would help build her case that GOP lawmakers should select a new speaker. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., tweeted this week that he told Johnson during a closed-door Republican conference meeting that he would be co-sponsoring Greene's motion. Massie suggested Johnson 'should pre-announce his resignation' and give Republicans time to select a successor.\nAdvertisement\nThe vast majority of Republicans are distancing themselves from Greene's effort, wary of repeating the chaos the House endured last fall when eight Republicans joined with Democrats in removing then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., from the post. It's likely that Johnson would not need a large number of Democratic lawmakers to help him remain in the speaker's office, but it would depend on how many Republicans voted to remove him.\nRep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., said that if Johnson would put the Senate-passed measure on the floor, 'I would do what I had to do to make sure he does not lose his job for that.' Johnson made the decision to take the Senate measure and break it into three separate bills. He's also added a fourth bill focused on national security priorities.\nBreaking up the package into parts gives lawmakers the ability to vote against military assistance to Ukraine or Israel without tanking the entire measure.\nAdvertisement\nJohnson said he has not asked a single Democrat to 'get involved in that at all' when asked about a possible motion to vacate.\n'I do not spend time walking around thinking about the motion to vacate,' Johnson said. 'I have a job to do here and I'm going to do the job, regardless of personal consequences.'\nRep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., said he would consider voting present during a speaker vote if Johnson allowed the Ukraine aid to be voted on.\n'Why in the world would I want to go along with Marjorie Taylor Greene if Mike Johnson just gave us a vote I've been advocating for for more than six months?' Boyle said. 'I think a number of Democrats would be in the same position \u2014 not necessarily a vote for him, but just make clear this is a Republican issue and we're not going to aid and abet Marjorie Taylor Greene to cause even more chaos.'\nAdvertisement\n'I hope he will have some sort of conversation with Hakeem, but either way, yes, I'm one of those who would save him if we can do Israel, Taiwan, Ukraine and some reasonable border security,' said Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas.\nOther Democrats said helping Johnson must come as part of a package deal. They said he shouldn't expect Democratic support just by putting the Senate-passed package up for a vote. He'll need to have coordinated with Jeffries as well.\n'We're just not going to go and bail out one of the most conservative Republican speakers in American history. But what Kevin McCarthy failed to do is even entertain a conversation to try to make a deal. Democrats were ready to deal. Kevin McCarthy refused to,' said Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass. 'If Speaker Johnson cares about doing the right thing as well as keeping his job, then he ought to make a deal with Democrats.'\nAdvertisement\nRep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., said there is a 'powerful instinct' among Democrats that it's not their job to rescue Johnson from the chaos in his party. But he's willing to help Johnson on the motion to vacate if he were to 'do the right thing' on the aid package and coordinate that with Jeffries.\n'I will defer to getting things done as opposed to tying myself up in partisan knots, but it's going to be Hakeem who decides how we act,' Himes said. 'We're not going to let the Republicans sort of chip off a number of us. This will be negotiated with our leadership.'\nRep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, said he's unlikely to help Johnson and is not sure how long the speaker would be around anyway if he has to rely on Democratic votes to continue on the job.\n'I've listened to what Mr. Jeffries said and I won't rule it out, but I'm inclined to vote as I normally would. I am very concerned about how long he's delayed Ukraine. We count the days. They count the lives lost,' Doggett said.\nAdvertisement\nAnd then there are scores of Democrats who are in the hard 'no' camp.\nRep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., for example, said there was no way he would vote to keep Johnson as speaker.\n'I think his worldview is very dangerous. I think there's no scenario where I'm going to reward someone like that, who allows this level of chaos to happen in the House.'\nAnd Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., also is a hard no on helping Johnson, calling it a well-intentioned idea that is fundamentally flawed.\n'Bad on guns, bad on gays, bad on abortion and bad on voting rights,' Connolly said. 'He litigated the overturning of the (2020) election. He didn't just vote the wrong way. He signed up for a lawsuit. That's who you want to save? Go home and explain that to Democrats.'\nMassie warned that if Democrats help Johnson stay on a speaker, 'they would doom him, they won't save him.'\n'It's not a stable situation if a Republican speaker is speaker only by virtue of Democrats fighting for him,' Massie said.\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Kevin Freking","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IDLXVIX5XEI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.928736,"_id":"e2e5929b0e352984e7f8687f07ac4f56"},{"title":"New Black congressional district in Louisiana bows to politics, not race, backers say","author":"Kevin Mcgill","published_date":"2024-04-18 04:20:57","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/18/louisiana-majority-black-congressional-district/0da5ab5a-fd3b-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Louisiana is awaiting a decision from three federal judges that could affect the balance of power in Congress \u2014 and the fortunes of two prominent state politicians","summary":"NEW ORLEANS \u2014 Politics and race are both factors in a pending court challenge of Louisiana's new congressional maps. How much weight each carries is a major question before three federal judges whose ruling could affect the balance of power in the next Congress.\nAt issue is a congressional map that was approved this year with the backing of the state's new governor, Jeff Landry \u2014 to the consternation of at least some of his fellow Republicans.\nThe map creates a new mostly Black congressional district in Louisiana, at the expense of a white Republican incumbent, Rep. Garret Graves, who backed another Republican in the governor's election last fall. Given voting patterns in Louisiana, a mostly Black district would be more likely to send a Democrat to Congress.\nTwelve self-described non-African American voters argued in a lawsuit that the new mostly Black district constitutes illegal 'textbook racial gerrymandering.'\nAdvertisement\nNot so, argue the new map's backers. Politics, they argue, was the major influence in drawing the new district boundary lines. They say the new map protects most incumbents and draws together Black populations in a way that will comply with the federal Voting Rights Act, giving Louisiana, which is roughly one-third Black, a second majority Black district among six.\nThey also pointed to Republican backers of the plan, who said during legislative debates in January that they wanted to safeguard four GOP-held House districts, including those of House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise.\nThat the new map put Graves in political peril by placing him in the new mostly Black district is further evidence race wasn't the sole motivating factor, the map's backers said in briefs and in testimony last week at a hearing in Shreveport.\nAdvertisement\n'We all know that one of the main reasons it was drawn the way it was, was because Gov. Jeff Landry wants to get rid of Congressman Graves,' state Rep. Mandie Landry, a New Orleans Democrat who testified at the hearing, said in a social media post. Landry is no relation to the governor.\nState Sen. Cleo Fields, a Black Democrat from the Baton Rouge area who served in Congress in the 1990s, has already declared his candidacy in the newly configured district.\nWhatever the three judges decide will likely be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. It's unclear when the judges will rule, but time is growing short. State election officials say they need to know the configuration of the districts by May 15 to prepare for the fall elections.\nThe controversy in Louisiana, as in other states, arose because new government district boundary lines are redrawn by legislatures every 10 years to account for population shifts reflected in census data. Louisiana's Republican-dominated Legislature drew a new map in 2022 that, despite some boundary shifts, was favorable to all six current incumbents: five white Republicans and a Black Democrat. Then-Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, vetoed the map but the majority-Republican Legislature overrode the veto, leading to a court challenge filed in Baton Rouge.\nAdvertisement\nIn June 2022, Baton Rouge-based U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick issued an injunction against the map, saying challengers would likely win their suit claiming it violated the Voting Rights Act. As the case was appealed, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an unexpected ruling in June that favored Black voters in a congressional redistricting case in Alabama.\nDick sided with challengers who said the 2022 map packed a significant number of voters in one district \u2014 District 2 which stretches from New Orleans to the Baton Rouge area \u2014 while 'cracking' the remaining Black population by apportioning it to other mostly white districts.\nIn November, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals gave the state a January deadline for drawing a new congressional district. Landry, who was the state's attorney general when he was elected to succeed the term-limited Edwards, called a special session to redraw the map, saying the Legislature should do it rather than a federal judge.\nAdvertisement\nThe new map does not resemble the sample maps that supporters of a new majority Black district had suggested earlier, which would have created a new district largely covering the northeastern part of the state.\nThe new mostly Black district crosses the state diagonally, linking Shreveport in the northwest to parts of the Baton Rouge area in the southeast. And while its backers hail the creation of a new majority Black district, the plaintiffs say it results in 'explicit, racial segregation of voters.'\nThe judges hearing the case are U.S. District Judges David Joseph and Robert Summerhays, both nominated to the court by former President Donald Trump; and Judge Carl Stewart of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, nominated by former Democratic President Bill Clinton.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Kevin Mcgill","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BDYGZMX5HMI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.90641,"_id":"c73ae890fd9ba9b652343e14179525b0"},{"title":"Melania Trump, long absent from campaign, will appear at a Log Cabin Republicans event in Mar-a-Lago","author":"Stephany Matat","published_date":"2024-04-20 04:21:29","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/20/melania-trump-log-cabin-republicans-maralago-fundraiser/75deba3e-fecd-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Former first lady Melania Trump is making a political comeback during the presidential campaign of her husband, former President Donald Trump","summary":"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Former first lady Melania Trump will attend a fundraiser Saturday for the Log Cabin Republicans, an advocacy group for LGBTQ+ members of the GOP, in a rare political appearance after months of being absent from her husband's campaign.\nThe event at the Palm Beach estate she shares with former President Donald Trump will take place behind closed doors. But it will be the first major political event this year for the former first lady.\nMelania Trump had for months not appeared at her husband's campaign events, notably being absent at his victory party on Super Tuesday. Her attendance at the fundraiser \u2014 for a group she has previously supported \u2014 could be a sign that she will ramp up her schedule with several months left before the November election.\nBoth Trumps went together to cast their ballots in the Florida primary last month.

Melania Trump was a special guest and award recipient of the organization's Spirit of Lincoln award in 2021 at a dinner hosted at Mar-a-Lago.\nThe Log Cabin Republicans on Friday posted on X thanking Melania Trump for her message in a Fox News Digital interview.\n'We must unite in our effort to establish a society where equality is the everyday experience of every American,' Melania Trump said in the interview.\nAdvertisement\nIn a 2020 endorsement of the former president for his reelection bid, the Log Cabin Republicans described Trump as having a 'commitment to govern from a place of inclusion.' In this endorsement, the group praised Trump for his 'commitment to end the spread of HIV/AIDS' and his initiative to 'end the criminalization of homosexuality internationally.'\nYet critics often criticize Trump's record on LGBTQ+ issues. During his presidency, he nominated judges for the U.S. Supreme Court, including Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, who were criticized by liberal advocates for LGBTQ+ people.\nTrump also faced national criticism in 2017 when he announced transgender people were barred from military service, when about 15,000 transgender people were enlisted at the time. In 2019, he barred U.S. embassies from displaying the rainbow or pride flag during Pride Month.\nAdvertisement\nThroughout his campaign, Trump has repeatedly mocked transgender people using language of gender identity that LGBTQ+ critics call harmful. He has acted out a young athlete struggling to lift heavy barbells compared with other competitors 'who transitioned.'\nIn campaign speeches he has touted his promise to cut federal funding on schools pushing what he calls 'transgender insanity.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Stephany Matat","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ON5CRDH6ZUI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.844136,"_id":"194ac35d406a6c28fbe824bd66342b0f"},{"title":"Fed-up House Republicans strike back","author":"Theodoric Meyer","published_date":"2024-04-19 10:14:36","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/19/fed-up-house-republicans-strike-back","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"In today's edition \u2026 The first week of Trump's hush money trial comes to a close \u2026 Biden: I'm from Scranton, not Mar-a-Lago.","summary":"Good morning, Early Birds.

But the proceedings may not last long.\nWhile the Senate is obligated to convene a trial under the rules of impeachment once the charges are walked across the Capitol, Democrats are expected to try to dismiss or table the charges before the arguments get underway.\nMajority Democrats have said the GOP case against Mayorkas doesn't rise to the 'high crimes and misdemeanors' laid out as a bar for impeachment in the Constitution, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., likely has enough votes to end the trial immediately if he decides to do so. The proceedings will not begin until Wednesday.\nAdvertisement\nOpening the Senate for the week, Schumer said he wants to 'address this issue as expeditiously as possible.'\n'Impeachment should never be used to settle a policy disagreement,' Schumer said. 'That would set a horrible precedent for the Congress.'\nSenators will be sworn in Wednesday as jurors, turning the chamber into the court of impeachment. The Senate will then issue a summons to Mayorkas to inform him of the charges and ask for a written answer. He will not have to appear in the Senate at any point.\nWhat happens after that is is unclear. Impeachment rules generally allow the Senate to decide how to proceed.\nRepublicans have argued there should be a full trial. As Johnson signed the articles Monday in preparation for sending them across the Capitol, he said Schumer should hold a trial to 'hold those who engineered this crisis to full account.'\nAdvertisement\n'Senator Schumer is the only impediment to delivering accountability for the American people,' Johnson said. 'Pursuant to the Constitution, the House demands a trial.'\nThe House narrowly voted in February to impeach Mayorkas for his handling of the border. House Republicans charged in two articles of impeachment that Mayorkas has not only refused to enforce existing law but also breached the public trust by lying to Congress and saying the border was secure. It was the first time in nearly 150 years a Cabinet secretary was impeached.\nSince then, Johnson has delayed sending the articles to the Senate for weeks while both chambers finished work on government funding legislation and took a two-week recess. Johnson had said he would send them to the Senate last week, but punted again after Senate Republicans said they wanted more time to prepare.\nAdvertisement\nSouth Dakota Sen. John Thune, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, has said the Senate needs to hold a full trial where it can examine the evidence against Mayorkas and come to a final conclusion.\n'This is an absolute debacle at the southern border,' Thune said. 'It is a national security crisis. There needs to be accountability,' he said.\nSchumer could call a vote to table the charges and end the trial as soon as Wednesday. Before a vote to dismiss, though, a group of House managers \u2014 members who act as prosecutors and are appointed by the speaker \u2014 will walk the articles across the Capitol and deliver the impeachment charges to be read on the Senate floor.\nHouse Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green, a Tennessee Republican who is one of the impeachment managers, said earlier this month that he believes Democrats 'have failed to meet the moment when it comes to ending this crisis and resolving the chaos at our borders.'\nAdvertisement\n'Conducting an impeachment trial represents a unique opportunity to correct course,' he said.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nOther impeachment managers appointed by Speaker Johnson are Michael McCaul of Texas, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Ben Cline of Virginia, Andrew Garbarino of New York, Michael Guest of Mississippi, Harriet Hageman of Wyoming, Clay Higgins of Louisiana, Laurel Lee of Florida, August Plfuger of Texas and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.\nAfter the jurors are sworn in, Senate Republicans are likely to try to raise a series of objections if Schumer calls a vote to dismiss or table, an effort to both protest and delay the move. But ultimately they cannot block a dismissal if majority Democrats have the votes.\nWhile most Republicans oppose quick dismissal, some have hinted they could vote with Democrats.\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said last week he wasn't sure what he would do if there were a move to dismiss the trial. 'I think it's virtually certain that there will not be the conviction of someone when the constitutional test has not been met,' he said.\nAdvertisement\nAt the same time, Romney said he wants to at least express his view that 'Mayorkas has done a terrible job, but he's following the direction of the president and has not met the constitutional test of a high crime or misdemeanor.'\nIn any case, Republicans would not be able to win the support of the two-thirds of the Senate that is needed to convict and remove Mayorkas from office. Democrats control the Senate, 51-49, and they appear to be united against the impeachment effort. Not a single House Democrat supported it, either.\nSen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is facing a tough reelection bid in Ohio, called the impeachment trial a 'distraction,' arguing that Republicans should instead support a bipartisan border compromise they scuttled earlier this year.\n'Instead of doing this impeachment \u2014 the first one in 100 years \u2014 why are we not doing a bipartisan border deal?' he said.\nAdvertisement\nIf Democrats are not able to dismiss or table the articles, they could follow the precedent of several impeachment trials for federal judges over the last century and hold a vote to create a trial committee that would investigate the charges. While there is sufficient precedent for this approach, Democrats may prefer to end the process completely, especially in a presidential election year when immigration and border security are top issues.\nIf the Senate were to proceed to an impeachment trial, it would be the third in five years. Democrats impeached former President Donald Trump twice, once over his dealings with Ukraine and a second time in the days after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. The Senate acquitted Trump bothtimes.\nAt a trial, senators would be forced to sit in their seats for the duration, maybe weeks, while the House impeachment managers and lawyers representing Mayorkas make their cases. The Senate is allowed to call witnesses, as well, if it so decides, and can ask questions of both sides after the opening arguments are finished.\nMayorkas told reporters last week he was not focused on the Senate proceedings. In a twist, he'll be testifying about his budget request Tuesday to the same House committee that led the impeachment effort.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"science","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Stephen Groves,Mary Clare Jalonick","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DSRANNH3VEI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.785589,"_id":"1a17573e4b2d80094bacdb33e4ddc13d"},{"title":"Newsom proposes law to help Arizonans get abortions in California","author":"Mariana Alfaro","published_date":"2024-04-21 22:25:16","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/21/gavin-newsom-abortion-arizona","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The emergency legislation the governor is seeking would expedite the licenses of Arizona abortion providers to let them treat their patients in neighboring California.","summary":"California Gov.

And they're fairly skeptical that Trump is getting a fair shake from the prosecutors in the case \u2014 or that the judge and jurors can be impartial in cases involving him.\nStill, half of Americans would consider Trump unfit to serve as president if he is convicted of falsifying business documents to cover up hush money payments to a woman who said he had an affair with her.\nAdvertisement\nWhile a New York jury will decide whether to convict Trump of felony charges, public opinion of the trial proceedings could hurt him politically. The poll suggests a conviction could hurt Trump's campaign. Trump enters a rematch with President Joe Biden as the first presumptive nominee of a major party \u2014 and the first former president \u2014 to be under indictment. A verdict is expected in roughly six weeks, well before the Republican National Convention where he will accept the GOP nomination.\nTrump has made the prosecutions against him a centerpiece of his campaign and argued without evidence that Biden engineered the cases. That argument helped him consolidate GOP support during the Republican primary, but a conviction might influence how many Americans \u2014 including independent voters and people long skeptical of Trump \u2014 perceive his candidacy.\n'Any conviction should disqualify him,' said Callum Schlumpf, a 31-year-old engineering student and political independent from Clifton, Texas.

'I'm no fan of Trump in any way, shape or form. Didn't vote for him, never will. But it's obviously all political.'\nConsistent with AP-NORC polls conducted over the past year, the new poll found that about half of Americans say Trump did something illegal regarding the classified documents found at his Florida home, and a similar share think he did something illegal regarding his alleged attempt to interfere in Georgia's vote count in the 2020 presidential election. The poll also found that nearly half of Americans believe he did something illegal related to his effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\nAdvertisement\nProsecutors in New York will argue that Trump falsified his company's internal records to hide the true nature of a payment to his former lawyer, Michael Cohen.

If the votes are successful, the package will go to the Senate, where passage in the coming days is nearly assured. President Joe Biden has promised to sign it immediately.\nPassage through the House would clear away the biggest hurdle to Biden's funding request, first made in October as Ukraine's military supplies began to run low. The GOP-controlled House, skeptical of U.S. support for Ukraine, struggled for months over what to do, first demanding that any assistance be tied to policy changes at the U.S. southern border \u2014 only to immediately reject a bipartisan Senate offer along those very lines.\nAdvertisement\nReaching an endgame has been an excruciating lift for Johnson that has tested both his resolve and his support among Republicans, with a small but growing number now openly urging his removal from the speaker's office. Yet congressional leaders cast the votes as a turning point in history \u2014 an urgent sacrifice as U.S. allies are beleaguered by wars and threats from continental Europe to the Middle East to Asia.\n'The only thing that has kept terrorists and tyrants at bay is the perception of a strong America, that we would stand strong,' Johnson said this week. 'And we will. I think that Congress is going to show that. This is a very important message that we are going to send the world.'\nStill, Congress has seen a stream of world leaders visit in recent months, from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, all but pleading with lawmakers to approve the aid. Globally, the delay left many questioning America's commitment to its allies.\nAdvertisement\nAt stake has also been one of Biden's top foreign policy priorities \u2014 halting Russian President Vladimir Putin's advance in Europe. After engaging in quiet talks with Johnson, the president quickly endorsed Johnson's plan this week, paving the way for Democrats to give their rare support to clear the procedural hurdles needed for a final vote.\n'It's long past time that we support our democratic allies in Israel, Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific and provide humanitarian assistance to civilians who are in harm's way in theaters of conflict like Gaza, Haiti and the Sudan,' House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said at a news conference Friday.\nVoting on the package is likely to create unusual alliances in the House. While aid for Ukraine will likely win a majority in both parties, a significant number of progressive Democrats are expected to vote against the bill aiding Israel as they demand an end to the bombardment of Gaza that has killed thousands of civilians.\nAdvertisement\nAt the same time, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has loomed large over the fight, weighing in from afar via social media statements and direct phone calls with lawmakers as he tilts the GOP to a more isolationist stance with his 'America First' brand of politics. Ukraine's defense once enjoyed robust, bipartisan support in Congress, but as the war enters its third year, a bulk of Republicans oppose further aid.\nAt one point in the months-long slog to get Ukraine assistance through Congress, Trump's opposition essentially doomed the bipartisan Senate proposal on border security. This week, Trump also issued a social media post that questioned why European nations were not giving more money to Ukraine, though he spared Johnson from criticism and said Ukraine's survival was important.\nStill, the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus has derided the legislation as the 'America Last' foreign wars package and urged lawmakers to defy Republican leadership and oppose it because the bills do not include border security measures.\nAdvertisement\nJohnson's hold on the speaker's gavel has also grown more tenuous in recent days as three Republicans, led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, supported a 'motion to vacate' that can lead to a vote on removing the speaker. A few more were expected to soon join, said Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who is urging Johnson to voluntarily step aside.\nThe speaker's office has been working furiously to whip up support for the bill, as well as for Johnson. It arranged a series of press calls in the lead-up to the final votes on the package, first with Jewish leaders, then with Christian groups, to show support for the speaker and the legislation he is bringing to the floor.\nAri Fleischer, a former White House press secretary under President George W. Bush, said it was about time the United States 'did something to support Israel, fight Vladimir Putin and stand up to China.'\nAdvertisement\n'Coming together like this is a refreshing reminder of the old days when foreign policy had bipartisan support,' he said.\nThe package includes several Republican priorities that Democrats endorse, or at least are willing to accept. Those include proposals that allow the U.S. to seize frozen Russian central bank assets to rebuild Ukraine; impose sanctions on Iran, Russia, China and criminal organizations that traffic fentanyl; and legislation to require the China-based owner of the popular video app TikTok to sell its stake within a year or face a ban in the United States.\nStill, the all-out push to get the bills through Congress is a reflection not only of politics, but realities on the ground in Ukraine. Top lawmakers on national security committees, who are privy to classified briefings, have grown gravely concerned about the situation in recent weeks. Russia has increasingly used satellite-guided gliding bombs \u2014 which allow planes to drop them from a safe distance \u2014 to pummel Ukrainian forces beset by a shortage of troops and ammunition.\nAdvertisement\n'I really do believe the intel and the briefings that we've gotten,' Johnson said, adding, 'I think that Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed.'\nA former ambassador to Ukraine under President George W. Bush, John Herbst, said the months-long delay in approving more American assistance has undoubtedly hurt Ukrainian troops on the battlefield.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Stephen Groves,Lisa Mascaro","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QUFX45X62EI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.630653,"_id":"a3d6d8ee3cb8d84c2ed2c12105681352"},{"title":"Why Massie is key in the effort to depose Johnson","author":"Leigh Ann Caldwell","published_date":"2024-04-17 10:29:38","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/17/why-massie-is-key-effort-depose-johnson","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"In today's edition \u2026 Sheehy apologized and asked for leniency after alleged 2015 gun incident \u2026 Seven New Yorkers sworn in as jurors in Trump's trial.","summary":"Good morning, Early Birds.

Greene had fallen out of favor with the far-right House Freedom Caucus and doesn't have many allies.

Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has upended that.\nRep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has upended that.\nAt Tuesday morning's closed-door Republican conference meeting, Massie announced that he had signed on to Greene's motion to vacate Johnson as House speaker after Johnson proposed funding aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan with no border-security provisions.\nThat turned heads for multiple reasons.\nMassie moved the needle\nRepublicans are now taking Greene's effort seriously.\nOn the one hand, Massie's support moves Greene one vote closer to being able to vacate Johnson. She now only needs one more vote in their narrow two-seat majority unless Democrats come to his rescue. (They have said they will if Johnson puts a bill similar to the Senate-passed bill with funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan on the floor for a vote.)\nAdvertisement\nBut Massie's support is significant in another way, too.\nRepublicans mostly dismissed the motion to vacate because Trump, who is worried about GOP chaos six months before the election, stood with Johnson at Mar-a-Lago last week and said he supports the speaker.\nRepublicans were skeptical that Greene would cross Trump \u2014 and Republicans frustrated with Johnson didn't want to cross Trump, either.\nMassie is, in some ways, immune to pressure from Trump. He's not particularly close with him. He cares little about what Trump thinks and the former president doesn't influence his actions or his votes. So a call from Trump would probably do little to dissuade him from voting to oust Johnson.\nFull circle\nAs recently as last Congress, both Massie and Greene were outsiders looking in.\nMassie, a libertarian who opposes nearly all government spending bills , is one of only a handful of Republicans who joined no conference or faction. He was a happy lone warrior warning his colleagues about the rising debt. Greene, a firebrand whose goal was to buck the establishment and promote Trump, was kicked off committees by Democrats and shunned by Republicans.\n, is one of only a handful of Republicans who joined no conference or faction.

He successfully brought both of them into the fold, giving Massie a spot on the Rules Committee, a position of leadership allies, and using Greene as an informal adviser. His actions turned them into team players who defended McCarthy during his ouster.\nJohnson, however, has failed to build a strong relationship with them. And now they could lead his political demise.\nMassie says the motion to vacate 'will happen' and has predicted that more than eight Republicans will support it, which would make it more popular than the effort by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) to oust McCarthy. (Only Greene can trigger the motion, because she filed it.)\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) to oust McCarthy.

I think it's dead wrong. It's not what motion to vacate was designed for,' Rep. Dan Meuser (R-Pa.) said. 'It's designed for if there's a scandal, if there is some crime, something that clearly shows that person is not capable or doesn't belong in that position. Not this.

Trump has insisted he wants to widen the map, even into his native New York, which is heavily Democratic. Most Republicans, though, agree that Trump will have a difficult path to an Electoral College majority if Biden were to win North Carolina's 15 electoral votes. Trump tacitly acknowledged North Carolina's status by tapping then-state Republican Chairman Michael Whatley to lead his campaign's effective takeover of the Republican National Committee.\nAdvertisement\nThere is no precedent for the kind of campaign Trump now has to run \u2014 in North Carolina and nationally.\nWith opening arguments of his trial expected Monday, Trump will be confined to the courtroom for the foreseeable future, limiting his ability to see voters, fundraise and make calls. Biden, conversely, spent multiple days this week campaigning in Pennsylvania, another key battleground. Trump aides have promised weekend rallies and events on Wednesdays, the one weekday Trump's trial is expected to be in recess. The former president's campaign also has promised additional weeknight appearances around New York, as in Harlem.\nThat schedule adds pressure for Trump to maximize his limited opportunities to reach voters and command media attention beyond his indictments.\nIn North Carolina, Biden's campaign already has hired statewide leadership and field organizers for offices across the state. That's on top of state party staff that began an organizing program last year ahead of municipal races and looking to this year's statewide races \u2013 including an open governor's race since Cooper is barred from seeking a third term.\nAdvertisement\n'We needed to build energy on the ground early,' said state Democratic Chairwoman Anderson Clayton, noting that the last Democratic presidential nominee to win North Carolina \u2014 Barack Obama in 2008 \u2014 had organized the state in a hotly contested primary campaign that ramped up the previous year.\nMatt Mercer, spokesman for the North Carolina Republican Party, countered that veteran GOP staffers have been working in the state since the 2020 election cycle. Mercer said the GOP, from Trump to volunteers, will stress a family-first message around the economy and public safety.\nVoters, Mercer said, 'understand the importance of what those messages mean to them in their daily lives' and are 'fed up' with Biden, 'whether it's with sky high inflation, the open southern border or the migrant crime crisis.'\nAdvertisement\nTrump will be joined Saturday by North Carolina Republican gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson, whom Trump has endorsed and called 'Martin Luther King on steroids.' Robinson is the first Black lieutenant governor of the state.\nCooper won the governor's office narrowly in 2016 and 2020, swaying just enough swing voters even as Trump carried the state in each of those presidential contests.\nThe governor argued that Biden's record \u2014 low unemployment, rising wages, stabilized inflation, infrastructure and green energy investments \u2014 will resonate with a geographically and demographically diverse state.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Bill Barrow","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FXOOXGH6TMI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.5737786,"_id":"84fafae298bf947d0f94306c90f7b43a"},{"title":"Biden's new Title IX rules protect LGBTQ+ students, but transgender sports rule still on hold","author":"Collin Binkley","published_date":"2024-04-19 09:01:40","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/19/title-ix-sexual-assault-transgender-sports/6f96d5fa-fe2b-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The rights of LGBTQ+ students will be protected by federal law and victims of campus sexual assault will gain new safeguards under new rules from the Biden administration","summary":"The rights of LGBTQ+ students will be protected by federal law and victims of campus sexual assault will gain new safeguards under rules finalized Friday by the Biden administration.\nThe new provisions are part of a revised Title IX regulation issued by the Education Department, fulfilling a campaign pledge by President Joe Biden. He had promised to dismantle rules created by former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who added new protections for students accused of sexual misconduct.\nNotably absent from Biden's policy, however, is any mention of transgender athletes.\nThe administration originally planned to include a new policy forbidding schools from enacting outright bans on transgender athletes, but that provision was put on hold. The delay is widely seen as a political maneuver during an election year in which Republicans have rallied around bans on transgender athletes in girls' sports.\nAdvertisement\nInstead, Biden is officially undoing sexual assault rules put in place by his predecessor and current election-year opponent, former President Donald Trump. The final policy drew praise from victims' advocates, while Republicans said it erodes the rights of accused students.\nThe new rule makes 'crystal clear that everyone can access schools that are safe, welcoming and that respect their rights,' Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said.\n'No one should face bullying or discrimination just because of who they are, who they love,' Cardona told reporters. 'Sadly, this happens all too often.'\nBiden's regulation is meant to clarify schools' obligations under Title IX, the 1972 women's rights law that outlaws discrimination based on sex in education. It applies to colleges and elementary and high schools that receive federal money. The update is to take effect in August.\nAdvertisement\nAmong the biggest changes is new recognition that Title IX protects LGBTQ+ students \u2014 a source of deep conflict with Republicans.\nThe 1972 law doesn't directly address the issue, but the new rules clarify that Title IX also forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. LGBTQ+ students who face discrimination will be entitled to a response from their school under Title IX, and those failed by their schools can seek recourse from the federal government.\nMany Republicans say Congress never intended such protections under Title IX. A federal judge previously blocked Biden administration guidance to the same effect after 20 Republican-led states challenged the policy.\nRep. Virginia Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina and chair of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, said the new regulation threatens decades of advancement for women and girls.\nAdvertisement\n'This final rule dumps kerosene on the already raging fire that is Democrats' contemptuous culture war that aims to radically redefine sex and gender,' Foxx said in a statement.\nThe revision was proposed nearly two years ago but has been slowed by a comment period that drew 240,000 responses, a record for the Education Department.\nMany of the changes are meant to ensure that schools and colleges respond to complaints of sexual misconduct. In general, the rules widen the type of misconduct that institutions are required to address, and it grants more protections to students who bring accusations.\nChief among the changes is a wider definition of sexual harassment. Schools now must address any unwelcome sex-based conduct that is so 'severe or pervasive' that it limits a student's equal access to an education.\nAdvertisement\nUnder the DeVos rules, conduct had to be 'severe, pervasive and objectively offensive,' a higher bar that pushed some types of misconduct outside the purview of Title IX.\nColleges will no longer be required to hold live hearings to allow students to cross-examine one another through representatives \u2014 a signature provision from the DeVos rules.\nLive hearings are allowed under the Biden rules, but they're optional and carry new limits. Students must be able to participate from hearings remotely, for example, and schools must bar questions that are 'unclear or harassing.'\nAs an alternative to live hearings, college officials can interview students separately, allowing each student to suggest questions and get a recording of the responses.\nThose hearings were a major point of contention with victims' advocates, who said it forced sexual assault survivors to face their attackers and discouraged people from reporting assaults. Supporters said it gave accused students a fair process to question their accusers, arguing that universities had become too quick to rule against accused students.\nAdvertisement\nVictims' advocates applauded the changes and urged colleges to implement them quickly.\n'After years of pressure from students and survivors of sexual violence, the Biden Administration's Title IX update will make schools safer and more accessible for young people, many of whom experienced irreparable harm while they fought for protection and support,' said Emma Grasso Levine, a senior manager at the group Know Your IX.\nDespite the focus on safeguards for victims, the new rules preserve certain protections for accused students.\nAll students must have equal access to present evidence and witnesses under the new policy, and all students must have equal access to evidence. All students will be allowed to bring an advisor to campus hearings, and colleges must have an appeals process.\nIn general, accused students won't be able to be disciplined until after they're found responsible for misconduct, although the regulation allows for 'emergency' removals if it's deemed a matter of campus safety.\nAdvertisement\nThe latest overhaul continues a back-and-forth political battle as presidential administrations repeatedly rewrite the rules around campus sexual misconduct.\nThe DeVos rules were themselves an overhaul of an Obama-era policy that was intended to force colleges to take accusations of campus sexual assault more seriously. Now, after years of nearly constant changes, some colleges have been pushing for a political middle ground to end the whiplash.\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Collin Binkley","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NYS3GEX6FMI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.547061,"_id":"6295aa02ca506729ecadd79ead8e5d5b"},{"title":"Two shootings, two different responses \u2014 Maine restricts guns while Iowa arms teachers","author":"David A.

Two tragedies. Two different approaches to improving public safety.\n'We live in two different Americas, in essence,' said Daniel Webster, a health policy professor affiliated with the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions.\n'We see terrible acts of gun violence; no one wants them, of course,' Webster said. 'But we see this through different lenses.'\nLegislatures in about 20 states already have passed measures this year to expand gun rights or restrict access to firearms. Dozens more proposals are pending. The divide continues a trend seen last year, when more than half the states enacted firearms legislation, with Democrats generally favoring more limits and Republicans more freedoms for gun owners.\nLIMITS ON GUNS IN MAINE\nMaine has a tradition of hunting and gun ownership. But after an Army reservist killed 18 people and wounded 13 others in Lewiston, Democratic Gov. Janet Mills called for a variety of new laws aimed at preventing dangerous people from possessing guns and strengthening mental health services.\nAdvertisement\nBefore adjourning its 2024 session early Thursday, lawmakers approved measures imposing a 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases, expanding background checks on private gun sales and criminalizing sales to certain prohibited people. They also passed a ban on devices that convert semi-automatic firearms into rapid-firing weapons like machine guns, and enhanced an existing law that allows judges to temporarily remove guns from people during a mental health crisis.\nA gun safety coalition praised it as a significant step forward in response to constituents' concerns after the Lewiston shooting. But Republican state Sen. Lisa Keim criticized colleagues for 'using the tragedy to advance legislation' that had been unable to pass previously.\nGUNS IN IOWA SCHOOLS\nIn Perry, Iowa, a school principal and sixth-grade student died and several others were wounded when a 17-year-old student opened fire in January.\nAdvertisement\nA 2021 state law already allowed schools to authorize individuals to carry firearms, though some districts have not done so because of concerns about insurance coverage.\nThe legislation given final approval Monday by the Republican-led Legislature builds upon the prior law by allowing teachers and staff who undergo gun safety training to get a professional permit to carry guns in schools. If they do, they would be protected from criminal or civil liability for use of reasonable force.\nThe legislation also requires large school districts to station a police officer or private security guard at each high school, unless the school board votes not to do so. Most of those school districts already have security staff.\nDIVERGING STATE LAWS\nRepublican-led legislatures in Kentucky, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee and Utah also passed measures this year that would expand the ability of some people to bring guns into schools. A bill passed in Wyoming allots $480,000 to reimburse schools for the cost of training employees to carry guns on school property.\nAdvertisement\nLouisiana and South Carolina, led by Republican lawmakers and governors, each enacted laws allowing people to carry concealed guns without a permit. The National Rifle Association, which supported the measures, said similar laws now exist in 29 states.\nBy contrast, the Democrat-led Delaware Legislature passed legislation requiring people wanting to buy a handgun to first be fingerprinted, undergo training and obtain a state permit.\nNew Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, signed a pair of new laws imposing restrictions. One sets a seven-day waiting period to purchase firearms \u2014 more than double the three-day period required by the federal government for a background check.\nAnother new law in New Mexico prohibits carrying firearms within 100 feet (30 meters) of polling places, with an exemption for concealed-carry permit holders. Voting site restrictions on guns now exist in about one-third of the states and Washington, D.C., according to the gun-violence prevention group Giffords.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBUCKING PARTY TRENDS\nNot all new gun policies diverge along partisan lines.\nAdvertisement\nRepublican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin this year vetoed 30 gun-related bills passed by the Democratic-led General Assembly that he said would have trampled on constitutional rights. Yet Youngkin also signed some gun restrictions: One bans devices that convert semi-automatic handguns into automatic weapons. Another allows felony charges against parents who let a child have access to a firearm after being notified the child poses a threat of violence.\nWhile signing several gun rights measures, Republican Gov. Mark Gordon of Wyoming also vetoed legislation that would have allowed people to carry concealed guns in public schools and government meetings. Gordon cited concerns the bill could have exceeded the separation of powers provision in the state constitution.\nAnd in some cases, high-profile shootings have prompted lawmakers to avoid taking action on proposals they might otherwise have considered.\nAdvertisement\nMissouri's Republican-led House had been prepared to debate bills exempting guns and ammunition from sales taxes and allowing people with concealed-carry permits to bring guns onto public transportation. But after the deadly shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl celebration, House Majority Leader Jon Patterson said those bills would not be brought up this year.\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David A.

Bob Graham is being remembered as a politician who genuinely loved people and encouraged them to get involved in civic affairs","summary":"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 A leader like Bob Graham would be a unicorn in the hyper-partisan politics of today.\nThe former Florida governor and U.S. senator wasn't a slick, slogan-spouting politician. He didn't have an us-against-them mentality. Sometimes, he even came across as more of a kind-hearted professor just trying to make the world a better place.\nHe connected with people on a very real level during his nearly five decades in politics, and he had immense respect for the nation's political process and institutions. Graham died Tuesday at the age of 87.\nIn a state long politically divided and now dominated by Republicans, he earned support among Republicans and Democrats alike with a folksy charm that belied the fact that he was a millionaire Harvard-educated lawyer. He fit in just as easily in conservative, rural north Florida as he did in bustling Miami.\nAdvertisement\nGraham was known for his workdays, when he would try a new job for a day. They began when he was a state senator and became a regular feature in his campaigns and time in office. It was his way to meet and connect with every day folks. His 408th and final workday was wrapping Christmas presents for a Florida Keys charity.\n'I've been Santa Claus, I've been an elf and, on a number of occasions as today, I've been a Santa Claus helper,' Graham said that day, wearing a red shirt instead of a red suit.\nThe workdays were similar to the 1,003-mile walk that former U.S. Sen. and Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles used to launch his foray into national politics.\n'I don't know why there hasn't been other efforts, either to emulate a walk or workdays or some other way to establish a special relationship with the people,' Graham said.\nAdvertisement\nAfter he retired from politics, Graham made it his goal to encourage people \u2014 all people \u2014 to get involved in civic affairs, from the local level on up. He established the Bob Graham Center for Public Service at the University of Florida, which list its mission as 'three central principles: civic engagement, public leadership and public service.'\nIn his book 'America: The Owners Manual,' Graham wrote, 'Since my retirement from the U.S. Senate in 2005, I have become increasingly involved in the effort to transform civics from a spectator sport into a participatory sport \u2014 one in which citizens directly engage in democracy and shape local, state and federal policies to the betterment of their families and communities.'\nPresident Joe Biden, who served in the Senate with Graham, described him as a person of principle.\nAdvertisement\n'Bob loved people, and he knew that politics at its core is about learning from and serving others. That's why he spent more than 400 \u2018workdays' on the job with constituents, doing everything from picking tomatoes, to handling baggage, to patrolling the streets with police. He knew it matters to walk a mile in other folks' shoes,' Biden said in a statement.\nGraham briefly ran for president in 2004, emphasizing his opposition to the invasion of Iraq. When Al Gore lost Florida, and thus the presidency, by 537-votes to George W. Bush in 2000, many speculated that Gore would have won if he had picked Graham instead of Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman as his running mate.\nDemocrats and Republicans remember him fondly.\n'Florida and our country has lost a great public servant. Bob Graham served Floridians with a servants heart, with integrity and with civility. Columba and I are praying for the Graham family,' former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush said in an email.\nAdvertisement\nCharlie Crist, who served as a Republican governor before switching parties and serving as Democratic U.S. representative, said Graham was an influence on him.\n'I always felt that when he was governor, that he was trying to govern for the people of Florida \u2014 not in any way political or partisan \u2014 and I took that to heart and tried to, in some small way, emulate it,' Crist said in a phone interview.\nGraham's daughter, former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham, tried following in her father's footsteps, running for governor in 2018 in much the same spirit he did, continuing his workdays and promising to put people over politics. She narrowly lost the Democratic primary and Republican Ron DeSantis went on to win the general election.\n'I've certainly learned from him, but I would never expect anyone to support me simply because I am Dad's daughter,' Graham told The Associated Press before announcing her candidacy. 'I will be a governor that does focus on what he focused on, which is making the right decisions for Florida again.'\nAdvertisement\nAt her announcement, Bob Graham was present, and spoke of how he relished the job. 'In a life of public service, I don't think there is a more exciting but demanding job than being governor,' he said.\nChris Hand, a former speechwriter for Graham who co-wrote 'America: The Owners Manual' with him, said his love of people was genuine, whether it was during workdays or meeting well-wishers after his retirement.\n'He was never anything but sincerely interested in the stories they would share and he would usually conclude by getting their contact information so he could stay in touch,' Hand said. 'I think that's one of his defining features as a leader. He truly loved the people that he represented, saw them as the best source of his ideas and truly enjoyed hearing their stories and learning from them.'\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brendan Farrington","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BAFSIJX46EI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.5271277,"_id":"dc7878a19fb78e06f152f85eac365a67"},{"title":"Senate to convene Mayorkas impeachment trial as Democrats plot quick dismissal","author":"Mary Clare Jalonick","published_date":"2024-04-17 04:15:46","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/17/mayorkas-senate-impeachment-trial-democrats/2a36f0e6-fc71-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Senate Democrats could end the impeachment trial of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas before arguments even begin","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Democrats could end the impeachment trial of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday before arguments even begin.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is expected to call votes to dismiss two articles of impeachment against Mayorkas after senators are sworn in as jurors midday, a move that could scuttle the trial and frustrate Republicans who have demanded that House prosecutors be able to make their case. Democrats appear to be united in opposition to moving forward.\nThe House narrowly voted in February to impeach Mayorkas for his handling of the U.S.-Mexico border, arguing in the two articles that he 'willfully and systematically' refused to enforce immigration laws. House impeachment managers appointed by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., delivered the charges to the Senate on Tuesday, standing in the well of the Senate and reading the them aloud to a captive audience of senators.\nAdvertisement\nThe entire process could be done within hours on Wednesday. Majority Democrats have said the GOP case against Mayorkas doesn't rise to the 'high crimes and misdemeanors' laid out as a bar for impeachment in the Constitution, and Schumer probably has enough votes to end the trial immediately if he decides to do so.\nSchumer has said he wants to 'address this issue as expeditiously as possible.'\n'Impeachment should never be used to settle a policy disagreement,' Schumer said. 'That would set a horrible precedent for the Congress.'\nAs Johnson signed the articles Monday in preparation for sending them across the Capitol, he said Schumer should convene a trial to 'hold those who engineered this crisis to full account.'\nSchumer 'is the only impediment to delivering accountability for the American people,' Johnson said. 'Pursuant to the Constitution, the House demands a trial.'\nAdvertisement\nOnce the senators are sworn in on Wednesday, the chamber will turn into the court of impeachment, with Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington presiding. Murray is the president pro tempore of the Senate, or the senior-most member of the majority party who sits in for the vice president.\nExactly how Democrats will proceed on Wednesday is still unclear. Impeachment rules generally allow the Senate majority to decide how to manage the trial, and Schumer has not said exactly what he will do.\nSenate Republicans are likely to try to raise a series of objections if Schumer calls votes to dismiss or table. But ultimately they cannot block a dismissal if majority Democrats have the votes.\nIn any case, Republicans would not be able to win the support of the two-thirds of the Senate that is needed to convict and remove Mayorkas from office \u2014 Democrats control the Senate, 51-49, and they appear to be united against the impeachment effort. Not one House Democrat supported it, either.\nAdvertisement\nWhile most Republicans oppose quick dismissal, some have hinted they could vote with Democrats.\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said last week he wasn't sure what he would do if there were a move to dismiss the trial. 'I think it's virtually certain that there will not be the conviction of someone when the constitutional test has not been met,' he said.\nAt the same time, Romney said he wants to at least express his view that 'Mayorkas has done a terrible job, but he's following the direction of the president and has not met the constitutional test of a high crime or misdemeanor.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe two articles argue that Mayorkas not only refused to enforce existing law but also breached the public trust by lying to Congress and saying the border was secure. The House vote was the first time in nearly 150 years a Cabinet secretary was impeached.\nAdvertisement\nSince then, Johnson has delayed sending the articles to the Senate for weeks while both chambers finished work on government funding legislation and took a two-week recess. Johnson had said he would send them to the Senate last week, but he punted again after Senate Republicans said they wanted more time to prepare.\nHouse impeachment managers previewed some of their arguments at a hearing with Mayorkas on Tuesday morning about President Joe Biden's budget request for the department.\nTennessee Rep. Mark Green, the chairman of the House Homeland Security panel, told the secretary that he has a duty under the law to control and guard U.S. borders, and 'during your three years as secretary, you have failed to fulfill this oath. You have refused to comply with the laws passed by Congress, and you have breached the public trust.'\nAdvertisement\nMayorkas defended the department's efforts but said the nation's immigration system is 'fundamentally broken, and only Congress can fix it.'\nOther impeachment managers are Michael McCaul of Texas, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Ben Cline of Virginia, Andrew Garbarino of New York, Michael Guest of Mississippi, Harriet Hageman of Wyoming, Clay Higgins of Louisiana, Laurel Lee of Florida, August Plfuger of Texas and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.\nAt a press conference with a group of Republican senators after the articles were delivered, the impeachment managers demanded that Schumer move forward with their case.\n'The voice of the people is very clear,' said McCaul, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 'Secure the border and impeach this man, this criminal.'\nIf Democrats are unable to dismiss or table the articles, they could follow the precedent of several impeachment trials for federal judges over the last century and hold a vote to create a trial committee that would investigate the charges. While there is sufficient precedent for this approach, Democrats may prefer to end the process completely, especially in a presidential election year when immigration and border security are top issues.\nAdvertisement\nAt a trial, senators would be forced to sit in their seats for the duration, maybe weeks, while the House impeachment managers and lawyers representing Mayorkas make their cases. The Senate is allowed to call witnesses, as well, if it so decides, and it can ask questions of both sides after the opening arguments are finished.\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"science","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Mary Clare Jalonick","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PMFQO6H4EYI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.5271277,"_id":"6cd7d03701eaccbbb6ada22aa00a5ae9"},{"title":"South Carolina making progress to get more women in General Assembly and leadership roles","author":"Jeffrey Collins","published_date":"2024-04-17 18:18:35","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2024/04/17/women-south-carolina-leadership-senate-house/e7c48496-fce6-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Progress is being made in getting more women into leadership positions in South Carolina","summary":"COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 At first glance, the all-male South Carolina Senate subcommittee deciding whether to approve a proposal to remove the sales tax from feminine hygiene products was a reminder that as recently as 2012 the state had no women in its Senate.\nBut progress is being made. The election of a sixth woman to the 46-member Senate in January pulled South Carolina up from last place in the U.S. in the percentage of women in its upper chamber.\nNo one noted the composition of the all-male Senate Finance subcommittee and they listened to five women speak in favor of the bill before ceding the floor to Republican Sen. Katrina Shealy, who broke the chamber's four-year run with no women in 2013.\n'I know we have a lot to do, but we can always do one more thing,' said Shealy, who spoke about how important it is to keep products like pads and tampons affordable and available, especially for younger women already struggling in poverty.\nAdvertisement\nThe bill, which was approved 114-0 in the House last year, passed through the subcommittee unanimously Wednesday. It now heads to the Senate floor. There are only three weeks left in session, but if anyone has a shot in making sure it gets to the governor's desk, it's Shealy, who got 11 bills where she was primary sponsor passed last session \u2014 twice as many as any other senator.\nSouth Carolina women have started organizing to get more of them into political office, from the General Assembly down to school boards.\nSC Women in Leadership is in its sixth year encouraging women to run for office, training them to be better candidates and supporting them when they get elected. The group helps Democrats and Republicans.\nIt's an uphill climb. Just 27 out of the 170 senators and House members in South Carolina are women. That 15.9% is above just West Virginia (11.9%), Tennessee (15.2%) and Mississippi (15.5%), according to the Center for American Women and Politics. Just the addition of Democratic Sen. Tameika Isaac Devine in January boosted South Carolina past a few of those states.\nAdvertisement\nThe five women in the Senate in 2023 \u2014 three Republicans and two Democrats \u2014 banded together to keep South Carolina from passing a near-total ban on abortions. They picked up the nickname the Sister Senators.\nShealy said it shows women can disagree when their political beliefs differ and still come together when their common experiences match.\nWomen in Leadership said women's experiences are different than men and it's vital their voices are in leadership so they not only get heard, but incorporated into policy.

Advocates for abortion rights and some state officials warn that would jeopardize the privacy of physicians and patients who can only receive abortions under strict circumstances.\nThe state bans abortions except within limited time frames in cases of rape, incest, lethal fetal anomaly and serious health risks to the patient. Like many states, Indiana has long collected data on abortions, but the Department of Health last year decided to keep the individual reports from public record and only release its regular summary data four times a year to make it harder to potentially identify patients.\nAdvertisement\nIndiana law requires physicians to submit 'terminated pregnancy reports' with demographic and medical history information to the health department. The reports do not name patients but can list their zip code and county of residence, and they're rarely released in states that collect them, according to experts.\nIn the days following the overturn of Roe v. Wade, an individual record obtained by the Indianapolis Star through a public records request confirmed an abortion provided to a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio.\nThe topic has gradually become a political football as Indiana's competitive primary for governor approaches in early May.\nIn January, Republican gubernatorial candidate and former Attorney General Curtis Hill called on the health department and Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb to allow the release of individual reports. Republican Lt. Gov. and gubernatorial candidate Suzanne Crouch pledged in a March post to X to make the reports public record if she is elected.\nAdvertisement\nAnd on Thursday, Attorney General Todd Rokita, who is running for reelection, issued an advisory opinion arguing the reports should be public record. The opinion doesn't change any practices but was in response to an inquiry from state Sen. Andy Zay, a congressional candidate, Rokita's office said.\nVoters should ask the field of gubernatorial candidates to take a stance, Rokita said during a Thursday news conference.\nAfter Rokita released his opinion, the health department said the reports are not public record, and pointed to an informal opinion written by an appointed open records official in December.\nRokita argued the reports are not medical records and could show whether an abortion was performed legally. Without the reports, he said, 'there is no effective way' to enforce the state's near-total ban.\nAdvertisement\nThe Legislature should act next year if the department doesn't, Zay said Thursday.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'We can use them as tools to hold those around the periphery of abortion clinics and abortion doctors accountable,' Zay said of the reports.\nThe individual reports ask patients for information including zip code, age, race, ethnicity, educational attainment, marital status, previous pregnancies, the date of their last period and the father's age, according to the most recent quarterly summary. Patients may refuse to answer questions, the department said.\nPhysicians report information on the type of procedure, the reason for the abortion and an estimate of the length of the pregnancy. The individual reports also include the name of the physician, the name of the facility and the date of the abortion.\nIndiana's ban went into effect in August. From October to December, 46 terminated pregnancy reports were filed with the health department compared to 1,724 in the same period in 2022.\nAdvertisement\nIt is not common for states to release individual abortion reports, said Rachel Jones, principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a science-based research group that supports abortion rights.\nJones said seeking individual reports is an effort to intimidate health care providers and patients.\n'There's no public health or even legal purpose for trying to impose this,' Jones said.\nRokita denied that the small number of reports makes it easier to identify patients and said that the health department can redact some information before making reports public.\nThe attorney general has taken up multiple legal battles focused on abortion. He gave a televised interview criticizing an Indianapolis OBGYN who provided an abortion to the 10-year-old from Ohio. The Indiana Supreme Court found last year that some of Rokita's statement violated rules of professional conduct for attorneys.\nRokita is weaponizing the reports, said Rebecca Gibron, CEO of the Planned Parenthood region that includes Indiana.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Isabella Volmert","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VGJN5YX3U4I65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.514362,"_id":"390b2b08c7400ba6ef2ac54ce67c2e71"},{"title":"Juneteenth or Jefferson Davis?

Juandalynn Givan and other Black lawmakers have lobbied for years to have the state recognize the Juneteenth holiday.\n'It's an acknowledgment that history happened, and I think we need to do whatever we can to make sure our history is not lost,' Givan (D) said.\nThis year, lawmakers may have reached a compromise.\nUnder the bill H.B. 4, Juneteenth, celebrated on June 19, would become a state holiday. But state employees would be able to choose between recognizing Juneteenth or the birthday of the president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, on June 3. Davis's birthday is already a state holiday.\n'It was a compromise. Did we like it? No. But can we live with it? Yes. Are we hopeful for the future? Absolutely,' said Givan, who sponsored the bill.\nAdvertisement\nThe Alabama House of Representatives passed the bill April 11 by a margin of 83-0, with 58 Republicans and 25 Democrats voting in favor of the bill. Ten lawmakers abstained. The bill still must be voted on by the state Senate, where it hasn't been introduced.\nJuneteenth has been celebrated for more than 100 years, marking the day, two years after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed, that Union troops arrived in Galveston, Tex., and announced that more than 250,000 enslaved Black people in the state were free.\nIt began garnering wider recognition in the aftermath of the social justice protests of 2020 and became a federal holiday in 2021. At least 28 states and the District of Columbia also recognize Juneteenth as a public holiday, giving state workers a paid day off, according to the Pew Research Center.\nAdvertisement\nSince Juneteenth became a federal holiday, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) has issued a proclamation marking the day as a public holiday. But it is not permanent.\nIvey didn't respond to a request for comment on the legislation.\n'I look at it as a Republican holiday because the Emancipation was presented by Abraham Lincoln, who was a Republican,' state Rep. Rick Rehm (R) said during the debate on the legislation, referencing Juneteenth. 'It's a very valid, worthy holiday, and I wanted to give my support for that.'\nAllowing employees to choose between two holidays would keep the number of state holidays celebrated to 13, Rehm told WTVY.\nRehm and the Alabama Republican Party didn't respond to a request for comment.\nBut some Black lawmakers and the Tuscaloosa NAACP have raised objections to the Alabama bill.\nAdvertisement\n'The compromise that it's asking me to make is just difficult,' said state Rep. Chris England (D), who abstained from a vote. 'Black Americans often have to accept really big compromises to make really small progress.'\nLawmakers have also tried unsuccessfully over the years to get rid of other state holidays commemorating the Confederacy.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAlabama celebrates Martin Luther King Jr. and Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee on the same day, Jan. 15. It celebrates Confederate Memorial Day on April 22.\nBut similar efforts have been more successful in other parts of the country. In 2022, Louisiana removed Robert E. Lee Day and Confederate Memorial Day from its list of state holidays. Georgia did the same in 2015.\nAlabama's Juneteenth compromise bill is a setback to the larger effort to promote the holiday, said Lisa Young, president of the Tuscaloosa County branch of the NAACP.\nAdvertisement\n'Things are always politically divided here in Alabama. \u2026 However, for myself, I would've wanted all or nothing,' Young said. 'Not treating Juneteenth the way all other holidays are treated is a slap in the face to African Americans.'\nYoung said she is worried that if the legislation moves forward, it could be used to overturn measures adopted in some Alabama cities, like Tuscaloosa and Northport, to recognize the holiday.\nThe compromise bill is overly conciliatory to those who believe in a 'lost cause' narrative, which promotes a pro-Confederate memory of the Civil War, said Hilary Green, professor of Africana studies at Davidson College.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Rachel Hatzipanagos","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/L7T44R2TDK2J7Q32VNFTLHDGYA_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.492806,"_id":"a905ce889202d89ae9192325788135e3"},{"title":"Johnson's Chamberlain-or-Churchill moment","author":"Theodoric Meyer","published_date":"2024-04-18 10:17:33","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/18/johnsons-chamberlain-or-churchill-moment","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"In today's edition \u2026 Johnson's foreign aid gambit gets tested at the Rules Committee \u2026 Kennedy family will endorse Biden.","summary":"Good morning, Early Birds.

Trump has long criticized Ukraine while repeatedly sympathizing with Russian leader Vladmir Putin, and has told advisers he would settle the war by letting Russia keep the land it has already seized. He pushed to turn the Ukraine aid into a loan, prompting Republicans to include a loan requirement in Saturday's legislation, with some caveats.\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on X that he was 'grateful' to the House, 'both parties, and personally Speaker Mike Johnson for the decision that keeps history on the right track.'\nAdvertisement\nJohnson, who has evolved on the issue of Ukraine, was defiant in his decision to move ahead on funding the foreign ally in a bipartisan manner even though there were 'critics of the legislation.'\n'It is not a perfect piece of legislation.

And as any political analyst will tell you, this Manhattan 'hush money'/election-interference case is the least concerning to voters of Trump's four indictments.\nBut what's also true is that Americans have overwhelmingly found the facts of this case to be problematic. And they could soon learn (or relearn) plenty about something that potential Trump voters especially haven't followed closely but could be troubling to them.\nLet's take start with the first part of that.\nIt's easy to cast the New York charges against Trump \u2014 his alleged falsification of business records to conceal a hush money payment to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels late in the 2016 campaign \u2014 as small-bore.

They even rivaled later events like the ones that led to Trump's two impeachments: the Ukraine scandal and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\nMore recently, polling shows fewer Americans think Trump did something illegal in the hush money case than in the other cases.

But there are also a few differences with the Senate bill designed to win over some House conservatives.\nHere's a look at what is in the bills that Johnson hopes to pass by this weekend.\nUKRAINE\nThe aid to support Ukraine totals about $61 billion. Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee said that more than a third of that amount would be dedicated to replenishing weapons and ammunition systems for the U.S. military.\nThe overall amount of money provided to Ukraine for the purchase of weapons from the U.S. is roughly the same in the House and Senate bills \u2014 $13.8 billion.\nAdvertisement\nThe main difference between the two packages is that the House bill provides more than $9 billion in economic assistance to Ukraine in the form of 'forgivable loans.' The Senate bill included no such provision seeking repayment.\nThe president would be authorized to set the terms of the loan to Ukraine and also be given the power to cancel it. Congress could override the cancellation but would have to generate enough votes to override a veto, a high bar considering how the two chambers are so evenly divided.\nJohnson, as he seeks GOP support for the package, noted that former President Donald Trump has endorsed a 'loan concept.'\nHe also noted that the House package includes a requirement for the Biden administration to provide a plan and a strategy to Congress for what it seeks to achieve in Ukraine. The plan would be required within 45 days of the bill being signed into law. House Republicans frequently complain that they have yet to see a strategy from Biden for winning the war.\nAdvertisement\nThe bill said the report from the administration must be a multiyear plan that spells out 'specific and achievable objectives.' It also asked for an estimate of the resources required to achieve the U.S. objectives and a description of the national security implications if the objectives are not met.\nISRAEL\nAid in the legislation to support Israel and provide humanitarian relief to citizens of Gaza comes to more than $26 billion. The amount of money dedicated to replenishing Israel's missile defense systems totals about $4 billion in the House and Senate bills. An additional $2.4 billion for current U.S. military operations in the regions is also the same in both bills.\nSome conservatives have been critical of the aid for Gaza. At the end of the day, though, Johnson risked losing critical Democratic support for the package if Republicans had excluded it. The humanitarian assistance comes to more than $9 billion for Gaza, where millions of Palestinians face starvation, lack of clean water and disease outbreaks.\nINDO-PACIFIC","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Kevin Freking","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GBTLSCX5BUI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.3876224,"_id":"1b9333b74ddc07b53a951be55c99960b"},{"title":"Sheehy apologized and asked for leniency after alleged 2015 gun incident","author":"Liz Goodwin","published_date":"2024-04-17 09:00:37","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/17/sheehy-gunshot-montana-senate","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The Montana GOP Senate candidate now says he lied about accidentally shooting himself at Glacier National Park.","summary":"Republican Senate candidate Tim Sheehy apologized and asked for leniency in 2015 after he said a gun he kept in his vehicle for bear protection fell and discharged, striking him in his right forearm in Glacier National Park, according to new National Park Service documents released through a Freedom of Information Act request.\nThe new documents, which provide additional detail about an incident first reported by The Washington Post this month, include a detailed written statement from Sheehy to a law enforcement officer regarding Sheehy having accidentally shot himself on Oct. 18, 2015 \u2014 an account that he now says was a lie.\n'As a highly trained and combat experienced wounded veteran, I can assure you this was an unfortunate accident and we are grateful no other persons or property were damaged,' Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL, said in the 2015 statement apologizing for illegally discharging his weapon in the park.

'My deepest apologies for any inconvenience this incident caused,' Sheehy said in the statement.\nIn The Post story published this month, however, Sheehy says that his gunshot wound that day was old, not fresh, and that he sought medical attention because he fell during a hike and feared he had dislodged a bullet in his arm from Afghanistan that he had never reported to his superiors, for fear of sparking an investigation into its origins. Sheehy said he believed the bullet may have been the result of a friendly fire ricochet during a nighttime firefight in April or May of 2012.\nAdvertisement\nSheehy also told The Post said that hospital staff told him they were required to report the gunshot wound to authorities and so he decided to lie \u2014 first to hospital staff and then to the ranger \u2014 to ensure the story of his older wound wouldn't trigger a military investigation that could harm his former platoonmates' careers, according to his campaign and an attorney representing him.\n'I guess the only thing I'm guilty of is admitting to doing something I never did,' Sheehy said of paying a $525 fine for illegally discharging his weapon in the national park. He now says the gun never went off.\nThe ranger's report says 'a park visitor called park dispatch' to report an accidental gun discharge at Logan Pass that day.

In his 2023 memoir, 'Mudslingers,' Sheehy wrote in one passage that he received multiple bullet wounds in Afghanistan. In another, he wrote that his body was hit by a bullet just once. In the book, he also offers varying accounts of how he was shot.\nAdvertisement\nIn one such account, Sheehy writes that he didn't report being struck by a ricochet bullet because it was caused by friendly fire and he didn't want the 'total stud' who shot him to get into trouble. He now says he does not know for sure if he was wounded by friendly or enemy fire, and that there was not one particular person he believed could have been responsible.\nSheehy was awarded a Bronze Star with 'V' for Valor and a Purple Heart for two separate incidents during his time serving as a SEAL in Afghanistan. The Purple Heart was awarded after he was knocked unconscious by an improvised explosive device blast, according to a local news report.\nA former teammate recalled Sheehy saying he was struck by a ricochet bullet while they were serving together in 2012. That person, who was interviewed at the request of the Sheehy campaign, spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is a military reservist and said he was not authorized to talk to the media. Other service members who served with Sheehy in Afghanistan either declined to comment or could not recall him discussing a gunshot wound.\nAdvertisement\nWatkins, Sheehy's lawyer, previously argued Sheehy could not have accidentally discharged the Colt .45 by dropping the gun in 2015 because 'doing so is not possible based on the design of the weapon's firing mechanism.'\nRick Vasquez, a firearms expert and former Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives official, said it would indeed be 'very unlikely' for that weapon to misfire when dropped as Sheehy told the ranger.\nSheehy has campaigned in part on his experience as a combat veteran, saying the Biden administration's chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 inspired him to run.\nSheehy was handpicked to run by Sen.

'The guy is a Purple Heart American war hero.'\nDaines said it was up to Sheehy whether he should release the medical records from the hospital.\n'That's his decision to sort that out,' Daines said of whether to release medical records.\nRep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.), who is also a former Navy SEAL and Sheehy supporter, noted that Sheehy already has a Purple Heart from a separate action in Afghanistan and that he believed veterans and service members would not have any concerns about the story. Zinke said it was Sheehy's decision whether to release his records from his ER visit.\n'I released my entire record and they were shocked on what an outstanding record looks like,' Zinke said of his 2014 House race, when he released military records after facing questions about his years serving in SEAL Team 6.\nWhile Daines and other Republicans backed Sheehy, some have said the story has exacerbated tensions among Rosendale supporters in the state who resented Rosendale's exit from the Senate race.\nRosendale lost to Tester in 2018 but nonetheless had a passionate following among some grass-roots conservatives in Montana.\n'There was a lot of hostility from Rosendale supporters toward Sheehy and these kinds of stories about Sheehy are not going to help heal that rift,' said Matthew Monforton, a former Republican member of the Montana state legislature who broke with the party and is now a libertarian. 'There's a real fear that Sheehy was not vetted well.'\nBrad Johnson, the former secretary of state of Montana and Sheehy challenger in the June Republican primary, slammed Sheehy in a statement provided to a local TV outlet. 'This is what you get when a couple of DC insiders like Mitch McConnell and Steve Daines anoint an unknown, untested and unvetted candidate and then dictate to Montana Republicans who their nominee to the United States Senate is going to be,' he said.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Liz Goodwin","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DXYKTAIXX43HU4KRQU3RU6YPNA_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.3054237,"_id":"0e868a0d03fc9c38100facea19803dca"},{"title":"$19K lectern purchase in Ark. governor's office might've been illegal, audit finds","author":"Jonathan Edwards","published_date":"2024-04-17 02:58:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/04/16/sarah-huckabee-sanders-lectern-audit","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Arkansas lawmakers on both sides of the aisle on Tuesday questioned the staff of Gov.

'No fraud was committed.'\nOn Monday, Sanders posted to social media a highly stylized 20-second video that appeared timed to the release of the report's findings. It ends with the silhouette of a lectern atop the words 'COME AND TAKE IT.'\nThe report was the only agenda item during a Tuesday meeting of state representatives and senators on the Legislative Joint Audit Committee. Judd Deere, Sanders's deputy chief of staff, told lawmakers during the meeting that the lectern is in the governor's office. He said that officials have not used it as legislative auditors conducted their investigation but plan to put it into service once it's finished.\nIn early February, the governor's staff contacted Salem Strategies, a Virginia-based company the office had hired to coordinate Sanders's inauguration events, to request information on portable 'falcon style' lecterns, according to the report. The following month, the company returned a draft design for such a lectern with a cost estimate of $10,000 to $15,000, it found. But at around the same time, another staff member sought estimates from an Arkansas-based audio and visual equipment dealer, who returned estimates ranging from $800 to $1,500, it states. In their report, auditors noted that they found similar lecterns online that sold for between $7,000 and $11,575.\nAdvertisement\nIn June, Arkansas blogger and lawyer Matthew Campbell started filing public records requests related to the governor's security and travel expenses, he told The Washington Post in October. Over the next several months, officials gave him some records but responded to most of his requests with denials. They said releasing the documents would jeopardize Sanders's security, Campbell said. That led him to file a lawsuit Sept. 6, alleging officials had violated the state's Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nTwo days later, Sanders called a legislative session to address tax cuts and updates to the state's FOIA laws, claiming new restrictions were needed to protect her and her family. Opponents, including several Republicans, criticized the move as an 'assault on our republic.'\nAs a result, Campbell went back to the documents he'd received and on Sept. 11 posted copies on X. Among them, a record of a $19,029.25 payment to Beckett Events, a Virginia-based events company founded by a Republican political consultant and lobbyist.\nposted copies on X.

According to Campbell, the reimbursement happened several days after he made his FOIA request for the records and a day before the state's responded.\nAdvertisement\nCampbell's tweets sparked a firestorm, which led to national coverage of what became known as #PodiumGate. The controversy led state Sen.

But after mulling for two months how to advance such a package through the political divides in the House, Johnson has revealed little of his strategy, including whether he will try to push the funding for Israel separately or keep it packaged with the aid for the other U.S. allies.\nAs the House has struggled to act, conflicts around the globe have escalated. Israel's military chief said Monday that Israel will respond to Iran's weekend missile strike. And Ukraine's military head over the weekend warned that the battlefield situation in the country's east has 'significantly worsened in recent days,' as warming weather has allowed Russian forces to launch a fresh offensive.\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden, hosting Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala at the White House, called on the House to take up the funding package immediately. 'They have to do it now,' he said.\nSenior Republicans were also growing impatient after Johnson had offered them assurances that he would bring Ukraine aid to the floor. Many have expected him to make that move before the House takes a recess next week. But with no plan set, time was running short for Johnson, who is learning the job of speaker as he goes.\nThe speaker planned to huddle with his fellow House Republicans on Monday evening. But the meeting will be filled with lawmakers strongly opposed on Ukraine: Republican defense hawks, including the top lawmakers on national security committees, who want Johnson to finally take up the national security supplemental package as a bundle, are pitted against populist conservatives who are fiercely opposed to continued support for Kyiv's fight at all.\nAdvertisement\nAhead of the meeting on Monday, Johnson revealed little on his decision after saying over the weekend that he would bring Israel aid to the floor this week. Johnson has expressed support for aiding Ukraine, but ignored questions from reporters on Monday about whether he would bundle funding for the two nations together. The House was also preparing this week to take up a series of bills aimed at sanctioning Iran.\n'The House must rush to Israel's aid as quickly as humanly possible, and the only way to do that is passing the Senate's supplemental ASAP,' said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\nMeanwhile, the White House would 'oppose' a standalone bill that only addresses aid for Israel, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Monday. Democratic leaders are pressuring Johnson to take up a Senate-passed bill that would provide a total of $95 billion for the U.S. allies, as well as humanitarian support for civilians in Gaza and Ukraine.\nAdvertisement\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries pledged in a letter to lawmakers to do 'everything in our legislative power to confront aggression' around the globe, and he cast the situation as similar to the lead-up to World War II.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'The gravely serious events of this past weekend in the Middle East and Eastern Europe underscore the need for Congress to act immediately,' Jeffries said. 'We must take up the bipartisan and comprehensive national security bill passed by the Senate forthwith. This is a Churchill or Chamberlain moment.'\nDuring a private meeting last week, two senior Democrats, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker emerita, and Rep. Steny Hoyer, the former No. 2 leader, encouraged their Democratic colleagues to sign on to a discharge petition that could force the House to vote on the Senate aid package.\nAdvertisement\nPelosi and Hoyer told the Democratic lawmakers that even if they oppose the bill, they could still sign the discharge petition to at least push the package to the floor -- and then vote against it later. The leaders' message was confirmed by two people familiar with the private meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it.\nSo far, 195 lawmakers have signed on to the discharge petition, about a dozen shy of the majority needed to force action on the floor. Many of the progressive Democrats holding out from signing the petition are against U.S. aid to Israel due to the Netanyahu government's assault on Gaza that has killed thousands of civilians.\nOn the right, the House Freedom Caucus said Monday that it opposed 'using the emergency situation in Israel as a bogus justification to ram through Ukraine aid with no offset and no security for our own wide-open borders.'\nAdvertisement\nThe political divides on foreign aid have so far flummoxed Johnson, who rose from the lower ranks of House leadership to become speaker after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was abruptly ousted late last year.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Stephen Groves,Lisa Mascaro","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NF6AXLX3NII65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.2330947,"_id":"5940991f15b41dc63a986f33d3f55ad6"},{"title":"Senate advances renewal of key US surveillance program as detractors seek changes","author":"Farnoush Amiri","published_date":"2024-04-18 21:27:51","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/18/fisa-donald-trump-surveillance-congress-johnson/82a1c4b8-fdca-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The Senate has advanced legislation that would reauthorize a key U.S. surveillance tool as lawmakers and the Biden administration rushed to tamp down fresh concerns about the program violating\u2026","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate advanced legislation Thursday that would reauthorize a key U.S. surveillance tool as lawmakers and the Biden administration rushed to tamp down fresh concerns about the program violating Americans' civil liberties.\nThe bipartisan legislation would reform and extend a section of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act known as Section 702, which U.S. officials say is vital to preventing terrorism, catching spies and disrupting cyberattacks. A bill renewing the program passed the House last week after a dramatic showdown on the floor over whether the FBI should be restricted from using the program to search for Americans' data.\nBut the same concerns that nearly derailed the bill in the House are flaring again in the Senate, with both progressives and conservative lawmakers agitating for further changes. It's a dynamic that could ultimately jeopardize the bill's passage in the upper chamber, though supporters remain optimistic that the program will be reauthorized without much deal.\nAdvertisement\nThe Biden administration has spent the week on Capitol Hill providing classified briefings to senators on the crucial role they say the spy program plays in protecting national security. Officials warn that some of the changes being proposed to the tool could handicap the FBI's efforts to thwart threats to the U.S.\nOpponents remain unfazed and have demanded that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer allow votes on amendments to the legislation that would seek to address what they see as civil liberty loopholes in the bill.\n'The administration is making the case that if there's any changes, it's going to jeopardize the program,' Democratic Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont said Thursday. 'That's asking a lot of the Senate to basically abdicate its responsibility.'\nThe legislation in its current form has the backing of not only the Biden administration but also the leaders of the national security committees in Congress, who have urged detractors to accept the mild reforms to the program. Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that the changes being proposed by the various groups are 'unnecessary' and would 'destroy the purpose' of the program.\nAdvertisement\n'If certain amendments like that were to pass, the bill would go back to the House and I just don't know what posture the House is going to be in to be able to take up legislation because we've got so much going on,' Rubio said.\nThough the spy program is technically set to expire Friday, the Biden administration has said it expects its authority to collect intelligence to remain operational for at least another year, thanks to an opinion earlier this month from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which receives surveillance applications.\nStill, officials say that court approval shouldn't be a substitute for congressional authorization, especially since communications companies could cease cooperation with the government if the program is allowed to lapse.\nOverall skepticism of the government's spy powers has grown dramatically in recent years, particularly on the right. Republicans clashed for months over what a legislative overhaul of the FISA surveillance program should look like, creating divisions that spilled onto the House floor last week as 19 Republicans broke with their party to prevent the bill from coming up for a vote.\nAdvertisement\nIn the end, House Speaker Mike Johnson managed to appease some critics of the reauthorization bill by shortening the extension of the program from five years to two years.\nFirst authorized in 2008, the spy tool has been renewed several times since then as U.S. officials see it as crucial in disrupting terror attacks, cyber intrusions and foreign espionage. It has also produced intelligence that the U.S. has relied on for specific operations.\nBut the administration's efforts to secure reauthorization of the program have repeatedly encountered fierce, and bipartisan, pushback, with Democrats like Sen. Ron Wyden who have long championed civil liberties aligning with Republican supporters of former President Donald Trump, who in a post on Truth Social on Wednesday stated incorrectly that Section 702 had been used to spy on his presidential campaign.\nAdvertisement\nA specific area of concern for lawmakers is the FBI's use of the vast intelligence repository to search for information about Americans and others in the U.S. Though the surveillance program only targets non-Americans in other countries, it also collects communications of Americans when they are in contact with those targeted foreigners.\nIn the past year, U.S. officials have revealed a series of abuses and mistakes by FBI analysts in improperly querying the intelligence repository for information about Americans or others in the U.S., including about a member of Congress and participants in the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Farnoush Amiri","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QAYAARX5ZII65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.2330947,"_id":"846c0acb5174c1dd9d83fa24d85674f9"},{"title":"Changing course, Florida prosecutor suspended by DeSantis to seek reelection","author":"Curt Anderson","published_date":"2024-04-16 14:52:04","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/16/suspended-prosecutor-warren-election-desantis-florida/e35f8630-fc00-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Changing course, a Democratic Florida prosecutor suspended from office by Republican Gov.

Ron DeSantis said Tuesday he will seek reelection while a court battle continues over his 2022 removal from the post.\nAndrew Warren had said in January he would not run this year. But that was before a federal appeals court ruled that a lower court should consider Warren's argument that statements he made about hot-button issues such as abortion were political advocacy protected by the First Amendment. That case remains pending.\nDeSantis cited those statements in suspending Warren, contending he was improperly refusing to uphold and enforce certain laws. The governor appointed Republican Suzy Lopez to replace Warren, and she is running for the position that prosecutes cases in Tampa and surrounding Hillsborough County.\nAdvertisement\nIn his announcement in a video posted on social media, Warren said the governor 'illegally forced me from office' and that he decided to seek a third term even as a judge in Tallahassee considers whether to order his reinstatement later this year.

But his legal expenses continue to be a tremendous burden on his campaign and its allied groups, the latest campaign finance records show, accounting for 26 percent of the spending in March by his political committees.\nNew Federal Election Commission filings released Saturday show that Save America leadership PAC, a Trump-aligned group he has used to pay some of his lawyers, took in $5 million during March and racked up $4.6 million in legal bills for Trump and some of his associates. Throughout this election cycle, Save America has spent the most on legal bills among the groups in Trump's orbit.\nTrump's political committees have spent at least $16.7 million on legal bills so far this year, and owe another $900,000 to various firms as of the end of March, bringing his overall legal fees since starting his campaign to around $86 million.\nAdvertisement\nThose costs have continued to siphon money away from the main super PAC supporting Trump, MAGA Inc., which agreed to refund $60 million to Save America last year. They transferred $52.25 million in 'contribution refunds' back to the leadership PAC in 12 installments that began last May. MAGA Inc. made another transfer of $5 million back to the leadership PAC in March, accounting for almost all of Save America's money flowing in, new reports show.\nFEC reports do not require candidates or their leadership PACs to disclose what legal matters each lawyer or law firm handled when they report payments to those firms.\nStill, there are signs that Trump's efforts to portray his legal troubles as unjust attacks are convincing grass-roots donors to keep giving to his campaign. The FEC data show that at one key moment in the civil fraud case, for example \u2014 March 22, when he was being asked to post a bond of several hundred-million dollars to keep New York authorities from seizing his assets \u2014 donations to his campaign spiked. A New York appeals court panel later said that former president Donald Trump would be allowed to post a reduced bond of $175 million.\nAdvertisement\nOn March 22, Trump wrote an all-caps post on his Truth Social platform claiming that he had almost $500 million in cash, 'a substantial amount of which I intended to use in my campaign for president.' He claimed in the post that the judge in the case was trying to take that money away from him. (Trump's attorneys had said in a March 18 court filing that he was unable to finance an appeal bond of more than $450 million to cover the judgment in the business fraud case.)\nIt was his best fundraising day since his mug shot was taken in Fulton County, Ga., in August. In the last half of March, after clinching the Republican nomination, Trump has averaged over $1.2 million a day via the online fundraising platform WinRed.\nCampaign finance records filed this week show that the joint Trump fundraising effort with the Republican National Committee is raking in big checks, with key donors giving the maximum of more than $800,000. But the GOP nominee's available cash at the end of March still trailed far behind what Biden and allied Democratic groups had stashed.\nAdvertisement\nHere are some other key takeaways from the latest filings:\nA vice-presidential windfall for Kennedy\nNicole Shanahan's personal wealth was one of her chief assets when Robert F. Kennedy Jr. chose her as his running mate for his long-shot independent bid for the White House. FEC records show that Shanahan helped to replenish Kennedy's campaign treasury a day after joining the ticket on March 26 \u2014 donating $2 million to the campaign. The money is a much-needed infusion that could bolster Kennedy's efforts to get on the ballot in as many states as possible. As a candidate, Shanahan can donate an unlimited amount of money to the campaign.\nBefore joining the ticket, Shanahan had donated the maximum of $6,600 to Kennedy's campaign. Her venture firm, Planeta Management LLC gave $500,000 in July to Common Sense PAC, another outside group supporting Kennedy. Planeta Management LLC also gave $4 million in January to American Values 2024, a super PAC supporting Kennedy \u2014 money that helped pay for a pro-Kennedy ad during the Super Bowl.\nPlaneta Management LLC also gave $4 million in January to American Values 2024, a super PAC supporting Kennedy \u2014 money that helped pay for a pro-Kennedy ad during the Super Bowl.\nDemocrats tout financial advantage as they seek House control\nReports filed to the FEC this week showed the Democrats extending their fundraising advantage well beyond the presidential race to many key areas in the battle for control of the House and Senate.\nto many key areas in the battle for control of the House and Senate.\nAdvertisement\nThe Republican National Committee, which was struggling to raise cash throughout the GOP primary, doubled its cash on hand, ending March with $22 million in cash. But the Democratic National Committee still has double that amount in its war chest \u2014 reporting $45.2 million in cash at the end of March.\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee, which is focused on House races, had nearly $56 million in cash on hand at the end of March, significantly less than the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which had $71.1 million in cash.\nThe other influential groups involved in the competitive House races are also raising money at a fast clip on both sides of the aisle. The GOP-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC reported that it had nearly $68.6 million in cash to spend on key races at the end of March, while the House Majority PAC reported $63.2 million in cash remaining at the end of the period in filings on Saturday.\nAdvertisement\nThough Senate Republicans are facing a much more favorable map and managed to recruit several wealthy contenders in key races, some of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents are amassing huge war chests. That group includes Sen. Jon Tester (Mont.), who had nearly $12.7 million in cash at the end of March; and Sen. Sherrod Brown (Ohio), who had nearly $16 million in cash at the end of the period.

Biden endorsed the package and last month said he would sign an earlier version of the TikTok legislation that the House passed.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2020, Trump issued an executive order to ban TikTok if its parent company did not sell it within 45 days. The order was later blocked in court.\n'As far as TikTok is concerned, we're banning them from the United States,' Trump said in July 2020.\nBut Trump's public stance on the social media app swung in the other direction in recent months, with the former president arguing in March that a TikTok ban would only empower Facebook, which he has called 'an enemy of the people.' Trump's post on Monday appeared to be the first time he explicitly referenced Biden while railing against proposals to force a TikTok sale.\nAsked for comment on Trump's post, Biden's reelection campaign referred to the White House, which denied it was working to shut down TikTok.\n'We've been clear: we do not want to ban apps like TikTok,' White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said in a statement. 'What we want \u2014 and what the legislation we support would do \u2014 is ensure that TikTok becomes owned by an American company so that our and our children's sensitive personal data stays here instead of going to China and so that Americans' understandings and views can't be manipulated by algorithms potentially controlled by the [People's Republic of China].'\nAdvertisement\nTrump accused Biden of wanting to shut down TikTok to 'help his friends over at Facebook' become more powerful and 'be able to continue to fight, perhaps illegally, the Republican Party.' Under the bill passed on a 360-58 vote by the House Saturday, TikTok's owner would have up to 360 days to divest, meaning any ban is not likely to happen until after Election Day.\nThe chamber in March passed an earlier version of the bill trying to force a TikTok sale on a shorter timeline, but it has languished in the Senate. The latest proposal's attachment to the foreign aid package could boost its chances in the upper chamber.\nTrump's reversal on TikTok raised questions about his relationship with Jeff Yass, a Republican megadonor from Pennsylvania who is also a TikTok investor. Trump, who is working to cultivate more heavyweight GOP donors as Biden builds a large fundraising advantage, met earlier this year with Yass but said afterward that they did not discuss TikTok.\nAdvertisement\nA former top aide in Trump's White House, Kellyanne Conway, is advocating for TikTok in Congress and has spoken to Trump about the importance of defending the application, The Washington Post reported last month. Conway is being paid by the Club for Growth, the conservative group that counts Yass as one of its biggest donors.\nTrump has called TikTok a national security threat but also touted its popularity, saying in a March interview with CNBC that there is 'a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok.'\n'As you know, I was at a point where I could have gotten it done if I wanted to,' Trump said, suggesting he ultimately wanted to leave the matter to Congress. 'I sort of said, \u2018You guys decide, you make that decision,' because it's a tough decision to make.

Bob Graham, who gained national prominence as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks and as an early critic of the Iraq war, has died. He was 87.\nGraham's family announced the death Tuesday in a statement posted on X by his daughter Gwen Graham.\n'We are deeply saddened to report the passing of a visionary leader, dedicated public servant, and even more importantly, a loving husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather,' the family said.\nGraham, who served three terms in the Senate, made an unsuccessful bid for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, emphasizing his opposition to the Iraq invasion.\nBut his bid was delayed by heart surgery in January 2003, and he was never able to gain enough traction with voters to catch up, bowing out that October. He didn't seek reelection in 2004 and was replaced by Republican Mel Martinez.\nAdvertisement\nGraham was a man of many quirks. He perfected the 'workdays' political gimmick of spending a day doing various jobs from horse stall mucker to FBI agent and kept a meticulous diary, noting almost everyone he spoke with, everything he ate, the TV shows he watched and even his golf scores.\nGraham said the notebooks were a working tool for him and he was reluctant to describe his emotions or personal feelings in them.\n'I review them for calls to be made, memos to be dictated, meetings I want to follow up on and things people promise to do,' he said.\nGraham was among the earliest opponents of the Iraq war, saying it diverted America's focus on the battle against terrorism centered in Afghanistan. He was also critical of President George W. Bush for failing to have an occupation plan in Iraq after the U.S. military threw out Saddam Hussein in 2003.\nAdvertisement\nGraham said Bush took the United States into the war by exaggerating claims of the danger presented by the Iraqi weapons of destruction that were never found. He said Bush distorted intelligence data and argued it was more serious than the sexual misconduct issues that led the House to impeach President Bill Clinton in the late 1990s. It led him to launch his short, abortive presidential bid.\n'The quagmire in Iraq is a distraction that the Bush administration, and the Bush administration alone, has created,' Graham said in 2003.\nDuring his 18 years in Washington, Graham worked well with colleagues from both parties, particularly Florida Republican Connie Mack during their dozen years together in the Senate.\nAs a politician, few were better. Florida voters hardly considered him the wealthy Harvard-educated attorney that he was.\nAdvertisement\nGraham's political career spanned five decades, beginning with his election to the Florida House of Representatives in 1966.\nHe won a state Senate seat in 1970 and then was elected governor in 1978. He was re-elected in 1982. Four years later, he won the first of three terms in the U.S. Senate when he ousted incumbent Republican Paula Hawkins.\nGraham remained widely popular with Florida voters \u2014 winning reelection by wide margins in 1992 and 1998 when he carried 63 of 67 counties. In that latter election, he defeated Charlie Crist, who later served as a Republican governor from 2007 to 2011.\n'He blew me out of the water, and I came to know even more so why during the course of the campaign,' Crist said Tuesday night. 'I learned to respect him even more than I already had, and love him for the good, decent man that he was.'\nAdvertisement\nCrist, who has since switched parties and most recently served as a U.S. representative, said Graham was an influence on him.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'I always felt that when he was governor, that he was trying to govern for the people of Florida \u2014 not in any way political or partisan \u2014 and I took that to heart and tried to, in some small way, emulate it,' Crist said.\nHouse Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi called Graham 'a patriotic American' and thanked him for his 'distinguished public service.' She highlighted his work on the inquiry into 9/11 and said he 'bravely opposed entry into the war in Iraq.'\n'He brought his love for his family and for his state of Florida to the Senate, where he served with immense dignity and courage,' she said in a statement Tuesday.\nEven when in Washington, Graham never took his eye off the state and the leadership in Tallahassee.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Gov. Jeb Bush and the Republican-controlled Legislature eliminated the Board of Regents in 2001, Graham saw it as a move to politicize the state university system. He led a successful petition drive the next year for a state constitutional amendment that created the Board of Governors to assume the regents' role.\nDaniel Robert Graham was born Nov. 9, 1936, in Coral Gables, where his father, Ernest 'Cap' Graham, had moved from South Dakota and established a large dairy operation. Young Bob milked cows, built fences and scooped manure as a teenager. One of his half-brothers, Phillip Graham, was publisher of The Washington Post and Newsweek until he took his own life in 1963, just a year after Bob Graham's graduation from Harvard Law.\nGraham was president of the student body at Miami Senior High School and attended the University of Florida, graduating in 1959.\nAdvertisement\nIn 1966 he was elected to the Florida Legislature, where he focused largely on education and health care issues.\nGraham got off to a shaky start as Florida's chief executive, and was dubbed 'Gov. Jello' for some early indecisiveness. He shook that label through his handling of several serious crises.\nAs governor he also signed numerous death warrants, founded the Save the Manatee Club with entertainer Jimmy Buffett and led efforts to establish several environmental programs.\nGraham pushed through a bond program to buy beaches and barrier islands threatened by development and started the Save Our Everglades program to protect the state's water supply, wetlands and endangered species.\nGraham also was known for his 408 'workdays,' including stints as a housewife, boxing ring announcer, flight attendant and arson investigator. They grew out of a teaching stint as a member of the Florida Senate's Education Committee and then morphed into a campaign gimmick that helped him relate to the average voter.\nAdvertisement\n'This has been a very important part of my development as a public official, my learning at a very human level what the people of Florida expect, what they want, what their aspirations are and then trying to interpret that and make it policy that will improve their lives' said Graham in 2004 as he completed his final job as a Christmas gift wrapper.\nAfter leaving public life in 2005, Graham spent much of his time at a public policy center named after him at the University of Florida and pushing the Legislature to require more civics classes in the state's public schools.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Associated Press","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BR4INEH4MMI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.0828547,"_id":"52768b3dc35d6ab8126f6e0589e629c0"},{"title":"The next president may be chosen by indifference","author":"Philip Bump","published_date":"2024-04-22 14:54:07","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/22/voter-interest-polling-biden-trump","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Voters are unusually not interested in the presidential race.

Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nIt's a small sample size, certainly, but the point is useful to consider: For all of the buildup of presidential politics and the years-long conversation centered on the determination of the most powerful person in politics, that conversation has been awfully repetitive recently. And, as polling from NBC News suggests, Americans are not enthusiastic about engaging in it once again.\nOn Sunday, the network published the results of a national poll that asked respondents, among other things, to evaluate how interested they were in the election on a scale from 1 to 10. Fewer than 2 in 3 selected 9 or 10 \u2014 lower than any similar measurement by NBC's pollsters this late in a presidential election year since at least 2008.\nAmong Republicans, 70 percent indicated they were very interested in the election. Among Democrats, only 65 percent. Among independents? Fewer than half.\nThis isn't terribly surprising. It is consistently the case that independents \u2014 generally meaning independents who tend to vote for one party or the other and independents who don't \u2014 are less politically engaged and less likely to vote. Comparisons of national polling conducted by the Pew Research Center with Census Bureau estimates of the electorate show how much of the nonvoter pool in each recent election has been made up of independents.\nIn 2016 and 2020, at least two-thirds of partisans voted, according to this analysis. About 6 in 10 independents who lean toward a party did, while about half of non-leaning independents cast ballots.\nAdvertisement\nBut there's an important asterisk this year: Those less likely to vote are also much more likely to support Trump.\nYou can see it in the NBC News data. Biden leads by nine points with those who voted in 2020 and 2022. Among those who voted in neither of those elections? Trump leads by 22 points .\n22 points.\nIt shows up elsewhere, too. The Harvard Youth Poll released last week found a single-digit gap between Trump and Biden among all Americans under 30 \u2014 but a nearly 20-point lead for Biden among those most likely to vote.\nThe youth vote is interesting in part because it overlaps with independent voter identification. Lots of independent voters are young voters and vice versa, so apathy among independents correlates to apathy among younger voters. It's also interesting because \u2014 revisiting the point made at the start of this article \u2014 voters 29 and younger have never been able to vote for a non-Trump Republican for president.\nResearch by University of Pennsylvania political scientist Dan Hopkins published by 538 earlier this month used an Associated Press poll conducted by NORC, previously the National Opinion Research Center, to compare support in the general election with voting frequency. The same pattern prevailed: Those who vote less often are more likely to back Trump \u2014 including among the Black and Hispanic voter pools that have been a focus of attention since 2020.\nThis suggests that Gallup's finding that young and non-White voters were shifting right over the past few years might be a function of less politically engaged people.\nViewing the same point through a different lens: Pew's analysis of recent voting habits shows that Black and Hispanic voters are also more likely to have not voted in recent elections.\nThis sets up a weird dynamic. The Washington Post reported earlier this month that some Democratic groups were balking at registering younger voters \u2014 usually a solid party constituency \u2014 out of fears they might be adding Trump voters to the pool. The expected pattern in which Democrats benefited from higher turnout might, this year, be inverted.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Philip Bump,National Columnist","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/56CEQMK6ZTSGHBQSVCK32EHOTI.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.0344453,"_id":"a8659e8277d84b1d6f7ae52f70524e10"},{"title":"Politics shouldn't be a roadblock to good environmental policy","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-19 19:05:37","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/19/pollution-politics-dc-climate-murdoch-abortion","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Plus, Post readers on visiting D.C., the climate and abortion.","summary":"Regarding the April 14 editorial, 'A \u2018climate club' could get China to clean up faster':\nWhy doesn't the Editorial Board want to hold heavy polluters such as China accountable without letting politics get in the way? There are two major misconceptions in the piece.\nFirst and foremost, the board assumes that the World Trade Organization requires a domestic carbon tax for compliance. The claim that a carbon price limited to imports would face insurmountable legal challenges and provoke retaliatory actions remains untested and relies on narrow interpretations of WTO policy. Analyses conducted by the Climate Leadership Council suggest that a climate and trade policy without a domestic carbon tax would comply with WTO regulations by leveraging existing domestic environmental regulations and addressing international emergencies.\nAdvertisement\nSecond, the board assumes Republicans resist engaging on climate even if it's through market-based mechanisms and trade policy. Democrats don't have a monopoly on environmental policy. The Foreign Pollution Fee Act, which I co-introduced with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), proposes a fee on certain imported industrial and energy products based on their emissions intensity relative to similar domestically produced goods. Former U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer, who served multiple Republican administrations, has been a consistent champion in leveraging U.S. trade policy to make China pay for its pollution.\nThe Foreign Pollution Fee Act would not only reduce global emissions but would also stimulate job creation, foster innovation, strengthen global supply-chain security and promote fair competition for U.S. companies on the international stage \u2014 all without imposing a domestic carbon tax, which I adamantly oppose.\nGiven the myth-busting above, it is essential to avoid needlessly politicizing the issue by maligning Republicans. Such actions undermine the potential for cooperation in Congress to develop meaningful policies that advance America's national economic interests and hold the world's largest polluters accountable.\nAdvertisement\nBill Cassidy , Washington\nBill Cassidy, Washington\nThe writer, a Republican, represents Louisiana in the U.S. Senate.\nThe writer, a Republican, represents Louisiana in the U.S. Senate.\nA change in perspective\nA recent family trip to Washington had a much more powerful effect on me than usual. I am always inspired when I go to D.C., but this trip was special.\nLike a lot of people over the past few years, I had absorbed the negativity and cynicism projected by many politicians and much of the media, but being in Washington changed my perception. Everyone I saw seemed so vibrant and positive and hopeful. There was something in the air and it wasn't just the cherry blossoms (which were magnificent!).\nThat something was something deeply American: Possibility. Cooperation. Innovation. Hope. Renewal. Transformation.\nIn one intersection, there were dozens of naval bronzes, alive with the bravery, fortitude and creative genius of Americans in the face of mortal danger. And the buildings all around me \u2014 the steps and the pillars and the tall windows \u2014 radiated a history of obstacles overcome, of compromises made, of forward positive movement toward a more inclusive nation.\nAdvertisement\nD.C. spoke to me. It transformed my perspective, from small and full of fear to large and full of hope.\nAnd my newly made and more hopeful perspective has led me to believe we can overcome our country's problems. We have overcome much greater threats.\nWe are not destined to bow down to tyrants. We are not destined to lose our democratic soul. We are not destined to the dustbin of history, as many would have us believe. America has power in reserve that we can draw on because that power is based on confidence and diversity and hope.\nThe primary task then is to project this confidence outward and reach those who do not feel it.\nToday, a lot of working-class people feel forgotten. They don't have this hope. They do the day-to-day, hands-on work of our country but do not feel they receive credit or are appreciated. This atmosphere fuels division, acrimony and distrust.\nAdvertisement\nWith the election almost here, President Biden can make workers feel less invisible and make them feel appreciated, but I think he has to talk about them every day.\nThe more Mr. Biden points out what workers contribute, the more he highlights their value to our country, the more he emphasizes how important they are, the more remembered workers will feel. The more appreciated they will feel. Feeling appreciated is powerful. It could help to lift our country up, to push back against our division and acrimony.\nI believe we can pull ourselves together as a nation and create a positive, innovative and fulfilling future. A future in which all of our children can achieve their full potential.\nDaniel Wasik , Fanwood, N.J.\nDaniel Wasik, Fanwood, N.J.\nThe climate is everyone's family business\nIt's little wonder that Kathryn Murdoch 'steers clear of discussing family business,' as reported in the April 10 Style article 'A climate of optimism.' She is concerned that today's youths have 'the sense that the future is doomed and we're helpless to do anything about it.' One reason scientists have been raising the alarm about the dangers of climate change is to counter the climate denialism of Fox News.\nAdvertisement\nOver the years, Fox News hosts such as Tucker Carlson, Jesse Watters, Laura Ingraham and others have tried to debunk the scientific consensus on climate change. According to Media Matters, 'On a near-daily basis, Fox News hosts, anchors, and guests spew misinformation and false narratives aimed at tanking efforts to address the climate crisis.'

Each claimed momentum heading into the next phase of the contest.\nAs May 14 approaches, attention is building on what had largely been seen as a sleepy contest for a reliably blue seat until Hogan launched a surprise bid two months ago. Endorsements are flying, yards signs are popping up and airwaves are thrumming with campaign messaging \u2014 and money.\nThis week alone saw the liberal super PAC Fight Corporate Monopolies launch the cycle's first negative ad, swiping at Trone's business practices and comparing him to former Republican president Donald Trump. On Wednesday, Hogan deployed a nearly $1 million television ad buy half bankrolled by national Republicans eager to flip the open Senate seat red.\nAdvertisement\nNational dollars are flowing into a contest that had been largely shaped by Trone's deep pockets. He has loaned his campaign at least $41.7 million since the start of the primary race, campaign finance records show.\nAlsobrooks, an underdog in the race, according to recent polls, repeatedly focused attention on Trone's fortunes and interrogated his argument that self-funding helps insulate him from special interests \u2014 repeating a line of attack she and her surrogates have raised about him 'buying' the seat.\nDuring the debate, she took aim at contributions Trone has made in a personal capacity and through his company, Total Wine & More, to conservative leaders such as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) who have worked to quash abortion access.\nThat fact, she said, contrasts with a record of giving that Trone has touted. He helped establish an abortion clinic in Western Maryland near the border with West Virginia after that state effectively shut down the procedure.\nAdvertisement\n'He cannot claim credit for the good his company does and distance himself from the bad that it does,' Alsobrooks said.\nTrone, in turn, swatted at her accusations by insinuating her interests would lie with companies that have supported her campaign, referencing by name Exxon, Pfizer and Cigna.\n'When you take the money \u2026 then they must expect something [of politicians],' Trone said. 'They're not charities.'\nAlsobrooks has brought in more individual contributions than any other candidate so far, and filings show she has just under $3.2 million on hand. Still, Alsobrooks's performance Friday carried extra weight in a race with lopsided resources at a time when she is seeking to boost name recognition.\nPolls released over the past six weeks show Trone consistently leading her, and Hogan, who left office last year with high favorability ratings, leading them both.\nHogan has maintained that he is an underdog in a state where registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans 2 to 1. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll conducted in March found that while Hogan is better known than Trone and Alsobrooks, he faces a crosscurrent Democrats hope to exploit: Maryland voters said by a 20-point margin that they prefer Democratic control of the U.S. Senate.\nHogan was out front in a poll released this week by FOX45 News, the Baltimore Sun and the University of Baltimore and conducted by OpinionWorks. The results show Trone leading Alsobrooks, 49 percent to 28 percent.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Trone on Friday detailed a bipartisan spirit he said helped him compete with Hogan, Alsobrooks took the opportunity to question a record of political giving to the man he hopes to beat. In 2014, eight of Trone's businesses gave $30,000 to Hogan in an effort to help him get rid of campaign debt, The Post reported.\n'What we don't need is a Larry Hogan donor trying to take on Larry Hogan in the fall,' Alsobrooks said.\nAmong the sharpest jabs Friday was an exchange on endorsements, with Trone noting he had secured the support of prominent politicians from the county Alsobrooks represents.\nOn Thursday, he received an endorsement from Aisha Braveboy (D), the Prince George's County state's attorney who holds Alsobrooks's former position. Democratic Prince George's County Council members Krystal Oriadha and Edward Burroughs III \u2014 both of whom have endorsed Trone and been critical of Alsobrooks in the past \u2014 were in the studio Friday, at times huddling around Trone during commercial breaks.\nAdvertisement\n'The folks that really matter the most are those that know you the best,' Trone said. 'Prince George's County supports us. The list goes on and on and on.'\nAlsobrooks has picked up Democratic heavyweights from the local to the federal level. Among her supporters are Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Rep. Jamie Raskin and former Prince George's county executive Rushern Baker IV.\nThe pair didn't spar over topics such as the Israel-Hamas war, on which they both agree that Hamas should be defeated, a cease-fire is needed and that hostages must be released. They also said cities should have access to federal data currently withheld from the public to enhance law enforcement's ability to trace guns and quell crime.\nand that hostages must be released. They also said cities should have access to federal data currently withheld from the public to enhance law enforcement's ability to trace guns and quell crime.\nBoth contenders have made protecting abortion rights a centerpiece of their campaign, tapping into an issue that has galvanized voters since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the constitutional right to abortion.\nprotecting abortion rights a centerpiece of their campaign, tapping into an issue that has galvanized voters since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the constitutional right to abortion.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAdvertisement\nThey have sought to paint Hogan, who would not say in an interview whether he would codify abortion protections in federal law, as an enemy of reproductive rights. Hogan said he would not vote for a national abortion ban, but he also said he would not take a position on hypothetical legislation that would codify Roe v. Wade .\nRoe v. Wade.\nCracks in their positions appeared when asked about repealing the death penalty.\nAlsobrooks supported the death sentence of a man convicted of killing four people including two children when she was Prince George's state's attorney, a panelist noted. But as the federal government reconsiders the death penalty, Alsobrooks noted that she, too, has evolved on the issue.\nMarylanders have decided that the death penalty is no longer the law of the land in Maryland, 'and I agree with Maryland voters,' Alsobrooks said. I can tell you that I would also not support the death penalty on the federal level. \u2026 Having said that, what I believe is that anyone who harms a child or who murders a child in particular deserves the stiffest penalty available to that person. And right now in Maryland, that penalty is life without parole.\nIn his rebuttal, Trone emphasized his steadfast opposition to it. 'It's clearly cruel and unusual punishment, and it's clearly racist,' he said.\nEarly voting in Maryland's Democratic and Republican primaries begins May 2.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Lateshia Beachum","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5GHNNWD7CZ4I7QHP7FRW3GDSBQ.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.906803,"_id":"89cc04b87cc68c17e60b443a23bd156c"},{"title":"Why opioid settlement money is paying county employees' salaries","author":"Aneri Pattani","published_date":"2024-04-16 11:51:58","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/16/why-opioid-settlement-money-is-paying-county-employees-salaries","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Billions of dollars in opioid settlements are pouring into state and local government coffers.

But either the inability or unwillingness of Loftis to help untangle the mess has left many unanswered questions, Republican Sen. Larry Grooms said.\nLoftis' plan, put in writing earlier this month after senators questioned if he was following transparency laws, was stopped after an emergency meeting with the governor that included a phone call from the state's top law enforcement official, Grooms said.\nAdvertisement\nLoftis' office said the treasurer warned senators about the dangers of posting the report and was talking to officials in the Department of Administration who agreed it was dangerous to do so without heavy redactions.\nThe report included the general fund names, account numbers and software type that would allow hackers to map their way into state accounts.\nGrooms said that in his mind, the damage is done and Loftis, a four-term Republican, needs to resign. But the report doesn't reach that conclusion because Republican Gov. Henry McMaster asked that Loftis be given time to work with a task force that's also investigating the missing money.\n'Why on earth would he threaten the state's finances?' Grooms said 'Either he was off his rocker or he was sending a message that if you try to remove me, I'm going to destroy the state's financial system.'\nAdvertisement\nLoftis' office said in a statement that the Senate report is 'very misleading.'\nHe said he would not read the report or watch the Senate on Tuesday but instead rely on staff to fill him in on any useful information.\nSenators 'can say and do anything they like and there are no consequences,' Loftis said.\n'It should be obvious to everyone that the subcommittee would like to overturn the election of an executive branch official and install a puppet to control the funds of the state,' he added.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe Senate report also said more investigation is needed into whether Loftis pressured the state auditor to take out an item in his draft report saying the state's accounts were out of balance for a short time, as well as whether the his office sold investments at a loss to make up the deficit.\nThe governor created the task force, led by the Department of Administration, that includes Loftis' office, the state auditor and the Comptroller General's Office. The Comptroller General's Office has been under the guidance of an interim director since May 2023 after the elected director resigned over an accounting error that double-counted nearly $4 billion for higher education.\nAdvertisement\nGov. McMaster asked the task force to report by July 1 where the $1.8 billion came from and where it is supposed to go.\nSouth Carolina can't spend the money until officials figure that out. It may belong to the federal government or a trust account, and thus can't be used for things like roads or teacher raises. And the state may even have to pay interest on the funds.\nThe Senate also wants to spend $4 million on a forensic investigation of the Treasurer's Office account.\nMcMaster wants to give Loftis a chance to solve the mess, spokesman Brandon Charochak said in a statement.\n'The governor believes the public's confidence is best maintained when elected officials and agencies work together to solve problems through collaboration, cooperation and communication. In that spirit, the governor suggested to Senator Grooms that this group be given some time to work,' Charochak said.\nAdvertisement\nGrooms said he learned of the account shortly after interim Comptroller General Brian Gaines discovered it last October. He asked for help from Grooms' subcommittee, and it requested information about all accounts under a certain fund number. Pages and pages came back with zeros, except for one account with $1.8 billion.\nGrooms thinks Loftis was trying to cover for elected Comptroller General Richard Eckstrom, who resigned last year, or vice versa. State law requires the two offices keep books as a safeguard.\n'Instead of checking on each other, they were cloaking each other's deficiencies,' Grooms said.\nThe subcommittee's thoughts on Loftis were unanimous. Democratic Sen. Margie Bright Matthews said people should be insulted not just by the incompetence of Loftis, but his insolence, including a six-hour public meeting with senators where he threw a pen on a lectern, told senators many things weren't his problem and threatened to walk out.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jeffrey Collins","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G2JMRFX4IAI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.812605,"_id":"b997b2306b9af84832cbf54516f2e023"},{"title":"DeSantis tweaks Florida book challenge law, blames liberal activist who wanted Bible out of schools","author":"Brendan Farrington","published_date":"2024-04-16 21:42:59","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2024/04/16/florida-ron-desantis-education-book-bans/4ac5425e-fc3a-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has acknowledged that a law he enacted two years ago making it easier for people to challenge books in schools and libraries has caused problems for school districts","summary":"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Two years ago, Democrats repeatedly and forcefully warned Republicans and Gov. Ron DeSantis that a new law making it easier to challenge school books was so broadly worded that it would create havoc across the state.\nNow they can say, 'I told you so.'\nDeSantis backtracked on the 2022 law on Tuesday when he signed a bill narrowing its focus. He blamed liberal activists for abusing the law, not the citizens whose objections to certain books account for the majority of book removals from school libraries and classrooms.\n'The idea that someone can use the parents rights and the curriculum transparency to start objecting to every single book to try to make a mockery of this is just wrong,' DeSantis said the day before the bill signing. 'That's performative. That's political.'\nCoincidentally, PEN America, a group that fights book bans, issued a report Tuesday saying Florida is responsible for 72% of the books that have been pulled from the nation's schools in the first half of the current school year.\nAdvertisement\nThe organization said liberal activists are not the ones who should be blamed for abusing the law.\n'The majority of books that we see being removed are books that talk about LBTQ+ identities, that include characters of color, that talk about race and racism, that include depictions of sexual experiences in the most broadest interpretation of that understanding,' said Kasey Meehan, Pen America's Freedom to Read program director.\nThose challenges are being made by conservative individuals and groups such as Moms For Liberty, Meehan said.\nThe original law allowed any person \u2014 parent or not, district resident or not \u2014 to challenge books as often as they wanted. Once challenged, a book has to be pulled from shelves until the school district resolves the complaint. The new law limits people who don't have students in a school district to one challenge per month.\nAdvertisement\nThe PEN America report says Florida is responsible for 3,135 of the 4,349 school book bans in the United States so far this school year. Just this week in conservative Clay County, one person challenged 40 books, Meehan said.\nBefore dropping out of the Republican presidential primary, DeSantis campaigned heavily on his education platform, including the law giving people more power to challenge books.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'It's just a big mess that DeSantis created and now he's trying to disown it, but I don't know if he'll be able to distance himself from this because he campaigned on it so hard,' said House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell.\nIt's not the only example of the tough-talking governor having to make adjustments to ideology he championed while seeking the White House.\nHe also has made concessions in the settlement of several lawsuits involving the state and Walt Disney World. The dispute between them erupted in 2022 after the company spoke out against a DeSantis-backed law that opponents dubbed 'Don't Say Gay.' The law bans classroom lessons on gender identity and sexual orientation.\nAdvertisement\nThe Associated Press asked DeSantis' office for examples of liberal activists abusing the law and it provided one: Chaz Stevens, a South Florida resident who has often lampooned government. Stevens raised challenges in dozens of school districts over the Bible, dictionaries and thesauruses.\nThe change to the law 'ensures that book challenges are limited for individuals, like Chaz, who do not have children with access to the school district's materials,' DeSantis spokeswoman Julia Friedland said in an email. She didn't reply to follow-up emails requesting more examples.\nStevens, who 11 years ago made national news when he installed a Festivus pole made out of beer cans across from a nativity scene displayed in the Capitol, was delighted DeSantis' office singled him out.\n'When they need to make stupid stupider, they send me up. I'm part comedian, I'm part activist, I'm part artist. I just want a better society,' Stevens said. 'I'm an idiot, but a smart guy at the same time.'\nAdvertisement\nWhile DeSantis' predecessor, current Republican Sen. Rick Scott, allowed what was then called the 'free speech zone' in the Capitol rotunda, the rules changed under DeSantis and new barriers were put in place to use Capitol space for political expression. The League of Women Voters and Stevens are among the applicants who have been denied access under the new rules.\n'I didn't realize that I have the power of millions!' Stevens said. 'I'm just one guy. I'm an agitator. I know my role in this.'\nDriskell pointed out that DeSantis was warned there would be problems when the book ban law passed in 2022.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brendan Farrington","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IZKOFRH4HII65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.812605,"_id":"9d37fa83e5d318a5cc11b6eec9e40bf6"},{"title":"Trump to meet with Polish president Duda as NATO leaders call for additional support for Ukraine","author":"Steve Peoples","published_date":"2024-04-16 23:39:26","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/16/trump-poland-duda-election/8fbdf42c-fc4a-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda on Wednesday in New York","summary":"NEW YORK \u2014 Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda on Wednesday in New York.\nThe planned dinner meeting, confirmed by a person familiar with the matter, comes as European leaders prepare for the possibility that Trump might win the November election and return to the White House.

All are testing the proposition he made to voters during his 2020 campaign that a Biden White House would bring a measure of calm and renewed respect for the United States on the world stage.\nForeign policy matters are not typically the top issue for American voters. This November is expected to be no different, with the economy and border security carrying greater resonance.\nBut public polling suggests that overseas concerns could have more relevance with voters than in any U.S. election since 2006, when voter dissatisfaction over the Iraq War was a major factor in the Republican Party losing 30 House and six Senate seats.\n'We see this issue rising in saliency, and at the same time we're seeing voter appraisals of President Biden's handling of foreign affairs being quite negative,' said Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. 'That combination is not a great one for Biden.'\nAdvertisement\nBiden has staked enormous political capital on his response to the Israel-Hamas war as well as his administration's backing of Ukraine as it fends off a Russian invasion.\nThe apparent de-escalation of tensions between Israel and Iran also comes as Congress moves closer to approving $95 billion in wartime aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, a measure that Biden has pushed for as Ukrainian forces run desperately short on arms.\nAfter months of delay in the face of the threat of ouster by his party's right flank, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pushed the package forward and final House passage was expected this weekend. That prospect \u2014 and a surge of weaponry to the front lines \u2014 is giving the White House renewed hope that Ukraine can right the ship after months of setbacks in the war.\nBiden also has made bolstering relations in the Indo-Pacific a central focus of his foreign policy agenda, looking to win allies and build ties as China becomes a more formidable economic and military competitor.\nAdvertisement\nBut Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have an argument to make that Biden's policies have contributed to U.S. dealing with myriad global quandaries, said Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at the Washington think tank Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.\nRepublicans have criticized Biden's unsuccessful efforts earlier in his term to revive a nuclear deal with Iran brokered by the Obama administration and abandoned by Trump, saying that would embolden Tehran. The agreement had provided Iran with billions in sanctions relief in exchange for the country agreeing to roll back its nuclear program.\nGOP critics have sought to connect Russia's invasion of Ukraine to Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan and they blame the Obama administration for not offering a strong enough response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's 2014 seizure of Crimea.\nAdvertisement\n'You can make an intellectual case, a policy case of how we got from Point A to B to C to D and ended up in a world on fire,' said Goldberg, a national security official in the Trump administration. 'People may not care about how we got here, but they do care that we are here.'\nPolling suggests Americans' concerns about foreign policy issues are growing, and there are mixed signs of whether Biden's pitch as a steady foreign policy hand is resonating with voters.\nAbout 4 in 10 U.S. adults named foreign policy topics in an open-ended question that asked people to share up to five issues for the government to work on in 2024, according to The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll published in January. That's about twice as many as mentioned the topic in an AP- NORC poll conducted in the previous year.\nAdvertisement\nFurther, about 47% of Americans said they believe Biden has hurt relations with other countries, according to an AP-NORC poll published this month. Similarly, 47% said the same about Trump.\nBiden was flying high in the first six months of his presidency, with the American electorate largely approving of his performance and giving him high marks for his handling of the economy and the coronavirus pandemic. But the president saw his approval ratings tank in the aftermath of the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in August 2021 and they never fully recovered.\nNow, Biden finds himself dealing with uncertainty of two wars. Both could shadow him right up to Election Day.\nWith the Israel-Hamas war, Republicans pillory him as being not being adequately supportive of Israel, and the left wing of his party harshly criticize the president, who has shown displeasure with Netanyahu's prosecution of the war, for not doing more to force the Israelis to safeguard Palestinian lives.\nAdvertisement\nAfter Israel's carefully calibrated strikes on Iran, Middle East tensions have entered a 'gray area' that all parties must navigate carefully, said Aaron David Miller, an adviser on Middle East issues in Republican and Democratic administrations.\n'Does what has occurred over the last 10 days strengthen each sides' risk-readiness or has it made them drop back from the brink and revert into risk aversion?' Miller said. 'Israel and Iran got away with striking each other's territory without a major escalation. What conclusions do they draw from that? Is the conclusion that we might be able to do this again? Or is it we really dodged a bullet here and we have to be exceedingly careful.'\nIsrael and Hamas appear far away from an agreement on a temporary cease-fire that would facilitate the release of remaining hostages in Hamas-controlled Gaza and help get aid into the territory.

That framing could scramble expectations about the salience of this trial for voters considering whether to return Trump to the White House in November.\nThat framing could scramble expectations about the salience of this trial for voters considering whether to return Trump to the White House in November.\n'With these trials, there's the 12-person jury, and then there's 120 million Americans that are gonna vote that form their own jury on this,' said Jim Kessler, executive vice president of policy for Third Way, a center-left policy group in Washington.

In the general election, it is far less clear how they will affect voters' attitudes.\nMany strategists view the New York case as the least damaging proceeding against Trump and are skeptical that further attention to his character will move the dial for voters already willing to look past 'Access Hollywood' and more. But the sordid details of the Manhattan trial will train public attention on allegations that could matter at the margins.\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's team said they wanted to play the recording of Trump making lewd remarks about groping women on the set of 'Access Hollywood.' They pushed to reference the women who came forward after the tape's disclosure to accuse Trump of sexual misconduct. Prosecutors also said they wanted to describe a previous hush money scheme with a Playboy model, Karen McDougal, and to specify that during that alleged encounter, Trump's wife was pregnant.\nsaid they wanted to describe a previous hush money scheme with a Playboy model, Karen McDougal, and to specify that during that alleged encounter, Trump's wife was pregnant.\nThe judge, Juan M.

Trials can have unexpected twists. Trump will have his turn to respond. A New York Times/Siena poll this month found that 37 percent of registered voters said they were paying little to no attention to this case.\nAdvertisement\nBut 58 percent of voters \u2014 including a majority of independents \u2014 said they view the charges as very serious or somewhat serious.\n'He stayed together with his wife,' said Martha Zoller, a conservative talk show host in Georgia who voted for Nikki Haley in the Republican primary and argued that rehashing allegations from so many years ago will matter little to voters. 'It just seems like an unnecessary case. \u2026 And I'm not a person that loves Trump.'\nViews of the New York charges echoed a gender gap in support for Trump and Biden. Forty percent of women called them very serious compared with 20 percent of men, according to the New York Times/Siena poll, which also found Biden leading with women by 16 points \u2014 and Trump leading with men by 20.\nConcerns about Trump's polling with women also resurfaced after a jury found him liable last year for sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll and defaming her. In January, Carroll won an additional $83.3 million after Trump defamed her again.\nAdvertisement\nGunner Ramer, the political director of Republican Voters Against Trump, said Monday that their focus groups suggest Trump's other criminal cases are more meaningful to swing voters than the New York case.\n'We run through each indictment, and we ask them which one matters to you most,' Ramer said. 'And this is never the one that matters to them most.'\nVoters already know that Trump is 'not some highly moral human being,' Ramer added, though he views Trump's overall legal woes as potentially impactful with the 'double haters' who dislike both Trump and Biden.\nOn Monday, Merchan also agreed to let prosecutors introduce evidence about a meeting at Trump Tower where a National Enquirer editor allegedly agreed to help suppress negative stories about Trump and publish negative stories about his rivals.\nAdvertisement\n'The entire point of the Trump Tower meeting was to control the flow of information that reached the electorate to accentuate the positive, hide the negative and exaggerate information that would be harmful to Trump's opponents,' Steinglass said.\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche argued that Pecker's meeting with Trump and Cohen did not show evidence of misconduct and that meetings like that are common for candidates. Merchan said the details of the meeting would be admissible as evidence of prior bad conduct that may help the jury decide whether Trump intended to commit a crime when he concealed his reimbursement payments to Cohen, who directly paid off Daniels.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Isaac Arnsdorf,Hannah Knowles","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2RSPX5RAGN5I7RISW3LRG6BBOE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.742007,"_id":"67d7cd93878ef6419dd69a01c6c320fa"},{"title":"Michigan attorney general to announce charges in investigation of former top lawmaker","author":"Associated Press","published_date":"2024-04-16 16:11:51","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/16/former-michigan-house-speaker-investigation/0910643e-fc0c-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Prosecutors plan to announce charges Tuesday in an investigation of the former leader of the Michigan House","summary":"LANSING, Mich. \u2014 Prosecutors plan to announce charges Tuesday in an investigation of the former leader of the Michigan House, the attorney general's office said.\nAttorney General Dana Nessel is scheduled to speak to reporters in the state capital at 2 p.m. EDT.\nAn email from Nessel's office didn't indicate who is being charged.\n'We were told we would be notified in advance.

Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nFor the sake of comparison, 80 percent of Democrats view Trump very unfavorably, about the same extent to which Republicans view Biden very unfavorably. In each case, partisans were significantly more likely to view the other party's candidate unfavorably than they were to view O.J. Simpson \u2014 a man accused (and acquitted) of nearly decapitating his ex-wife, among other things \u2014 very unfavorably.\nBesides the Simpson component, this two-unpopular-candidates scenario is no longer novel. It was similarly the case in 2016 and, like then, it means that some portion of each candidate's support includes people who incongruously view their preferred candidate unfavorably.\nCurious about the extent of that incongruity, I reached out to YouGov for their polling in the past three presidential contests, each of which has featured Trump. In April 2020, the then-sitting Republican president was viewed quite positively by his own supporters, in part because he was seeing an approval boost from his initial response to the coronavirus pandemic. (That's obvious from the 'very favorable' percentage he enjoyed from his supporters at that point, too.) Other than that, at least 1 in 10 supporters of each major-party candidate has said in April that they viewed their own candidate unfavorably.\nThe extent to which Trump and Biden are viewed unfavorably by their own supporters in 2024 is more modest than was the case for Trump and Hillary Clinton in April 2016. Then, nearly a fifth of each candidate's support viewed them unfavorably. Relatedly, supporters of Trump and Biden are now also a bit more likely to view the other party's presumptive nominee very unfavorably \u2014 in part because the major-party candidates have established track records as president.\nThis prompts an obvious question, though: Why would you vote for a candidate you view unfavorably? The answer, in many cases, is simply that the voter dislikes the other candidate more . YouGov's most recent data shows that a third of those who say they plan to vote for Trump are doing so mostly as a vote against Biden's candidacy. A majority of Biden's supporters say their vote is meant to block Trump.\nmore.

LOUIS \u2014 Republican attorneys general attacked the Biden administration's stated goal of pursuing environmental justice, calling it a form of 'racial engineering.\u2018'\nFlorida Attorney General Ashley Moody and 22 other GOP officials asked the EPA Tuesday to stop using civil rights laws to investigate actions and policies that result in harm to Black people or other minority groups \u2014 even unintentionally \u2014 more than white residents.\n'The EPA should be focusing on enforcing the environmental laws passed by Congress, not so called \u2018environmental justice,' which is a euphemism for Biden's extreme agenda,\u2018' Moody said. Their petition demands that the EPA change decades-old rules, though the civil rights law could still be used where discrimination was intentional.\nThe petition is unlikely to convince the Biden administration to back away from an issue EPA Administrator Michael Regan has taken pains to highlight. Regan, for example, went on a 'Journey to Justice' tour to places like the industrial stretch of Louisiana typically called Cancer Alley to show how majority-Black communities living near polluters were being hurt. To address such harms, the EPA has turned in part to a section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 called Title VI to open investigations and pressure states to make changes.\nAdvertisement\nThe petition in an election year is the latest in Republicans' expanding fight against federal policies aimed at addressing historic racial discrimination and they believe courts are on their side. They cited the recent Supreme Court decision that eliminated affirmative action in college admissions, arguing it shows the court is wary of race-conscious federal policies.\n'Because the EPA's regulations prohibit any action that results in racial disparities, a funding recipient must set demographic targets for their projects to maintain compliance,' the attorneys general wrote. 'This kind of allocation based on group membership is a constitutional nonstarter.'\nThe Florida attorney general's office, which took the lead on the petition, said the states would sue if the EPA does not amend its rules.\nAdvertisement\nEPA declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation around the issue.\nTitle VI aims to prevent discrimination in programs that receive federal funds. The agency can investigate allegations of discrimination, publish their findings and pressure states and local governments to agree to change policies. The federal government can yank funding if they find a Title VI violation.\nDebbie Chizewer, managing attorney in the Midwest office at the environmental group Earthjustice, said Title VI is part of the country's historic fight against discrimination and is still a critical tool. Elected officials across the county permitted numerous polluting factories, chemical plants and refineries near minority communities that now are burdened with the effects, including poorer health, lower property values and economic blight.\nAdvertisement\n'I think it is a perversion of our civil rights laws to say otherwise, to say that you can't account for these past harms by creating policies that protect communities that are disproportionately harmed,' she said.\nPreviously, Title VI has been a relatively weak environmental weapon, rarely resulting in significant changes to environmental policy. Under the Biden administration, however, environmental and civil rights groups were hopeful it could be used to do more.\nThose groups asked the EPA to investigate Louisiana's regulation of air pollution, arguing that it disproportionately hurt majority-Black communities near heavy industry. They highlighted the Denka Performance Elastomer plant that makes synthetic rubber and emits harmful chloroprene. It's located a half-mile from an elementary school. The agency agreed to investigate and released initial findings saying there was evidence of discrimination.\nAdvertisement\nBut before the state agreed to any changes, the EPA dropped its investigation. The end came soon after Louisiana sued the agency, arguing that focusing on policies that may harm one group more than another but weren't intentionally discriminatory went too far.\nThat lawsuit has so far seen success. In January, a federal judge in Louisiana put a temporary halt on the EPA's power to investigate discrimination that had a so-called 'disparate impact.' A final decision in the case hasn't come yet.\nEnvironmental groups have worried that the EPA's move in Louisiana amounts to a pullback on the Biden administration's commitment to fighting environmental discrimination.\nEPA officials are wary of unfavorable court rulings and a conservative Supreme Court that has already curtailed its regulatory power. The Supreme Court restricted the EPA's authority to fight air and water pollution \u2014 including a landmark 2022 ruling that limited the EPA's authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants that contribute to global warming.\nAdvertisement\nRegan said earlier this month that he believes strongly in using Title VI to fight environmental discrimination, but it's complicated.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'It is not just on this issue, we face headwinds in the courts on a lot of issues,' Regan said. He added that the EPA is trying to ensure every action it takes can withstand a court challenge.\nBut the agency has other options to hold polluters accountable, he said. Recently, for example, the EPA finalized new, tougher, emissions limits for more than 200 chemical plants, including the Denka facility under scrutiny in Louisiana.\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Michael Phillis","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.6611514,"_id":"9308b3418cf650ba1d959001db579742"},{"title":"Biden administration moves to make conservation an equal to industry on US lands","author":"Matthew Brown","published_date":"2024-04-18 17:32:49","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/18/biden-public-lands-conservation-leases/ad45c852-fda9-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The Biden administration is moving to let conservationists lease government land for restoration","summary":"BILLINGS, Mont. \u2014 The Biden administration on Thursday finalized a new rule for public land management that's meant to put conservation on more equal footing with oil drilling, grazing and other extractive industries on vast government-owned properties.\nOfficials pushed past strong opposition from private industry and Republican governors to adopt the proposal.\nThe rule from the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management \u2014 which oversees more than 380,000 square miles (990,000 square kilometers) of land, primarily in the U.S. West \u2014 will allow public property to be leased for restoration in the same way that oil companies lease land for drilling.\nThe rule also promotes the designation of more 'areas of critical environmental concern' \u2014 a special status that can restrict development. It's given to land with historic or cultural significance or that's important for wildlife conservation.\nAdvertisement\nThe land bureau has a history of industry-friendly policies and for more than a century has sold grazing permits and oil and gas leases. In addition to its surface land holdings, the bureau regulates publicly-owned underground mineral reserves \u2014 such as coal for power plants and lithium for renewable energy \u2014 across more than 1 million square miles (2.5 million square kilometers).\nInterior Secretary Deb Haaland said the changes would 'restore balance' to how the U.S. government manages its public lands. The new rule continues the administration's efforts to use science to restore habitats and guide 'strategic and responsible development,' Haaland said in a statement.\nBut Republican lawmakers and agriculture industry representatives have blasted the move as a backdoor way to exclude mining, energy development and agriculture. They assert the administration is violating the 'multiple use' mandate for Interior Department lands, by catapulting the 'non-use' of federal lands \u2014 meaning restoration leases \u2014 to a position of prominence.\nAdvertisement\nAbout 10% of all land in the U.S. falls under the Bureau of Land Management's jurisdiction, putting the agency at the center of arguments over how much development should be allowed on public property.\nEnvironmentalists largely embraced the changes, characterizing them as long overdue.\nTrout Unlimited President Chris Wood said conservation already was part of the bureau's mission under the 1976 Federal Lands Policy Management Act. The new rule, he said, was 'a re-statement of the obvious.'\n'We are pleased to see the agency recognizing what the law already states \u2014 conservation is a vital use of our public lands,' he said.\nRestoration leases will not be issued if they would conflict with activity already underway on a parcel of land, officials said. They also said private industry could benefit from the program, since companies could buy leases and restore that acreage to offset damage they might do to other government-owned properties.\nAdvertisement\nThose leases were referred to as 'conservation leases' in the agency's original proposal last year. That was changed to 'restoration leases' and 'mitigation leases' in the final rule, but their purpose appears largely the same.\nWhile the bureau previously issued leases for conservation purposes in limited cases, it has never had a dedicated program for it.\nBureau Director Tracy Stone-Manning has said the changes address the rising challenges of climate change and development. She told The Associated Press when the changes were announced last year that making conservation an 'equal' to other uses would not interfere with grazing, drilling and other activities.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Matthew Brown","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/U3OWPBX5VEI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.58974,"_id":"b6fdae962235ff06976c676935df4ac0"},{"title":"How senators are voting to end the Mayorkas impeachment trial","author":"Hannah Dormido","published_date":"2024-04-17 19:50:35","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2024/04/17/mayorkas-impeachment-senate-vote","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"See how senators are voting on dismissing the impeachment trial of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.","summary":"Warning: This graphic requires JavaScript.  for the best experience.\nHow senators are voting to end the Mayorkas impeachment trial\nSenators are voting on whether to dismiss articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

That night, at his hotel, a group of similarly minded demonstrators banged drums, played loud music and used a loudspeaker until 12:15 a.m., yelling slogans including, 'Wake up, sleepy Joe!' and 'I am your nightmare, Biden!'\nAt a another site where Biden was speaking in Scranton, a very different group of demonstrators assembled, these backing Donald Trump. They held signs reading 'Joe Biden: You're Fired' and waved flags bearing the former president's name. Asked by a local news host about the proliferation of pro-Trump signs across Pennsylvania, Biden bristled: 'Well, you haven't been driving in the right places, pal. \u2026 He has no presence here.'\nHe has no presence here.'\nAt other times, Biden faced much friendlier terrain during his three - day swing through Pennsylvania, as large pro-Biden crowds materialized and supporters shouted, 'Four more years' or 'We love you, Joe.' One group held a sign reading 'Scranton Loves Joe!'\n-day swing through Pennsylvania, as large pro-Biden crowds materialized and supporters shouted, 'Four more years' or 'We love you, Joe.' One group held a sign reading 'Scranton Loves Joe!'\nAdvertisement\nThe question for Biden, as he throws himself in earnest into winning a state that means an enormous amount to him personally and politically, is how all these roiling sentiments will play out in November, in Pennsylvania and across the country. In many ways, Pennsylvania is a microcosm of the United States \u2014 a Democratic operative once famously described it as two metropolitan areas with Alabama in between \u2014 and strategists will be paying close attention to the state's Democratic and Republican primaries Tuesday for clues on which party has momentum.\n'Look, you're my ticket to the White House: you, Pennsylvania,' Biden told a group of campaign workers in Philadelphia on Thursday. 'No, it's not hyperbole. You're the ticket to the White House.'\nPolls show the race essentially tied between Biden and Trump, and both campaigns expect the state \u2014 which went for Trump by 0.72 percent in 2016 before swinging to Biden by 1.17 percent in 2020 \u2014 to come down to the wire in 2024.\nIn a recent memo on Pennsylvania, Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez stressed that Democrats have won statewide races there in 2018, 2020 and 2022, as voters turned sharply against Trump' policies from abortion to election denialism.\nAdvertisement\nBut Biden's visit highlighted his challenge as an incumbent at a time when many voters are worried about the economy and the country's direction, while others oppose his position on Gaza, and the nation overall is deeply polarized. Speaking to supporters in Scranton on Tuesday, Biden mused about the level of animus he has faced around the country.\n'I've never thought I'd see a time when I'm going through a neighborhood, or a rural town that's in the West, and see big signs that have a Trump sign in the middle that says \u2018F Biden,' and having a little kid standing with his middle finger \u2014 7 years old, 8 years old,' Biden said. 'Well, I promise, it happens all the time. It's not who we are.'\nDavid Urban, a Republican strategist who led Trump's successful effort to flip Pennsylvania in 2016, said his travels through the state have convinced him that Biden is struggling with its residents, many of whom blame him for the high cost of living and for policies they see as hostile to the local energy industry.\n'The current president is pushing a big rock up a hill, trying to convince people things aren't as bad as they are,' Urban said.\nLast week, Biden was pushing hard.\nAdvertisement\nHe unleashed a populist speech in Scranton. He embraced unions while addressing steelworkers in Pittsburgh. He made stops at Sheetz and Wawa, a nod to the hometown convenience stores whose respective merits are hotly debated, as well as to the kind of retail politicking aides say will be pivotal to helping the 81-year-old president connect with skeptical voters.\nAnd Biden ended his trip Thursday by visiting a majority-Black neighborhood in Philadelphia, where he accepted an endorsement from family members of his most prominent third-party rival, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nAs Biden's birthplace and the largest battleground state \u2014 home to a crucial 19 electoral college votes \u2014 Pennsylvania looms large in the president's personal and political backstory. It's a state both Democrats and Republicans view as crucial to victory, and it stands as a key a test of whether everyday Americans believe his performance as president warrants another term.\nAdvertisement\nThat's a big part of the reason Biden has spent so much time in Pennsylvania, which has the added benefit of being close to both Washington and his home state of Delaware.\nLike Biden, who has already traveled to the state a handful of times this year, Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has also prioritized Pennsylvania. His aides and allies see it as a central pillar in their push to knock down Democrats' venerated 'blue wall' of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2014 as Trump did in 2016 but not in 2020.\nWith a population of about 13 million consisting of large urban centers, fast-changing suburbs, millions of blue-collar workers and vast rural stretches, Pennsylvania reflects many of the trends upending the nation's political landscape. Since 1960, no Democrat has won the presidency without carrying the state.\nAdvertisement\nAt a recent rally ahead of his criminal trial in New York, Trump told a large crowd in Schnecksville, Pa., that Biden is responsible for high inflation, global instability and a general malaise hanging over the country.\n'All of America knows that the real blame for this nightmare lies with one person: Crooked Joe Biden,' Trump said. 'That's why the people of Pennsylvania are going to tell Crooked Joe, \u2018You're fired. Get out. You're fired.''\nBiden's swing through the state offered a glimpse at how he will respond to such attacks, as aides noted that he made a point of addressing several constituencies that helped propel him to the White House in 2020.\nOn Tuesday, the president visited his childhood home after giving a speech contrasting his view on taxes with that of Trump, saying he represents the scrappy values of Scranton while Trump reflects the money-focused morals of Mar-a-Lago in Florida. His pitch to the United Steelworkers union Wednesday featured a populist pledge to protect American industry from unfair foreign competition, including by tripling tariffs on Chinese-made steel if necessary. He also took a jab at Trump, joking that the former president \u2014 who was in New York facing a court trial \u2014 was 'busy right now.'\nAdvertisement\nHis speech at the Martin Luther King Jr. Recreation Center in Philadelphia on Thursday targeted the city's large population of Black voters. John White Jr., a former state representative and civil rights leader, introduced Biden by praising his record of boosting 'Black livelihoods,' and the president was accompanied around town by Mayor Cherelle Parker (D).\nThroughout the trip, Biden played up his personal connection to the state, where first lady Jill Biden grew up \u2014 she often mentions her attachment to Philadelphia sports teams \u2014 and where the Bidens had their first date. He talked about launching his 2020 campaign in Pittsburgh and turning to Philadelphians to bolster his Senate campaigns over the years. He said he had been dubbed Pennsylvania's 'third senator' because of how often he was on the news in Philadelphia, which shares a media market with his hometown of Wilmington.\nAt the same time, the Biden campaign unleashed a blitz of advertising targeting key groups in the state, including Black residents and Hispanic voters from Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, as well as a ramped-up ground operation aimed in part at holding down Trump's margins in rural and exurban parts of the state. The Trump campaign's on-the-ground presence is more limited than Biden's effort, which now includes more than a dozen offices and a mix of paid staff and volunteers.\nAdvertisement\nThat advantage in fundraising and campaign infrastructure will pay dividends for Biden down the road, said Brendan McPhillips, a senior campaign adviser who managed Biden's 2020 race in Pennsylvania and the successful campaign of Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) in 2022.\n'The gap is huge between what the president's campaign has been doing and is doing right now, versus Trump, who has come into the state once or twice for very brief visits,' McPhillips said, adding that the Biden campaign plans to open another dozen Pennsylvania offices, including in some Trump-friendly areas, in the coming months.\nBut for Trump's allies, the negative emotions sparked by Biden during his visit suggest he will struggle to hit his marks in the parts of the state where he needs a strong turnout to overcome Republicans' dominance in rural counties.\nAdvertisement\n'This '24 race feels way more like '16 than '20,' Urban said. 'The antipathy toward Biden \u2014 I won't say it's the same as it was toward Clinton, but it's definitely present. The chants of \u2018FJB' are louder than they've ever been.'\nLike Hillary Clinton, Biden has faced public blowback from progressive voters. His support for Israel's military campaign in Gaza, in particular, has cost him support from key voting groups, including many young people, Arab Americans and some Black voters.\nIn Pennsylvania, organizers are aiming to convince some 40,000 voters to write in 'uncommitted' rather than voting for Biden during Tuesday's primary. Given Pennsylvania's tight margins, even a small number of defections in November could tip the race.\nBiden's team hopes the state's voters are listening more to other voices, like those of the Kennedy family members who gathered to support him in Philadelphia on Thursday.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Toluse Olorunnipa","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SAKBL7A7CWJBO5JFLP37P52ZXE.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.5542507,"_id":"26c70ae879cc8db458c83472f5090344"},{"title":"New rules for Pregnant Workers Fairness Act include divisive accommodations for abortion","author":"Claire Savage","published_date":"2024-04-15 17:50:34","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/15/pregnant-workers-fairness-act-abortion/a8fae0bc-fb50-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Workers are entitled to time off and other job accommodations for abortions under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, according to finalized federal regulations published Monday","summary":"NEW YORK \u2014 Workers are entitled to time off and other job accommodations for abortions \u2014 along with pregnancy-related medical conditions like miscarriage, stillbirth and lactation \u2014 under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, according to finalized federal regulations published Monday.\nThe regulations provide guidance for employers and workers on how to implement the law, which passed with robust bipartisan Congressional support in December 2022 but sparked controversy last year when the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission included abortions in its draft rules. The language means that workers can ask for time off to obtain an abortion and recover from the procedure.\nThe EEOC says its decision to keep the abortion provisions in its final rules despite criticism from some conservatives is consistent with its own longstanding interpretation of Title VII, as well as court rulings. The federal agency added that the new law does not obligate employers or employer-sponsored health plans to cover abortion-related costs, and that the type of accommodation that most likely will be sought under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act regarding an abortion is time off to attend a medical appointment or for recovery, which does not have to be paid.\nAdvertisement\nThe act requires most employers with 15 or more employees to provide 'reasonable accommodations' for a worker's known limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions \u2014 including fertility and infertility treatments in some cases \u2014 unless the accommodation will cause the employer an undue hardship. The EEOC's regulations, which will be used as a framework to enforce the law, will go into effect on June 18.\nLabor advocates hailed the new law as especially important for women of color who are most likely to work in low-wage, physically demanding jobs but are often denied accommodations for everything from time off for medical appointments to the ability to sit or stand on the job. Major business groups also supported the law, citing the need for clarity about the accommodations that employers are required to give pregnant workers.\n'No one should have to risk their job for their health just because they are pregnant, recovering from childbirth, or dealing with a related medical condition,' said EEOC Chair Charlotte A. Burrows on Monday.\nAdvertisement\nBut Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion activists denounced the EEOC's inclusion of abortion after the agency first released its proposed rule in August for a monthslong public commentary period. Abortion rights proponents, meanwhile, applauded the provision as critical at time when abortion rights have been curtailed in many states following the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The EEOC is composed of three Democratic commissioners and two Republican commissioners.\nSen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the lead Republican sponsor of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Law, accused the Biden administration on Monday of 'shocking and illegal' disregard of the legislative process to promote a political agenda. The Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal organization, said the Biden administration was trying to 'smuggle an abortion mandate' into the law.\nBut in comments submitted to the EEOC, the American Civil Liberties Union applauded the agency for 'recognizing that abortion has for decades been approved under the law as a \u2018related medical condition' to pregnancy that entitles workers to reasonable accommodations, including time off to obtain abortion care.'\nAdvertisement\nThe EEOC said it had received 54,000 comments urging the commission to exclude abortion from its definition of medical condition related to pregnancy, but it also received 40,000 comments supporting its inclusion. While the commission said it understood that both sides were expressing 'sincere, deeply held convictions,' it cited numerous federal cases that it said supported its interpretation that abortion is a pregnancy-related condition deserving of protection.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe new rules include extensive details on the types of accommodations that pregnant workers can request, from temporary exemption from jobs duties like heavy lifting to considerations for morning sickness.\nWomen's right advocates had campaigned for years for the law, arguing that the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act offered inadequate protection for pregnant workers. The 1978 law, which amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibited discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and marked a major shift for gender equality at time when pregnant women were routinely denied or pushed out of jobs.\nAdvertisement\nBut in order to receive workplace accommodations, pregnant women had to demonstrate that co-workers had received similar benefits for comparable needs, since the act stated only that pregnant workers must be treated similarly to other employees, not that they deserved special consideration. That put a burden of proof that many women found impossible to meet, forcing them to work in unsafe conditions or quit their jobs, according to A Better Balance, one of the most vocal advocates for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.\nThe new law makes clear that that pregnant workers are entitled to accommodations to keep doing their jobs, mirroring the process for workers with disabilities. It places the burden on employers to prove 'undue hardship' if they deny requests for modifications.\nThe EEOC typically handles between 2,000 and 4,000 pregnancy discrimination charges a year, many involving denial of workplace accommodations. A study conducted by A Better Balance found that in two-thirds of pregnancy discrimination cases that followed the 2015 Supreme Court ruling, courts determined the employers were allowed to deny accommodations under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.\nAdvertisement\nIn a prepared statement, A Better Balance Co-President Dina Bakst applauded the EEOC 'for issuing robust final regulations that appropriately recognize the broad scope of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.'\n____","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"science","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Alexandra Olson,Claire Savage","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/URLPJJX3KAI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.523172,"_id":"8ff6433771c44641e4961fffe19510aa"},{"title":"Biden returns to his Scranton roots to pitch tax plan","author":"Chris Megerian","published_date":"2024-04-16 09:05:42","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/16/joe-biden-scranton-pennsylvania-election-taxes/80482f1e-fbd0-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"President Joe Biden will begin three straight days of campaigning in Pennsylvania in his childhood hometown of Scranton","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden returns to his childhood hometown of Scranton on Tuesday to open three straight days of campaigning in Pennsylvania, capitalizing on the opportunity to work the battleground state while Donald Trump spends the week in a New York City courtroom for his first criminal trial.\nThe Democratic president plans to use Scranton, a working class city of roughly 75,000 people, as the backdrop for his pitch for higher taxes on the rich. At the same, he will portray Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee and a billionaire himself, as a tool of wealthy interests.\nIt's all aimed at reframing the conversation around the economy, which has left many Americans feeling sour about their financial situations at a time of stubborn inflation and elevated interest rates despite low unemployment.\nAdvertisement\nBiden plans to spend Tuesday night in Scranton before continuing to Pittsburgh on Wednesday morning. He then goes back to the White House, only to return to Pennsylvania on Thursday, this time visiting Philadelphia.\nBy the time the week is over, Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris will have visited the state eight times this year, reflecting its importance to Biden's hopes for a second term.\n'It's hard to draw paths to Biden winning the White House that don't involve Pennsylvania,' said Daniel Hopkins, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania. No Democrat has become president without winning the state since Harry Truman in 1948.\nScranton, the president's first destination, will blend the personal and the political for Biden. He grew up in a three-story colonial home in the Green Ridge neighborhood until his father struggled to find work and moved the family to Delaware when the future president was 10.\nAdvertisement\nAlthough Delaware eventually became the launching pad for Biden's political career, he often returned to Scranton and grounded his autobiography in the city. He visited so often, he was sometimes called 'Pennsylvania's third senator.'\nIn 2020, Biden described the presidential campaign as 'Scranton versus Park Avenue,\" and his reelection team is framing this year's race in a similar way.\n'You've got Joe Biden, who sees the world from the kitchen table where he grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Donald Trump, who sees the world from his country club down in Mar-a-Lago,' said Michael Tyler, the campaign's communications director.\nChristopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, described Scranton as a 'mythical place in political culture,' and it will provide a test for Biden's political appeal.\nAdvertisement\n'It's an area that, on paper, aligns perfectly with the populist gains of the Republican Party during the Trump era,' Borick said.\nHowever, Biden won the city and the surrounding county in 2020. If he's able to carry Scranton and similar places again this year, as well as limit Trump's winning margins in rural areas, Biden may be able to secure another victory in Pennsylvania.\n'Everything is on the margin. Everything that we talk about are small shifts,' Borick said.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBiden's pitch on taxes is a key part of his effort to blunt Trump's populist allure.\nWhen Trump was president, he signed into law a series of tax breaks in 2017 that disproportionately benefit the rich. Many of the cuts expire at the end of 2025, and Biden wants to keep a majority of them to fulfill his promise that no one earning less than $400,000 will pay more taxes.\nAdvertisement\nHowever, he also wants to raise $4.9 trillion in revenue over 10 years with higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations. His platform includes a 'billionaire's tax,' which would set a minimum rate of 25% on the income of the richest Americans.\nBiden's travels in Pennsylvania overlap with the start of Trump's first criminal trial, presenting an opportunity and a challenge for the president's campaign.\nTrump is defending himself against criminal charges for a scheme to suppress allegations of affairs with a porn actress and a Playboy model. Biden's team has quietly embraced the contrast of the former president sequestered in a courtroom while the current president has free rein to focus on economic issues that are top of mind for voters.\nHowever, the juxtaposition becomes less helpful if Trump soaks up the country's attention during the first-ever criminal trial of a former president.\nAdvertisement\nBiden campaign officials said they weren't worried about the trial.\n'No matter where Donald Trump is, whether it's in Mar-a-Lago or a courtroom or anywhere else, he'll be focused on himself, his toxic agenda, his campaign of revenge and retribution,' Tyler said. 'That's going to be a continuation of the contrast the American people have been able to see since this campaign began.'\nSam DeMarco, chair of the Republican Party in Allegheny County, where Pittsburgh is located, said Democrats' message is that 'the economy is good, we're just not smart enough to realize it.'\nHowever, DeMarco said, 'across the board, it costs more to live today than it did when Joe Biden came to office.'\n'These are the things that families feel,' he said. 'And a scripted appearance by the president is not going to change that.'\nAdvertisement\nTrump was last in Pennsylvania on Saturday night in Schnecksville, where he described Biden as a 'demented tyrant' and blamed him for all of the country's problems, in addition to his own legal woes.\n'All of America knows that the real blame for this nightmare lies with one person, Crooked Joe Biden,' Trump said.\nHe attacked Biden's tax plans, falsely claiming that 'they're going to raise your taxes by four times.'\nTrump also went on an extended riff about the Civil War battle in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, calling it 'so vicious and horrible, and so beautiful in so many different ways,' and suggesting that the Confederate General Robert E.

That could soon change under a far-reaching Interior Department rule that puts conservation, recreation and renewable energy development on equal footing with resource extraction.\nThe final rule released Thursday represents a seismic shift in the management of roughly 245 million acres of public property \u2014 about one-tenth of the nation's land mass. It is expected to draw praise from conservationists and legal challenges from fossil fuel industry groups and Republican officials, some of whom have lambasted the move as a 'land grab.'\nInterior's Bureau of Land Management, known as the nation's largest landlord, has long offered leases to oil and gas companies, mining firms and ranchers. Now, for the first time, the nearly 80-year-old agency will auction off 'restoration leases' and 'mitigation leases' to entities with plans to restore or conserve public lands.\nAdvertisement\n'Today's final rule helps restore balance to our public lands as we continue using the best-available science to restore habitats, guide strategic and responsible development, and sustain our public lands for generations to come,' Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement.\nUnder President Biden, the BLM has put a greater emphasis on protecting public lands from the twin threats of climate change and development. Tracy Stone-Manning, the bureau's director, has warned that hotter, drier climates are driving longer and more intense wildfires and drought across the American West. At the same time, development has fragmented and destroyed wildlife habitat and migratory corridors.\n'We oversee 245 million acres, and every land manager will tell you that climate change is already happening. It's already impacting our public lands,' Stone-Manning said during a Washington Post Live event last year. 'We see it in pretty obvious ways, through unprecedented wildfires.'\nAdvertisement\nThe fossil fuel industry, a frequent foe of the Biden administration, has chaffed at the BLM's approach. It has called the public lands rule an example of regulatory overreach that will stifle domestic energy production, even as the United States pumps more oil than any nation in history.\nKathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, which represents oil and gas companies, said the group plans to challenge the BLM rule in court. She said the policy appears to violate the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the 1976 law that tasked the bureau with overseeing 'multiple uses' of public lands for current and future generations.\n'We have no choice but to litigate,' Sgamma said. 'These conservation leases seem to be designed to preclude energy development on federal lands.'\nThe BLM's proposed rule released last year sparked especially intense outrage in Wyoming, an energy powerhouse that accounts for nearly one-tenth of U.S. fossil fuel production. Some Wyoming Republicans have claimed that the BLM is colluding with liberal environmental groups to put millions of acres off-limits to development \u2014 and to push a form of imperialism.\nAdvertisement\n'It does seem to me this is a very top-down, Washington-centric approach that has kind of cut the legs out from the local people,' Gov. Mark Gordon (R) told The Post last year. 'Unfortunately, Wyoming finds itself imposed upon by these colonial forces of national environmental groups who are pushing an agenda onto Wyoming.'\nAaron Weiss, deputy director of the Center for Western Priorities, an advocacy group, said some Republican officials have spread 'disinformation and the conspiracy theories' about the rule. He noted that during a House Natural Resources Committee hearing last year, South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem (R) claimed the draft rule would allow Chinese citizens to purchase leases on U.S. lands.\nUnlike the proposed rule, the final rule clarifies that 'leases cannot be held by foreign persons.' It also offers 'restoration leases' and 'mitigation leases' rather than 'conservation leases' \u2014 a linguistic tweak that seems designed to skirt the politicization of the word 'conservation,' Weiss said.\nAdvertisement\nMitigation leases will allow lease holders to offset the impact of their activities. For example, a rancher whose cattle grazing is degrading the land could be required to purchase a mitigation lease during the permitting process. The rancher could then work with a local conservation group to restore nearby habitat for the greater sage grouse, an imperiled bird of the West.\nto offset the impact of their activities. For example, a rancher whose cattle grazing is degrading the land could be required to purchase a mitigation lease during the permitting process. The rancher could then work with a local conservation group to restore nearby habitat for the greater sage grouse, an imperiled bird of the West.\nThe final rule also directs the BLM to prioritize landscape health for the first time and to incorporate Indigenous knowledge into its decision-making. The latter is a top priority of Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary and lead a department that once oversaw the removal of Indigenous people from their land.\nThe Trump administration took a vastly different approach to managing public lands than Biden officials. President Donald Trump briefly moved the BLM's headquarters from Washington to Grand Junction, Colo., a hot spot for natural gas production. More than 87 percent of the affected employees either resigned or retired rather than move to Colorado, depriving the agency of expertise and disrupting its operations.\nTo lead the BLM, Trump tapped William Perry Pendley, a conservative lawyer who had previously advocated for selling off public lands across the country. Pendley, who was never confirmed by the Senate, pushed the bureau to maximize oil, gas and mineral development.\ntapped William Perry Pendley, a conservative lawyer who had previously advocated for selling off public lands across the country.

Trump aides said the former president and current Republican nominee chose the store because it has been the site of a violent attack on an employee. He will also highlight consumer inflation under President Joe Biden, aides said.\nThe visit would be Trump's first campaign appearance since his criminal hush money trial began, making the presumptive GOP nominee the first former president in U.S. history to stand criminal trial.\nTrump will be confined to the courtroom on most days, dramatically limiting his movements and his ability to campaign, fundraise and make calls. Aides have been planning rallies and other political events on weekends and Wednesdays, the one weekday when court is not supposed to be in session. Plans also include local appearances Trump can make after court recesses each day.\nAdvertisement\nTrump's stop in Harlem demonstrates the former president's determination to amplify familiar campaign arguments even within the strictures of being a criminal defendant.\nIn July 2022, Jose Alba, a clerk at the store in Hamilton Heights, a heavily Hispanic section of Harlem, was attacked by 35-year-old Austin Simon. The resulting altercation, captured on surveillance video, ended with Alba fatally stabbing Simon. Alba was arrested and charged with murder but the Manhattan district attorney dropped the charges within weeks, saying they could not prove Alba had not acted in self-defense.\nOn another evening in August 2022, according to the New York Post, owner Osamah Aldhabyani was in the store when a customer entered and an altercation between the two ensued. The customer was arrested, the newspaper reported.\nAdvertisement\nBefore his arrival, Trump's campaign distributed materials to journalists criticizing Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for his handling of the stabbing case, including the weeks Alba spent jailed at Rikers Island without bail. Bragg oversees the office now prosecuting Trump.\nThe former president's local appearance also affirms his intentions to campaign in his home state, even though New York remains overwhelmingly Democratic. In 2020, Biden garnered more than 60% of the vote in the state and ran up even wider margins in New York City. Trump insists he can win New York in November anyway, and he has mused about holding rallies in the South Bronx and Queens, where the former president was born and grew up, and even Madison Square Garden.\n'I may rent Madison Square Garden,' he said in an interview with Breitbart News. 'That's the belly of the beast, right?'\nAdvertisement\nThat would be a prohibitively expensive proposition, particularly as his campaign has worked to save cash as it confronts a fundraising gap with Biden.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'You know, the president is very keen on New York,' Chris LaCivita, Trump senior campaign adviser, told The Associated Press last month as he talked up the campaign's efforts to put more states in play. Still, LaCivita laughed when asked whether he agrees. 'I don't get out in front of the boss. I do what the boss says. The boss drives,' he said.\nTrump has argued that the ongoing influx of migrants to the city, where he grew his real estate empire and became a tabloid fixture, has made New Yorkers more willing to vote for him since his 2020 loss to Biden. The city has struggled to house the new arrivals, putting many up in city hotels.\n'I think we have a chance. New York has changed a lot in the last two years,' he told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo. 'The people of New York are angry. People that would have never voted for me because I'm a Republican \u2014 I mean they're Democrats ... I think they're going to vote for me. So I think we're going to give New York a heavy shot.'\nAdvertisement\nTrump cited the 2022 New York governor's race, when Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul prevailed over Republican former Rep. Lee Zeldin \u2014 but by a much tighter margin than usual for her party's statewide nominees.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a top Trump ally, said Monday that Trump will be campaigning all over the state while he's forced to be on trial in New York.\n'He's going to make the best out of this,' she said, adding that 'Democrats in New York and the judge and everyone, they're really going to regret it.'\nAt the least, Trump, long a famous figure for New Yorkers, showed Tuesday that he can still turn heads in the city.\n'Papito Trump is coming. Yeah!' said one passerby ahead of the former president's arrival.\nLesandra Carrion, 47, who lives in the neighborhood, came out to see the former president when she heard he might be visiting.\nAdvertisement\nShe said she doesn't agree with everything Trump says or does but declared that 'he speaks the truth.' Carrion cited the rising migrant population and strained city resources. 'I think that he will make a difference,' she said of Trump.\nAs for his troubles at the courthouse at the south end of Manhattan, Carrion was dismissive. 'He's going to beat that,' she said. 'We all make mistakes at the end of the day. But he's the truth and light.

CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. 'I'll just tell you that Ukraine right now is facing some dire battlefield conditions.'\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin, seated alongside Brown, told lawmakers that time matters.\n'We're already seeing things on the battlefield begin to shift a bit in Russia's favor. We are seeing them make incremental gains. We're seeing the Ukrainians be challenged in terms of holding the line,' he said.\nAdvertisement\nTheir grim assessments came as House Republicans wrangle over the $95 billion foreign aid bill that the Senate passed in February. That legislation provides funding for Ukraine, Israel and other allies, as well as humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza and Ukraine and replenishment cash for the U.S. military to replace weapons sent to Ukraine.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson was forging ahead Wednesday toward votes later this week on the funding, even as he risks losing his leadership post in the bitterly divided Republican caucus.\nMembers of the House panel lamented the gridlock that has stalled the foreign aid, but several said they are hopeful the legislation will begin to move.\nRep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., noted the 'chilling' comments by Gen. Christopher Cavoli, the top U.S. military commander for Europe last week. He told the committee that Ukraine will be outgunned 10 to one by Russia within a matter of weeks if Congress doesn't approve the funding.\nAdvertisement\n'Without the United States assistance, Ukraine will literally run out of ammunition and more civilians in Ukraine will be murdered by Russia,' McCollum said.\nBrown told lawmakers that Israel also critically needs support in the bill, including air defense interceptors and munitions to defend itself following Iran's attack over the weekend. Iran launched about 300 missiles and drones toward Israel on Saturday, but the vast majority were shot down by Israeli defenses or U.S. and other allies. The attack came less than two weeks after a suspected Israeli strike in Syria killed two Iranian generals in an Iranian consular building.\nThe funding issue dominated the hearing, including its impact on the U.S. military and defense companies scattered across 30 states. The Pentagon's comptroller, Michael McCord, said the Defense Department has already spent about $2 billion for military operations in Europe and the Middle East to ensure troops and allies there are secure.\nAdvertisement\nSome of that includes the movement of Navy ships to help protect Israel over the weekend and the extended deployment of ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to safeguard commercial and military vessels being targeted by Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen.\nWithout the supplemental funding, McCord said the $2 billion would have to be absorbed by the base budget and shifted from other spending on things like facilities and equipment maintenance.\n'So there is an impact on our forces and our readiness as well if we cannot get the supplemental approved,' he said.\nAustin also repeated a selling point that defense leaders have been making to lawmakers over the past several months: The funding bill will directly help the American defense industry that is building Abrams tanks, ammunition and other weapons and equipment.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Lolita C.

But it still presented its staggering finding as a stark warning to Washington, where the federal debt has surged this year to more than $34.5 trillion.\nCiting the country's fiscal health as 'unsustainable,' the report called for significant reforms that 'can reduce the loss of federal dollars and help improve the federal government's fiscal outlook.'\nEven before its release, though, the GAO report drew sharp, rare rebukes from the White House Office of Management and Budget, which raised significant concerns with its methodology in a formal letter released alongside the analysis Tuesday.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nJason Miller, the deputy director for management at OMB, stressed the fraud estimate is 'not based on analysis of estimated losses by individual federal programs,' but rather, is a government-wide figure derived from a 'simulation model.'\nAdvertisement\nMiller pointed to the GAO's own acknowledgments that it lacked the proper data to pinpoint the full extent of waste, fraud and abuse in some federal programs. And he said its release would 'create confusion and promote misleading generalizations that have no factual connection' to federal spending.\nThe new report is still likely to rile Capitol Hill, where fiscal hawks from both parties have long lamented the scourge of federal waste, fraud and abuse \u2014 even if they have done very little to address the root causes of the problem. Repeatedly, the GAO has asked Congress to adopt some basic reforms that might improve federal spending data and bolster the government's ability to spot scams, but Democrats and Republicans often have ignored the requests.\nThe GAO's indictment arrives one week after the White House joined Senate Democrats in unveiling new legislation that would crack down on fraud targeting federal programs. The $1.3 billion bill would deliver on President Biden's two-year old request by investing new resources toward fighting identity theft, aiming to ward off scammers who use real Americans' information to obtain government benefits they do not deserve.\nAdvertisement\nIdentity theft long has dogged the government, but it emerged as one of the most costly, devastating scourges during the coronavirus pandemic.

It was very difficult and we did lose the initiative there,' Zelensky said. 'Now we have all the chance to stabilize the situation and to take the initiative, and that's why we need to actually have the weapon systems.'\nThe $60 billion aid package had stalled because of bitter infighting among Republicans over whether to side with Ukraine against Russia, which invaded the country more than two years ago. Officials in Washington and Kyiv have warned that Ukraine's front-line units were rationing a rapidly evaporating stockpile of armaments and that soon Moscow would have a 10-to-1 advantage in artillery rounds.\nNotably, Zelensky did not give a timeline for when his forces might regain an advantage on the battlefield once they receive the weapons, nor did he say that the additional support would be decisive in the war.\nAdvertisement\n'I think this support will really strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine and we will have a chance for victory,' Zelensky said.\nThanking House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), whose support for the package has threatened his leadership position, as well as President Biden, Zelensky urged the Senate to act so weapons could be sent to Ukraine 'as fast as possible so that we get some tangible assistance for the soldiers on the front line as soon as possible, not in another six months, so that they would be able to move ahead.'

Glenn Youngkin (R) remain at loggerheads as Virginia lawmakers return to the state Capitol on Wednesday to take action on the budget and other bills the governor has proposed changing, barreling toward a June 30 deadline to adopt a two-year spending plan or begin shutting down the state government.\nDemocrats have said repeatedly in recent days that they are in no mood to compromise with Youngkin, who welcomed the legislature's budget in March by calling it 'backward' and going on a tour around the state proclaiming how misguided it was. Since the governor unveiled a package of 233 proposed amendments on April 8 that essentially rewrote the spending plan the General Assembly passed with bipartisan support, Democrats who control both chambers of the legislature have reacted angrily.\n'We passed [an] on-time, structurally sound, balanced budget, which is required of us by the constitution,' House Speaker Don L. Scott Jr. (D-Portsmouth) said Tuesday in remarks to a small group of reporters.

He then could become the first governor in modern Virginia history to veto an entire budget. Youngkin would probably call a special legislative session so lawmakers could start all over, racing to get a budget plan finished before the new fiscal year starts July 1.

'This is new territory for us all, and it should be interesting. This place never fails to surprise.'\nIn addition to his proposed budget changes, Youngkin issued a record 153 vetoes \u2014 more in one year than the 120 the next most veto-heavy governor, Democrat Terry McAuliffe, issued in his entire four-year term. Democrats said over the past few days that they probably don't have enough Republican support to muster the two-thirds majorities needed to override those vetoes, which included legislation to create a legal market for recreational marijuana, raise the minimum wage, and prevent other states where abortion is illegal from extraditing someone who has or performs the procedure legally in Virginia.\n120 the next most veto-heavy governor, Democrat Terry McAuliffe, issued in his entire four-year term.

He proposed eliminating the Assembly's plan to expand the sales tax to digital downloads \u2014 an idea that Youngkin initially proposed \u2014 and in return offered to retreat from his own insistence on tax cuts, which were dead anyway because lawmakers left them out of the budget.\nAdvertisement\nHe also said he would accept the legislature's plan to increase spending in several key areas, including providing 3 percent pay raises in each of the next two years for public school teachers and state employees, increasing funding for higher education and boosting the state's contribution to the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority, though at a lower level than the General Assembly approved. Youngkin argued that Virginia can afford those expenditures without raising taxes.\nAs if to underscore that point, the administration released a monthly revenue estimate Tuesday evening that showed tax collections up and the state surging toward a surplus of funds. As of March, state coffers are on track for a surplus of more than $1 billion for the year, Youngkin's office said.\nevening that showed tax collections up and the state surging toward a surplus of funds.

His plan for Metro, for instance, boosts the state's contribution by tapping into federal dollars that had been set aside for localities in Northern Virginia \u2014 an approach several Democrats said was not acceptable.\nDemocratic leaders who accuse Youngkin of divisive rhetoric and aggressive treatment of their bills see him as punishing them for rejecting his plan to build a $2 billion, publicly financed arena in Alexandria for the Washington Wizards and Capitals.

Surovell (D-Fairfax) told The Washington Post on Monday.\nAdvertisement\nSurovell characterized Youngkin's amendments as not just aggressive but also as a misreading of his role in government. 'The governor seems to approach governor's amendments as if he's an actual member of the legislature,' he said, noting that Youngkin had essentially rewritten the budget and introduced new concepts to some bills after it was too late to vet them through the 'committee process and take broad input into whether it's good policy or not.'\nOne example: complex legislation to allow slot machine-like 'skill games' in convenience stores that Youngkin drastically rewrote, suggesting amendments that effectively ban the games in many metropolitan areas.\nSome Democrats have fanned the rhetorical flames. In addition to Scott's digital ad, Senate Finance and Appropriations Chairwoman L. Louise Lucas (D-Portsmouth), who often mocks Youngkin on X, last week posted cartoon images of the governor giving up on the arena, which she dubbed the 'Glenn Dome,' and 'tax cuts for the rich.'

Amendments to bills are a bit more complicated.\nIf a simple majority of both chambers approves all amendments on a bill, it becomes law as amended with no further action. If legislators approve some or none of the amendments, the bill goes back to Youngkin with only the amendments they have accepted for him to sign or veto. The governor gets the last word, since the General Assembly does not get another chance to override him.\nBut the legislature can head off a potential veto by taking a second vote on a bill after rejecting some or all of the governor's amendments. A legislator would have to make a motion to enroll the bill as law 'notwithstanding the governor's [anticipated] veto.' If that motion wins a two-thirds vote in both houses, the measure becomes law.\nAdvertisement\nTwo bills that could be ripe for a challenge, according to several legislators: the skill-games bill that the governor rewrote, and a measure that would allow localities to impose a 1 percent local sales tax to fund school construction, a bipartisan bill that Youngkin vetoed.\nBut reconciling the positions staked out by both sides on the budget is going to take more time than is available in Wednesday's session, even if it extends for more than one day, said Stanley, the Republican senator. 'How do you find middle ground? I don't think you find it in the veto session,' he said. 'After the dust settles, we have to have a budget by July 1.

He predicted one change: The new budget might find ways to spend about $100 million freed up by Youngkin's vetoes.\n'It's not going to get any better,' Deeds said of the next spending plan. 'It could get worse from his perspective.'\nThe Virginia Constitution gives the legislature 10 days to take up the governor's vetoes and amendments, but it is rare for the reconvened session to extend beyond one day.
