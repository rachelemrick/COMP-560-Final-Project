Gen. Aharon Haliva is the first senior military figure to step down over the Hamas attacks on October 7, which was the deadliest day for Israel since its founding.\n'It was decided that MG Aharon Haliva will end his position and retire from the IDF, once his successor is appointed in an orderly and professional process,' the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Monday, thanking him for his 38 years of service.\nIn October, Haliva admitted to an 'intelligence failure' by his unit in not alerting the Hamas-led attacks on Israel.\n'During my visits to IDF Intelligence bases over the last 11 days, I have repeatedly said that this war began with an intelligence failure. The Intelligence Directorate, under my command, has failed to alert this terror attack launched by Hamas,' Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva said then in a letter to IDF's intelligence personnel.\n'We didn't fulfil our most important task, and as the head of the Intelligence Directorate, I take full responsibility for this failure.' These were Haliva's first comments since the attack.\nThey came after Israel's top domestic security official took responsibility on for the attacks.\nShin Bet chief Ronen Bar wrote in a statement then that, 'despite a series of actions we carried out, we weren't able to create a sufficient warning that would allow the attack to be thwarted,' adding, 'The responsibility is on me,' according to Israel's Army Radio station.\nThe attack was widely seen as a major Israeli intelligence failure, with a number of top defense and security officials coming forward in October to take responsibility to some extent for missteps that led to the attacks.\nIn December, a report from the New York Times claimed Israel obtained Hamas' plan for the attack more than a year in advance. The report said Israeli officials dismissed the plan as aspirational, and deemed it too complex for the group to carry out. Other outlets, including Israeli newspaper Haaretz, have also reported the claim.\nSoon after the attacks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu received sharp public criticism after he accused security chiefs in a later-deleted social media post of failing to warn him about the impending attack.\nIn a CNN interview in November, Netanyahu refused to answer whether he would take responsibility for failing to prevent the deadly incursion.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Eugenia Yosef,Tamar Michaelis,Sophie Jeong","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/head-of-military-idf-intelligence-directorate-change-of-command-ceremony-6-6-2022-ii.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":6.982729,"_id":"8ff2a039aceae3c843d80a350083ad28"},{"title":"Israeli military strikes four locations in Lebanon, state news agency reports","author":"Kathleen Magramo","published_date":"2024-04-22 04:01:31","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-04-22-24/h_8bfc9f1c70fee8df5bb5b535792f5840","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Israeli strikes hit four sites in southern Lebanon over the weekend, Lebanese state-owned National News Agency reported, as regional tensions intensify over Israel's military campaign in Gaza.","summary":"Israeli strikes hit four sites in southern Lebanon over the weekend, Lebanese state-owned National News Agency reported, as regional tensions intensify over Israel's military campaign in Gaza.\nThe strikes hit the villages of Khiam, Tayr Harfa, Kfarkella near Odaisseh, and an area between Ramieh and Beit Leif.\nThe Israeli military confirmed bombardment on three of the four locations, hitting what it said were Hezbollah targets.

Iran's rulers decided to rip off the cover behind which they have spent decades attacking Israel and others indirectly, and instead of using one of their proxy militias they made the move themselves, openly, launching more than 300 projectiles \u2014 cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, explosive-laden drones \u2014 toward Israel, the country they have repeatedly vowed to destroy.\nThe next chapter of this conflict is still being written, but already the event has left us with important lessons and looming questions.\n1. If Israel's defensive shield had failed, thousands of Israelis could have been killed, and the world today would find itself in a major regional war.\n1. If Israel's defensive shield had failed, thousands of Israelis could have been killed, and the world today would find itself in a major regional war. It's impossible to overstate just how cataclysmic the Islamic Republic's weekend attack could have become. The indelible image of Iranian missiles intercepted over Jerusalem, exploding above the golden cupula of the Dome of the Rock, over al-Aqsa Mosque and the Temple Mount \u2014 the site of the biblical Temple in Jerusalem \u2014 as well as other landmarks tracing the life and death of Jesus, stood as a warning of the intensity of what Iran might have unleashed.\nMiraculously, by a feat of military technology bolstered by coordination with friends and allies, Israel was able to repel the massive attack. The only reported injury on the ground was a young Arab Israeli girl hit by falling shrapnel.\nAnyone who claims Iran was only seeking to inflict a symbolic show of force is ignoring the facts. Iran could have killed thousands of civilians. If it had, the world would look very different today; a major regional conflagration would likely be raging now with worldwide reverberations.\nIran justified its attack as a response to an April 1 strike against an annex to its embassy in Damascus, which killed top commanders of its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Israel denied the building was a diplomatic facility and has not acknowledged carrying out the hit, but US officials believe it did. The Quds Force commanders have been working with Iran-allied Hezbollah, which has been shelling Israel since Oct. 7, when Hamas launched an attack from Gaza. Thousands remain displaced as the attack made parts of Israel unlivable.\nIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

The Quds Force commanders have been working with Iran-allied Hezbollah, which has been shelling Israel since Oct. 7, when Hamas launched an attack from Gaza. Thousands remain displaced as the attack made parts of Israel unlivable. Tehran's hypocritical indignation at what it frames as a violation of its diplomatic protections brings to mind the many occasions when Tehran's proxies have massacred civilians, blowing up American and Israeli embassies as they did in Beirut and Buenos Aires. (Iran denies involvement.)\n2. What if Iran's missiles and drones had carried nuclear material?\n2. What if Iran's missiles and drones had carried nuclear material? It's the stuff of nightmares. Watching the skies over Israel \u2014 and before that over Jordan, Iraq and Iran \u2014 streak with flying objects laden with explosives, it was impossible to ignore that Iran is close to its long-sought nuclear weapons capability. (It denies it wants nuclear weapons.) Iran could build a nuclear weapon in short order, but even before a bomb is ready, even before it builds one or buys it from, say, North Korea, it could use nuclear material inside a conventional weapon. Shooting it down would bring radioactive material to the ground.\nThis is an inescapable reality that reminds us why a country that has built a network of proxy militias, that oppresses its own people and even hunts them down in exile, is not just a threat to the freedom of Iranians and the survival and stability of its neighbors. It's a challenge for the entire world.\n3. The unimaginable is not a theory. It can happen. It does.\n3. The unimaginable is not a theory. It can happen. It does. Israel and Iran have fought a shadow war for decades. The notion that one day Iran would launch a direct attack against Israel may have seemed like a distant possibility: something that was bound to happen, but only at some elusive future date. The same was true of Hamas, a terrorist group that seized control of Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thought he could appease Hamas and preserve quiet in Gaza and safety for Israelis living in the south. Others worried that one day Hamas would attack with full force. Many have worried that Iran will one day attack with full force. October 7 and April 14 are reminders that the unimaginable, the barely-imaginable, can and does happen.\nThe same was true of Hamas, a terrorist group that seized control of Gaza.

The war in Gaza is about more than Gaza, about more than a Palestinian state.\n4. The war in Gaza is about more than Gaza, about more than a Palestinian state. In the midst of the calamity that has befallen the people on both sides of the Israel-Gaza border and in light of the immense human suffering \u2014 more than 1,200 Israelis killed, hostages taken by Hamas and still held in Gaza and tens of thousands killed in Gaza including women and children \u2014 it's easy to overlook the larger forces at play in the Israel-Hamas war. The Middle East is in the throes of a regional conflict, a major geopolitical battle in which Iran is a major player \u2014 the major player. Iran has made it possible for Hamas to build up its arsenal. Iran all but created Hezbollah, now the dominant force in Lebanon. Iran exerts enormous influence in Yemen, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq.

And it views not only Israel but many of its Arab neighbors as rivals and foes. 5. Israel is not isolated; Iran is.\n5. Israel is not isolated; Iran is. Iran does have its satellites and proxies, and it has become a weapons supplier to Russia in its war against Ukraine. But the night Iran attacked Israel it revealed its own isolation. Israelis are basking in the rare and reassuring discovery that much of the world does support them, at least at this moment.\nAs the missiles took aim at Israel, a grand coalition mobilized. The verbal backing spanned the globe. From Argentina to Japan world leaders condemned Iran. An emergency virtual meeting of the G7 expressed 'full solidarity and support to Israel and its people,' condemning Iran 'in the strongest terms.' UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres 'strongly condemned' Iran's actions.\nMore importantly, Israel received military and tactical backing. Even though Israel shot down the overwhelming majority of the projectiles, the United States, France and the UK helped shoot down some of the hundreds of drones headed for Israel. More significantly, Jordan acknowledged that it, too, seeing its airspace violated, intercepted Iranian drones.\nThere are multiple reports that other Arab countries also participated. The Wall Street Journal reported that several countries agreed to pass intelligence and radar tracking information and, 'in some cases, supplied their own forces to help.' Saudi Arabia \u2014 Iran's longtime rival \u2014 and the United Arab Emirates agreed to supply intelligence, according to the report.\nIn addition, the US was able to work out of its bases in Qatar and northern Iraq to counter Iran's attack.\nThe question now is how Israel responds. Benny Gantz, a member of the war cabinet formed after the Hamas attack, said Israel will 'exact a price from Iran in a way and time that suits us.'\nBiden wants Israel to 'take the win,' and move on. The most far-right members of Netanyahu's coalition, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who are not in the war cabinet, want more drastic action. In the US, former National Security Advisor John Bolton told CNN that this is an opportunity for Israel to 'destroy Iran's nuclear weapons program, which is the existential threat Israel faces.'\nBezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who are not in the war cabinet, want more drastic action.

Sign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook This is, however, another opportunity for Israel, a chance to rebuild some of the ties that have become frayed during the devastating war with Hamas.\nThe Iranian attack has revealed that Israel does have friends, including some in very important places: across the Middle East. The Islamic Republic just reminded the entire Middle East, the entire world, that it can upend expectations and launch a reckless, potentially catastrophic attack.\nIsrael should use the moment to fortify its links with Arab neighbors who despise and distrust Iran. That could go a long way in protecting the entire region against Iran, but also in carving a path forward that includes a stable Gaza, one that is not in the hands of one of Iran's extremist proxies, opening the possibility to more stability and, just maybe, lasting peace.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Frida Ghitis,Opinion Frida Ghitis","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-04-13t233806z-760586938-rc2y57asx8kc-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-20240415194039062.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@CNNOpinions","_score":6.9170527,"_id":"9dc70dd7ea55caad12a58fa1873495a2"},{"title":"Live updates: Israel weighs response to Iran attack, US will impose new sanctions on Tehran","author":"Kathleen Magramo","published_date":"2024-04-17 03:58:23","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-04-17-24","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The United States will impose new sanctions targeting Tehran after Iran's attack on Israel over the weekend.

In this episode, CNN's Nic Robertson looks at what two past Israeli attacks can tell us about how they may respond in this case. We're going to be talking about the Iran situation again today, but I do not want to forget about Gaza. The war continues there, and so does the mass death that comes along with it. Little how much holds his tiny brother's hand and carries a bag of flour. The other day, a huge group of Palestinians said they got word that they would be allowed to return to whatever is left of their homes in Gaza City, even though there was no such official announcement. But when they got to a checkpoint, all they found was a bloodbath. They say Israeli soldiers opened fire as young men tried crossing the checkpoint with women and children. Several were injured. Among them five year old Sally. She was in her mother's arms when she was shot in the head. The Israeli military didn't comment on Sally's injury and said the north remains a war zone. No one is allowed to return. Meanwhile, famine is still an urgent concern. More aid trucks have moved across the border into the north, but there continues to be issues with actually distributing it. And with all of that as a backdrop, the entire Middle East is watching and waiting for Israel's next move after Iran's unprecedented aerial attack. Whatever happens next could plunge the region into full blown chaos. But because all of this is so unprecedented, does anybody have a playbook to pull from? Prime Minister Netanyahu has to calculate that the rules of the game have changed with Iran, and he's now got to predict what the new rules are. Today, how decades of shadow warfare between Israel and Iran suddenly moved into the spotlight from CNN, this is Tug of War. I'm David Rind. Nic Robertson is back with us today. He is CNN's international diplomatic editor is in Jerusalem. And so, Nic, as we sit here on Thursday, we are still waiting to see if Israel will respond to this Iranian attack. But like for those unfamiliar with the region and all the history here, can you tell us a little bit about where this beef between Israel and Iran started? Like, how far back does this go? You could say it goes back millennia, but I think more recently you would look at the Islamic revolution in Iran, 1979, and the theocracy that established itself in Iran chose to support the cause of Palestinians in Israel, in the West occupied West Bank, in Gaza as a cause, to many would argue, curry favor with with Arab states in the region. And the state of Iran calls for the destruction of the state of Israel. They deny its right to exist. And this is deep. And for Israel, the threat from Iran is existential. And of course, Iran, no fan of the U.S. as well. So I imagine they see that alliance as particularly troublesome. They see Israel as an arm of the United States interests in the region which run counter to their interests. And so a lot of this conflict had been kind of operated in the shadows, right through proxies and kind of covert attacks. That's been the history, that the way that Iran strikes back at Israel has been through Hezbollah in Lebanon, through their proxies in Syria, through proxies in Iraq, when they can through proxies in Yemen. And there's certainly a strong case made that they fund and support, train, give ideas to Hamas inside the West Bank, inside of Gaza, all of which to destabilize the Israeli state. And so you wrote on CNN.com about a couple of past incidents, past Israeli operations, that maybe can tell us something about what we're seeing now. So tell me about those. Israel's fought a number of wars with its Arab neighbors over the years, and it sees threats from those neighbors as existential. South of the city, in an area where cameras are not permitted. Is the nuclear reactor hit by Israeli jets? Drive over a picture of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein? The newspaper Code of Syria carries a banner headline saying everyone condemns Israel. When Israel saw that Iraq was developing a nuclear facility. They decided that that was an existential threat. They sent fighter jets to destroy it, and it was bombed in 1981 and then 2007. The target no one's officially talking about. Israeli warplanes hit something inside Syria. They realized that Syria was developing a nuclear facility as well, with systems purchased from North Korea. They developed a plan to destroy that and again sent jets to destroy it. No Israeli official has confirmed an attack even took place, let alone provided any details. It was a complex operation, sophisticated. It was 11 years before Israel actually acknowledged the strike in Syria. While they didn't admit to it for over a decade, they didn't. That's the way that Israel operates. It operates with a great deal of secrecy because in part because if it openly accepts that it's done it, then that gives the other side legitimacy to strike back. That ambiguity is supposed to give a level of protection, if you will. It's it's it's one of multiple veneers of protection. But I guess then in this case, like if something happens in Iran that seems a little shady, like, isn't everybody going to know that this was Israel? Of course, they point the finger at Israel and their and their proxies in the region will take up the cry and say it is Israel. And there's very often strong and credible and leading evidence that would point to Israel, an Israeli hand behind it. But proving it can often be hard. I mean, access in Iran for independent reporting is incredibly difficult. So when the top Iranian nuclear physicist is assassinated, the assumption would be Israel was behind it. But to independently be on the ground and and test test the accusations is hard. And in terms of the actual things that we could see, like an assassination you're saying is on the table, like what else could possibly be in the playbook? It's hard to know what could be in the playbook, but it could run from attacking airbases to attacking nuclear facilities to attacking through cyber, trying to shut down, you know, various facilities, power structures, whatever it may be. But to send, send this very clear, strong signal to, to the Iranian leadership that this is a strike back. It could be targeted assassinations. It could also be that Israel does what the United States says and takes this as a win. I think it's worth it's worth noting Iran's strike on Israel was not theater. This was intended to take out military bases. Yeah, I wanted to ask about that because some people have been speculating that, oh, they knew that all of this stuff was going to get shot down and that would kind of accomplish their symbolism. But you're saying that they really did want to cause harm. Who knows what was in precisely in the mind of the Iranian leadership. But they launched a bigger attack on Israel than any of the sophisticated air attacks that Russia has launched on Ukraine in the last two years of war. That tells you something. Yes. The drones take many hours. And yes, Iran did inform neighboring countries that something was coming in the next 72 hours. But this defense system that Israel was able to put in place with allies did a job that I think even the Israelis didn't expect it to do, and certainly the allies didn't expect it to do. Iran very likely hoped for a better outcome. We know that the air alerts that Israel put out to to the civilian population over the weekend told people in Dimona, where the nuclear facility is, to seek and take cover. So it's clear that Israel knew that Iran was targeting the nuclear facility. And so this tells you several things. It perhaps explains, in part why Iran over the weekend, according to the IAEA, Director General Rafael Grossi, had shut down their nuclear facilities expecting the possibility of a very quick retaliation, which we understand was on the cards, a quick retaliation. But this also may signal that Israel is putting out in the public domain information about what Iran targeted. It was a nuclear facility, which to some people, would give legitimacy for Israel to strike an Iranian nuclear facility or its mind games, or they or they are just messing with the Iranians to the extent of maybe this is what we'll target. More with Nick in just a bit. Welcome back to Tug of War and my conversation with CNN's Nic Robertson. You mentioned the other countries in the region. How are they feeling about this very tenuous moment? It's difficult. Neither Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the same. Both countries don't want to be aligned, or it's difficult for them to be politically aligned with Israel because so many Palestinians in Gaza are almost 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza now have been killed. So these Arab nations that have helped Israel over the weekend defend itself from Iran's attack. They don't want to have to do that every weekend. It can certainly cause them political turmoil and internal stress. Because they don't want to be seen as like, cosigning what is happening in Gaza by helping Israel defend itself. That that's the link that people would make, and they would want to bring down their leaderships if they thought that was the case. Hmhm. You know it's an escalation ladder. And where is the threshold? The threshold is quite flexible. 'Amos Yadlin is a very well-informed person and he is a very experienced person. He was the fighter pilot that dropped the bomb in 1981 from his fighter jet on the Iraqi nuclear reactor, and he was as the head of the military intelligence agency in 2007. The person who put together the plan to target the Syrian nuclear facility in 2007 and destroy it successfully. So he has a good understanding of what can be on the table in terms of potential target, and he has a good understanding of the analysis that is made on whether or not you strike a target. The damage that can be inflicted on Iran is huge, is huge. That's why they do it always indirectly. And his assessment is that Israel crossed a red line, an Iranian red line, by targeting the IRGC commander and other IRGC figures in Damascus in that building, the Iranians say it was a diplomatic facility. He believes it was not a diplomatic facility, that it was somewhere that military were meeting. Nevertheless, Israel's calculation until now has always been that it struck targets that have been not going to cause a retribution from Iran, and this time they got the call wrong. Which means why did they get it wrong? Why is Iran's assessment changed? This is his belief. And his belief is that Iran's assessment has changed quite simply because the Iranians think Netanyahu, the prime minister, is weaker because his relationship with the United States and President Biden is weakened and it's weakened over Gaza. And they see this as an opportunity that they've never seen or taken before. We are in uncharted territory. Because the US relationship with Israel is a little bit strained at this point. Iran says, hey, we can go after them without necessarily having to fear of getting a huge U.S. blowback on any of these specific actions that Israel might take. And President Biden has affirmed that by saying that he's not going to help Israel strike back at Iran. So Iran has calculated correctly here. So therefore, Prime Minister Netanyahu has to calculate that the rules of the game have changed with Iran, and he's now got to predict what the new rules are. So when he strikes back, he has to be aware that he may cause a level of retribution on Israel that will cause significant civilian casualties. This is a new place for the Israeli prime minister to be. This is a much steeper and problem for him to navigate. Really complicated moment. Thanks for boiling it down for us, Nick. Appreciate it.

I'll talk to you then.\nHow Israel-Iran Tensions Moved Out of the Shadows Tug of War 16 mins While Iran's air attack on Israel over the weekend was uniquely brazen, experts say the two nations have been engaged in a \u2018shadow war' through proxies and covert actions for decades. In this episode, CNN's Nic Robertson looks at what two past Israeli attacks can tell us about how they may respond in this case.\nWe're going to be talking about the Iran situation again today, but I do not want to forget about Gaza. The war continues there, and so does the mass death that comes along with it. Little how much holds his tiny brother's hand and carries a bag of flour. The other day, a huge group of Palestinians said they got word that they would be allowed to return to whatever is left of their homes in Gaza City, even though there was no such official announcement. But when they got to a checkpoint, all they found was a bloodbath. They say Israeli soldiers opened fire as young men tried crossing the checkpoint with women and children. Several were injured. Among them five year old Sally. She was in her mother's arms when she was shot in the head. The Israeli military didn't comment on Sally's injury and said the north remains a war zone. No one is allowed to return. Meanwhile, famine is still an urgent concern. More aid trucks have moved across the border into the north, but there continues to be issues with actually distributing it. And with all of that as a backdrop, the entire Middle East is watching and waiting for Israel's next move after Iran's unprecedented aerial attack. Whatever happens next could plunge the region into full blown chaos. But because all of this is so unprecedented, does anybody have a playbook to pull from? Prime Minister Netanyahu has to calculate that the rules of the game have changed with Iran, and he's now got to predict what the new rules are. Today, how decades of shadow warfare between Israel and Iran suddenly moved into the spotlight from CNN, this is Tug of War. I'm David Rind. Nic Robertson is back with us today. He is CNN's international diplomatic editor is in Jerusalem. And so, Nic, as we sit here on Thursday, we are still waiting to see if Israel will respond to this Iranian attack. But like for those unfamiliar with the region and all the history here, can you tell us a little bit about where this beef between Israel and Iran started? Like, how far back does this go? You could say it goes back millennia, but I think more recently you would look at the Islamic revolution in Iran, 1979, and the theocracy that established itself in Iran chose to support the cause of Palestinians in Israel, in the West occupied West Bank, in Gaza as a cause, to many would argue, curry favor with with Arab states in the region. And the state of Iran calls for the destruction of the state of Israel. They deny its right to exist. And this is deep. And for Israel, the threat from Iran is existential. And of course, Iran, no fan of the U.S. as well. So I imagine they see that alliance as particularly troublesome. They see Israel as an arm of the United States interests in the region which run counter to their interests. And so a lot of this conflict had been kind of operated in the shadows, right through proxies and kind of covert attacks. That's been the history, that the way that Iran strikes back at Israel has been through Hezbollah in Lebanon, through their proxies in Syria, through proxies in Iraq, when they can through proxies in Yemen. And there's certainly a strong case made that they fund and support, train, give ideas to Hamas inside the West Bank, inside of Gaza, all of which to destabilize the Israeli state. And so you wrote on CNN.com about a couple of past incidents, past Israeli operations, that maybe can tell us something about what we're seeing now. So tell me about those. Israel's fought a number of wars with its Arab neighbors over the years, and it sees threats from those neighbors as existential. South of the city, in an area where cameras are not permitted. Is the nuclear reactor hit by Israeli jets? Drive over a picture of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein? The newspaper Code of Syria carries a banner headline saying everyone condemns Israel. When Israel saw that Iraq was developing a nuclear facility. They decided that that was an existential threat. They sent fighter jets to destroy it, and it was bombed in 1981 and then 2007. The target no one's officially talking about. Israeli warplanes hit something inside Syria. They realized that Syria was developing a nuclear facility as well, with systems purchased from North Korea. They developed a plan to destroy that and again sent jets to destroy it. No Israeli official has confirmed an attack even took place, let alone provided any details. It was a complex operation, sophisticated. It was 11 years before Israel actually acknowledged the strike in Syria. While they didn't admit to it for over a decade, they didn't. That's the way that Israel operates. It operates with a great deal of secrecy because in part because if it openly accepts that it's done it, then that gives the other side legitimacy to strike back. That ambiguity is supposed to give a level of protection, if you will. It's it's it's one of multiple veneers of protection. But I guess then in this case, like if something happens in Iran that seems a little shady, like, isn't everybody going to know that this was Israel? Of course, they point the finger at Israel and their and their proxies in the region will take up the cry and say it is Israel. And there's very often strong and credible and leading evidence that would point to Israel, an Israeli hand behind it. But proving it can often be hard. I mean, access in Iran for independent reporting is incredibly difficult. So when the top Iranian nuclear physicist is assassinated, the assumption would be Israel was behind it. But to independently be on the ground and and test test the accusations is hard. And in terms of the actual things that we could see, like an assassination you're saying is on the table, like what else could possibly be in the playbook? It's hard to know what could be in the playbook, but it could run from attacking airbases to attacking nuclear facilities to attacking through cyber, trying to shut down, you know, various facilities, power structures, whatever it may be. But to send, send this very clear, strong signal to, to the Iranian leadership that this is a strike back. It could be targeted assassinations. It could also be that Israel does what the United States says and takes this as a win. I think it's worth it's worth noting Iran's strike on Israel was not theater. This was intended to take out military bases. Yeah, I wanted to ask about that because some people have been speculating that, oh, they knew that all of this stuff was going to get shot down and that would kind of accomplish their symbolism. But you're saying that they really did want to cause harm. Who knows what was in precisely in the mind of the Iranian leadership. But they launched a bigger attack on Israel than any of the sophisticated air attacks that Russia has launched on Ukraine in the last two years of war. That tells you something. Yes. The drones take many hours. And yes, Iran did inform neighboring countries that something was coming in the next 72 hours. But this defense system that Israel was able to put in place with allies did a job that I think even the Israelis didn't expect it to do, and certainly the allies didn't expect it to do. Iran very likely hoped for a better outcome. We know that the air alerts that Israel put out to to the civilian population over the weekend told people in Dimona, where the nuclear facility is, to seek and take cover. So it's clear that Israel knew that Iran was targeting the nuclear facility. And so this tells you several things. It perhaps explains, in part why Iran over the weekend, according to the IAEA, Director General Rafael Grossi, had shut down their nuclear facilities expecting the possibility of a very quick retaliation, which we understand was on the cards, a quick retaliation. But this also may signal that Israel is putting out in the public domain information about what Iran targeted. It was a nuclear facility, which to some people, would give legitimacy for Israel to strike an Iranian nuclear facility or its mind games, or they or they are just messing with the Iranians to the extent of maybe this is what we'll target. More with Nick in just a bit. Welcome back to Tug of War and my conversation with CNN's Nic Robertson. You mentioned the other countries in the region. How are they feeling about this very tenuous moment? It's difficult. Neither Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the same. Both countries don't want to be aligned, or it's difficult for them to be politically aligned with Israel because so many Palestinians in Gaza are almost 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza now have been killed. So these Arab nations that have helped Israel over the weekend defend itself from Iran's attack. They don't want to have to do that every weekend. It can certainly cause them political turmoil and internal stress. Because they don't want to be seen as like, cosigning what is happening in Gaza by helping Israel defend itself. That that's the link that people would make, and they would want to bring down their leaderships if they thought that was the case. Hmhm. You know it's an escalation ladder.

In addition to a potential military response, the war cabinet is also mulling diplomatic options to further isolate Iran on the world stage.\nBenny Gantz, a key member of the war cabinet, has pushed for a swifter response to Iran's attack, two Israeli officials said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far pumped the brakes on making a decision.\nGantz believes that the longer Israel delays its response to Iran's attack, the harder it will be to garner international support for such an attack, the sources said.

Beirut, Lebanon CNN \u2014\nBeirut, Lebanon CNN \u2014 The scope of Israel's military response to Iran's first-ever direct attack on the country remains murky. Israeli officials have yet to publicly acknowledge responsibility for reported overnight explosions in parts of Iran on Friday. Tehran has dismissed these as attacks by 'tiny drones' that were shot down by its air defense systems.\nIran may be downplaying what was likely to have been a significant but limited Israeli attack, but that seems to be secondary to the larger forces at play. What is plain to see is that both Iran and Israel are keen to wrap up the most dangerous escalation between the two regional powerhouses to date.\nThis month's dramatic escalation, which kicked off with an apparent Israeli airstrike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, followed by a largely foiled Iranian attack of over 300 airborne weapons on Israel, seems to have given way to a rapid climbdown. Shortly after the Friday morning attack in Iran, a regional intelligence source told CNN's Nic Robertson that Iran was not expected to respond further, and that the direct state-to-state strikes between the two enemy states were over.\nThe latest flare-up brought the stakes into sharp focus, but it also exposed the limits of a direct confrontation between Iran and Israel.\nBy attacking Iran's consulate in Syria on April 1 and killing a senior Iranian commander that serves as a key intermediary between Tehran and Lebanon's Hezbollah, Israel risked provoking a response from the powerful Shia militant group on its northern border. As part of Iran's retaliatory attack on Israel, its weapons navigated over at least two neighboring countries that house US bases.\nWhat happens between Iran and Israel rarely stays between Iran and Israel. The region is deeply intertwined. That heightens the risks of military action, but it also acts as guardrails against a potential conflagration.\nSo when US officials said last weekend that Washington would not participate in an Israeli response to Iran's attack on Israel, that seemed to immediately take the wind out of the sails of a potential escalation.\nUS forces had shot down more than 70 of Iran's weapons as they headed to Israel. By buttressing Israel's defenses, the US had ostensibly done its part in protecting its stalwart ally. But participating in Friday's attack would have been a step too far for the US, thrusting a region dotted with US-allied states into the unknown.\nTehran's regional considerations may also be cause for restraint. Its fledgling friendships with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 both major US allies \u2013 are a centerpiece of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi's foreign policy. Diplomatic relations between Tehran and Riyadh \u2013 former archnemeses \u2013 were restored during talks brokered last year by China, which threw its weight into maintaining those normalization agreements. Region-wide turmoil would risk compromising those key relationships.\nThose dangers may be lost in Iran and Israel's more hawkish quarters, where the more extremist elements may be itching for a final showdown. Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir blasted Friday's attack as 'weak.' Over the past week, Israeli media reported that he had urged Israel's war cabinet to 'go crazy' apparently bristling at indications of a tempered military response from Israel.\nIn Iran, analysts speculated that the shooting down of Iranian weapons in and around Israel's airspace was likely to have underscored an imbalance of power in favor of its enemy, ultimately empowering the hardliners in Tehran to flout international pressure and advance the country's long-feared nuclear program.\nThis month's flare-up will undoubtedly stir up domestic tensions as the two sworn enemies return to their long-running shadow war. Iran's non-state allies will continue to fight Israel and the US in various parts of the Middle East \u2014 they have vowed to keep up the fight as long as Israel's devastating war in Gaza continues. Those battles, which span Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, grow in complexity the longer they go on.\nMeanwhile, parties to these conflicts will continue to test the limits of the unwritten rules of engagement, hoping to assert their power and brandish their arsenal while preventing a complete downward spiral into war.\nThere is much to read between the lines of the latest flare-up. But it is clear that both sides of the regional battle have decided that they have too much to lose in all-out war.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Tamara Qiblawi,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap24110402233044.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":6.8885164,"_id":"7052703e62f061ac4badf36240b23fbe"},{"title":"Direct state-to-state strikes between Israel and Iran are 'over,' says regional intelligence source","author":"Kathleen Magramo","published_date":"2024-04-19 06:08:15","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-iran-gaza-conflict-news-04-19-24/h_b3be04c2f747ec45fc2a338bbc768cf6","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"A regional intelligence source with knowledge of Iran's potential reaction to Friday's strike, which was carried out by Israel according to a US official, said that direct state-to-state strikes\u2026","summary":"Israel has carried out a military strike on Iran, a US official told CNN, a potentially dangerous escalation in a fast-widening Middle East conflict that Iranian officials have so far sought to play down.

Mostafa Alkharouf/Anadolu/Getty Images Israel would need significant support from Western allies to enter into a full-blown war in the Middle East, according to Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center research foundation. \"Israel does not have the capacity for a long-term all-out war without external support. It would need the commitment from the United States to continue providing arms. It relies on the United States and other Western powers on a number of military fronts,\" she told CNN's John Vause. Appeals made by Israel's Western allies for it to exercise restraint in the wake of Iran's attack last weekend likely played a large role in Israeli officials' calculations on how strongly to retaliate, she added. 'It was clear that there was tremendous (international) pressure on Israel not to escalate things further.\" For context: The US, the UK and France all helped Israel counter Iranian missiles and drones during last weekend's attack.

Israel had carried out a strike on Iran hours earlier, a US official told CNN. The Israeli military has not commented and Iran has not identified the source of the attack. Air defenses intercepted three drones, an Iranian official said. And air defenses caused blasts near an army base in Isfahan province, according to Iranian media. Iranian media showed residents walking near Isfahan landmarks such as the Naqsh-e Jahan square and along the Zayandeh Rud river, while normal traffic was reported in the city, according to semi-official news outlet ISNA. Isfahan airport was operating as normal after airports were earlier closed around the country, according to semi-official Tasnim news.

Israel targeted Syria's \"air defense sites in the southern region. The aggression led to material losses,\" SANA reported. The Israeli military told CNN that it does not comment on reports in foreign media. 3 hr 7 min ago From CNN's John Vause and Elizabeth Wolfe Iranian officials appear to view Friday's attack \u2014 which was limited in scope \u2014 as Israel trying to \"save face\" after it was targeted by Iran in strikes over the weekend, according to Abas Aslani, an Iranian journalist and researcher. \"It's a bit early to judge whether it's over or not, but at the moment... it doesn't seem to be a regional war emerging,\" Aslani told CNN, noting there is still a chance the situation could escalate. Since a suspected Israeli attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria earlier this month, people in Iran have mostly stood behind their government's airstrikes against Israel on Saturday, he said. It is \"a matter of national pride\" for many Iranians. \"Whether they are reformist or conservatives, critical or supportive of the government, because it's an issue of security they have been mostly supportive of Iran's action against Israel,\" Aslani said. 3 hr 42 min ago From CNN's Adam Pourahmadi and Irene Nasser There has been no damage to Iran's nuclear sites after an aerial attack in Isfahan province on Friday, the United Nations nuclear watchdog said, as it called for restraint in the region. The International Atomic Energy Agency said its chief, Rafael Grossi, \"continues to call for extreme restraint from everybody and reiterates that nuclear facilities should never be a target in military conflicts.\" \"IAEA can confirm that there is no damage to Iran's nuclear sites ... [and] is monitoring the situation very closely,\" it said. Earlier, an Iranian official said air defenses intercepted three drones. Multiple Iranian state-aligned news agencies reported that sites associated with the country's nuclear program were 'completely secure' and the attack appeared to be limited in scope. Some context: A US official told CNN that Israel carried out a strike inside Iran. The target was not nuclear, the official added. Prior to Friday's strike, the US expectation was that Israel would not target civilian or nuclear facilities, a second US official said. 3 hr 37 min ago From CNN staff IRGC released a photo that it said showed flashes in the sky of Isfahan, Iran following reports of explosions. IRGC Israel has carried out a strike inside Iran, a US official told CNN on Friday, in a move that threatens to further escalate conflict in the Middle East. Iran's air defense systems were activated in several locations after explosions were heard close to the airport and an army base in the province of Isfahan, state media reported early Friday morning. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attack. Here's what we know: What Iranian reports say: Three blasts were heard near a military base where fighter jets are located in northwest Isfahan, Iran's semi-official FARS news agency reported. Following the strike, Iranian media reported that all facilities around Isfahan are secure, including significant nuclear facilities in the area.

For days, Israel has been weighing its response to unprecedented weekend strikes from Iran, which were launched in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on its embassy compound in Syria earlier this month. A US official told CNN that Friday's attack was an Israeli strike. Israel has declined to comment on it. 'Israel must maintain its vigilance' in case Iran decides to respond with another show of force, retired Major General Mark MacCarley said. By targeting the Iranian province of Isfahan \u2014 the site of significant nuclear facilities \u2014Israel was likely warning that it could easily overwhelm Iran's defenses, MacCarley said. 'I think that there was a very deliberate thought process on the part of the Israeli war cabinet,\" he said. \"Israelis had to retaliate, but at the same time, within that retaliation was a message, and that is, 'Yes, we can get through. Don't do it again.

The House GOP Conference will meet Monday evening to discuss the Iran-Israel situation and their legislative plans going forward, according to GOP sources.\n'The House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing with Israel. We're going to try again this week, and the details of that package are being put together right now. We're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues,' Johnson told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo over the weekend.\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries urged immediate passage of the foreign aid package passed by the Senate in a new letter to colleagues.\n'The gravely serious events of this past weekend in the Middle East and Eastern Europe underscore the need for Congress to act immediately. We must take up the bipartisan and comprehensive national security bill passed by the Senate forthwith,' Jeffries wrote.\nIn November, the House passed a bill to provide $14.3 billion in aid to Israel, but Democrats objected to the fact that the bill did not include aid to Ukraine and would enact funding cuts to the Internal Revenue Service.\nThe Senate passed its bill in February \u2013 a $95.3 billion foreign aid bill with assistance for Ukraine, Israel and other priorities.\nA significant number of House Republicans are opposed to sending further aid to Ukraine. Now, Johnson faces the most significant threat to his speakership to date after GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is among those who oppose additional Ukraine aid, filed a motion against him that could be used to force a vote on his ouster.\nJohnson called Greene's decision to file the motion to vacate a 'distraction' during the interview on Fox News.\n'That's a distraction. What Marjorie has done with the motion to vacate is not helpful for our party, for our mission to save the country, because if we don't grow the House majority, keep the House majority, win the Senate and win back the White House for President Trump, we're going to lose the republic,' he said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Clare Foran","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2147028982.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.873728,"_id":"88b8a62705e6c08593773c3ef5e59d19"},{"title":"Live updates: Israel attacks Iran, explosions in Isfahan, war in Gaza","author":"Kathleen Magramo","published_date":"2024-04-19 06:08:15","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-iran-gaza-conflict-news-04-19-24","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Israel has carried out a strike inside Iran, according to a US official.

It is \"a matter of national pride\" for many Iranians. \"Whether they are reformist or conservatives, critical or supportive of the government, because it's an issue of security they have been mostly supportive of Iran's action against Israel,\" Aslani said. 2 hr 32 min ago From CNN's Adam Pourahmadi and Irene Nasser There has been no damage to Iran's nuclear sites after an aerial attack in Isfahan province on Friday, the United Nations nuclear watchdog said, as it called for restraint in the region. The International Atomic Energy Agency said its chief, Rafael Grossi, \"continues to call for extreme restraint from everybody and reiterates that nuclear facilities should never be a target in military conflicts.\" \"IAEA can confirm that there is no damage to Iran's nuclear sites ... [and] is monitoring the situation very closely,\" it said. Earlier, an Iranian official said air defenses intercepted three drones. Multiple Iranian state-aligned news agencies reported that sites associated with the country's nuclear program were 'completely secure' and the attack appeared to be limited in scope.

For days, Israel has been weighing its response to unprecedented weekend strikes from Iran, which were launched in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on its embassy compound in Syria earlier this month. A US official told CNN that Friday's attack was an Israeli strike. Israel has declined to comment on it. 'Israel must maintain its vigilance' in case Iran decides to respond with another show of force, retired Major General Mark MacCarley said. By targeting the Iranian province of Isfahan \u2014 the site of significant nuclear facilities \u2014Israel was likely warning that it could easily overwhelm Iran's defenses, MacCarley said. 'I think that there was a very deliberate thought process on the part of the Israeli war cabinet,\" he said. \"Israelis had to retaliate, but at the same time, within that retaliation was a message, and that is, 'Yes, we can get through. Don't do it again.

CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Israel has yet to agree how to respond to the Iranian attack over the weekend that saw more than 300 projectiles fired at its territory in the first direct military confrontation between the Islamic Republic and the Jewish state.\nIsrael must balance international pressure to show restraint on the one hand, while searching for an appropriate response to an unprecedented attack. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now has to weigh his right-wing coalition's call for a strong reaction against the risk of further international isolation for Israel by widening the war without international support.\nRelated article Why Iran attacked Israel and what comes next\nRelated article Why Iran attacked Israel and what comes next Israel's war cabinet on Monday remained determined to respond to Iran's attack for what Iran says was retaliation to a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic building in Damascus on April 1. Despite pressure from allies not to escalate, the cabinet is now debating the timing and scope of the response, two Israeli officials familiar with the deliberations told CNN.\nAnalysts say that Israel has few options, and each of those options comes with a price for the Jewish state, especially as it is already embroiled in a brutal six-month war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip and is confronting various Iran-backed militants in the region.\nA direct attack on Iran would set yet another precedent. While Israel is believed to have conducted covert operations in Iran over the years, often targeting individuals or facilities seen as a threat to its security, it has never launched a direct military assault on Iranian territory.\n'We are definitely in a new phase, and a very dangerous phase of the Israeli-Iranian confrontation,' said Raz Zimmt, an Iran expert at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv. 'Iran has certainly tried to change the rules of the game with Israel\u2026 We might expect more rounds of direct attacks in the future.'\nWhile Israel may find it hard not to retaliate, he said, it may not conduct an immediate 'full scale military attack against targets inside Iran' as Tehran has vowed to retaliate with an even bigger response than the attack launched over the weekend.\n'The preference in Israel has been to continue and concentrate on achieving our main objectives in Gaza, and not to open new fronts,' Zimmt told CNN.\nAlon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat, said it is unlikely that Israel will retaliate by directly striking Iran. But if it does, he said, the fallout will depend on the targets. Targets could include military assets or the Islamic Republic's nuclear program, he said. 'Each and every one represents a different level of escalation.'\nAn Israeli official told CNN on Monday that among the military options being considered is an attack on an Iranian facility that would send a message to Tehran but avoid causing casualties. Israeli officials recognize that will be a difficult needle to thread, the official added.\nIsrael's response may however be constrained by the fact that it acted as part of an informal coalition when fending off Iran's barrage of missiles and drones, Tamir Hayman, Israel's former head of military intelligence, said on X.\nThe attacks were thwarted with the help of allies including the US, UK and France, as well Jordan.\n'This is effective and important, but it will limit the freedom of action in response,' Hayman, who now heads the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv, said on Sunday. Western and Arab allies of Israel have been discouraging it from responding to Iran's attack.\nUS President Joe Biden and senior members of his national security team have told their Israeli counterparts the US will not participate in any offensive action against Iran, according to US officials familiar with the matter. Biden sought to frame Israel's successful interception of the Iranian onslaught as a major victory \u2014 with the suggestion that further Israeli response was unnecessary.\nIsrael is also likely to take domestic political considerations into account. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leads the most right- wing coalition in the country's history, and keeping that government from collapsing would require appeasement of hardliners.\nNetanyahu has come under intense criticism at home for not being able to prevent the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel and his inability to secure the release of the more than 100 hostages that remain in Gaza.\nPinkas expects any retaliatory decision by Israel to be heavily influenced by Netanyahu's far-right coalition and the prime minister's own needs for political survival.\n'With Mr. Netanyahu, it's all about politics and his own survival, and the maintenance of his coalition and his desire to broaden the war to distance himself from October 7 and the Hamas attack,' Pinkas said.\n'So, in his mind, a regional conflict or a direct conflict with Iran is consistent with the fabricated narrative that he invented, that this (October 7) is not just a terror attack but part of a much bigger confrontation and campaign,' Pinkas said.\nIn Israel, Pinkas added, the public doesn't want to open another front, with troops still fighting in Gaza.\n'People are still devastated and shocked over what had happened in October, so I don't think there is any public desire to escalate and open an entirely direct conflict with Iran,' he said.\nAhead of the weekend attacks, Israel had become increasingly isolated on the world stage due to its conduct in the Gaza war, where more than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed. Since the attack by Iran, however, its allies have rallied around the Jewish state and its right to protect itself.\nSome Israeli politicians have called for the state to take advantage of the support gained after the attack to hit back.\nOthers have called for Israel to use the 'international credit' to either attack Tehran or invade Gaza's Rafah city, where more than 1 million Palestinians are sheltering, and which Israel says is Hamas' last stronghold. A planned operation in the city has been delayed amid a global consensus against it.\n'We need to respond \u2014 and there are two good options: Either, we take advantage of the attack yesterday in order to attack Iran, or to come to an agreement with the United States to enter Rafah, and eliminate Hamas there,' Yaakov Amidror, former national security adviser to Netanyahu, told the Jerusalem Post on Monday.\nIsrael's government is aware of the international support and goodwill from its allies and doesn't want to squander that. At the same time, it recognizes that it cannot allow Iran's first attack on Israeli soil to go unanswered.\nBenny Gantz, a key member of the war cabinet, has pushed for a swifter response to Iran's attack, two Israeli officials told CNN. He believes that the longer Israel delays its response to Iran's attack, the harder it will be to garner international support for it, the sources said.\nOthers disagree, saying retaliatory action from Israel that escalates tensions would only further isolate the Jewish state, especially from Gulf Arab states that Israel seeks to normalize ties with.\nArab states, including those that are friendly with Israel, have expressed concern about a potential escalation from Iran's attack, but haven't outright condemned it. Israel said that most of the drones fired from Iran were intercepted outside its airspace. Jordan shot down a number of those drones and faced criticism in the Arab world for the move. It has argued that it was done to protect its citizens and in response to violations of its airspace.\nDespite its role in protecting Israel, however, Jordan has not shied away from chastizing the Netanyahu government. In an interview with CNN's Becky Anderson, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi appeared to support Iran's position that the attack was in retaliation to Israel's bombing of the Iranian diplomatic building in Damascus.\n'Now I think the pressure is on Israel not to escalate and work towards the objective that we all share, which is de-escalating the conflict,' Safadi said on Monday, warning that Netanyahu seeks an escalation to shift focus away from the war in Gaza.\nIsrael has also been on a mission to mend relations with Arab states, some of which sit across the Persian Gulf from Iran, house US military bases and have come under fire from Iran-allied groups in the past. Those nations have played a delicate balancing act between ties with Tehran and with Israel, and are wary of the impact of a full blown Iranian-Israeli war on their own stability and oil exports.\n'The last thing they (Gulf states) want right now is a conflagration that would raise oil prices, that would block the Strait of Hormuz,' Pinkas told CNN, referring to the world's most important oil transit point. Relations with those states may be affected if Israel is seen as responsible for such an escalation, he added.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jeremy Diamond,Nadeen Ebrahim,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/5a0724dd-cd2e-4d69-823c-42984829ff14.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":6.855904,"_id":"af804f2ad682def9abb69957fa4fbd92"},{"title":"Analysis: Can Netanyahu avoid triggering a regional war?","author":"Nic Robertson","published_date":"2024-04-16 23:02:11","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/16/middleeast/analysis-israel-options-for-iran-attack-intl-latam","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Can Netanyahu read the room right \u2013 with Iran threatening to attack, allies warning him not to \u2013 and avoid triggering a regional war?","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Israel, aided by its allies, dodged a bullet Sunday.\nTo be more precise, 60 tons of explosives aboard more than 350 Iranian projectiles, some bigger than a family car, failed to dodge Israel's defenses.\nYet Israel, in defiance of US President Joe Biden's warnings to 'take the win' and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi's threat of a 'severe, extensive and painful' response to any retaliation, is contemplating just that.\nDeterrence, shorthand for 'meanest S.O.B. in the room,' Israel believes, is the cornerstone of its survival. Iran is stealing that brick.\nIn a paradigm shift after decades of shadow proxy war, Tehran is usurping Israel's strategy. 'We have decided to create a new equation,' Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Commander Hossein Salami said. 'We will retaliate against them [Israel]'.\nWhen faced with existential threats in the past, Israel has executed the most audacious raids the region has ever witnessed. Cloaked in extreme secrecy in 1981, they bombed Iraq's nuclear reactor at Osirak before it went on line. Similarly, in 2007, they bombed Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad's nuclear reactor before it could be built.\nBoth attacks partnered intelligence with conventional military assets. It was 11 years before Israel admitted to the Syria strike.\nThe point being, Israel won't telegraph its attack plans as Iran did at the weekend.\nAside from the core members of Israel's war cabinet \u2013 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Netanyahu's former biggest political rival Benny Gantz \u2013 more than a dozen other people have sat at the table deep inside the Kirya, Israel's maximum security defense headquarters in Tel Aviv, thrashing out their next move.\nNotably, Mossad Chief David Barnea and Army Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi are among several security and intelligence officials who have been brought in.\nOutside the room, Netanyahu faces huge pressure from his hard right governing coalition. Bezalel Smotrich is demanding he 'restore deterrence,' and popular Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir is calling on the prime minister to 'go crazy.'\nOutside Israel, where allies are condemning Iran's attack but urging restraint and some are also bitter about Netanyahu's deadly treatment of Gaza's Palestinians since Hamas's brutal October 7 attack, calls for fresh sanctions on Tehran are growing.\n7 attack, calls for fresh sanctions on Tehran are growing. War cabinet members Gantz and Gallant are both seized of the diplomatic opportunity \u2013 Gantz saying, 'we will build a regional coalition to exact a price from Iran', while Gallant, according to a government press release, 'highlighted the opportunity to establish an international coalition and strategic alliance to counter the threat posed by Iran.' The defense minister has hinted heavily that Iran's nuclear facilities are in his sights, saying it is 'a state that threatens to place nuclear warheads on its missiles.'\nhas hinted heavily that Iran's nuclear facilities are in his sights, saying it is 'a state that threatens to place nuclear warheads on its missiles.' Netanyahu, meanwhile, said in a statement on the X account of his office, 'The international community must continue to stand united in resisting this Iranian aggression, which threatens world peace.'\nNetanyahu's next move will likely try to lock in sanctions, and strike before negative Gaza headlines dump the international good will filling his sails.\nThe clock is ticking.

Instead, it may have been intended to demonstrate Israeli capacity to penetrate deep into Iran following Iran's unprecedented missile and drone attack on Israel last weekend, which was largely thwarted.\nStill, the fact that Israel chose a target inside Iran rather than confining its response to Iranian proxies in Syria or Iraq, for instance, significantly ups the ante in the confrontation and raises the possibility that the showdown could quickly get out of control.\nThe Israeli action last weekend that was largely repulsed by Israeli, US and allied defensive systems followed an Israeli strike on Iranian consular buildings in Damascus, Syria, that killed two senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers.\nWith the latest twist of the crisis, Israel's strikes appeared to be trying to thread a needle in demonstrating that it can evade Iranian defenses at will \u2013 and in the vicinity of Iranian nuclear facilities \u2013 while not creating a situation that would oblige Iran to respond with another escalation that could push the rivals toward all-out war.\nThe risk in trying to navigate this narrow path is that the region is so on edge six months into Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza and the political tensions are so acute inside both countries that it is hard for each side to accurately assess exactly how the other might react.\nHours before the Israeli strikes, for instance, Iran had warned that any Israeli attack would be met with a robust response. Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told CNN that such action would be 'immediate and at a maximum level.'\nStill, early indications were on Friday that Iran is prepared to end this particular phase of escalation without stepping up another rung on the confrontational ladder and that Israel \u2013 while rebuffing international calls for restraint \u2013 may still have taken US and Western concerns about the possibility of sparking a major regional war into account.\nIranian official media and government officials were downplaying the attack on Friday. And a regional intelligence source with knowledge of Iran's potential reaction to Friday's strike said that direct state-to-state strikes between the two enemies were 'over.' The source, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told CNN that, to his knowledge, Iran was not expected to respond to the strikes \u2014 but did not give a reason.\nIf subsequent events bear this out, Israel may succeed in fulfilling a strategic maxim laid out by President John Kennedy in 1963 as he reflected upon the Cuban missile crisis the previous year when he said that statesmanship must aim to 'avert those confrontations which bring an adversary to a choice of either a humiliating retreat or a nuclear war.' The danger was not a nuclear war in this case but a tit-for-tat climb into a major conventional conflict that could have consumed the entire region and killed many Iranians, Israelis and people in neighboring countries. As it stands, neither Iran nor Israel have been forced into a humiliating retreat \u2013 and that may be the key to containing the situation.\nIsrael's attack on Iran also represents a rebuff by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of President Joe Biden's advice to treat the successful interception of nearly all the drones and missiles directed at Israel as a victory. The president had argued that the massive defensive operation proved Iran couldn't pose a threat to Israel's security and that further retaliation was not required.\nWhile there does seem to have been an effort by Israel to consider US and Western anxieties about a wider war, Netanyahu has repeatedly ignored Biden's entreaties \u2014 including months of US complaints about the Israeli conduct of the war in Gaza and its toll on Palestinian civilians following the October 7 Hamas terror attacks. The president, though getting increasingly frustrated with Netanyahu, has not been willing to lay down red lines for the Israeli prime minister or to condition the use of US arms shipments in Gaza.\nBut Biden also came up against the reality that Israel is a sovereign state, and while strongly reliant on the United States, was unlikely ever to allow a mass air attack directed at its territory to go unanswered. In the aftermath of latest developments, Washington is concentrating on a new effort to stop tensions from rising further while distancing itself from the Israeli action.\n'What we're focused on, what the G7 is focused on, and again, it's reflected in our statement and in our conversation, is our work to de-escalate tensions,' Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a conference of foreign ministers from industrialized nations in Italy.\nThe White House did make clear in recent days that it would not join any Israeli offensive actions against Iran. But US military forces will almost certainly be called upon to defend Israel again in the event of a major Iranian retaliation. Biden thus could get dragged ever deeper into a military conflict in the region that he has repeatedly tried and failed to stop. The political consequences would be grave for the president in November as presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump warns the world is spinning out of control on his watch. Biden has already paid a heavy price among progressive, young and Arab American voters over his support for Israel, which could have serious implications for his performance in swing states that will decide the presidential election. And any spike in oil prices caused by uncertainty in the Middle East ahead of the election could push up the cost of gasoline and exact a painful political price on the president.\nIsrael, for all its military prowess, is in a deeply vulnerable position. It is now effectively fighting on three fronts \u2014 against Hamas in Gaza; another Iranian proxy, Hezbollah, in a simmering conflict over the Lebanon border; and directly against Iran itself.\nThe threat from Hezbollah is especially acute since the radical group has tens of thousands of missiles that could cause carnage in Israeli cities far greater than the threat posed by Hamas rockets at the start of the Gaza war. A full-scale entry by Hezbollah into the conflict to support Iran would be certain to trigger a massive Israeli response. That would bring war back to Lebanon, a nation already cursed by a desperate modern history and home to the Iran-backed militia.\nEvents of the last few days mean that even if the region doesn't tip into a large-scale war immediately, previous assumptions that Iran would never openly attack Israel and Israel would not strike at Iranian soil have been shattered.\n'Even if you get through this phase without a major Iranian retaliation, the reality is that Israel and Iran are going to be locked in this competitive struggle,' Aaron David Miller, a veteran Middle East peace negotiator for Republicans and Democratic presidents, told CNN. 'There is no solution to the problem of Iranian proxies. There's no solution to the fact that Iran is a nuclear weapons threshold state. And this relationship is going to be hanging over the region and perhaps the international community like some sword of Damocles.'\nIsrael faced intense pressure to show restraint not just from the United States but also from European and Arab powers, several of which joined the US and Israeli operation to shoot down Iran's drones and missiles last weekend. While US support for Israel is assured, the reaction of those other countries will be critical now that Netanyahu decided to ignore advice from Israel's defenders. One argument for Israel not retaliating against Iran had been that it could benefit from a wave of sympathy and support and begin to repair ties with allies that fervently criticized its conduct of the war in Gaza. That opportunity might already have been squandered.\nIsrael, however, regards itself as locked in an existential battle with Iran, one that played out until now in covert and cyber-attacks on its nuclear program, scientists and military and intelligence infrastructure. History shows that when Israeli leaders feel their country's survival is threatened, they often act unilaterally even when the United States counsels restraint. Such a doctrine led to previous Israeli attacks on nuclear facilities in Iraq and Syria.\nBy striking back at Israel after the Damascus attack, Iran was making an implicit statement that Israel could not escape paying a price for such attacks anymore and that they'd be met by a direct response.\nFor Israel's war cabinet, which mulled for days its response to the airborne Iranian barrage, the idea that Iran enjoyed the advantage in their geopolitical game of chicken would have been untenable.\nMalcolm Davis, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told CNN's Michael Holmes that the latest actions did set the stage for a long-term escalatory cycle that generates from instability in the region. But the apparent Israeli capacity to elude Iran's air defenses may also reestablish Israel's strategic edge. 'I do think it sends a message to Tehran that really they are more vulnerable to Israeli strikes than they would like to admit,' Davis said.\nSome experts worry that the new reality of direct exchanges with Israel may prompt Iran \u2013 which is estimated by experts to be only weeks away from being able to produce its own nuclear weapon \u2013 to rush across the nuclear threshold.

Throughout the week, US officials had urged Israel not to retaliate for Iran's unprecedented attack five days prior, when hundreds of missiles and drones were fired from inside Iran at Israel.\nUS officials worried that any Israeli counter-strike could trigger an escalating cycle of direct action between the two nations that could spiral out of control.\n'We didn't endorse [Israel's] response,' the senior official said, referencing the heads up the US received before Israel's Thursday strike.\nThe back-and-forth attacks of the past week have left US officials concerned that a barrier that once existed between Israel and Iran has now been breached, leading to a new form of direct confrontation that could be infinitely more volatile and difficult to predict.\nHow Iran responds will now be a crucial test of whether the two nations have entered the opening stages of direct conflict \u2014 or whether both sides can step back from the brink.\nThere are some signs that the situation may be defusing.\nUS intelligence has long assessed that neither Iran nor Israel has any appetite for an outright war. Israel's retaliatory strike appears to have been designed to be limited, striking a single military base about 275 miles from Tehran and leaving untouched two nearby facilities that are an important part of Iran's nuclear development program.\nA regional intelligence source with knowledge of Iran's reaction to the attack told CNN that the direct state to state strikes between the two countries were 'over.' Iran, this person said, was not expected to respond.\n'No indications of further escalation at the moment,' the senior US official said, warning that things could change. 'But all indicators suggest stepping back.'\nStill, US officials are keenly aware that after the unprecedented exchange of direct fire, it may be harder than ever to predict how Iran will respond to perceived provocations.\nIran's massive attack on Israel last week marked the first time it had fired from within its own borders directly at Israel, upending years of comfortable assumptions by the US and its allies about the limits of Iranian militancy and its willingness to attack Israel directly.\nIranian officials have stated publicly that Iran's policy toward Israel has changed.\n'We have decided to create a new equation, and that is if from now on the Zionist regime attacks our interests, assets, personalities, and citizens, at any point we will attack against them from the Islamic Republic of Iran,' Hossein Salami, the top commander of Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, told Iranian state TV following last weekend's attack.\nAnd just hours before Israel's counterstrike Thursday night, Iran's foreign minister told CNN's Erin Burnett that if Israel retaliated, 'the next response from us will be immediate and at a maximum level.'\n'I have rarely seen a moment [in the Middle East] more combustible than it is today,' CIA Director Bill Burns said at the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas on Thursday.\nFor some former US officials deeply familiar with the Iranian regime, Iran's unprecedented direct attack last weekend makes sense given its failure to compete with Israel in a long-simmering shadow war that has left a number of its commanders dead.\nIsrael has carried out numerous successful strikes against Iranian military leaders across the region, and even some officials inside Iran's own borders. Then, on April 1, an Israeli strike on what Iran claims was an embassy in Syria killed seven officials, including two senior Iranian commanders.\n'Imagine the pressure building up in the [Iranian] system,' said retired Gen. Frank McKenzie, the former commander of US Central Command. '\u2018Israel kills our people and doesn't pay a price?' I think that is a significant driver.'\nMcKenzie and other analysts suggested that to Iran, the April 1 attack in Syria was an escalation on top of an already untenable situation that its leaders felt demanded a stronger-than-usual response to deter future Israeli action.\nOne of the commanders who was killed, Mohammed Reza Zahedi, was the connective tissue between Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah, Iran's largest and most capable proxy, according to Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior intelligence analyst who specializes in the region. Zahedi, he said, 'was not a small kill.'\nLeading up to Iran's missile and drone barrage against Israel, US officials still believed Iran was likely to respond through its network of proxy fighters, as it had always done before. But as the US and its allies began to see signs that Iran was moving missiles within its own territory, it sparked a frantic rethinking across Washington about what Iran was likely to do, current and former American officials said.\nIt remains to be seen whether this shift in Iran's posture reflects a more permanent change in the thinking of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei.\n'It's not clear whether Khamenei, at age 84, has changed his longtime strategic doctrine to avoid direct confrontation with Israel, or whether this is a preview of how a post-Khamenei, military-led Iranian government may conduct itself,' said Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowmernt for International Peace.\nPerhaps the best parallel for the current situation is what happened after the US strike that killed top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani in January 2020. Within days, Iran\u2014 not one of its proxies\u2014 fired dozens of short-range ballistic missiles at American troops on a US military base in Iraq. That, too, was considered an unprecedented step that risked igniting a new and more dangerous regional paradigm.\nIn that instance, Iran signaled enough of its intentions that US troops were able to shelter in bunkers to minimize casualties. No Americans were killed \u2014 although dozens suffered traumatic brain injuries \u2014 and when the attack had finished, Iran messaged publicly that it considered the matter closed. The US under then-President Donald Trump chose not to retaliate further.\nIn the days following the attack on Israel, some analysts suggested that Iran may have deliberately sought to avoid casualties in an effort to keep the situation from escalating; Pentagon officials stridently rejected that hypothesis.\nOn Saturday, Israel and its allies were able to destroy 99 percent of the Iranian projectiles before they impacted. There was little damage in Israel, and no deaths. That, combined with public and diplomatic signaling by Iran in the days leading up to the attack, has caused similar theories about Iran's intent to circulate Washington this week.\nBut administration officials \u2014 as well as McKenzie and other former officials \u2014 have denied the suggestion that Iran was pulling its punches this time, either. The sheer scale of the assault itself suggests that Iran intended to kill Israelis, officials and analysts said. In many ways, Saturday was a triumph of years of military planning done in preparation for precisely this kind of hypothetical assault.\nBut air defense against such a vast array of threats is a complex and difficult operation, and although Israel and its allies were successful, that success was in no way a foregone conclusion, current and former officials say.\n'The Iranians used the crown jewels,' McKenzie said. 'Their ballistic missiles, drones, and land attack cruise missiles. And what they launched was a maximum effort, about as much as they could do. This was not signaling.'\nNow, Washington and the region await Iran's response to the Israeli counterstrike.\nThe risk, officials say, is profound.\n'Israel and Iran are going to be starting higher on the escalatory ladder for every future moment of conflict and that is incredibly dangerous,' said Panikoff. 'If Israel and Iran have a greater threat perception of each other, they're more likely to think they have to act in a more robust and aggressive way.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Katie Bo Lillis,Alex Marquardt,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-04-13t233806z-760586938-rc2y57asx8kc-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-20240415194039062.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.8061023,"_id":"5a3b2f944ab8b76519b60617c61f335c"},{"title":"Israeli leaders and military criticize reported US plans to sanction IDF unit","author":"Eugenia Yosef","published_date":"2024-04-22 13:01:55","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/22/middleeast/israeli-military-us-sanctions-west-bank-intl","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other ministers have sharply criticized the reported plans of the Biden Administration to sanction a unit of the Israel Defense Forces for alleged human\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other ministers have sharply criticized reports of plans by the United States to sanction an Israeli military unit for alleged human rights abuses against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.\nThe allegations are said to implicate members of the Netzah Yehuda battalion of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in the occupied West Bank, a unit established in 1999 comprising religious and Ultra-Orthodox Jews. They precede the Hamas-led attacks on October 7.\n'Sanctions must not be imposed on the Israel Defense Forces!' Netanyahu posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Saturday.\n'In recent weeks, I have been working against the imposition of sanctions on Israeli citizens, including in my conversations with senior American government officials. At a time when our soldiers are fighting the monsters of terror, the intention to impose a sanction on a unit in the IDF is the height of absurdity and a moral low.\n'The government headed by me will act by all means against these moves,' added Netanyahu.\nReports of the potential sanctioning came as Human Rights Watch (HRW) on Wednesday said that violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank increased in 2023 to its highest level since 2006. This was the case even before the Hamas-led attacks on October 7, HRW said, citing UN data.\nTensions over Israel's military offensive in Gaza have spilled into the West Bank. Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 483 Palestinians there since October 7, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.\nLast week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he made determinations about whether to cut funding to certain Israeli security units for reports of human rights abuses committed before October 7. He didn't explicitly name Netzah Yehuda.\n'The \u2018Netzah Yehuda' battalion is an inseparable part of the Israel Defense Forces. It is subject to military law and is responsible for operating in full compliance with International law,' Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's war cabinet, posted on X, on Saturday.\nIsrael has a 'strong, independent judicial system that evaluates meticulously any claim of a violation or deviation from IDF orders and code of conduct, and will continue to do so,' said Gantz. 'I have great appreciation for our American friends, but the decision to impose sanctions on an IDF unit and its soldiers sets a dangerous precedent and conveys the wrong message to our shared enemies during war time\u2026 I intend on acting to have this decision changed.'\nIsraeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said, 'The decision to impose American sanctions on the IDF while Israel is fighting for its existence is complete madness.'\nThe IDF said over the weekend that Netzah Yehuda Battalion soldiers in Gaza are 'professionally and bravely conducting operations in accordance to the IDF Code of Ethics and with full commitment to international law.'\n'The reports regarding sanctions against the Netzah Yehuda Battalion are not currently known to the IDF. Should such a decision be made on the matter, its consequences will be reviewed. The IDF remains committed to continue to examine exceptional incidents professionally and according to law.'\nBlinken said investigations regarding the allegations 'takes time,' adding, 'That has to be done very carefully, both in collecting the facts and analyzing them.'\n'And that's exactly what we've done. And I think it's fair to say that you'll see results very soon. I've made determinations. You can expect to see them in the days ahead,' he told reporters in Italy on Friday.\nBlinken did not give any indications about what his determinations are and if the US will in fact stop funding to those units.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Tim Lister,Eugenia Yosef","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2023-10-28t202503z-1962074316-rc2u14aumf3h-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-netanyahu.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":6.797992,"_id":"2af057aae0828e9da09fb6f3811632e0"},{"title":"Washington wrestles with 'new equation' of direct attacks between Iran and Israel","author":"Alex Marquardt","published_date":"2024-04-19 23:18:43","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/politics/washington-wrestles-with-new-equation-of-direct-attacks-between-iran-and-israel","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Hours before Israel launched a drone strike against Iran on Thursday night, Israeli officials gave a heads up to their US counterparts in Washington: an attack was in the works, they said, and without\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Hours before Israel launched a drone strike against Iran on Thursday night, Israeli officials gave a heads up to their US counterparts in Washington: an attack was in the works, they said, and without sharing specifics, indicated it would be carried out in the next several days, according to a senior US official.\nIt was exactly the message the Biden administration had hoped they wouldn't receive.

Sign up here.\nA version of this story appears in CNN's Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region's biggest stories. Sign up here. CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 As the skies over Amman and other Jordanian cities lit up with Jordan's interception of Iranian drones and missiles headed for Israel last weekend, officials in the country were notably silent for hours.\nTehran's unprecedented attack on Israel in retaliation for a suspected April 1 Israeli assault on its diplomatic building in Damascus has put the kingdom in an uneasy and dangerous position.\nJordan's geography demonstrates its quandary. The small kingdom sits between Israel and the West Bank on one side, and Iran's neighbor Iraq on the other, where pro-Iran militias reign supreme. To its north lies Syria, a failing state that is also in Iran's orbit.\nLast week's attack was the first time in more than three decades that missiles directed at Israel entered Jordanian airspace, when Saddam Hussein launched Scud missiles at the Jewish state in 1991 during the Gulf War.\nBut much has changed since then. Jordan became the second Arab country to sign a peace deal with Israel in 1994. In the eyes of Israel's Western allies, it has been vital to regional security. It has close intelligence and security cooperation with Israel, hosts American troops and is reliant on United States military aid.\nThe Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty had always been unpopular at home, but it has come under increased stress of late. Emotions have been running high in Jordan over the war in Gaza, where more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed as Israel pummels the territory. More than half of Jordan's population is either Palestinian or of Palestinian descent, and for months its leadership has been walking a tightrope trying to balance mounting public anger with its close alliance with the United States and relationship with Israel.\nIn the early hours of Sunday, Jordanians took to social media to post videos of interceptions and projectile fragments that landed in some parts of the country. 'It was scary\u2026 you could hear the explosions echo (across the area),' one Amman resident told CNN.\nThe only official announcement related to the events that night came hours before the attack from the country's civil aviation agency, announcing the closure of the kingdom's airspace for traffic.\nThe optics weren't good.\nIt didn't take long that night for social media to get flooded with posts criticizing Jordan and its leadership for the interceptions. The kingdom was portrayed as shielding Israel at a time when Palestinians were being bombed by Israel in Gaza. One meme shared by users apparently outside Jordan showed a manipulated image of Jordan's King Abdullah in an Israeli military uniform.\nOfficials were likely scrambling behind the scenes to explain the events to their people.\nOn Sunday the government confirmed the interceptions 'to protect citizens and residential areas.' Prime Minister Bisher al-Khasawneh, speaking during a cabinet meeting, warned against the 'spread of rumors or misleading news that could fuel anxiety and fear.'\nBut it did little to ease concerns among many in the kingdom that trouble may still be ahead. After Tehran completed its attack against Israel, it turned its focus on Jordan.\n'The military forces of our country are carefully monitoring the movements of Jordan during the punitive attack of the Zionist regime (Israel), and if they participate in a possible action, they will be the next target,' an unidentified source in the Islamic Republic's armed forces told the semi-official Fars news agency.\nWithin hours, Jordan summoned the Iranian ambassador in Amman to protest what it said was 'harmful disinformation.' Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told CNN's Becky Anderson on Monday that Amman will 'retaliate' against Iran if such 'disinformation' continues, adding that his country faces longstanding threats from Iranian-backed groups accused of smuggling drugs and weapons.\nUS and Israeli officials sought to play up the role of Arab states in thwarting Iran's attack. But Jordan pushed a different narrative.\n'What we did was consistent with our long-standing policy and any projectiles, drones, whatever that enters our space' Safadi said. 'We are in the range of fire and any missiles or projectile that could fall in Jordan would cause harm to Jordan. So, we did what we have to do. And let me be very clear: We will do the same regardless of where those drones are from. From Israel, from Iran, from anybody else. Our priority is to protect Jordan and to protect Jordanian citizens.'\nAnd Jordan's leadership seems intent on sending that message to its people. Fighter jets have been patroling its skies since Monday. The military says it has increased air sorties to prevent any violations of its airspace and to protect the country.\n'Jordan will not be a battlefield for any party, and the protection of Jordanians comes above all else' King Abdullah told local leaders in a visit to the northern governorate of Mafraq on Tuesday.\nThe country's message to the international community and its allies this week has been that the focus should return to Gaza and the suffering of Palestinians there. Ending the war in Gaza is the only way to deescalate regional tensions, is the message that King Abdullah gave to US President Joe Biden in a call on Sunday, according to the Jordanian Royal Court.\nIn the CNN interview, Safadi accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyaahu of 'invoking a fight with Iran' to 'dilute' the international pressure on Israel over Gaza.\nThe Jordanian monarch has faced a tough balancing act since October as anger over the mounting death toll in Gaza has driven thousands to the streets.\nAbdullah and his wife Queen Rania, who is of Palestinian descent, have been among the loudest and most critical voices of Israel and its devastating war in Gaza. The kingdom has also been at the forefront of the effort to deliver humanitarian aid into the enclave, turning its military airport into a hub for international airdrops and carrying out dozens of such missions.\nBut for many in Jordan that has not been enough. Protesters since October have urged the kingdom to do more, with pressure growing on it to cut ties with Israel and shut its embassy in Amman, the scene of many protests over the past six months.\nIt is no secret that Jordan's relationship with Israel under Netanyahu's leadership has been strained for years, but is now perhaps at its lowest in decades. Those frustrations were laid bare by Safadi, Jordan's foreign minister, who ruled out breaking relations, but said the Jordan-Israel peace treaty is now 'a document collecting dust.'\nAs Israel weighs how to respond to Iran's attack, the region sits on a knife's edge with the very real threat of an all-out war in the Middle East. And the stakes could not be higher for Jordan, a key Western ally that has prided itself as a bedrock of stability in a turbulent region.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Jomana Karadsheh","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-1740305632.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":6.7763124,"_id":"ef6776b878a83285fd31bb04ff008214"},{"title":"Israel launches strike on Iran, US official says","author":"Kathleen Magramo","published_date":"2024-04-19 06:08:15","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-iran-gaza-conflict-news-04-19-24/h_84961f742ce5495f690d32d766adbeb1","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Iran's media on Friday published footage and images of calm scenes in the areas where air defenses were activated and explosions were reported.","summary":"Israel has carried out a military strike on Iran, a US official told CNN, a potentially dangerous escalation in a fast-widening Middle East conflict that Iranian officials have so far sought to play down.

Israel had carried out a strike on Iran hours earlier, a US official told CNN. The Israeli military has not commented and Iran has not identified the source of the attack. Air defenses intercepted three drones, an Iranian official said. And air defenses caused blasts near an army base in Isfahan province, according to Iranian media. Iranian media showed residents walking near Isfahan landmarks such as the Naqsh-e Jahan square and along the Zayandeh Rud river, while normal traffic was reported in the city, according to semi-official news outlet ISNA.

Israel targeted Syria's \"air defense sites in the southern region. The aggression led to material losses,\" SANA reported. The Israeli military told CNN that it does not comment on reports in foreign media. 4 hr 9 min ago From CNN's John Vause and Elizabeth Wolfe Iranian officials appear to view Friday's attack \u2014 which was limited in scope \u2014 as Israel trying to \"save face\" after it was targeted by Iran in strikes over the weekend, according to Abas Aslani, an Iranian journalist and researcher. \"It's a bit early to judge whether it's over or not, but at the moment... it doesn't seem to be a regional war emerging,\" Aslani told CNN, noting there is still a chance the situation could escalate. Since a suspected Israeli attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria earlier this month, people in Iran have mostly stood behind their government's airstrikes against Israel on Saturday, he said. It is \"a matter of national pride\" for many Iranians. \"Whether they are reformist or conservatives, critical or supportive of the government, because it's an issue of security they have been mostly supportive of Iran's action against Israel,\" Aslani said. 4 hr 44 min ago From CNN's Adam Pourahmadi and Irene Nasser There has been no damage to Iran's nuclear sites after an aerial attack in Isfahan province on Friday, the United Nations nuclear watchdog said, as it called for restraint in the region.

[and] is monitoring the situation very closely,\" it said. Earlier, an Iranian official said air defenses intercepted three drones. Multiple Iranian state-aligned news agencies reported that sites associated with the country's nuclear program were 'completely secure' and the attack appeared to be limited in scope. Some context: A US official told CNN that Israel carried out a strike inside Iran. The target was not nuclear, the official added. Prior to Friday's strike, the US expectation was that Israel would not target civilian or nuclear facilities, a second US official said. 4 hr 39 min ago From CNN staff IRGC released a photo that it said showed flashes in the sky of Isfahan, Iran following reports of explosions. IRGC Israel has carried out a strike inside Iran, a US official told CNN on Friday, in a move that threatens to further escalate conflict in the Middle East. Iran's air defense systems were activated in several locations after explosions were heard close to the airport and an army base in the province of Isfahan, state media reported early Friday morning. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attack. Here's what we know: What Iranian reports say: Three blasts were heard near a military base where fighter jets are located in northwest Isfahan, Iran's semi-official FARS news agency reported. Following the strike, Iranian media reported that all facilities around Isfahan are secure, including significant nuclear facilities in the area. Iran's National Cyberspace Center spokesman, Hossein Dalirian, said air defenses shot down three drones and \"there are no reports of a missile attack for now.\"\nThree blasts were heard near a military base where fighter jets are located in northwest Isfahan, Iran's semi-official FARS news agency reported.

For days, Israel has been weighing its response to unprecedented weekend strikes from Iran, which were launched in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on its embassy compound in Syria earlier this month. A US official told CNN that Friday's attack was an Israeli strike. Israel has declined to comment on it. 'Israel must maintain its vigilance' in case Iran decides to respond with another show of force, retired Major General Mark MacCarley said. By targeting the Iranian province of Isfahan \u2014 the site of significant nuclear facilities \u2014Israel was likely warning that it could easily overwhelm Iran's defenses, MacCarley said. 'I think that there was a very deliberate thought process on the part of the Israeli war cabinet,\" he said. \"Israelis had to retaliate, but at the same time, within that retaliation was a message, and that is, 'Yes, we can get through. Don't do it again.

Vahid Salemi/AP Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani expressed concerns Wednesday over the state of international mediation efforts led by Qatar to help reach a hostage and a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Al Thani, who is also Qatar's foreign minister, criticized the misuse of Qatar's efforts for 'narrow political' gains by some involved, undermining the broader goal of peace and humanitarian relief, 'which required the State of Qatar to conduct a comprehensive evaluation.' He emphasized the sensitivity of the ongoing talks and highlighted the challenges faced in bridging gaps between conflicting parties. He also pointed out the inconsistency between private assurances and public statements by involved parties, describing such actions as counterproductive. While the Qatari leaders did not point anyone out by name, the comments followed a statement by US Rep. Steny Hoyer on Monday that said if Qatar fails to apply pressure on Hamas to reach an agreement on a deal to release hostages and establish a temporary ceasefire, 'the United States must reevaluate its relationship with Qatar.' On Tuesday Qatar's Embassy to the US in Washington issued a statement saying it was surprised by Hoyer's remarks, adding that while the country shares the congressman's frustrations, it does not control Israel or Hamas. 'Blaming and threatening the mediator is not constructive, especially when the target is a friend,' the embassy statement added. 12 min ago From CNN's Hande Atay Alam Mourners carry the bodies of children, who were killed in a strike in Rafah, during their funeral on February 9.

The Israel Defense Forces said it had raided a building complex that included two schools after receiving \"intelligence that terrorists from the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists organizations were located in the building and using civilians present there as human shields.\" CNN is not able to independently confirm the claims made by the IDF. The IDF said it told civilians to leave the building before entering during its joint operation with the Israel Security Agency, Israel's domestic security agency, also known as Shin Bet or Shabak. What Gazans told CNN: People living in the area said Israeli military vehicles began an operation there on Monday afternoon, firing shots and rounds of artillery shelling. Residents said that Israeli forces had surrounded three schools early Tuesday morning, including one where hundreds of people had been sheltering. They ordered people to leave the schools and detained dozens of men, including some elderly people and teenagers over the age of 15, according to residents. An elderly woman who had been sheltering in one of the schools said Israeli soldiers came in the middle of the night and arrested several men and women. 15 min ago From CNN's Benjamin Brown The first shipment of aid to Gaza to be delivered into Ashdod Port was transferred Wednesday, according to the Israeli military.

Israel earlier this month announced its decision to facilitate aid deliveries via the port. At the time, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed the development but said the 'real test' would be to see whether aid was 'effectively reaching people who it needed throughout Gaza.'

Smotrich said Israel's response to Iran's missile and drone attack should make Tehran 'regret the moment they even thought about firing' and be 'fierce, severe and inflict a disproportionate toll.' Smotrich, who is technically also a minister in Israel's defense ministry due to a deal struck in coalition agreements, told Israel's Army Radio (GLZ) that the nature of Israel's response would 'shape [Israel's] position in the Middle East.\" The response, he said, 'should rock Tehran, so everyone there will realize they shouldn't mess with us,' he said, adding that 'this is the language spoken in the Middle East.' The minister, who is head of the far-right Religious Zionism party, also said that Israel should maintain its strategic ties with the United States and other partners but must prevent itself from finding itself in a 'bear-hug, which will limit and make us incapable.'

Follow for live updates.","summary":"US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke to his Israeli counterpart Monday and 'reaffirmed the strategic goal of regional stability,' according to a readout of the call. Austin and Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant discussed the aftermath of Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel over the weekend, the readout said. The secretary also reiterated 'steadfast' US support for Israel's defense. Some context: Israel's war cabinet is weighing a response to Iran's attack, which saw more than 300 projectiles fired at its territory \u2014 most of which were intercepted. Austin previously asked Gallant to notify the US ahead of any potential response to the Iranian attack, according to a US official. The two had spoken hours after Iran had launched a barrage of drones and missiles at Israel. Israel was set to take its first steps toward a ground offensive in Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah this week but has delayed those plans as it mulls a response to Iran's unprecedented aerial attacks over the weekend, two Israeli sources have told CNN. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long stressed the importance of invading Rafah to dismantle Hamas's remaining battalions, despite international pressure to call off an all-out ground offensive. But a military response to Iran could pull Israel's attention and resources away from Gaza. Here are the latest developments in the region: Israel weighs response to Iran : The Israeli war cabinet has reviewed military plans for a potential response to Iran's attacks, an official said. The cabinet also reviewed diplomatic options, which could be carried out in addition to a military response.

Hostage talks: Hamas has slashed the number of hostages it is willing to release during the first phase of a ceasefire deal by more than half, an Israeli source said. This represents a significant step backward in the talks. Hamas has slashed the number of hostages it is willing to release during the first phase of a proposed ceasefire deal by more than half, an Israeli source close to the negotiations said. In its latest counterproposal, Hamas offered to release fewer than 20 hostages in exchange for a six-week ceasefire, more than halving the number of 40 hostages that has been the basis of negotiations for months \u2014 a significant step backward in the talks. A senior Biden administration official confirmed that Hamas is focused on those 20 for the first phase of a potential deal. The official also confirmed Hamas is telling mediators that it only has around 20 remaining hostages who are women or sick, wounded and elderly men. Hamas also called for the release of more Palestinian prisoners in exchange for fewer hostages, the source said, as well as a higher number of prisoners serving life sentences. The Israeli source said the latest Hamas counterproposal signals that Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza, does not want a deal, seeking to exploit fissures between the US and Israel over Israeli military operations in Gaza and domestic pressure on the Israeli government. Hamas spokesperson Basem Naim said the group had proposed 'releasing (three) captured Israelis each week,' but said 'no one is talking about final numbers.' Beyond the ratio of Palestinian prisoners, Hamas is continuing to demand assurances about a permanent ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, and unrestricted access for Palestinians to return to northern Gaza. 'I think part of this is Hamas thinks they're winning. Because their definition of success is survival and they've survived so far,' the Biden official said. 'The longer the conflict has gone on the more recalcitrant Hamas has become rather than the other way around.' China said it noted Iran's statement that the actions against Israel were an 'exercise of the right of self-defense' during a phone call between the foreign ministers of the two nations on Monday, and did not condemn the weekend strikes. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian that China condemned the attack on a consulate building in the Iranian embassy compound in Damascus, according to a statement issued by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Chinese foreign minister added the incident 'seriously violates international law and is unacceptable.' 'China has noted Iran's statement that the actions it took were limited and it was an exercise of the right of self-defense in response to the attack on the embassy building,' the statement said.\n'The current regional situation is very sensitive, and Iran is willing to exercise restraint and has no intention of further escalating the situation,' the statement added, quoting Amir-Abdollahian. Separately, China's Special Envoy on the Middle East, Zhai Jun, met with Irit Ben-Abba Vitale, Israel's Ambassador to China, on Monday, in which the latter expressed Israel's position and concerns on the conflict in Gaza. Zhai said China was 'deeply concerned about the current escalation of regional tensions, and conflicts and bloodshed serve the interests of no one.' Fifteen more bodies were recovered on Monday from around Al-Shifa Hospital following the withdrawal of the Israeli military from the area two weeks ago, Gaza residents and medical crews told CNN. Health workers and residents in northern Gaza have been searching and digging for what they believe are mass graves and looking for their loved ones, after they said Israeli forces killed hundreds of Palestinians and left their bodies to decompose during their two-week siege of the complex. 'We were called today to extract the bodies that are buried inside Al-Shifa medical complex. We came here at 9 a.m. with an excavator and excavated 15 bodies,' Adel Al-Mash-Harawi, an ambulance driver from Gaza told CNN from the site of the excavation. Hundreds of bodies have been recovered from areas around the hospital complex since the siege ended on April 1, a Gaza Civil Defense spokesperson told CNN last week. Video filmed by CNN Monday shows medical workers, some wearing UN-marked vests, walking around the site over mounds of sand, digging up bodies. White body bags can be seen lying on the side of the excavation site, some marked with text reading 'unidentified body' and some with names of people on them. CNN has contacted the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment on these allegations but has not received a response. Read the full story. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby reiterated Monday morning that President Joe Biden is focused on preventing Iran's attack against Israel from spiraling into a wider regional conflict. 'Just because Iran conducted this unprecedented attack, which we and our Israeli partners and other partners thwarted, doesn't mean that we should just accept a constant rising escalation in the region. The President is not going to accept that he wants to see things de-escalate,' Kirby told CNN's Kate Bolduan this morning. Pressed on whether it's the White House position that Israel should not retaliate, Kirby said that's ultimately up to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government but that the US wants to see tensions de-escalate. 'We respect their sovereign decision-making process. What we want to see is de-escalation of the tensions. We don't want to see a wider war,' Kirby said. Israel was set to take its first steps toward a ground offensive in Rafah this week, but has delayed those plans as it mulls a response to Iran's attack, two Israeli sources tell CNN. The Israeli Air Force had planned on dropping leaflets on parts of the city on Monday, the sources said. One Israeli official said Israel remains determined to carry out a ground offensive in the city but that the timing of civilian evacuations and the coming ground offensive remains unclear at the moment. The Israeli military declined to comment. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stressed the importance of invading Rafah to dismantle Hamas's remaining battalions despite significant pressure from the United States to call off an all-out ground offensive. The future of the war in Gaza and the ground offensive in Rafah in Rafah, where more than a million people are sheltering, are also factoring into the war cabinet's debate about a potential response to Iran's attack. A military response that risks escalating the conflict with Iran further would pull the military's attention and resources away from Gaza, where Israel's government has vowed to hand Hamas a total defeat. Read the full story. The Israeli war cabinet has reviewed military plans for a potential response against Iran during a nearly three-hour meeting on Monday, an official said. The war cabinet remains determined to act, but it is not clear at this point if a decision has been made. There is a sense that Israel must act quickly, the official said. The war cabinet also reviewed diplomatic options to further isolate Iran, which could be carried out in addition to a military response. Israel has yet to agree on how to respond to the Iranian attack that saw more than 300 projectiles fired at its territory in the first direct military confrontation between the Islamic Republic and the Jewish state. Israel must balance international pressure to show restraint on the one hand while searching for an appropriate response to an unprecedented attack. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now has to weigh his right-wing coalition's call for a strong reaction against the risk of further international isolation for Israel by widening the war without international support. Despite pressure from allies not to escalate, Israel's war cabinet is now debating the timing and scope of the response, two Israeli officials familiar with the deliberations told CNN. Analysts say that Israel has few options, and each of those options comes with a price, especially as it is already embroiled in a brutal six-month war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip and is confronting various Iran-backed militants in the region. A direct attack on Iran would set yet another precedent. While Israel is believed to have conducted covert operations in Iran over the years, often targeting individuals or facilities seen as a threat to its security, it has never launched a direct military assault on Iranian territory. 'We are definitely in a new phase, and a very dangerous phase of the Israeli-Iranian confrontation,' said Raz Zimmt, an Iran expert at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv. 'Iran has certainly tried to change the rules of the game with Israel\u2026 We might expect more rounds of direct attacks in the future.' Read the full analysis. It's imperative the international community 'stand united in resisting this Iranian aggression, which threatens world peace,' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a Monday statement from his office on X. Netanyahu added: 'Directly and through its terror proxies Hamas and others, Iran is conducting a full-scale campaign of aggression that threatens not only Israel but the entire Middle East.' Israel deeply appreciates the support of the United States, Britain, France and others in thwarting the Iranian attack against Israel. \u2014 Prime Minister of Israel (@IsraeliPM) April 15, 2024 The international community must continue to stand united in resisting this Iranian aggression, which threatens world peace. \u2014 Prime Minister of Israel (@IsraeliPM) April 15, 2024 Netanyahu's comments follow an Iranian strike against Israel over the weekend in which more than 300 missiles and drones were launched.

'The longer the conflict has gone on the more recalcitrant Hamas has become rather than the other way around.'\nChina said it noted Iran's statement that the actions against Israel were an 'exercise of the right of self-defense' during a phone call between the foreign ministers of the two nations on Monday, and did not condemn the weekend strikes.\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian that China condemned the attack on a consulate building in the Iranian embassy compound in Damascus, according to a statement issued by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nThe Chinese foreign minister added the incident 'seriously violates international law and is unacceptable.'\n'China has noted Iran's statement that the actions it took were limited and it was an exercise of the right of self-defense in response to the attack on the embassy building,' the statement said.\n'The current regional situation is very sensitive, and Iran is willing to exercise restraint and has no intention of further escalating the situation,' the statement added, quoting Amir-Abdollahian.\n'The current regional situation is very sensitive, and Iran is willing to exercise restraint and has no intention of further escalating the situation,' the statement added, quoting Amir-Abdollahian. Separately, China's Special Envoy on the Middle East, Zhai Jun, met with Irit Ben-Abba Vitale, Israel's Ambassador to China, on Monday, in which the latter expressed Israel's position and concerns on the conflict in Gaza.\nZhai said China was 'deeply concerned about the current escalation of regional tensions, and conflicts and bloodshed serve the interests of no one.'\nFifteen more bodies were recovered on Monday from around Al-Shifa Hospital following the withdrawal of the Israeli military from the area two weeks ago, Gaza residents and medical crews told CNN.\nHealth workers and residents in northern Gaza have been searching and digging for what they believe are mass graves and looking for their loved ones, after they said Israeli forces killed hundreds of Palestinians and left their bodies to decompose during their two-week siege of the complex.\n'We were called today to extract the bodies that are buried inside Al-Shifa medical complex. We came here at 9 a.m. with an excavator and excavated 15 bodies,' Adel Al-Mash-Harawi, an ambulance driver from Gaza told CNN from the site of the excavation.\nHundreds of bodies have been recovered from areas around the hospital complex since the siege ended on April 1, a Gaza Civil Defense spokesperson told CNN last week.\nVideo filmed by CNN Monday shows medical workers, some wearing UN-marked vests, walking around the site over mounds of sand, digging up bodies. White body bags can be seen lying on the side of the excavation site, some marked with text reading 'unidentified body' and some with names of people on them.\nCNN has contacted the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment on these allegations but has not received a response.\nRead the full story.\nRead the full story. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby reiterated Monday morning that President Joe Biden is focused on preventing Iran's attack against Israel from spiraling into a wider regional conflict.\n'Just because Iran conducted this unprecedented attack, which we and our Israeli partners and other partners thwarted, doesn't mean that we should just accept a constant rising escalation in the region. The President is not going to accept that he wants to see things de-escalate,' Kirby told CNN's Kate Bolduan this morning.\nPressed on whether it's the White House position that Israel should not retaliate, Kirby said that's ultimately up to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government but that the US wants to see tensions de-escalate.\n'We respect their sovereign decision-making process. What we want to see is de-escalation of the tensions. We don't want to see a wider war,' Kirby said.\nIsrael was set to take its first steps toward a ground offensive in Rafah this week, but has delayed those plans as it mulls a response to Iran's attack, two Israeli sources tell CNN.\nThe Israeli Air Force had planned on dropping leaflets on parts of the city on Monday, the sources said.\nOne Israeli official said Israel remains determined to carry out a ground offensive in the city but that the timing of civilian evacuations and the coming ground offensive remains unclear at the moment. The Israeli military declined to comment.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stressed the importance of invading Rafah to dismantle Hamas's remaining battalions despite significant pressure from the United States to call off an all-out ground offensive.\nThe future of the war in Gaza and the ground offensive in Rafah in Rafah, where more than a million people are sheltering, are also factoring into the war cabinet's debate about a potential response to Iran's attack.\nA military response that risks escalating the conflict with Iran further would pull the military's attention and resources away from Gaza, where Israel's government has vowed to hand Hamas a total defeat.\nRead the full story.\nRead the full story. The Israeli war cabinet has reviewed military plans for a potential response against Iran during a nearly three-hour meeting on Monday, an official said.\nThe war cabinet remains determined to act, but it is not clear at this point if a decision has been made.\nThere is a sense that Israel must act quickly, the official said.\nThe war cabinet also reviewed diplomatic options to further isolate Iran, which could be carried out in addition to a military response.\nIsrael has yet to agree on how to respond to the Iranian attack that saw more than 300 projectiles fired at its territory in the first direct military confrontation between the Islamic Republic and the Jewish state.\nIsrael must balance international pressure to show restraint on the one hand while searching for an appropriate response to an unprecedented attack.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now has to weigh his right-wing coalition's call for a strong reaction against the risk of further international isolation for Israel by widening the war without international support.\nDespite pressure from allies not to escalate, Israel's war cabinet is now debating the timing and scope of the response, two Israeli officials familiar with the deliberations told CNN.\nAnalysts say that Israel has few options, and each of those options comes with a price, especially as it is already embroiled in a brutal six-month war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip and is confronting various Iran-backed militants in the region.\nA direct attack on Iran would set yet another precedent. While Israel is believed to have conducted covert operations in Iran over the years, often targeting individuals or facilities seen as a threat to its security, it has never launched a direct military assault on Iranian territory.\n'We are definitely in a new phase, and a very dangerous phase of the Israeli-Iranian confrontation,' said Raz Zimmt, an Iran expert at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv. 'Iran has certainly tried to change the rules of the game with Israel\u2026 We might expect more rounds of direct attacks in the future.'\nRead the full analysis.\nRead the full analysis. It's imperative the international community 'stand united in resisting this Iranian aggression, which threatens world peace,' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a Monday statement from his office on X.\nNetanyahu added:\n'Directly and through its terror proxies Hamas and others, Iran is conducting a full-scale campaign of aggression that threatens not only Israel but the entire Middle East.'\nIsrael deeply appreciates the support of the United States, Britain, France and others in thwarting the Iranian attack against Israel.\n\u2014 Prime Minister of Israel (@IsraeliPM) April 15, 2024 The international community must continue to stand united in resisting this Iranian aggression, which threatens world peace.\n\u2014 Prime Minister of Israel (@IsraeliPM) April 15, 2024 Netanyahu's comments follow an Iranian strike against Israel over the weekend in which more than 300 missiles and drones were launched.\nTehran said the attack was in retaliation for a deadly Israeli attack against a consulate building in the Iranian embassy compound in Damascus.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Cnn'S Kareem Khadder,Cnn'S Colin Mccullough,Cnn S Sam Fossum,Cnn Staff,Simone Mccarthy,Zeena Saifi,Kathleen Magramo,CNN,Cnn S Manveena Suri,Wayne Chang","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240413164018-southern-israel-gaza-border-03-20-2024.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":6.743434,"_id":"e06b5fc0dbbb5d595acddeb38da7e090"},{"title":"Biden administration tightlipped on Israel strike as US looks to maintain distance from decision","author":"Kevin Liptak","published_date":"2024-04-19 13:41:01","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/19/politics/us-reaction-israel-iran-strike","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"As Israel struck Iran overnight in what appeared to be a limited retaliation for last weekend's attack, the Biden administration adopted a tightlipped approach that reflected US officials' desire to\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 The Biden administration on Friday adopted a tightlipped approach that reflected US officials' desire to keep a level of distance from Israel's decision to strike back against Iran in what appeared to be a limited retaliation for last weekend's attack.\nIsrael has not commented on the strike, which was reported after three explosions were heard close to a major military airbase near Isfahan, state media reported early Friday morning. Iranian officials have said air defenses intercepted three drones and there were no reports of a missile attack.\nAmerican officials, who said they received warning from Israel of their plans, neither endorsed nor condemned the counterstrike. Israel had told the US on Thursday that it would be retaliating against Iran in the coming days, a senior US official said, adding that the US 'didn't endorse the response.'\nInstead, the US sought to make clear the choice was Israel's alone.\n'We were not involved,' one official said.\nIsrael informed the US through a variety of different channels ahead of its counterstrike against Iran, a person familiar with the matter said, adding that the warning did not come far in advance but did not catch the US off-guard. Speaking at the G7 foreign ministers' summit in Capri, the Italian foreign minister said the US received word from Israel at the 'last minute' of its plans to retaliate. The person familiar said the heads-up came on Thursday.\nIn his first public remarks since the counterstrike, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken declined nearly all comment on the matter while speaking at a G7 meeting in Capri, Italy. But, he said, G7 countries were committed to Israel's security while seeking to avoid the conflict from further spiraling.\n'We're also committed to de-escalating \u2013 to trying to bring this tension to a close,' Blinken said during a news conference.\nHe also said the countries shared 'a commitment to hold Iran to account.'\nEven though President Joe Biden counseled restraint last weekend in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 suggesting to his counterpart that because of the successful interception of nearly all of Iran's missiles and drones, a counterattack might not be necessary \u2013 there were few inside the White House who believed Israel would do nothing.\nInstead, officials believed what Israel was planning would be limited in scope and designed to send Iran a message. Officials had asked Israel for advance warning of the plans.\nSenior US officials spent a good part of Thursday in virtual conversations with top Israeli officials to discuss, among other topics, the attack last weekend by Iran and efforts to boost Israeli security.\nThe talks, led by US national security adviser Jake Sullivan, included Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, a top confidante of Netanyahu, and Israeli National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi.\nBefore expanding to a larger group of senior officials, the US and Israeli sides discussed in a smaller format last weekend's attack, as well as Biden's decision to apply new sanctions on Iran.\nThe sanctions, applied in conjunction with other Western nations, appeared designed to send a message that retaliating against Iran didn't necessarily require a military component.\nIt's not clear how much the Israeli side briefed the American officials on the plans to respond to the Iran attack.\nThe larger meeting focused on another topic of disagreement between the Biden administration and the Israeli government: plans for a ground invasion of Rafah to go after Hamas. The White House said afterward that American officials 'expressed concerns with various courses of action in Rafah, and Israeli participants agreed to take these concerns into account.'\nThe disagreement was an indication even amid the back-and-forth with Iran that the war against Hamas in Gaza continues apace \u2013 with negotiations for a ceasefire stalled and with a humanitarian crisis worsening.\nThe latest counterstrike adds to increasing tensions in the Middle East following Iran's unprecedented strike against Israel last weekend, in which it lobbed more than 300 drones and cruise missiles toward Israel, nearly all of which were intercepted. That attack was retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on Iran's embassy compound in Syria earlier this month.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Shania Shelton,CNN,Kevin Liptak","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/f89e3c1c-c954-46f3-8013-68f69fab3509.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.727248,"_id":"b208b44acc03ccaf407c427dfecb45c1"},{"title":"Iran says it shot down drones\u00a0as regional tensions flare.

The airstrike hit the refugee camp in central Gaza on Tuesday, with initial reports saying 13 people \u2014 including seven children \u2014 were among those killed. The Israeli military said the incident is under review. Footage of the strike: Graphic video, obtained exclusively by CNN from eyewitness Nihad Owdetallah, showed several casualties scattered on the floor, including children, with blood streaming around the area.

Vahid Salemi/AP Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani expressed concerns Wednesday over the state of international mediation efforts led by Qatar to help reach a hostage and a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Al Thani, who is also Qatar's foreign minister, criticized the misuse of Qatar's efforts for 'narrow political' gains by some involved, undermining the broader goal of peace and humanitarian relief, 'which required the State of Qatar to conduct a comprehensive evaluation.' He emphasized the sensitivity of the ongoing talks and highlighted the challenges faced in bridging gaps between conflicting parties. He also pointed out the inconsistency between private assurances and public statements by involved parties, describing such actions as counterproductive. While the Qatari leaders did not point anyone out by name, the comments followed a statement by US Rep. Steny Hoyer on Monday that said if Qatar fails to apply pressure on Hamas to reach an agreement on a deal to release hostages and establish a temporary ceasefire, 'the United States must reevaluate its relationship with Qatar.' On Tuesday Qatar's Embassy to the US in Washington issued a statement saying it was surprised by Hoyer's remarks, adding that while the country shares the congressman's frustrations, it does not control Israel or Hamas. 'Blaming and threatening the mediator is not constructive, especially when the target is a friend,' the embassy statement added. 2 hr 12 min ago From CNN's Hande Atay Alam Mourners carry the bodies of children, who were killed in a strike in Rafah, during their funeral on February 9. Mohammed Abed/AFP/Getty Images More than 13,800 children have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) Executive Director Catherine Russell. \"Thousands have been injured and thousands more are on the brink of famine,\" she said during a news conference in New York. In a separate statement, the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women said that \"one child is injured or dies every 10 minutes\" in Gaza. And that more than 10,000 women have been killed in Gaza since the war began, and 6,000 of them left 19,000 orphaned children behind. UNICEF communication specialist Tess Ingram, who recently visited Gaza, said in Geneva on Tuesday that what struck her was the number of wounded children she saw. \"Not just in the hospitals, but on the streets, in their makeshift shelters, going about their now permanently altered lives,\" she said. CNN cannot independently verify death numbers due to a lack of media access to Gaza. 2 hr 14 min ago From CNN's Benjamin Brown The Israeli military said it killed and arrested several militants during an operation in the civilian area of Beit Hanoun in the northeastern Gaza Strip. The Israel Defense Forces said it had raided a building complex that included two schools after receiving \"intelligence that terrorists from the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists organizations were located in the building and using civilians present there as human shields.\" CNN is not able to independently confirm the claims made by the IDF. The IDF said it told civilians to leave the building before entering during its joint operation with the Israel Security Agency, Israel's domestic security agency, also known as Shin Bet or Shabak. What Gazans told CNN: People living in the area said Israeli military vehicles began an operation there on Monday afternoon, firing shots and rounds of artillery shelling. Residents said that Israeli forces had surrounded three schools early Tuesday morning, including one where hundreds of people had been sheltering. They ordered people to leave the schools and detained dozens of men, including some elderly people and teenagers over the age of 15, according to residents. An elderly woman who had been sheltering in one of the schools said Israeli soldiers came in the middle of the night and arrested several men and women. 2 hr 16 min ago From CNN's Benjamin Brown The first shipment of aid to Gaza to be delivered into Ashdod Port was transferred Wednesday, according to the Israeli military.

Israel earlier this month announced its decision to facilitate aid deliveries via the port. At the time, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed the development but said the 'real test' would be to see whether aid was 'effectively reaching people who it needed throughout Gaza.' CNN has reached out to the WFP for comment. 2 hr 16 min ago From CNN's Benjamin Brown in London and Tamar Michaelis in Jerusalem Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich speaks to the press on February 5, 2024, in Jerusalem.Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has said that Israel's response to Iran's attack should inflict a 'disproportionate toll' and 'rock Tehran' to deter Iran from future strikes. Smotrich said Israel's response to Iran's missile and drone attack should make Tehran 'regret the moment they even thought about firing' and be 'fierce, severe and inflict a disproportionate toll.' Smotrich, who is technically also a minister in Israel's defense ministry due to a deal struck in coalition agreements, told Israel's Army Radio (GLZ) that the nature of Israel's response would 'shape [Israel's] position in the Middle East.\" The response, he said, 'should rock Tehran, so everyone there will realize they shouldn't mess with us,' he said, adding that 'this is the language spoken in the Middle East.' The minister, who is head of the far-right Religious Zionism party, also said that Israel should maintain its strategic ties with the United States and other partners but must prevent itself from finding itself in a 'bear-hug, which will limit and make us incapable.' Key context: Smotrich is not a member of Israel's war cabinet, which the security cabinet has authorized to decide on how to respond to the Iranian attack. As tensions in the region intensify, many world leaders have urged restraint as Israel weighs the size and scope of its response to Iran.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will make its \"own decisions\" when responding to Iran's unprecedented weekend airstrikes, most of which were intercepted.\nWhile it's unclear how Israel will respond, the US expects the reaction to be limited in scope, sources told CNN.\nMore than 13,800 children have been killed in Gaza since the start of Israel's war on Hamas, according to UNICEF.\nQatar, which is leading international mediation efforts on an Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage release deal, said it would re-evaluate its role after what its prime minister said was a misuse of his country's efforts for 'narrow political' gains.\nHere's how to help humanitarian efforts in Gaza and Israel. 36 min ago From CNN staff\nA Palestinian child plays near a building destroyed by earlier Israeli bombardment in Gaza City on April 8.

She said the Israeli pavilion at the international cultural exhibition 'will only open when the release of hostages and ceasefire agreement happens' in a statement shared on Instagram on Tuesday. Patir said she would raise her voice 'with those I stand with in their scream, ceasefire now, bring the people back from captivity. We can't take it anymore.' A petition signed by more than 23,000 people recently called for Israel to be excluded from the Venice Biennale. Patir on Tuesday said that she and commissioners Mira Lapidot and Tamar Margalit had made headlines in recent weeks rather than the art and the exhibition titled \"(M)otherland.\" 'If I am given such a remarkable stage, I want to make it count,' Patir said, adding that she 'firmly objected' to cultural boycotts but chose to take action as she felt there was 'no right answer.' Protests against Israel's war in Gaza have taken place at various cultural events, including this year's Oscars and the Grammy's. 8 min ago From CNN's Colin McCullough U.S. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon in Arlington,Virginia, on April 15. Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke to his Israeli counterpart Monday and 'reaffirmed the strategic goal of regional stability,' according to a readout of the call. Austin and Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant discussed the aftermath of Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel over the weekend, the readout said. The secretary also reiterated 'steadfast' US support for Israel's defense. Some context: Israel's war cabinet is weighing a response to Iran's attack, which saw more than 300 projectiles fired at its territory \u2014 most of which were intercepted. Austin previously asked Gallant to notify the US ahead of any potential response to the Iranian attack, according to a US official. The two had spoken hours after Iran had launched a barrage of drones and missiles at Israel. 4 hr 3 min ago From CNN Staff Israel was set to take its first steps toward a ground offensive in Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah this week but has delayed those plans as it mulls a response to Iran's unprecedented aerial attacks over the weekend, two Israeli sources have told CNN. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long stressed the importance of invading Rafah to dismantle Hamas's remaining battalions, despite international pressure to call off an all-out ground offensive. But a military response to Iran could pull Israel's attention and resources away from Gaza. Here are the latest developments in the region: Israel weighs response to Iran : The Israeli war cabinet has reviewed military plans for a potential response to Iran's attacks, an official said.

Hostage talks: Hamas has slashed the number of hostages it is willing to release during the first phase of a ceasefire deal by more than half, an Israeli source said. This represents a significant step backward in the talks. 4 hr 4 min ago From CNN's Jeremy Diamond in Tel Aviv Hamas has slashed the number of hostages it is willing to release during the first phase of a proposed ceasefire deal by more than half, an Israeli source close to the negotiations said. In its latest counterproposal, Hamas offered to release fewer than 20 hostages in exchange for a six-week ceasefire, more than halving the number of 40 hostages that has been the basis of negotiations for months \u2014 a significant step backward in the talks. A senior Biden administration official confirmed that Hamas is focused on those 20 for the first phase of a potential deal. The official also confirmed Hamas is telling mediators that it only has around 20 remaining hostages who are women or sick, wounded and elderly men. Hamas also called for the release of more Palestinian prisoners in exchange for fewer hostages, the source said, as well as a higher number of prisoners serving life sentences. The Israeli source said the latest Hamas counterproposal signals that Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza, does not want a deal, seeking to exploit fissures between the US and Israel over Israeli military operations in Gaza and domestic pressure on the Israeli government. Hamas spokesperson Basem Naim said the group had proposed 'releasing (three) captured Israelis each week,' but said 'no one is talking about final numbers.' Beyond the ratio of Palestinian prisoners, Hamas is continuing to demand assurances about a permanent ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, and unrestricted access for Palestinians to return to northern Gaza. 'I think part of this is Hamas thinks they're winning. Because their definition of success is survival and they've survived so far,' the Biden official said. 'The longer the conflict has gone on the more recalcitrant Hamas has become rather than the other way around.' 11 min ago From CNN's Manveena Suri, Simone McCarthy and Wayne Chang China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi speaks during a press conference at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China, on April 1. Ken Ishii/AFP/Getty Images China said it noted Iran's statement that the actions against Israel were an 'exercise of the right of self-defense' during a phone call between the foreign ministers of the two nations on Monday, and did not condemn the weekend strikes. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian that China condemned the attack on a consulate building in the Iranian embassy compound in Damascus, according to a statement issued by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Chinese foreign minister added the incident 'seriously violates international law and is unacceptable.' 'China has noted Iran's statement that the actions it took were limited and it was an exercise of the right of self-defense in response to the attack on the embassy building,' the statement said.\n'The current regional situation is very sensitive, and Iran is willing to exercise restraint and has no intention of further escalating the situation,' the statement added, quoting Amir-Abdollahian. Separately, China's Special Envoy on the Middle East, Zhai Jun, met with Irit Ben-Abba Vitale, Israel's Ambassador to China, on Monday, in which the latter expressed Israel's position and concerns on the conflict in Gaza. Zhai said China was 'deeply concerned about the current escalation of regional tensions, and conflicts and bloodshed serve the interests of no one.' 2 hr 24 min ago From CNN's Kareem Khadder and Zeena Saifi A United Nations team inspects the grounds of Al-Shifa hospital after an Israeli raid on April 8. AFP/Getty Images Fifteen more bodies were recovered on Monday from around Al-Shifa Hospital following the withdrawal of the Israeli military from the area two weeks ago, Gaza residents and medical crews told CNN. Health workers and residents in northern Gaza have been searching and digging for what they believe are mass graves and looking for their loved ones, after they said Israeli forces killed hundreds of Palestinians and left their bodies to decompose during their two-week siege of the complex. 'We were called today to extract the bodies that are buried inside Al-Shifa medical complex. We came here at 9 a.m. with an excavator and excavated 15 bodies,' Adel Al-Mash-Harawi, an ambulance driver from Gaza told CNN from the site of the excavation. Hundreds of bodies have been recovered from areas around the hospital complex since the siege ended on April 1, a Gaza Civil Defense spokesperson told CNN last week. Video filmed by CNN Monday shows medical workers, some wearing UN-marked vests, walking around the site over mounds of sand, digging up bodies. White body bags can be seen lying on the side of the excavation site, some marked with text reading 'unidentified body' and some with names of people on them. CNN has contacted the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment on these allegations but has not received a response.

Some portions of this handout photo have been blurred by the source. Adam Schultz/The White House White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby reiterated Monday morning that President Joe Biden is focused on preventing Iran's attack against Israel from spiraling into a wider regional conflict. 'Just because Iran conducted this unprecedented attack, which we and our Israeli partners and other partners thwarted, doesn't mean that we should just accept a constant rising escalation in the region. The President is not going to accept that he wants to see things de-escalate,' Kirby told CNN's Kate Bolduan this morning. Pressed on whether it's the White House position that Israel should not retaliate, Kirby said that's ultimately up to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government but that the US wants to see tensions de-escalate. 'We respect their sovereign decision-making process. What we want to see is de-escalation of the tensions. We don't want to see a wider war,\" Kirby said. 4 hr 28 min ago From CNN's Jeremy Diamond in Tel Aviv A general view from the makeshift tents where Palestinian families taking shelter in Rafah, Gaza, on February 18. Abed Zagout/Anadolu/Getty Images Israel was set to take its first steps toward a ground offensive in Rafah this week, but has delayed those plans as it mulls a response to Iran's attack, two Israeli sources tell CNN. The Israeli Air Force had planned on dropping leaflets on parts of the city on Monday, the sources said. One Israeli official said Israel remains determined to carry out a ground offensive in the city but that the timing of civilian evacuations and the coming ground offensive remains unclear at the moment. The Israeli military declined to comment. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stressed the importance of invading Rafah to dismantle Hamas's remaining battalions despite significant pressure from the United States to call off an all-out ground offensive. The future of the war in Gaza and the ground offensive in Rafah in Rafah, where more than a million people are sheltering, are also factoring into the war cabinet's debate about a potential response to Iran's attack. A military response that risks escalating the conflict with Iran further would pull the military's attention and resources away from Gaza, where Israel's government has vowed to hand Hamas a total defeat.

We are committed to the security of our personnel and partners in the region. And we will not hesitate to take all necessary action to hold you accountable,' Biden said.\n'We're using Treasury's economic tools to degrade and disrupt key aspects of Iran's malign activity, including its (unmanned aerial vehicle) program and the revenue the regime generates to support its terrorism,' said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. 'We will continue to deploy our sanctions authority to counter Iran with further actions in the days and weeks ahead.'\n'Our actions make it harder and costlier at every turn for Iran to continue its destabilizing behavior,' she said.\nOver the weekend, Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones toward Israel in a retaliatory attack for an Israeli airstrike on a diplomatic compound in Damascus that killed senior Iranian military officials. Israel, with the help of the United States and other regional countries, intercepted most of the incoming fire.\nAfter the attack, Biden consulted with fellow Group of 7 leaders to condemn the attack and develop a diplomatic response, including developing new sanctions.\nBiden and other leaders have called on Israel to exercise restraint following the weekend attack, hoping to prevent a wider regional conflict. The US and other countries have said the successful interception of the Iranian barrage was ample demonstration of Israel's military superiority.\nIsrael, however, has not yet said how it will respond. The country's war cabinet has met periodically this week without announcing any definitive action.\nIn a phone call on Saturday evening, Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the US would not participate in offensive action against Iran. Instead, the White House has been clear it intended to take economic action against Tehran as punishment for the unprecedented attack on Israel.\nThursday's actions will augment what is already one of the most stringent regime of US sanctions. The US has long sought to squeeze Iranian officials and industries as a way to punish the regime for human rights abuses and to prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\nEarlier this week, Yellen did not rule out applying sanctions on Iranian oil exports. Doing so could risk the potential of higher gas prices and of angering China, a top buyer of Iranian oil.\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction.\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Kevin Liptak","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-04-13t233806z-760586938-rc2y57asx8kc-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-iran-20240415194039062.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.6195254,"_id":"95054348c9326e1a9bbd55e4f6192a66"},{"title":"Israel delays Rafah offensive plans amid heated debate over response to Iranian attack, sources say","author":"Jeremy Diamond","published_date":"2024-04-15 11:29:11","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/15/middleeast/israel-war-cabinet-iran-debate-intl","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Israel was set to take its first steps towards a ground offensive on the Gaza city of Rafah but delayed that campaign after Iran's weekend attack on their country, which has sparked a heated debate in\u2026","summary":"Israel was set to take its first steps towards a ground offensive on the Gaza city of Rafah but delayed that campaign after Iran's weekend attack on their country, which has sparked a heated debate in the war cabinet over how to respond, Israeli sources have told CNN.\nThe Israeli Air Force was set to begin dropping leaflets on parts of Rafah on Monday, two Israeli sources said, amid preparations for a ground offensive into Gaza's southernmost city where more than 1 million people are sheltering.\nThose plans were paused after a retaliatory weekend attack from Iran, which saw more than 300 projectiles fired towards Israel, the vast majority of which were intercepted by Israel and its partners.\nOne Israeli official said Israel remains determined to carry out a ground offensive in Rafah, although the timing of civilian evacuations and the coming ground offensive remains unclear at the moment.\nThe Israeli military declined to comment.\nThe war cabinet meanwhile remains determined to respond to Iran's attack. On Monday during a nearly three-hour meeting, it reviewed military plans for a potential response, an Israeli official said. However, it is not clear at this point if a decision has been made on what that response will be or when it might happen.\nThe IDF chief of staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said later on Monday that Iran's attack 'will be met with a response,' while IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said the force will do 'all that is necessary' to defend Israel and 'will do that at the time we choose.'\nIn addition to a potential military response, the war cabinet is also mulling diplomatic options to further isolate Iran on the world stage.\nBenny Gantz, a key member of the war cabinet, has pushed for a swifter response to Iran's attack, two Israeli officials said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far pumped the brakes on making a decision.\nGantz believes that the longer Israel delays its response to Iran's attack, the harder it will be to garner international support for such an attack, the sources said. Multiple countries are already cautioning Israel against escalating the situation further with a military response.\nIsrael's government is aware that the country is currently enjoying international support and good will from its allies and does not want to squander that. At the same time, the government recognizes that it cannot allow Iran's first attack on Israeli soil to go unanswered.\nAmong the military options that are being considered, the war cabinet is considering an attack on an Iranian facility that would send a message, but avoid causing casualties, one Israeli official said.\nBut Israeli officials recognize that will be a difficult needle to thread, hence the ongoing debate. The timing of a decision remains unclear.\nNetanyahu has been facing international pressure to de-escalate a fraught situation after Iran's weekend attack.\nThe attack came in response to a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria earlier this month, which killed at least seven officials including Mohammed Reza Zahedi, a top commander in Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), and senior commander Mohammad Hadi Haji Rahimi.\nUS President Joe Biden spoke by phone with Netanyahu after the weekend attack, and made clear that the US would not participate in any offensive operations against Iran, a senior White House administration official told CNN.\nBiden told Netanyahu he should consider the events of Saturday night a 'win' as Iran's attacks had been largely unsuccessful, and instead demonstrated Israel's 'remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks.'\nBut Gantz urged on Sunday the need to 'build a regional coalition and exact a price from Iran, in a way and at a time that suits us.'\nIsrael and Iran have long been rivals, but tensions escalated in the wake of Hamas' attacks on Israel, which left about 1,200 people dead. Iran backs a web of proxies across the Middle East that have frequently clashed with Israel since the attacks.\nNetanyahu has stressed the importance of invading Rafah in order to dismantle Hamas's remaining battalions, despite significant pressure from the United States to call off an all-out ground offensive.\nThe future of the war in Gaza and a coming ground offensive in Rafah are also factoring into the war cabinet's debate about a potential response to Iran's attack.\nA military response that risks escalating the conflict with Iran further would pull the military's attention and resources away from Gaza, where Israel's government has vowed to hand Hamas a total defeat.\nAmerican officials reiterated last week that the US has not seen anything resembling a comprehensive plan from the Israelis on how they would carry out such an operation, including first moving the majority of the estimated 1.4 million civilians out of Rafah.\nPalestinians from across Gaza fled to the city, in the south of the enclave, in the early stages of the war to escape an advancing Israeli military.\nBut with the Egyptian border to the south closed, there is no clear escape route for those Palestinians, many of whom are living in tents surrounding the city.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jeremy Diamond,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/5a0724dd-cd2e-4d69-823c-42984829ff14.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":6.613062,"_id":"79bd5b3d4c00e18cb131e1c4f40cc130"},{"title":"Israel vows response to Iran's attack: 'face the consequences'","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-16 08:06:48","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/cnn-tonight/episodes/f6331060-a9b7-11ee-8cd4-87b76dc3531f","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"After day one of Trump's hush money trail, more than half of first batch of prospective jurors say they can't be fair and impartial, the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape can't be played, but Karen\u2026","summary":"Israel vows response to Iran's attack: 'face the consequences' Laura Coates Live 46 mins After day one of Trump's hush money trail, more than half of first batch of prospective jurors say they can't be fair and impartial, the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape can't be played, but Karen McDougal, an actress and model who alleged she also had an affair with Trump, will be allowed to testify.

Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto/Getty Images Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi made no mention of Israel's Friday (local time) strike on Iran, while publicly lauding the unprecedented Iranian military operation last weekend targeting the \"Israeli-occupied territories.\" Iran's April 13 retaliatory strikes, part of an operation named \"True Promise,\" were a display of Iran's military strength and a necessary act against what Raisi called the \"illegal regime,\" he said Friday. Raisi described the strikes as \"punitive reprisal\" by the Iranian Armed Forces, aimed at demonstrating Iran's power and the resolve of its people. Remember: The April 1 strikes on Iran's embassy compound in Damascus demolished a building and left several dead, including two high-ranking generals.

Getty Images Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart on Friday, according to a readout from the Pentagon. This comes one day after Israel carried out strikes in Iran. The readout makes no mention of the Israeli strikes, and the Biden administration has been tight-lipped following the actions. Austin and Israel Defense Minister Yoav Gallant discussed 'regional stability,' as well as the ongoing war in Gaza, according to the Pentagon. Austin also spoke with Gallant on Thursday before the strikes took place. The readout of the earlier call had slightly more information, saying the two discussed 'Iran's destabilizing actions in the Middle East.' In a previous call, Austin had asked Gallant for Israel to notify the US before taking any action in retaliation for a massive Iranian barrage fired at Israel last weekend. 5 min ago Analysis from CNN's Tamara Qiblawi in Beirut, Lebanon The scope of Israel's military response to Iran's first-ever direct attack on the country remains murky. Israeli officials have yet to publicly acknowledge responsibility for reported overnight explosions in parts of Iran on Friday. Tehran has dismissed these as attacks by 'tiny drones' that were shot down by its air defense systems. Iran may be downplaying what was likely to have been a significant but limited Israeli attack, but that seems to be secondary to the larger forces at play. What is plain to see is that both Iran and Israel are keen to wrap up the most dangerous escalation between the two regional powerhouses to date. This month's dramatic escalation, which kicked off with an apparent Israeli airstrike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, followed by a largely foiled Iranian attack of over 300 airborne weapons on Israel, seems to have given way to a rapid climbdown. Shortly after the Friday morning attack in Iran, a regional intelligence source told CNN that Iran was not expected to respond further, and that the direct state-to-state strikes between the two enemy states were over. The latest flare-up brought the stakes into sharp focus, but it also exposed the limits of a direct confrontation between Iran and Israel. Remember: What happens between Iran and Israel rarely stays between Iran and Israel. The region is deeply intertwined. That heightens the risks of military action, but it also acts as guardrails against a potential conflagration. So when US officials said last weekend that Washington would not participate in an Israeli response to Iran's attack on Israel, that seemed to immediately take the wind out of the sails of a potential escalation. 5 min ago From CNN's Paul P. Murphy SAR data \u00a9 2024 Umbra Space, Inc. There does not appear to be any extensive damage at an air base purportedly targeted by an Israeli military strike, according to exclusive satellite images obtained by CNN from Umbra Space. The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images were taken around 10:18 a.m. local time. There does not appear to be any large craters in the ground and there are no apparent destroyed buildings. Additional visual satellite imagery will be needed to check for burn scars \u2013 which cannot be seen by SAR images -- around the complex. SAR images are not like normal satellite images. The SAR images are created by a satellite transmitting radar beams capable of passing through clouds, like the ones currently preventing satellites from imaging the area. Those radar beams bounce off objects on the ground, and echo back to the satellite. Iranian news agency FARS said that an army radar at the Isfahan province military base was one of the possible targets, and that the only damage from the attack was broken windows on several office buildings. The images also show that the Iranian F-14 Tomcats that have been stationed at the air base in the past are not there at the moment. Additional archival satellite imagery reviewed by CNN shows that those F-14 Tomcats have not been there for some time. 4 min ago Violence and uncertainty has gripped the Middle East since Hamas' October 7 attacks on Israel, and Israel's subsequent war in Gaza. The war has threatened on several occasions to spill over into an all-out regional conflict, and those concerns have intensified in recent weeks, as Israel and Iran traded missile strikes. Here's a look at where and how violence has spread. 4 min ago From CNN's Catherine Nicholls and Benjamin Brown in London The European Union imposed sanctions on 'extremist settlers in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem,' the European Council announced on Friday, listing four people and two entities. According to the statement, the entities Lehava, a 'radical right-wing Jewish supremacist group,' and Hilltop Youth, a 'radical youth group consisting of members known for violent acts against Palestinians and their villages in the West Bank,' were added to the EU sanctions regime alongside two leading figures of Hilltop Youth, Meir Ettinger and Elisha Yered. Neria Ben Pazi, who the EU's governing body said has been 'accused of repeatedly attacking Palestinians,' and Yinon Levi, who the council said has 'taken part in multiple violent acts against neighbouring villages,' were also added to the listing. The EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said in a post on X that 'the EU has decided to sanction extremist settlers in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem for serious human rights abuses against Palestinians. We strongly condemn extremist settler violence: perpetrators must be held to account.' Belgium's Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib said that she 'welcomes' the sanctions , adding that the 'recent escalation of violence against Palestinians in the West Bank must stop; these settlers must be held accountable.' Yered responded later Friday, saying he was 'honored to be included in this respected list' and that 'we shall continue holding onto the land of our forefathers \u2014 until the victory.' 4 min ago From CNN's Jennifer Hansler, Kylie Atwood and Alex Marquardt The US Treasury Department in Washington, DC, on May 8, 2023. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images The US Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two organizations on Friday for fundraising on behalf of two violent Israeli extremists in the West Bank. The two groups -- Mount Hebron Fund and Shlom Asiraich \u2013 established crowdfunding campaigns to raise thousands of dollars for Yinon Levi and David Chai Chasdai respectively. Both of those men were sanctioned by the US in February under a new executive order targeting those perpetrating violence in the West Bank. At the same time, the State Department on Friday sanctioned Ben-Zion Gopstein, 'the founder and leader of Lehava, an organization whose members have engaged in violence, including assaults on Palestinian civilians,' the Treasury Department said in a statement Friday. The executive order, issued by President Joe Biden in early February, came amid increased violence in the occupied West Bank in the wake of the October 7 Hamas attack. That violence has only continued in subsequent months. The order angered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who complained to the administration, calling it 'inappropriate' and 'highly problematic,' according to Axios. Gopstein responded later on Friday, saying: 'We overcame Pharaoh; we shall overcome Biden too,' which is his rephrasing of the commonly used expression said during Israel at Passover: \"We overcame Pharaoh; we shall overcome this.\"\nIsrael carried out a military strike on Iran early Friday, a US official told CNN, in a potentially dangerous escalation of a fast-widening Middle East conflict that Iranian officials have so far sought to play down.

Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto/Getty Images Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi made no mention of Israel's Friday (local time) strike on Iran, while publicly lauding the unprecedented Iranian military operation last weekend targeting the \"Israeli-occupied territories.\" Iran's April 13 retaliatory strikes, part of an operation named \"True Promise,\" were a display of Iran's military strength and a necessary act against what Raisi called the \"illegal regime,\" he said Friday. Raisi described the strikes as \"punitive reprisal\" by the Iranian Armed Forces, aimed at demonstrating Iran's power and the resolve of its people. Remember: The April 1 strikes on Iran's embassy compound in Damascus demolished a building and left several dead, including two high-ranking generals. Israel and the United States have said that Iran's lob of some 300 missiles had very little material impact and caused only one injury. 4 hr 7 min ago From CNN's Aqeel Najim and Hamdi Alkhshali Flames from a large explosion near Babylon, Iraq, can be seen in an image taken from video obtained by CNN from social media.

The blasts happened at a site belonging to the Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), according to Muhannad al-Anazi, a member of the Security Committee in Babylon Governorate, south of the capital Baghdad. There was no immediate indication as to the cause. Israeli and US officials said neither was involved in the blast.

Getty Images Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart on Friday, according to a readout from the Pentagon. This comes one day after Israel carried out strikes in Iran. The readout makes no mention of the Israeli strikes, and the Biden administration has been tight-lipped following the actions. Austin and Israel Defense Minister Yoav Gallant discussed 'regional stability,' as well as the ongoing war in Gaza, according to the Pentagon. Austin also spoke with Gallant on Thursday before the strikes took place. The readout of the earlier call had slightly more information, saying the two discussed 'Iran's destabilizing actions in the Middle East.' In a previous call, Austin had asked Gallant for Israel to notify the US before taking any action in retaliation for a massive Iranian barrage fired at Israel last weekend. 4 hr 6 min ago Analysis from CNN's Tamara Qiblawi in Beirut, Lebanon The scope of Israel's military response to Iran's first-ever direct attack on the country remains murky. Israeli officials have yet to publicly acknowledge responsibility for reported overnight explosions in parts of Iran on Friday. Tehran has dismissed these as attacks by 'tiny drones' that were shot down by its air defense systems. Iran may be downplaying what was likely to have been a significant but limited Israeli attack, but that seems to be secondary to the larger forces at play. What is plain to see is that both Iran and Israel are keen to wrap up the most dangerous escalation between the two regional powerhouses to date. This month's dramatic escalation, which kicked off with an apparent Israeli airstrike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, followed by a largely foiled Iranian attack of over 300 airborne weapons on Israel, seems to have given way to a rapid climbdown. Shortly after the Friday morning attack in Iran, a regional intelligence source told CNN that Iran was not expected to respond further, and that the direct state-to-state strikes between the two enemy states were over. The latest flare-up brought the stakes into sharp focus, but it also exposed the limits of a direct confrontation between Iran and Israel. Remember: What happens between Iran and Israel rarely stays between Iran and Israel. The region is deeply intertwined. That heightens the risks of military action, but it also acts as guardrails against a potential conflagration. So when US officials said last weekend that Washington would not participate in an Israeli response to Iran's attack on Israel, that seemed to immediately take the wind out of the sails of a potential escalation. 4 hr 5 min ago From CNN's Paul P.

The US vetoed it.\nThe Palestinian Authority President, Mahmoud Abbas, sharply criticized the US veto, saying in a statement that it was 'unfair, immoral, and unjustified, and defies the will of the international community, which strongly supports the State of Palestine obtaining full membership in the United Nations.'\nIsrael's Foreign Minister Israel Katz praised the US for vetoing what he called a 'shameful proposal.'\n'The proposal to recognize a Palestinian state, more than 6 months after the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust and after the sexual crimes and other atrocities committed by Hamas terrorists was a reward for terrorism', Katz wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, after the US veto.\nThe Palestinian efforts to gain recognition as a member state of the UN came six months after Hamas \u2013 the militant group that controls the Gaza Strip \u2013 launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing more than 1,200 Israelis and taking more than 240 hostages. Israel responded to the atrocities of October 7 last year with an assault that has has killed nearly 34,000 people in Gaza, according to authorities there.\nUS State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel had announced earlier Thursday that the US would vote against the Security Council resolution, saying that the US has 'been very clear, consistently, that premature actions in New York, even with the best intentions, will not achieve statehood for the Palestinian people,' referring to the headquarters of the United Nations.\nHe also noted there was no unanimity as to whether the Palestinians met the criteria for membership as a state in the UN, saying the US believes future statehood should be dependent on negotiations between Israel and representatives of the Palestinians. 'The most expeditious path towards statehood for the Palestinian people is through direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority with the support of the United States and other partners who share this goal,' Patel said.\nPalestinian attempts for recognition as a full member state began in 2011. They are currently a non-member observer state, a status that was granted in November 2012.\nAt the time, UN Ambassador of the Palestinian Territories Riyad Mansour called the step a 'historic moment,' adding that he hoped 'the Security Council will elevate itself to implanting the global consensus on the two-state solution by admitting the state of Palestine for full membership.'\nIsrael's UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan condemned Friday's move as consideration of a 'Palestinian terror state.'\n'This won't be a regular state. It will be a Palestine-Nazi state, an entity that achieved statehood despite being committed to terror and Israel's annihilation,' Erdan added.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jennifer Hansler,Richard Roth,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2147903587.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":6.454419,"_id":"13abd40a6ccb091ff77377d64f60bff7"},{"title":"How progressive ceasefire advocate Summer Lee defanged the opposition ahead of her primary in Pennsylvania","author":"Gregory Krieg","published_date":"2024-04-21 16:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/21/politics/summer-lee-primary-pennsylvania-12","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Summer Lee is getting used to this.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Summer Lee is getting used to this.\nThe freshman congresswoman from Western Pennsylvania ousted regional political royalty on her way to the state House in 2018, then overcame millions in outside spending, nearly all of it from pro-Israel groups, to win the Democratic nomination and her seat in Congress two years ago. This time out, in her first House reelection bid, Republican megadonor Jeffrey Yass is bankrolling a super PAC attacking Lee and boosting her primary challenger, Edgewood Councilmember Bhavini Patel.\nIn an interview, Lee told CNN she had been 'bracing for this moment' since her last run and trusted that her consistency, as a candidate and on the major issues, would see her through to another term.\n'I put out there who I am because I am a very honest politician,' Lee said. 'I'm not obfuscating, I'm not obscuring parts of me. I'm not hiding one hand when I campaign.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who will campaign with her this weekend, Lee has the support of both commonwealth senators, Bob Casey, who's also up for reelection this year, and John Fetterman.

The first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania, Lee has also cultivated a working relationship with the White House \u2013 President Joe Biden made a point of shouting her out last week during a campaign stop in Pittsburgh.\nBut the race for the Democratic nomination in Pennsylvania's 12th District is as notable for the people and groups that are largely sitting it out as those more deeply involved.\nIn 2022, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and its affiliated super PAC, United Democracy Project, along with Democratic Majority for Israel, spent remarkable sums \u2013 for a primary in a safe blue district \u2013 attempting to block Lee's path to what was an open seat. This time around, despite AIPAC and DMFI both promising to invest heavily in defeating candidates they deem insufficiently pro-Israel, the groups have been absent from the district's airwaves.\nTheir decision to effectively skip the contest, which many progressives expected to be a priority for pro-Israel groups, has frustrated some moderates upset by Lee's position on Israel's war in Gaza. (She called early on for a ceasefire and supports conditioning US military aid to Israel.) But pro-Israel political groups, according to multiple sources familiar with their thinking, ultimately backed off over concerns about Patel's low profile and Lee's strong polling. Lee's support for most of Biden's domestic agenda and willingness to occasionally work across party lines also played a role, they said, along with a grudging acknowledgement that she has proven sensitive to some of their concerns.\n'She's been forced to make some compromises. Certainly not as many as we would like, but some compromises with the pro-Israel community,' one pro-Israel strategist told CNN, noting Lee canceled an appearance at a fundraiser for the Council on American-Islamic Relations amid criticism of other scheduled speakers.\nAsked about their decision to stay on the sidelines in Pennsylvania, AIPAC spokesperson Marshall Wittmann did not specifically address the campaign in the 12th, though he promised robust involvement in other races. A United Democracy Project spokesperson declined to comment.\n'We are already involved in several races, and we will be engaged in additional campaigns where we can have the greatest impact,' Wittmann said. 'By the end of this election year, the voice of the pro-Israel movement will definitely be heard.'\nThe issue has particular resonance, though, in the Pittsburgh area, home to both a large Jewish community and the country's deadliest antisemitic attack, when a gunman in 2018 killed 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue. Those anxieties spiked again after Hamas' brutal October 7 raid into Israel. Patel criticized Lee's immediate response to the attack, accusing her opponent of going AWOL.\n'You know what I would be doing after October 7? I would've come straight back home; I would've been present in my community,' Patel said. 'There were rallies and visuals that were organized here at home. She was nowhere to be found.'\nLee called that claim an 'intentional mischaracterization' of her work.\n'There's a difference between campaigning and being actually present. And the reality is that she's campaigning right now,' Lee said of Patel. 'The assertion that we weren't present or that we did not do our due diligence to earnestly represent them is a mischaracterization. And she knows that we've done that.'\nMark Mellman, the founder of Democratic Majority for Israel, which spent big against Lee alongside AIPAC two years ago, doubled down on his past criticism, but also acknowledged Lee's strength as a candidate.\n'Summer Lee's always been a very talented politician, but she has clearly demonstrated herself to be opposed to a strong US-Israel relationship,' Mellman told CNN. 'There's no question about that either.'\nDespite some of the usual suspects choosing not to spend, Patel's campaign, which kicked off days before Hamas' October 7 attack, has not struggled for cash. She raised more than $300,000 in the last quarter of 2023 \u2013 a decent figure for such a little-known candidate. Lee pulled in roughly $1 million over the same period and nearly $2.3 million for the cycle. Patel's overall reported haul is about $600,000, though she entered the race with a shorter runway.\nBoth candidates are also enjoying significant air cover from outside groups \u2013 though the sources of those funds are very different. A coalition of progressive groups \u2013 led by the Working Families Party, along with Emgage PAC and Justice Democrats \u2013 have put more than $600,000 into the race on Lee's behalf. Patel's outside support has largely come from one very rich and, in most Democratic circles, unpopular individual: Yass, the GOP billionaire with close ties to former and potentially future President Donald Trump.\nThe Pennsylvania-based co-founder of Susquehanna International Group, Yass has already spent millions this election cycle. But his support for a Democrat, Patel, has garnered the most attention \u2013 at least for now \u2013 in large part because he effectively uses Moderate PAC, which has invested more than $600,000 in opposing Lee, to press his interests.\n'This being a \u2018D +8 district,' we saw the potential for a Republican to come steal the seat,' Moderate PAC President Ty Strong told CNN. 'So our calculus was trying to get a more moderate Democrat, that represents the district, in that seat before we lose the seat. And before she does any more things that go against the wishes and the outlook of the people she represents.'\nPatel has denounced Yass and Trump. In an interview with CNN, she insisted she has never sought Yass' support and, ultimately, believes it has benefited Lee.\n'I have zero control over outside spending in this race,' Patel said. 'And I think any sort of conversation that takes away from my opponent's voting record and her inability to actually represent the values of this region, I think, again, is just deflecting.'\nPatel's campaign enjoys a decent amount of local Democratic support, though none with the ability to make headlines \u2013 or provoke liberal anger \u2013 like Yass, whose involvement also soured some pro-Israel groups on the race.\n'To go in as a well-known, right-wing Republican billionaire with a personal PAC and try and affect this race, frankly, taints everybody who might be interested in helping Patel and defeating Summer Lee,' the pro-Israel strategist said.\nAsked why he thought the pro-Israel groups were not joining his cause, Strong, the Moderate PAC leader, said Patel's lack of name recognition and internal polling numbers 'scared a lot of people away,' particularly those who 'did not want to give (Lee) another feather in the cap.'\n'If someone had more name recognition or was a staffer in the White House or had a little bit more of a history in the Democratic Party, if there was a picture of Patel standing next to Joe Biden, I think she would've gotten a lot farther,' Strong said of the challenger, adding that the PAC was still able to 'move the needle' by criticizing Lee's record and offering an alternative.\nLee and her supporters view the story differently \u2013 and often argue that, even without spending big, the specter of AIPAC's involvement can change the fundamentals of a campaign.\n'Whether or not AIPAC or someone like them gets in your race, it's destabilizing,' Lee said. 'It makes candidates think differently about how they're going to run and who they're serving, whose values they're going to represent.'\nIn the final days of the race, Lee's campaign and its allies are trying to steer the focus to her performance on Capitol Hill, most notably the significant federal funds she's helped bring to the district.\n'Progressives are often accused of having these lofty values that they can't actualize. And I think Summer, along with the rest of \u2018The Squad,' has proven in this first race that they can do exactly that,' said Justice Democrats spokesperson Usamah Andrabi. 'A billion dollars in (to the district) in one Congress is an insane amount of money, and it's actually being delivered to the people and communities who need it.'\nProgressive leaders and other Lee allies are also keen to argue that, come November, it is Lee supporters Biden needs to turn out in big numbers to defeat Trump in this crucial, potentially decisive, battleground state.\n'President Biden needs to win Summer Lee voters. He needs to win progressives,' Andrabi said. 'And Western Pennsylvania is a progressive stronghold now.'\nPatel, for her part, argues that Lee is poised to be a drag on Biden in the general election. She pointed to what she described as Lee's 'performative obstructionism' in the House, where Lee has occasionally bucked Democratic leadership, and the congresswoman's support for an 'uncommitted' primary write-in campaign led by progressives critical of the administration's handling of Israel's war in Gaza \u2013 hoping to send a message to Biden that their votes should not be taken for granted.\n'When you look at the bigger picture and the alternative is Donald Trump, that's incredibly dangerous because our basic freedoms depend on getting President Biden reelected,' Patel said of Lee's alliance with the 'uncommitted' movement. 'If you claim to care about reproductive justice, LGBTQ rights, labor rights, then that means that you have to unequivocally be behind Biden because there is no other alternative to that.'\nModerate PAC echoed those criticisms in a recent television ad, which claimed that Lee 'is opposing President Biden' and, in a reprise of the 2022 campaign, highlighted a years-old tweet criticizing then-candidate Biden.\nFor her part, Lee insists she is confident the attacks will fall flat.\n'We're hearing (in the ads) from a very vocal minority,' she said, 'and we are representing a very resolute majority.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Gregory Krieg","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1255300017.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.4037304,"_id":"e10b15a86f22c0182e69208d3ddcdb1b"},{"title":"Flight operations resume at Iranian airports","author":"Kathleen Magramo","published_date":"2024-04-15 04:00:21","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-04-15-24/h_849b640a5585d66b18f530c710bad769","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Airports in the Iranian capital of Tehran have resumed flights at 6:00 a.m. local time on Monday, according to Iran's state-aligned Tasnim news agency.","summary":"People walk down a street in Tel Aviv on Saturday.

Ukrainian air defenses downed the first seven missiles, but the next four completely destroyed the plant.\n'Why? Because we had zero missiles. We ran out of all missiles,' Zelensky told PBS NewsHour in an interview that aired Monday.\nZelensky has repeatedly warned allies that Ukraine's air defenses are running perilously thin, as Russia has recently renewed its assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. But a desperately needed military aid package from the United States has for months been blocked by House Republicans in Congress.\nZelenksy said Iran's thwarted attack on Israel demonstrated that Western countries were able to protect the skies of their allies. Iran fired more than 300 projectiles at Israel in an unprecedented attack over the weekend, but the attack was stymied with the help of US, UK, French and Jordanian air defenses.\n'Israel, by itself, wouldn't be able to protect against such a numerous, powerful strike.

They only care about their approval ratings. That's what it's all about. But forgetting that dead people don't care about ratings', Zelensky said.\n'People in Congress need to think twice about pushing these political matters with regards to support in Ukraine and vote to support all of the countries whose lives depend on it.'\nZelensky repeated his warnings that Ukraine risks losing the war if the US fails to approve military aid.\n'I can tell you, frankly, without this support, we will have no chance of winning,' he said.\nHe said Russia enjoys a 10-to-one advantage in terms of artillery shells.

The majority of the incidents documented by the ADL \u2013 6,535 \u2013 were cases of harassment, which the group describes as instances when either one or more Jewish people, or people perceived as Jewish, are harassed with antisemitic slurs, stereotypes or conspiracy theories. This category includes online and in-person incidents. The group also tracked 2,177 cases of vandalism and 161 assault incidents.\nThe audit shows there was a dramatic upward trend of incidents after the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Between October 7 and December 31, there were 5,204 incidents, according to the audit.\nThe ADL said it updated its methodology for the audit after the start of the war to include certain expressions of opposition to Zionism as well as support for resistance against Israel or Zionists 'that could be perceived as supporting terrorism or attacks on Jews, Israelis or Zionists.' A total of 1,350 incidents were included as a result of the methodology's update, according to the audit.\n'When they occur during public activism (such as at protests), in confrontations between individuals or in the form of vandalism (such as graffiti), these expressions constitute an implicit attack on the great majority of American Jews who view a relationship with Israel to be an important part of their religious, cultural and/or social identities,' the ADL said in the audit findings.\nThe ADL said it also tracked 1,352 anti-Israel rallies where antisemitic and anti-Zionist rhetoric was observed after October 7.\nThe advocacy group said 'legitimate political protest, support for Palestinian rights or expressions of opposition to Israeli policies' were not included in the audit as well as most physical scuffles or verbal insults between protestors 'unless the context suggests an antisemitic or anti-Zionist motivation for the assaults.'\nWhile the audit includes all cases of picketing of Jewish institutions for their perceived or real support for Israel, the ADL says it does not include 'protests outside pro-Israel political activist groups or Israeli embassies/consulates unless those protests incorporate anti-Zionism, support for terrorism, or classic antisemitic tropes.'\nThe report highlights antisemitic incidents by locations, including 1,162 cases in K-12 schools. Last year, there were also 1,987 incidents at Jewish institutions, which the ADL says were driven by bomb threats at synagogues and other institutions starting in the summer.\nA total of 922 incidents were reported at colleges and universities and most took place after the start of the Israel-Hamas war, the ADL said.\nJonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the ADL, described the wave of antisemitism as 'nothing short of a national emergency' and called for immediate action from governors across the nation.\n'Jewish Americans are being targeted for who they are at school, at work, on the street, in Jewish institutions and even at home,' Greenblatt said in a statement. 'This crisis demands immediate action from every sector of society and every state in the union. We need every governor to develop and put in place a comprehensive strategy to fight antisemitism, just as the administration has done at the national level.'\nAs part of its audit, the ADL included policy recommendations for federal and state leaders. At the federal level, the ADL called for support for the Countering Antisemitism Act, which was introduced in Congress earlier this month, CNN previously reported.\nFor state governments, the ADL suggest leaders should publicly commit to combat antisemitism and launch strategies to increase understanding of antisemitism, safety for Jewish communities and solidarity.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Nicole Chavez","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1782693121.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":6.3489165,"_id":"70d3d098ca90fe65e978ca953781de2e"},{"title":"\u2018Thank You America!': Ukraine's Zelensky and Israel's Netanyahu hail House passage of $95 billion foreign aid package","author":"Maria Kostenko","published_date":"2024-04-20 22:10:12","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/20/americas/foreign-aid-bill-ukraine-israel-thank-you-intl-latam","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Foreign leaders say the decision will help defend democracy and Western civilization.

It provides nearly $61 billion to help Ukraine and others in the region fight Russia, while the House also passed funding worth $26.4 billion for Israel and $8.1 billion to counter China's actions in the Indo-Pacific.\nZelensky said the decision would keep 'history on the right track.'\n'Democracy and freedom will always have global significance and will never fail as long as America helps to protect it.

'This news gives us a sense of support and understanding that we have not been forgotten.'\nAn artillery reconnaissance commander with the 110th mechanized brigade, who spent two years defending the industrial town of Avdiivka before it fell to Russia in February, had a similar message.\n'When we feel support from the outside, it motivates us. After all, the military knows it cannot win with sticks and bows and arrows,' the commander, using his call sign Teren, told CNN. 'For people who want to defeat the enemy, this news is a great morale booster.'\nvideo\nvideo Related video See moment Ukraine aid bill passes the House\nRelated video See moment Ukraine aid bill passes the House He went on: 'To win, we need ammunition \u2026 we really need artillery shells because we have an artillery hunger. We also need drones, both reconnaissance and attack drones.'\nAnother soldier, Dmytro Kurylovich, fighting in eastern Ukraine with the National Guard, identified air defense and artillery as top priorities.\n'First of all, we need air defense systems and artillery shells [\u2026] All big cities need air defense systems. Artillery is needed so that we can conduct a counter-offensive and fight back. If we have enough artillery, we will be able to liberate our territories faster and change the situation at the front,' he said in an audio message to CNN.\n'Morale changes depending on whether there is ammunition,' he added, throwing into sharp relief the impact on Ukraine's soldiers of being outgunned by Russian forces ten to one \u2013 a ratio recently reported by Ukraine's president in an interview.\nThe intelligence officer Bankir also described how frontline soldiers would feel more secure knowing the rest of the country was better protected from Russian missile strikes.\n'We need air defense systems. Here at the front, we need to be sure that our families in the back are protected and safe. Then we can fight,' he said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Maria Kostenko,Andrew Carey,Frederik Pleitgen,Tamar Michaelis,Samantha Waldenberg","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20240420-zelensky-netanyahu-split.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":6.341603,"_id":"6977808b0a1493f31d44a000ee7fce39"},{"title":"Iran's attack on Israel and the potential for further escalation in the Middle East; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on her recent trip to Beijing; Ambassador Rahm Emanuel on US-Japan cooperation in the region","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-15 08:34:12","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/fareed-zakaria-gps/episodes/c9c0f8fe-9f75-11ee-a524-53f94bd96d33","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Today on the show, CNN's chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward joins from Tel Aviv to break down the calculations taking place within Netanyahu's government about how and if to respond.\u2026","summary":"Iran's attack on Israel and the potential for further escalation in the Middle East; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on her recent trip to Beijing; Ambassador Rahm Emanuel on US-Japan cooperation in the region Fareed Zakaria GPS 41 mins Today on the show, CNN's chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward joins from Tel Aviv to break down the calculations taking place within Netanyahu's government about how and if to respond.

The PMU are responsible for the site where the explosion struck, according to Muhannad al-Anazi, a member of the Security Committee in Babylon Governorate.\nThe cause of the blast is still unknown. Israeli and US officials said neither was involved in the explosion, which came a day after a military strike on Iran that has been attributed to Israel.\nThe explosion and fire occurred at 1 a.m. local time at Kalsu base, which also serves as a headquarters for the Iraqi army and police, according to the military's statement. A member of the army was among those injured, the statement said.\nThe Iraqi army said no drones or planes were in the air at the time. 'There was no drone or fighter aircraft in the airspace of Babylon [Governorate] before and during the explosion.' It added that it would create a committee to investigate.\nThe PMU said the blast happened 'at the Kalsu military base in the Al-Mashrou district on the highway, north of the Babylon Governorate.' Investigators are currently at the site of the explosion, which also caused material losses, the PMU added.\n'We will provide you with the details once the preliminary investigation is completed,' it said.\nUnlike other Iran-backed groups around the region, the PMU is tied to the local government, and is closely linked to Iran-aligned Shiite blocs that have dominated politics in Iraq for years.\nThe blast comes at a time of high tension in the Middle East, as Israel wages war against Hamas in Gaza, after the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group launched a deadly incursion into southern Israel in October.\nTit-for-tat strikes this month have also brought a decades-long shadow war between Israel and Iran out in the open.\nIsrael carried out a military strike on Iran early Friday, a US official told CNN, in a potentially dangerous escalation. Israel has not commented and Iran has not identified the source of the attack, while no major damage was reported.\nAfter the Iraq blast, an Israeli official told CNN that it was not involved.\nMeanwhile US Central Command posted on social media: 'We are aware of reports claiming that the United States conducted airstrikes in Iraq today. Those reports are not true. The United States has not conducted air strikes in Iraq today.'\nIn 2016, the Iraqi parliament passed a bill recognizing the PMU as a government entity operating alongside the Iraqi military.

Hong Kong CNN \u2014\nHong Kong CNN \u2014 China has voiced 'deep concern' over escalating tensions in the Middle East after Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles in an unprecedented attack on Israel, raising the prospect of a wider conflagration in a region where Beijing has pledged to play peacemaker and promote its own security vision.\n'(China) calls on relevant parties to exercise calm and restraint to prevent further escalation,' the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday, framing the latest tensions as 'a spillover from the Gaza conflict' \u2013 which it said should be put to an end as soon as possible.\n'China calls on the international community, especially countries with influence, to play a constructive role for the peace and stability of the region,' the ministry added.\nThe Iranian strikes, which Tehran said were retaliation for the bombing of an Iranian diplomatic building in Damascus on April 1, marked the first time the Islamic Republic has launched a direct assault on Israel from its soil.\nThe decision by Iran's leaders to strike at Israel directly has pushed the shadow war between the two regional foes into the open. Israel is being urged by Western allies to de-escalate, as fears grow of an all-out regional war \u2013 a scenario Washington has sought to enlist Beijing's help to avoid.\nFollowing the Damascus strike, which Iran said killed seven people, including two top Iranian military commanders, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to China's top diplomat Wang Yi \u2013 and other counterparts in Turkey and Saudi Arabia \u2013 to 'make clear that escalation is not in anyone's interest, and that countries should urge Iran not to escalate,' according to a US State Department spokesperson.\nThat was not the first time the US had asked China to influence Iran since the war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas broke out last October.\nIn the wake of Houthi rebels' assaults on commercial shipping in the Red Sea late last year, American officials repeatedly tried to prod Beijing into pressuring Tehran \u2013 which is believed to train, fund and equip the Houthis \u2013 to rein in the attacks.\nThe latest flare-up of tensions has again raised questions over how much leverage China wields over Iran \u2013 and whether Beijing is willing to turn its political capital into influence.\nRelated article The Red Sea crisis tests China's global ambitions\nRelated article The Red Sea crisis tests China's global ambitions 'On paper, China has a great deal of potential leverage over Iran,' said William Figueroa, an assistant professor at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.\nChina has been Iran's biggest trading partner for the past decade and buys 90% of Iran's oil exports, providing a lifeline to Tehran against US sanctions. Chinese companies also provide Iran with security and surveillance equipment.\nIn practice, however, it is difficult for China to pull these levers to influence Iran's behavior, Figueroa said.\n'Weaponizing these trade relations, especially in such a high-profile way, would undermine its greater regional strategy of developing close economic ties throughout the Global South.'\nChina has greatly expanded its economic and political footprint in the Middle East. In recent years, Chinese leader Xi Jinping has vowed to 'contribute Chinese wisdom to promoting peace and tranquility in the Middle East' as part of his Global Security Initiative to offer an alternative to the Western-led security order.\nLast year, Beijing brokered a historic rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, two longtime regional rivals, but reining in Iran in the ongoing conflict could prove a thornier task for China, analysts say.\nRelations between Beijing and Tehran are already strained by China's 'chronic underinvestment in Iran' despite repeated promises, and previous attempts to influence Iranian policy over the Houthi attacks, Figueroa said.\n'While happy to play a role in negotiations, the reality is they lack real coercive power in the region and remain primarily interested in trade and diplomatic initiatives. They are aware of this and not eager to overextend themselves the way they believe the US has done.'\nAnd while China is genuinely concerned about the risk a wider conflict poses to its investment and trade in the region \u2013 especially its energy deals, it believes the root cause lies in the conflict in Gaza.\n'Therefore, it sees the real solution not in China restraining Iran, but rather in the United States restraining Israel and bringing the conflict to a negotiated settlement that includes a two-state solution,' Figueroa said.\nChina did not condemn Iran for the weekend's attack \u2013 in contrast to the US and other Western allies, as well as Beijing's own response following what Tehran says was an Israeli strike on its diplomatic compound in Syria earlier this month.\nIsrael did not claim responsibility for the airstrike. However, a military spokesperson told CNN that Israel believes the Iranian building hit in the attack is a 'military building of Quds forces' and not a consulate.\nBeijing issued a strong condemnation following that airstrike in Damascus.\n'The security of diplomatic institutions must not be violated, and the sovereignty and independence of Syria must be respected,' Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a regular news conference the day after the attack.\n'Amid the ongoing turbulence in the Middle East, we oppose any act that would escalate the tensions.'\nBeijing relayed that message to Washington last week, when Wang stressed in his phone call with Blinken that 'China strongly condemns the attack on the Iranian embassy in Syria,' according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry.\nYun Sun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center think tank, said China is reluctant to condemn Iran for its retaliatory strikes because it sees Tehran as a victim.\n'I think the Chinese are particularly sympathetic to Iran given their own experience of the US bombing of Chinese embassy in Belgrade. That's why China does not condemn Iran,' said Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center think tank.\nDuring a NATO air raid on the former Yugoslavia in 1999, pilots attacked the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade killing three Chinese journalists.\nBill Clinton, US President at the time, apologized to then Chinese leader Jiang Zemin and called the bombing a 'tragic accident' resulting from faulty intelligence. Beijing meanwhile denounced the strike as a 'barbarian act,' with protests erupting outside US diplomatic compounds across China.\n'It's unlikely, therefore, for China to apply pressure on Iran,' Sun said. 'For China, had US applies enough pressure on Israel, neither the Israeli attack nor the Iranian retaliation would have taken place. To apply pressure on Iran, which is seen as the victim at the first place, is illogical.'\nThe drastic escalation of tensions has drawn stern responses from other countries in Asia.\nJapan's Prime Minister Kishida said he 'strongly condemns' Iran's attack, which 'further aggravates the current situation in the Middle East,' and pledged to continue diplomatic efforts to 'prevent the situation from worsening and to calm the situation down.'\nIndia said it was 'seriously concerned' about the escalation of hostilities between Iran and Israel and closely monitoring the evolving situation.\n'We call for immediate de-escalation, exercise of restraint, stepping back from violence and return to the path of diplomacy,' India's Foreign Ministry said in a statement Sunday.\nIndia's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar spoke with Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz on Sunday to share India's 'concern' after the attacks and to discuss the 'larger regional situation.' He also spoke to Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and 'stressed the importance of avoiding escalation, exercising restraint and returning to diplomacy,' according to his post on social platform X.\nThe Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia have also called for restrain from further escalation.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Nectar Gan,Simone McCarthy,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240413204251-05-israel-air-intercepts-041424-dle-card.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":6.2743893,"_id":"5c35557e7045ea8cfd0fd70b801d608e"},{"title":"Oil prices get short-lived boost from attack on Iran","author":"Laura He","published_date":"2024-04-19 05:16:07","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/investing/oil-prices-gold-stocks-israel-iran-attack-intl-hnk","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Oil prices jumped overnight after explosions were reported near the Iranian city of Isfahan, but those gains dissipated Friday as officials sought to play down the latest escalation in Middle East\u2026","summary":"Hong Kong/London CNN \u2014\nHong Kong/London CNN \u2014 Oil prices jumped overnight after explosions were reported near the Iranian city of Isfahan, but those gains dissipated Friday as officials sought to play down the latest escalation in Middle East tensions.\nBrent crude, the global oil benchmark, was down 0.4% at $86.8 per barrel, having earlier spiked more than 3%.

'And we know that the world is watching us to see how we react.'\nDespite the speaker's attempt to thread the needle, however, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who continues to dangle the threat of a vote on Johnson's ouster, was quick to criticize the foreign aid plan.\n'I am firmly against the plan as it stands right now,' Greene told reporters, though when asked whether she would force a vote on the motion to vacate as a result, she said, 'I haven't decided on that yet.'\nJohnson dismissed concerns over a vote to oust him by his conservative flank if he moves on aid to Ukraine, telling CNN, 'I don't spend my time worrying about motions to vacate. We're having to govern here and we're going to do our job.'\nIn addition to aid for Israel and Ukraine, Johnson said in a post on X that the bills would support allies in the Indo-Pacific and there would be additional measures to 'counter our adversaries and strengthen our national security.'\nBut Republican leaders could still take procedural steps to send all those pieces as one package to the Senate, which could enrage the right wing of the House GOP conference.\nJohnson left open the possibility that the bills could ultimately be packaged together, setting up a potential fight with the right flank.\n'We're discussing whether they would be merged together in one package that's sent to the Senate or if it goes over as individual measures,' Johnson said. 'My personal preference is to do it individually, but we'll let the body decide.'\nAmong the ways GOP leaders plan to address Ukraine aid: a bill to seize Russian assets, a lend-lease program for Ukraine military aid and convertible loans for humanitarian relief.\nFormer President Donald Trump, who recently met with House Speaker Mike Johnson at Mar-a-Lago, has expressed openness to structuring Ukraine aid as a loan.\nGOP Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma told CNN that Johnson is allowing germane amendment votes on these bills as well \u2013 a process that far right Republicans had been demanding of Johnson.\nIn the wake of Iran's unprecedented retaliatory strikes on Israel, Democrats have called on Johnson to bring up a Senate-passed foreign aid package that includes aid to Israel and Ukraine, but hardline conservatives have urged the Louisiana Republican against attaching Ukraine funding to any Israel aid package \u2013 a warning that comes as the speaker faces the threat of a potential vote to oust him from his leadership post.\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries urged immediate passage of the foreign aid package passed by the Senate in a new letter to colleagues.\n'The gravely serious events of this past weekend in the Middle East and Eastern Europe underscore the need for Congress to act immediately. We must take up the bipartisan and comprehensive national security bill passed by the Senate forthwith,' Jeffries wrote.\nIn November, the House passed a bill to provide $14.3 billion in aid to Israel, but Democrats objected to the fact that the bill did not include aid to Ukraine and would enact funding cuts to the Internal Revenue Service.\nThe Senate passed its bill in February \u2013 a $95.3 billion foreign aid bill with assistance for Ukraine, Israel and other priorities.\nA significant number of House Republicans are opposed to sending further aid to Ukraine. Now, Johnson faces the most significant threat to his speakership to date after GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is among those who oppose additional Ukraine aid, filed a motion against him that could be used to force a vote on his ouster.\nGreene told CNN on Monday that Trump's backing of Johnson during a Friday press conference will not deter her from moving to oust the speaker.\n'No, no, and as a matter of fact, there's more people that are probably going to be angry from whatever happens this week,' she said.\nLater, Greene said, 'He's definitely not going to be speaker next Congress if we're lucky enough to have a majority. I think that is a widely held belief throughout the Congress.'\nAsked if she thinks he'll remain speaker for the remainder of the current session of Congress, the congresswoman said, 'That is to be determined. Like I said, I'm still processing.'\nJohnson called Greene's decision to file the motion to vacate a 'distraction' during an interview on Fox News.\n'That's a distraction. What Marjorie has done with the motion to vacate is not helpful for our party, for our mission to save the country, because if we don't grow the House majority, keep the House majority, win the Senate and win back the White House for President Trump, we're going to lose the republic,' he said.\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.

After refusing multiple requests to leave the premises, law enforcement was engaged to remove them to ensure office safety,' the spokesperson added.\n'We have so far concluded individual investigations that resulted in the termination of employment for 28 employees, and will continue to investigate and take action as needed.'\nGoogle and Amazon have a $1.2 billion contract to provide cloud computing services to the Israeli government and military, known as Project Nimbus, according to No Tech For Apartheid, who have strongly condemned the dismissals.\n'This flagrant act of retaliation is a clear indication that Google values its $1.2 billion contract with the genocidal Israeli government and military more than its own workers,' the group said in a statement published on Medium Thursday.\nIsrael has rejected claims it is committing genocide in Gaza, arguing that it is fighting its war against Hamas in self-defense. Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages.\nGoogle Cloud's contract with the Israeli government dates back to 2021, when the company announced that it had been chosen to provide 'public cloud services to help address the country's challenges within the public sector, including in healthcare, transportation, and education.'\nBut the protests followed a report in Time magazine earlier this month, citing an internal company document, that Israel's Ministry of Defense is a Google Cloud customer.\nAccording to Time, the ministry has its own secure entry point to Google-provided computing infrastructure, which would allow it to store and process data, and access artificial intelligence services. Earlier this year, the ministry also sought consulting assistance from Google to expand its Google Cloud access, Time reported.\nNo Tech for Apartheid said the article showed that Google had 'built custom tools' for the Ministry of Defense and had 'doubled down on contracting' with Israel's military since the war broke out.\nthat Google had 'built custom tools' for the Ministry of Defense and had 'doubled down on contracting' with Israel's military since the war broke out. The Google spokesperson said Google Cloud 'supports numerous governments around the world, including the Israeli government.'\n'We have been very clear that the Nimbus contract is for workloads running on our commercial cloud by Israeli government ministries, who agree to comply with our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy. This work is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services,' the spokesperson added.\nSeparately, Google confirmed that it is making an unspecified number of fresh layoffs as part of an internal reorganization. The job cuts will not be company-wide, and impacted employees will be able to apply for other open roles across Google.\nGoogle laid off hundreds of employees earlier this year, adding to a wave of job cuts in the tech and media industries, including at Amazon, Vice and the Los Angeles Times.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.

'The most expeditious path towards statehood for the Palestinian people is through direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority with the support of the United States and other partners who share this goal,' Patel said.\nSpeaking before the Security Council Thursday, Ziad Abu Amr, Special Representative of the Palestinians, said: 'how could granting the State of Palestine full membership at the United Nations, similar to other countries around the world, how could this damage the prospect of peace between Palestinians and Israelis?'\nThe Palestinian Mission to the UN first put in a request to be recognized as a full member state in 2011.

'It is important that our full attention be on our remarkable graduates.'\nThe university had planned to offer honorary degrees to filmmaker and alumnus Jon M. Chu, director of 'Crazy Rich Asians,' alumna Maria Rosario Jackson, tennis legend Billie Jean King and geophysicist Marcia McNutt, according to an April 12 post on USC's website.\n'We've been talking to this exceptional group and hope to confer these honorary degrees at a future commencement or other academic ceremonies,' the university said Friday.\nCNN reached out to USC for further information on the cancellations and was referred to the commencement update on the university's website.\nThe move to cancel the speakers' attendance comes just days after the university denied Tabassum \u2013 its 2024 valedictorian \u2013 the chance to deliver her commencement speech.\nIt also comes a day after hundreds of demonstrators congregated on campus to protest the cancellation of the speech, with many chanting, 'Let her speak' during the rally, CNN affiliate KABC reported.\nIn announcing the decision to cancel Tabassum's speech, the university said Monday that it 'must prioritize the safety of our community.'\n'Over the past several days, discussion relating to the selection of our valedictorian has taken on an alarming tenor,' USC Provost Andrew Guzman said in an online campus-wide letter dated April 15. 'The intensity of feelings, fueled by both social media and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, has grown to include many voices outside of USC and has escalated to the point of creating substantial risks relating to security and disruption at commencement.'\nLauren Bartlett, the university's associate vice president for strategic and crisis communications, earlier this week declined to say what security concerns prompted the school's decision. 'In the interest of safety and security, we don't disclose specific threats around the assessment,' Bartlett said.\nAs tensions in the Middle East rage on, Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza has yielded a dire humanitarian crisis while stoking angst across the world as supporters of Israel and Palestinians advocate online and in the streets, many in support of a ceasefire.\nUSC student advocacy group Trojans for Israel accused Tabassum of sharing a link in the bio of her Instagram page that calls Zionism 'a racist settler-colonial ideology' and advocates for the 'complete abolishment' of Israel, it wrote in a social media post.\nTabassum \u2013 a first-generation South Asian American Muslim who studied biomedical engineering with a minor in resistance to genocide and an interest in global health care equity \u2013 said she posted the link three years ago as part of her commitment to stand up for human rights. She said the link details 'what's happening in Palestine, and how to help.'\n'My goal when putting this link in my bio is to inform and in the spirit of academic discourse. I think people need to be informed, people ultimately can make their own decisions,' she told CNN.\n'I don't think, for example, my minor in resistance to genocide, or this link, should actually be looked in the confines or in the vacuum of the events after October 7th,' Tabassum said.

It was a week of unexpected developments in an unpredictable but consequential election year.\nHere are the surprise developments and what they could mean for the future:\nUnless you've been stranded off the grid in Antarctica, you know that former President Donald Trump is on trial in New York on charges of falsifying business records related to hush money payments made before the 2016 election. This overriding lead story was the subject of blanket TV coverage and banner headlines.\nThe surprise is that a jury selection process predicted to take weeks was over in days. Twelve jurors and six alternates will sit in judgment of the former president.\nThere were multiple hiccups, such as when one juror reconsidered her ability to remain impartial or when a self-immolation created a scene outside the courthouse.\nBut the end result is the most important thing. The first of four potential criminal trials of Trump is happening. Opening arguments get underway next week.\nWe can't say exactly who will testify because the prosecution won't tell Trump's team which witnesses they will call first. They anticipate Trump will violate a gag order and trash talk whoever takes the stand.\nWhat we do know is that Trump has already tried to seed a conspiracy theory that the jury is somehow biased against him. This despite the open process that led to the seating of the anonymous jury.\n'Help' is probably the wrong word. When 165 Democrats voted with 151 Republicans in favor of House Speaker Mike Johnson's plan to hold votes on aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, it ossified the aggravation at Johnson from the right wing of his party.\nThree Republicans \u2013 Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona \u2013 have said they will support a plan to oust Johnson from the speaker's chair.\nJohnson, meanwhile, refused to protect himself by changing House rules to make it harder to fire him. He has maintained the support of most Republicans and of Trump. At least for now.\nThe fault lines in the GOP, evident for years, are under immense stress. If Johnson is to keep his spot as speaker, he'll probably need help as soon as next week from Democrats for that too.\nIt would be something that looks like bipartisan or coalition governing, which would be music to any moderate American's ears. And if Johnson keeps his position as well as passes what most Americans and lawmakers want, his skill at leadership will deserve a reexamination. More to come next week.\nMost lawmakers in the House and Senate support giving more military aid to Ukraine as it fends off Russia's invasion. But the opposition of the right wing of the GOP has delayed the aid since the White House requested it in October.\nJohnson, although a bona fide conservative and a skeptic at times of Ukraine aid, is finally on the cusp of getting the vote done in the House. It's a major development.\nBut the fight over aid has also uncovered some uncomfortable truths, such as the prominence of the nationalist-veering GOP right wing, which is not afraid to say it doesn't put much stock in supporting democracies around the world.\nTit-for-tat strikes and responses between Israel and Iran in recent weeks have threatened to spark an all-out conflagration between the two countries.\nThis week, Iran responded to Israel's strike on a Syrian diplomatic facility with its own strikes, which Israel responded to on Friday with a strike on Iran. But the takeaway of many analysts was that might be it for a while.\nHere's Tamara Qiblawi in CNN's Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter:\nThis month's dramatic escalation, which kicked off with an apparent Israeli airstrike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, followed by a largely foiled Iranian attack of over 300 airborne weapons on Israel, seems to have given way to a rapid climbdown. Shortly after the Friday morning attack in Iran, a regional intelligence source told CNN's Nic Robertson that Iran was not expected to respond further, and that the direct state-to-state strikes between the two enemy states were over.

Read more from Qiblawi. With all the Trump trial coverage, you might have missed that President Joe Biden is running a spirited presidential campaign. While Trump is spending most days at his trial, Biden is going all over the map.\nThis week, he was in Philadelphia, where he went to a Wawa, and he was in Pittsburgh, where he went to a Sheetz. He was in Pennsylvania for a three-day swing to push his economic populism. If he can sustain the blue wall that wins Democrats their recent presidencies, it's this kind of tailored campaigning that will do it.\nAs Trump was spinning conspiracy theories outside his trial, Biden was adopting some of Trump's message on issues like tariffs, while drawing a bright line between the two of them on the key American issue of protecting democracy.\nAll of Biden's hard work won't quiet the critics who point to his age and wonder if he's up to the job, but it's impossible to argue the man is not trying very hard to convince people he wants to remain president.\nThe term 'Bidenomics' is either an insult or a brag, depending on the circumstances.\nBiden's economic pitch, as earnest as it was this week, might be a hard sell to Americans who still acutely feel the pinch of inflation and feel priced out of everything from the housing market to the restaurant scene.\nThe International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, is worried not about a US recession, but rather that the US economy is too hot compared with other countries, according to a report released this week. While Europe and other developed countries have yet to reach their pre-pandemic growth levels, the data suggests the US economy has blown past them.\n'Astonishingly, the US economy has already surged past its pre-pandemic (growth) trend,' IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in a blog post accompanying the agency's World Economic Outlook. That means any talk of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the near future is likely to end.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Zachary B.

Doha has repeatedly pushed back against the accusations since the onset of the conflict.\nSome analysts say that Qatar is the only interlocutor capable of delivering a deal due to its ties with Hamas and alliance with the US. Qatar hosts Hamas' political office, but it is also home to a 10,000-troop US military base.\nExperts say it is unlikely Qatar will end its mediation role.\n'I think that they will try and help, and try and mediate, as long as they can,' said Anna Jacobs, senior Gulf analyst at the Brussels-based International Crisis Group think tank, adding that Qatar is however concerned about the criticism from US politicians. 'They've had to confront it for a while,' Jacobs told CNN.\nDaniel Shek, a former Israeli diplomat, said he is doubtful that Qatar will retreat from the role. 'I think they are actually enjoying the spotlight,' Shek told the Israel news outlet i24News, adding that while there are other players that can mediate, Qatar has 'the best position to play in this negotiation.'\nQatar has maintained a relationship with Hamas since 2012, after falling out with some of its Arab neighbors for supporting protesters seeking to overthrow the regimes in several Arab nations during the Arab Spring.\nWhile American and Israeli politicians have been raising criticisms of Qatar since the start of the October 7 war, the Gulf state this week appeared to have had enough, accusing some politicians of capitalizing on the conflict to prop up electoral campaigning at home.\n'We are seeing political bidding by some politicians, with narrow political gains, who are waging their electoral campaigns by offending Qatar's role,' Qatari Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told a news conference Wednesday.\n'This is completely unacceptable, for us to be told things in closed meetings and then for statements to be made that are damaging and unhelpful,' the prime minister said.\nIsrael has been questioning Qatar's role in the talks for months. In a leaked audio from January, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was heard saying that Doha's role was 'problematic.' Majid Al Ansari, the Qatari foreign ministry spokesman, said his government was 'appalled' by the comment and accused Netanyahu of 'obstructing and undermining the mediation process for reasons that appear to serve his political career.'\nOn April 8, James Comer, the Republican chair of the US House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Accountability sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, alleging that Qatar paid Hamas '$30 million per month since 2018.'\n'Qatar does not pay Hamas,' the Qatari embassy in Washington DC responded on X the next day, adding that 'misinformation' is unhelpful to the negotiations.\nAnd on Monday, Democratic US Congressman Steny Hoyer accused Qatar of 'blocking' progress in the talks.\nJacobs says that it is important to note which American politicians are voicing the criticism, adding that 'many in Washington see the value of the Hamas relationship (with Qatar) and feel that if Qatar ended its role, then that would be harmful and not helpful.'\nUS President Joe Biden in November thanked Qatar for helping reach a humanitarian pause that allowed the release of some hostages.\nQatar is one of the closest US allies in the Gulf region. It is home to the Al Udeid Air Base, the biggest US military installation in the region and which houses more than 10,000 American troops. Earlier this year, the US quietly reached an agreement that extends its military presence at a sprawling base in Qatar for another 10 years. The Gulf state was also a Major Non-NATO Ally, as well as key energy supplier to Western states.\nAnd despite coming under fire for sending hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Hamas-governed Gaza over the years, it had done so with Israel's blessing, and with the knowledge of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, CNN previously reported.\nThe Qatari prime minister's decision to evaluate the country's role in the talks is seen as 'more of a way to highlight that they are frustrated with that criticism,' Jacobs said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Nadeen Ebrahim,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-02-06t224537z-1229035179-rc23x5a7orbm-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-blinken-qatar.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":5.8298593,"_id":"bdab8f7d803c2c7b7d562447aa16ca39"},{"title":"The week in 29 photos","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-19 05:10:08","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/19/world/gallery/photos-this-week-april-11-april-18/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Take a look at 29 photos of the week from April 11 to April 18.","summary":"Indonesia's Mount Ruang volcano spews hot lava and ash columns into the night sky Wednesday, April 17, as seen from Sitaro, North Sulawesi.

Thomas Massie said he would co-sponsor an effort to oust Johnson from his job and called on him to resign, the Louisiana Republican described himself as a 'wartime speaker' in challenging times.\n'I am not resigning,' Johnson told reporters. 'And it is, in my view, an absurd notion that someone would bring a vacate motion when we are simply here trying to do our jobs.'\nRepublican hardliners are growing angry at Johnson's complex plan to advance billions of dollars in foreign aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\nMassie told Republican colleagues behind closed doors Tuesday morning that he will cosponsor the motion to vacate Johnson from his position.\nThe comments highlight a significant escalation of the far right's threat to Johnson's leadership that have dogged the Louisiana Republican since Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia filed a resolution to vacate the chair last month.\nMassie was booed by his Republican colleagues after he made this announcement, according to one of the sources, and then GOP Rep. Trent Kelly of Mississippi stood up and criticized Massie, saying it's 'wrong' to not back the speaker.\n'I asked him to resign,' Massie told CNN after the meeting. 'He said he would not. And then I said, \u2018Well, you're the one who's going to put us into this,' because the motion is going to get called up. OK. Does anybody doubt that? The motion will get called up, and then he's going to lose more votes than (former House Speaker) Kevin McCarthy, and I have told him this in private, like, weeks ago.'\nMassie's comments show how Johnson would likely need to rely on Democratic votes to pass his foreign aid package \u2013 as well as potentially to save his job \u2013 as Republicans control only a razor thin majority, and efforts to send foreign aid to Ukraine have divided the GOP.\nJohnson, however, disputed Tuesday that he will have to rely on Democratic support to save his job, insisting House Republicans 'are going to work this out.'\nThe text of the plan has not been released, so House Democrats are still weighing whether to bail out Johnson \u2013 or stand up against it and pressure Republicans to instead take up the $95 billion Senate package that Johnson has sidelined for two months. House Democrats met Tuesday morning.\nThe first problem for Johnson: Approving the rule that governs floor debate, a procedural step that allows legislation to be passed by a majority vote. For decades, these rules have been approved along straight-party lines, but GOP divisions have derailed rules seven times this Congress and stymied its agenda.\nAt least one Republican \u2013 Greene \u2013 said she will vote against the rule. Several others told CNN they are still considering how they'd vote.\nIn making his announcement Monday, the Louisiana Republican predicted the House will vote Friday evening on the separate bills. On Tuesday, Johnson stood by that timeline, saying he aims to get his plan 'on the floor by the end of the week.'\nIn November, the House passed a bill to provide $14.3 billion in aid to Israel, but Democrats objected to the fact that the bill did not include aid for Ukraine and would enact funding cuts to the Internal Revenue Service.\nThe Senate passed its bill in February \u2013 a $95.3 billion foreign aid bill with assistance for Ukraine, Israel and other priorities.\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.
