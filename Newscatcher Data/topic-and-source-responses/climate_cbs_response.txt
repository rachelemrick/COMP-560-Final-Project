And while not everyone agrees events like these are the direct result of climate change, they do connect to peoples' opinions about it: a big majority of Americans feel the U.S. needs to address climate change, with those who report experiencing extreme weather more likely to say we should do so right now.\nViews on climate change have long been associated with partisanship, and they still are, but age is a factor, too. Younger Americans, including younger Republicans, are even more likely to say the U.S. needs to take steps to at least try to slow it.\nThere's a sense of urgency from many in the public, too. A large majority think it needs to be addressed at least in the next few years, including half who think it needs to be addressed right now.\nThere's the sense that we should address climate change, and there's also some belief that we can.\nThat extends down to the personal level, too. Most Americans believe humans can do something to at least slow the effects of climate change, and those who think so feel they personally have a responsibility to do something about it.\nExtreme weather and climate change\nPeople who report having experienced extreme weather in their area in recent years \u2014 which is half the country \u2014 are more inclined than those who haven't to believe climate change is a major factor contributing to extreme weather, and more of them see the issue as one that needs to be addressed right away.\nAnd even if people don't experience the extreme weather themselves, such events can spark concern. When people hear about the earth experiencing the warmest temperatures on record, more than half say it makes them more concerned about climate change. Those who don't see climate change as a factor in extreme weather are less persuaded by this, including some who don't believe that the earth's temperature is rising.\nYounger people and the political divides on climate change\nMajorities across all age groups favor the U.S. taking steps to address climate change, but it's people under age 45 \u2014 many who say they were taught about climate change in school \u2014 who are especially likely to be in support of the country taking action.\nThere have long been political divisions on addressing climate change, with Democrats expressing more concern than Republicans. These continue today, to some extent. Democrats are more than twice as likely as Republicans to say climate change needs to be addressed right now. And Democrats overwhelmingly support the U.S. taking steps to reduce climate change, but Republicans are divided on that.\nDivisions in the GOP on climate?\nThe divides within the rank and file GOP we see are along age and ideological lines. Most younger Republicans \u2014 those under age 45 \u2014 support the U.S. taking steps slow or stop climate change, while most older Republicans do not\nMore moderate Republicans also see climate change as more pressing than those who are more conservative.\nAnd like the public overall, Republicans who report having experienced extreme weather in their local area are more likely to think climate change needs to be addressed.\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,230 U.S. adult residents interviewed between April 16-19, 2024. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as past vote. The margin of error is \u00b12.7 points.\nToplines","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Anthony Salvanto,Jennifer De Pinto,Fred Backus","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/07/07/c71f81bb-c2a1-41c3-862a-dfe61fc9b347/thumbnail/1200x630/7c59e50438f70dc8c19c9ce9f8d50093/download.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSNews","_score":8.5046625,"_id":"2a614f83987f2a9264690d702ea6db63"},{"title":"This lizard is getting forced out of its home by climate change","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-16 21:49:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/this-lizard-is-getting-forced-out-of-its-home-by-climate-change","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"One million species on Earth are threatened with extinction, according to the United Nations, and one of the reasons for that is climate change.

PAUL, Minn. \u2014 April is Earth Month and we're less than a week from Earth Day. That timing matches up with an email we received from Mary in Minneapolis.\nShe wants to know: What can the average person do to help reduce global warming? Good Question.\nWCCO stopped two people along the trail surrounding Lake Como to see if they've taken steps to reduce climate change. Both were quick to share how they're being environmentally friendly.\n\"Our family is minimalist, so we try to really reduce consumption as a whole. So, we have less to waste and bring in less things from the environment,\" said Devan Compart.\n\"I drive a Tesla, which is an electric car which uses no fuel,\" Nash Baux said. \"I try to grow most of my food.\"\nGOOD QUESTION: What's the most efficient way to clean your home?\nGOOD QUESTION: What's the most efficient way to clean your home?\nWe were surprised that the first two people we stopped both had lifestyles with climate change in mind. At the same time, maybe we shouldn't have been surprised.\nA survey last year found 72% of Americans believe global warming is happening and 64% are worried about it.\n\"But many of us don't actually know what to do,\" said Heidi Roop.\nRoop is an assistant professor of climate science and the director of the University of Minnesota's Climate Adaptation Partnership.\n\"We serve as the front door to Minnesota communities to help them understand their climate risks and what the future may hold in terms of climate change,\" she said. \"Most important of what we do is address those challenges.\"\nShe's heard it all before when it comes to how people can slow climate change, especially when asked, \"Am I actually making a difference?\" It's a question she's pondered herself.\n\"Climate change is my day-in and day-out. It's what I do all day, and sometimes I still wonder whether it's enough,\" Roop said.\nHow can we get motivated to feel like we're making a difference with climate change?\n\"I always encourage people to find a way to engage in climate work where they like being and doing things they enjoy,\" she said.\nFor an artist, that could mean creating a piece that raises awareness on climate change and helps keep the conversation going.\n\"There are a multitude of ways that we can build our own unique climate solutions journeys,\" Roop said.\nRELATED: Nearly half of U.S. homes face severe threat from climate change, study finds\nRELATED: Nearly half of U.S. homes face severe threat from climate change, study finds\nPopular ideas include buying an electric car or installing solar panels on your home. Both are impactful and proven to slow climate change but they're not possible for everyone, whether it's cost or location.\nIt's why Roop wrote The Climate Action Handbook, filled with 100 ideas to help people lower their carbon footprint and learn how to prepare for the climate changes that have already happened.\nThere's a chapter on changes to make in your home, such as LED light bulbs, lowering your water heater temperature and fixing the insulation to ensure heat doesn't escape.\n\"The benefit here on many cases, it can save you a lot of money on your energy bill,\" Roop said.\nThere are several chapters involving eating habits. Roop doesn't want to tell people what they can and can't eat, but she does emphasize that less meat in a diet can lower emissions. Cattle in particular are known for how much methane gas they produce.\nOne change could be dropping meat or beef consumption by 25% or replacing meat with vegetables in a meal once a week. Baux removed meat from his diet for health reasons.\n\"If people try to steer themselves toward a healthy lifestyle, then naturally the environment becomes also healthy,\" said Baux.\nHow much we eat versus throw out is another way to make a difference.\n\"About 40% of the food we produce in this country goes straight into waste. It's never consumed,\" Roop said.\nRepurposing leftovers or scraps into new meals reduces waste. Composting is another method to reduce waste. Less garbage in landfills reduces greenhouse gases.\nFood composting\nWCCO\nOnline shopping is extremely popular, but the emissions produced by delivery trucks hurt the environment more than the average car. Roop had several tips to be more environmentally friendly when shopping online.\n\"By opting for slower shipping, you can reduce the emissions associated with the package by about 180%,\" she said.\nThat means instead of getting next-day delivery for one item, pick a later date to ship. That allows the supplier to create a more efficient delivery route.\nGOOD QUESTION: How do you dispose of old electronics and wires?\nGOOD QUESTION: How do you dispose of old electronics and wires?\nHow often you return items purchased online is another change to consider. Her book states that 30% of online shoppers \"overbuy\" and end up making returns. It often happens with clothing since people need to try on multiple sizes. The return rate for clothes and shoes is 56%, her book states. That results in more emissions due to another round of shipping.\n\"These are behavior changes and in some cases they feel sacrificial,\" said Roop. \"But I think that's where building out a portfolio of the many things you can do today and the things you're going to work toward tomorrow are really important.\"\nThat means it's OK for people to move at their own pace, just spread the word along the way.\n\"Getting there can be pretty challenging, but once you're there it's a freeing process,\" Compart said about becoming a minimalist.\nTo learn more about Roop's background and read more of her tips on slowing climate change, click here.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jeff Wagner","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/17/86d5d379-ec10-4953-bf7d-2ea2319d6447/thumbnail/1200x630/63bbfb4e24e5dd561869144cd09efa28/gettyimages-1439441839.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@https://twitter.com/jeff_wagner4","_score":8.238004,"_id":"3d6f338baf82b43faffa176bb1f08ab9"},{"title":"Climate change may drive millions of species to extinction","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-18 03:00:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/climate-change-may-drive-thousands-of-species-to-extinction","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"At least a million species may disappear from Earth in coming decades due to a warming climate, but scientists are using a range of tools to protect plants and animals.

(CBS) - Deep in the heart of Brendan T. Byrne State Forest in Burlington County, New Jersey, where lush trees tower above streams gushing with water, is an area that symbolizes death.\nIt's a large cluster of gray-colored, dead Atlantic White Cedar trees that make up a \"ghost forest.\"\n\"It's really visually striking, isn't it?\" New Jersey State Forester Todd Wyckoff said. \"It does have an eerie presence. It's kind of a foreboding eerie existence of a ghost forest.\"\nCBS News Philadelphia\nHow climate change has led to an increase in \"ghost forests\"\nWhile visually impressive, Wyckoff said the site is a total loss, part of an alarming decline in Atlantic White Cedars due to climate change.\nThe New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection said back when Europeans first arrived in America, there were about 100,000 acres of Atlantic White Cedars in New Jersey. Now, there are only about 25,000 acres left.\nThe reason for the drop is due, in part, to sea level rise.\nCarbon emissions from cars and factories are changing the climate by trapping the heat and making the planet warmer.\nThose emissions melt glaciers and warm up oceans, causing water to rise.\n\"Cedar is not particularly tolerant of saltwater,\" supervising forester Bill Zipse said. \"So, as you get sea level rise and saltwater intrusion into the groundwater, that really impacts cedar.\"\nDEP's plan to restore Atlantic White Cedars in New Jersey\nZipse said climate change also causes more frequent storms.\nIn 2012, Superstorm Sandy wiped out several Atlantic White Cedars at Double Trouble State Park in Ocean County.\n\"It looked like pick-up sticks with lines of snow on top of them,\" Zipse said. \"Pretty much everything that we're standing in here had been blown down.\"\nNJDEP removed all the downed trees, which allowed the Atlantic White Cedars still standing around the edges of the area to drop new seeds, which led to new Atlantic White Cedars.\n\"The seeds are the size of pepper grains, so they're really really tiny seeds,\" Zipse said. \"These cones open up and then get into the soil, and they either get stored if they're not in sunlight, they'll stay viable in the soil for a long period of time or they'll start growing into new trees.\"\nNJDEP is now spending millions of dollars to restore 10,000 acres of Atlantic White Cedars in 10 years.\nWhy restoring Atlantic White Cedars is important\nOne of the reasons the agency is focusing on restoring Atlantic White Cedars is that the trees act as an effective filtration system for groundwater, according to NJDEP Commissioner Shawn LaTourette.\n\"We lose too much of that part of our ecosystem,\" LaTourette said. \"We end up paying to build water treatment plants where the forest once was that was purifying our groundwater that we later drank.\"\nOne of Atlantic White Cedars' other benefits is that they capture carbon, which is responsible for warming the planet and fueling climate change.\nWyckoff said the life and death of these Atlantic White Cedars are a canary in a coal mine.\n\"This, to me, is a signal,\" Wyckoff said. \"A call to action for all of us that climate change is here at our doorstep, and that New Jersey is particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change.\"\nBut Zipse said humans can change their actions by helping to save Atlantic White Cedars.\n\"So many of the climate change-related messages right now are like, 'Oh we're doomed,'\" Zipse said. \"It doesn't have to be with that. There are ways to interact with an ecosystem where you can have a positive outcome.\"","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brandon Goldner","media":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/15/e7122086-0cce-4524-81aa-10981cb70ae9/thumbnail/1200x630/a98ac321481e0cb6b414d46e07cc0c42/ghost-forests-new-jersey.jpg?v=c0ff3069549804234360eec4c5e30dea","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@https://twitter.com/GoldnerTV","_score":7.912793,"_id":"03b17818db8fad129fad5df9e104f0fb"},{"title":"How will tropical forests respond to climate change?","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-19 21:49:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/how-will-tropical-forests-respond-to-climate-change","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"As average temperatures get warmer, one scientist wants to learn what it could mean for our forests around the world.

So the fact that they're conscious of it, that's the biggest thing,\" said JC Bermudez student Georgina Mederos.\nSince its launch, share tables are also available at three elementary schools.\nAs the program spreads, you can imagine the impact, with over 300,000 students in the Miami-Dade school district.\nAudra Young-Wright, director of Miami-Dade Schools food & nutrition program said, \"together we will change and hopefully become ambassadors for the entire school district and for other school districts around this country.\"\nDa Motta said one of the best parts is \"every Friday, whatever is left on our share table will we'll pick up and that'll go back to local shelters and other community members who are in need.\"\nIt's a program bringing several issues to the table for a shared solution.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Betty Nguyen","media":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/18/fb605b03-db2b-44d9-aacb-836140c57bf0/thumbnail/1200x630/bbe58259ca7b14f5ed728f56211a5b08/share-table.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSMiami","_score":7.7778907,"_id":"68f62143f0e2ee4caa0289b64a60b354"},{"title":"Endangered Puerto Rican parrots at risk from worsening climate-fueled storms","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-17 23:23:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/video/endangered-puerto-rican-parrots-at-risk-from-worsening-climate-fueled-storms","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"This week, leading up to Earth Day, we're showing you the dedication, creativity, and heart of people trying to protect life on Earth.

That includes the likely extinction of the lizards Wiens has studied for 10 years \u2014 the population of Yarrow's spiny lizards found in the Mule Mountains of southern Arizona.\n\"There's a lot of species on Earth, and we're going to lose a lot of them because of climate change,\" said Weins, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona. \"It's catastrophic.\"\nRiding the elevator to extinction\nOver the last 3 million years \u2014 a million years longer than humans have been around \u2014 the Yarrow's spiny lizards in the Mules adapted to live in cool mountain climates called sky islands.\nBecause the desert floor below is too hot, the lizards were essentially marooned at higher elevations, as if on an island, and cut off from other Yarrow's populations in southern Arizona and northern Mexico.\nThese lizards were also easy to find in the wild, unlike many other species. They would often sun themselves on large rock outcroppings. That behavior allowed Wiens and his colleagues to regularly count their population to see how they were affected by a warming climate.\nIn 2014, the team could not find any lizards below 5,700 feet. Up to that elevation the temperature in the mountains had gotten too hot. In 2021-22, they returned to the Mules to count lizards in the same spot. They were gone.\n\"They're dying at lower elevations,\" he said.\nAt that point, the lizards could only be found living much higher, at 7,100 feet, a cooler elevation. In a scientific paper, Wiens and his colleagues calculated the rate at which the lizards were dying, concluding that it is among the fastest rates ever recorded.\nBut because the highest peak in the Mules is 7,700 feet, the Yarrow's spiny lizards were quickly running out of elevations with cooler air. Based on its calculated rate of decline, and with nowhere else to go, Wiens projected the lizards would go extinct here by 2025 \u2014 a phenomenon that scientists call riding the \"elevator to extinction.\"\nIn March of this year, a survey trip into the mountains with CBS News proved his hypothesis correct, one year ahead of schedule. Wiens could no longer find any lizards, though it will take several more trips before rendering a conclusion.\n\"It seems like the species is now extinct, this distinct lineage that's been separated for about 3 million years,\" he said. \"This is what the future is going to look like. This is climate-related extinction.\"\nAccording to Krista Kemppinen, a senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity, who did not participate in Wiens' research, the implications are dire for other species in the Sonoran Desert, where the Mules are located, as they may already be at the upper threshold of how much heat they can tolerate.\n\"The region is really like a ticking time bomb when it comes to climate change,\" she said.\nHumans \"have some responsibility for this\"\nAccording to an exhaustive 2019 U.N. report, 1 million plant and animal species are threatened with extinction around the globe.\nWiens concluded the number is likely far higher in a more recent research paper, he published in Global Change Biology. He estimates that 3 to 6 million species will be threatened with extinction in the next 50 years, driven heavily by climate change, which will make it too warm for many species to survive.\n\"As human beings, in the developed world, we all sort of have some responsibility for this,\" Wiens said.\nWhile the distinct 3-million-year-old population of Yarrow's lizard species is presumed extinct in the Mule Mountains, its distant relatives still exist in other mountainous locations in Arizona and Mexico \u2014 though many are also in decline.\nStill, across the country, 1,700 plants and animals are listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act, which provides resources to help protect the species and their habitat.\nThe act is widely viewed as an environmental success story. Some high-profile species on the list include:\nThe California condor, the largest flying bird in the U.S., with about 90 adults remaining in the wild.\nThe iconic Florida panther, with about 200 animals remaining.\nThe massive North Atlantic right whale, which roams the Atlantic Ocean; all that's left are 250 individuals.\nStill, the Endangered Species Act only covers a fraction of the species at risk, in part because the process of listing a species can be long, bureaucratic and political.\n\"It can take on average 12 years, when legally it should only take two,\" Kemppinen said.\nNot enough time for the Yarrow's spiny lizards of the Mule Mountains.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Tracy J.

Three years into his presidency, what do those who care about the issue most think about what he's done? How much do they know?\nFew Americans say they've heard a lot about what the administration has done on climate change. That extends to those in the president's own party and to those who rate the issue of climate change as very important. Half of them have heard little or nothing at all about what the administration has done.\nAnd perhaps as a result, those who prioritize climate change are feeling somewhat unsatisfied \u2014 more of them feel the president has done too little, rather than the right amount on trying to reduce it.\nBut they do like the Biden administration's policies when they hear about them.\nClimate change: An issue important to Biden's base\nClimate change is not the most important issue for Americans overall; it trails economic issues and matters like crime and immigration. But most Democrats, liberals, those who voted for Mr. Biden in 2020 and many younger people place a lot of importance on the issue. These groups will be crucial to Mr. Biden in November.\nJust 10% of Americans who say climate change is a very important issue have heard or read a lot about what the Biden administration has done so far to deal with it. And when evaluating the Biden administration, many think it has done too little to address it.\nWhen presented with some of the Biden administration's climate change policies, a majority of those who place a lot of importance on climate change \u2014 from enhanced regulations, to reducing toxic chemicals in drinking water, to tax rebates for buying an electric vehicle \u2014 favored the policies.\nEven people who feel the administration has done too little on climate change support these policies. So this may be more about Mr. Biden needing to get his message out there than having to convince this \"climate constituency\" \u2014 those who call the climate issue very important \u2014 of the substance of his policies.\nWhat is the \"climate constituency\" looking for?\nNine in 10 of those who call the climate issue very important support the country taking steps to stop or slow the rate of climate change, and if they had to choose, they overwhelmingly would prioritize protecting the earth's climate over energy production.\nAnd most agree with the administration and Democratic leaders that efforts to reduce climate change would help the economy, not hurt it, putting them at odds with those who place little or no importance on the issue.\n2024 presidential candidates and climate change\nWhile this \"climate constituency\" would like to see Mr. Biden do more, they do prefer his approach to climate change and energy policy to former President Donald Trump's. It's the public at large that is not convinced, and that adds up to Mr. Biden running about even with Trump among people who are asked whose approach to the issue they agree with more. More than a quarter pick neither.\nAmericans who think the issue of climate change is very important and those who want an energy policy that moves away from fossil fuels in favor of renewable energy sources prefer Mr. Biden's approach on both climate and energy, while those who place little importance on climate change and who want to encourage greater production of fossil fuels favor Trump's approach.\nThis cuts heavily to partisanship as well, though independents \u2014 who think efforts to fight climate change will hurt rather than help their finances \u2014 lean more towards Trump's approach than Mr. Biden's.\nLooking ahead, there's skepticism that either candidate can do much about climate change if elected in November.\nOn balance, more think Mr. Biden will slow the rate of climate change and more think Trump will increase it, while half don't think it will make any difference, regardless of who wins in 2024.\nAmericans with a more fatalistic view on climate change \u2014 who think humanity can't do anything about climate change or who think it doesn't exist in the first place \u2014 are the most likely to say the election will make no difference.\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,230 U.S. adult residents interviewed between April 16-19, 2024. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as past vote.

unveiled the new cups ahead of Earth Day and as a new report warns plastic production emissions are even greater than those from aviation.","summary":"Starbucks unveiled a new cup lineup that the company says will keep more than 13.5 million pounds of plastic out of landfills every year. The new cups, announced ahead of Earth Day, are made with up to 20% less plastic and will require less water to make, but come amid a new report that found plastic production continues to pose a major problem, producing more emissions than even the aviation industry.\nThe company's Seattle-based innovation lab developed the new cups, which will be used for cold drink purchases. The cups will require 10% to 20% less plastic to make, depending on the size, when compared to previous cold drink cups.\n\"They're not only made with less plastic than previous cold cups, they are also projected to reduce emissions and conserve water in the production process,\" the company said in its announcement. \"... And they cost less to make.\"\nThese are the first single-use cups designed in the innovation lab to specifically be more sustainable. It was done in an effort to meet the company's goal of slashing its carbon, water and waste footprints in half within the next six years. The company says it estimates redesign will help reduce emissions the equivalent of 5,200 cars and will save roughly 2,800 Olympic-sized swimming pools of water. They will also take 13.5 million pounds of plastic out of landfills annually, the company said.\nThe cups are also made to be more accessible to those who are visually impaired. Starbucks said they feature raised dots to help differentiate the sizes and that the printed fill lines on the cups that indicate measurements were made black and white to allow for better contrast.\nMinimizing plastic usage is essential in addressing the climate crisis, researchers say. A new report from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory details that researchers found plastic production emits as much carbon pollution as 600 coal-fired plants every year and accounts for roughly 12% of the global oil demand.\nIn 2019, global plastic production generated 2.24 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, far more than the 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions generated by the aviation industry that same year, according to the report.\nAnd those emissions could triple by 2050, researchers said, even as experts continue to warn that minimizing emissions is essential to reduce global warming. Greenhouse gases are what work to trap heat in the atmosphere, increasing global temperatures that then fuel extreme weather conditions, sea level rise and more.\n\"Even in scenarios where global power grids are decarbonized, this could increase the plastic industry's share of the global carbon budget from a little more than 5% today to more than 20%, assuming even the most modest estimates for industry growth,\" a press release from the lab says. \"Industry analysts expect plastic production to at least double by 2050.\"\nHeather McTeer Toney, executive director of Beyond Petrochemicals, said in a statement that the continued growth of the plastics industry \"is undermining the world's efforts to address climate change.\"\n\"Plastic pollution has become an increasing threat to natural ecosystems, human health and climate,\" an executive summary of the report says. \"... Alternative materials used also need to be recyclable in a sustainable and climate-friendly manner. Designing products with reuse, repair and remanufacturing in mind is another important consideration to reduce climate impacts.\"","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"finance","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Li Cohen,Allison Elyse Gualtieri,Trending Content Writer","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/19/472a4cd5-b4ff-48e6-afa7-a6e2bbcfb73f/thumbnail/1200x630/a8b1a5ac0bff032d0c9f485d66752c98/gettyimages-994954606.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSNews","_score":7.511567,"_id":"b99528c132c88bfddbb5379e5be79750"},{"title":"Climate politics and the bottom line \u2014 CBS News poll","author":"Anthony Salvanto","published_date":"2024-04-22 18:17:40","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-politics-opinion-poll-cbs-news-4-22-2024","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Many Americans see an economic cost to combating climate change.","summary":"For many years addressing climate change has been framed, at least in political debates, as one that carries an economic tradeoff: Could we afford to do it, even if we think it's otherwise a good idea, or would it cost jobs and money in a world so dependent on fossil fuels?\nThis framing endures today in many ways \u2014 especially on a personal level, if not a macro one.\nPeople are far more likely to oppose U.S. efforts to combat climate change if they think it will hurt their personal finances.\nIn fact, a majority of those who think efforts to reduce climate change will hurt them financially are in principle opposed to the U.S. taking steps on climate change, even as the rest of the nation breaks heavily in favor of that.\nMoreover these Americans extrapolate out and think a switchover to renewable energy, in particular, hurts the U.S. economy and hurts jobs.\nSo, who are they? For one thing, these folks seem highly sensitive to the price of gas \u2014 which may be one of the most immediate ways people believe they can measure any impact. If they report the price of gas has been a hardship or difficult for them, they are \u2014 by a double-digit-point difference \u2014 more likely to think efforts to reduce climate change hurt them.\nBut there's another way to measure personal economic impact, too, and that's in damage from weather events.\nA third of the country says their community has suffered damage from hurricanes, floods, fires and heat.\nThose people are much more likely to favor efforts to fight climate change and almost twice as likely to say efforts to fight climate change would help them financially.\nFinally, having said all that, there are a lot of people who outright reject the tradeoff framing in the first place \u2014 at least as it concerns energy production. Almost eight in 10 think it is possible to both increase energy production and protect the climate.\nAnd so, when people turn and look at the macro picture, there is little consensus on whether or not fighting climate change helps or hurts the larger economy.\nBiden climate agenda\nAnd half of Americans have heard not much or nothing about what the Biden administration has done about climate change. Only 14% say they've heard a lot.\nAnd two-thirds don't know if their state has gotten federal funds for climate change projects.\nWhen people are specifically asked about some of the Biden administration's policy programs, a lot of them gain at least net favor over opposition, at least in principle, though many still have not heard about them.\nBut the fact that people more broadly don't feel they know a lot about Biden administration plans for climate change \u2014 while at the same time a large majority say they support U.S. efforts to combat it, at least in principle \u2014 could signal that people aren't connecting the president's specific plans and policies to that larger goal.\nOf course, this is an argument the Biden administration, like many Democrats, has been making \u2014 that renewable energy and helping the climate makes financial sense, too.\nTake a closer look at one initiative \u2014 the move toward electric vehicles. There's a slight majority in favor of that move.\nBut here too, one of the reasons people oppose such a policy, when they do, centers around economics: They think it will hurt the economy and jobs. (The other is a more general opposition to what they see as imposing a choice.)\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,230 U.S. adult residents interviewed between April 16-19, 2024.

But ongoing climate change is putting the species at\u2026","summary":"Whale watching is a fan favorite pastime off the coast of Southern California, but one species you may have seen is nearing the brink of possible extinction due to ongoing climate change.\nGray whales migrate more than 10,000 miles a year, swimming from their chilly feeding waters in the Arctic to their warm breeding grounds in Baja California, but human-caused climate change has now put the species in peril.\n\"When you layer on fisheries, entanglements and loud and noisy oceans and boat strikes, it's like death by a thousand cuts,\" said Dr. Alissa Deming, VP of Conservation Medicine and Science at Pacific Marine Mammal Center.\nIt's not just the ocean's largest creatures that face the threat of extinction either.\nOver the last 15 years, there have been more unusual mortality events that have impacted a variety whale species, seals, sea lions and small crustacean species \u2014 more than ever in the past.\nClimate change is altering ocean temperatures and sea currents, making it harder for sea creatures to find food. Gray whales have started migrating later and are often malnourished, causing them to sometimes give birth in unprotected areas further north than Baja California.\nWith an increasing lack of prey in their usual hunting grounds, orcas \u2014 or killer whales \u2014 are now showing up off the Southern California coastline, intersecting with the gray whales and their calves with deadly results.\n\"There's not a lot of things big enough to take down a gray whale, and orcas are one of them that have figured it out,\" Deming said.\nExperts are working to study and understand how warming ocean temperatures are impacting the movements of animals, and they believe that migration pattern changes for orcas and grey whales is just the beginning.\n\"Our environment is so connected, and the ecosystem really has these kind of butterfly effects where one little thing happens, and that can really result in significant impacts down the road,\" Deming said.\nOver the last 50 years, oceans have absorbed about 90% of the Earth's increased heat energy and experts say recent years have had an even larger toll. Prolonged periods of unusually high temperatures, also known as marine heatwaves, have occurred across the globe, creating devastating effects on the marine ecosystem.\n\"It's normal for environments to change, but when the change happens quickly, it doesn't give that opportunity for animals to react and change their behavior,\" said Deming.\nClimatologists say that time is of the essence as climate change restructures the delicate equilibrium for all living organisms on Earth.\n\"Education is really the key for turning this around ... this is a collective effort,\" said Kirsten Donald, VP of Education and Ocean Advocacy at the Pacific Marine Mammal Center. \"We all have to be a part of the solution. Climate change is one of the number one problems facing us today and that is going to impact ourselves as well.\"\nEnvironmentalists suggest that making simple changes can help make a big difference. Things like using less plastic, buying products in bulk and at local farmers markets can help lessen a person's impact.\nAccording to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, US fishermen and seafood farmers operate under some of the world's strictest environmental standards, so checking packaging to ensure product comes from America can also help.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Marina Jurica","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/17/fc47191d-37d5-4a7f-84d3-3f46e59cab34/thumbnail/1200x630/bcc4d2816282533f09c0d0c4e7ff5259/gettyimages-504727216.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@kcalnews","_score":7.5048876,"_id":"b4b807e29269ea729ab5211faf124f81"},{"title":"Most Americans support efforts to address climate change, CBS News poll finds","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-22 22:43:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/most-americans-support-efforts-address-climate-change-poll","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"A new CBS poll finds that most of the public favors the U.S. taking steps to address climate change.

Thursday to recover from the heaviest recorded rainfall ever to hit the desert nation, as its main airport worked to restore normal operations even as floodwater still covered portions of major highways and roads.\nDubai International Airport, the world's busiest for international travel, allowed global carriers on Thursday morning to again fly into Terminal 1 at the airfield. Later Thursday, the facility said in a message posted on social media that its Terminal 3 was also reopening for flight check-in, but it warned passengers to come only if their pending departure was confirmed due to \"a high volume of guests in the check-in area.\"\n\"Flights continue to be delayed and disrupted, so we urge you to only come to Terminal 1 if you have a confirmed booking,\" the airport said in its series of tweets.\nPeople wait at a flight connection desk after a rainstorm hit Dubai, causing severe disruptions at Dubai International Airport, in the United Arab Emirates, April 17, 2024.\nRula Rouhana/REUTERS\nThe long-haul carrier Emirates, whose operations had been struggling since the storm Tuesday, had stopped travelers flying out of the UAE from checking into their flights as they tried to move out connecting passengers. Pilots and flight crews had been struggling to reach the airport given the water on roadways. But on Thursday, they lifted that order to allow customers into the airport.\nOthers who arrived at the airport described hourslong waits to get their baggage, with some just giving up to head home or to whatever hotel would have them.\nThe UAE, a hereditarily ruled, autocratic nation on the Arabian Peninsula, typically sees little rainfall in its arid desert climate. However, a massive storm forecasters had been warning about for days blew through the country's seven sheikhdoms. By the end of Tuesday, more than 5.59 inches of rainfall had soaked Dubai over 24 hours. An average year sees 3.73 inches of rain at Dubai International Airport.

The shrinking population is alarming.","summary":"(CBS DETROIT) - Monarch butterflies are well known, but have you noticed they're appearing less? The shrinking population is alarming.\n(CBS DETROIT) - Monarch butterflies are well known, but have you noticed they're appearing less? The shrinking population is alarming.\nFrom 1996 to 2020, nearly 90% of the eastern monarch population has diminished from an estimated 383 million to just under 45 million. With their unique lifecycle, monarchs are essential for our planet to thrive, migrating from central Mexico, and flying to the United States and parts of Canada. During their travels, butterflies lay eggs on milkweed, eventually creating a new generation that relocates farther north. The last generation won't reproduce and will fly back to Mexico for the winter.\nAlong this migratory life process, monarchs are experiencing habitat loss, with overuse of pesticides, disease and a warming climate all contributing to the drop in population.\n\"They're also experiencing threats related to climate change, so they need a very specific kind of temperature and precipitation conditions to develop from an egg all the way into a butterfly, and if those change during certain times of the years, they may not be able to survive quite as successfully or be able to reproduce as successfully,\" said Elise Zipkin, an associate professor at Michigan State University's environmental science and policy program.\nThe milkweed plant is known as the host plant for monarch butterflies. Meri Holm, a wildlife biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, says climate change impacts the butterflies' survival and plants.\n\"When you get warmer springs, wetter springs, all this impacts how plants grow and when they grow and when they flower, the phenology of plants,\" she said. \"If there aren't a lot of resources for the butterfly during the certain time of year when they need them when they're migrating. Then that's going to impact the population, if there's not a lot of nectar out there for them at the time that they need it it's going to have an impact on the population, so really the climate change impacting the plants is also impacting the butterflies because they depend on those plants.\"\nDue to the vulnerability of this species, the monarch butterfly is a candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act. We will know more about this in December 2024.\nConservation efforts are happening in many areas in hopes of restoring the population.\nHolm says the Fish and Wildlife program works with various groups in Detroit.\n\"The city has taken a lot of parks that were underused and we're just lawns and been converting those to a wildflower meadow,\" she said. \"We've been doing that every year for the last eight years to try to connect those habitats. So with other land owners, whether it be a private land owner or a nonprofit, and to make corridors of habitat for pollinators like the monarch butterfly.\"\nThere are ways you can help, too. The Detroit Zoo's Butterfly Garden houses many butterfly species.\nJessica Jozwiak, the Detroit Zoo's bird department supervisor, has tips on helping restore the monarch population.\n\"There are things your average person can do, and that is plant milkweed and plant nectar plants in your yard if you can. Work with the local community to make sure they preserve existing habitat for monarch butterflies,\" she said.\nDespite their small size, monarchs play a critical role in our environment. We rely on our natural resources, like the air we breathe, clean water and our food sources, and monarch butterflies are just one part of that.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Kylee Miller","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/03/21/aeeb63b4-248a-4a5d-9fc6-c5cecbbcbf89/thumbnail/1200x630/bd7a42633710cc762d5b380bbfad01a0/gettyimages-1246834226.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSDetroit","_score":7.239792,"_id":"ec7d658d859fc0fd99dca130929de7bf"},{"title":"Chicago spring temperatures on a warming trend over past 50 years","author":"David Yeomans","published_date":"2024-04-19 17:46:02","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/chicago-spring-temperatures-on-a-warming-trend-over-past-50-years","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Data from Chicago O'Hare shows the city just recorded 11 consecutive days of warmer-than-normal temperatures after a brisk start to the month.","summary":"Cooler temperatures blowing into the area this weekend may be a welcome relief to Chicagoans as the city is in the midst of a top-10 warmest April on record to date.\nData from Chicago O'Hare shows the city just recorded 11 consecutive days of warmer-than-normal temperatures after a brisk start to the month.\nFrom April 1 through April 18, temperatures are running a 4.9-degree fever compared to what is typical, currently ranking as the ninth-warmest April to date on record.\nTemperatures at Midway have been 4.8 degrees above normal, ranking as Midway's tenth-warmest April to this point.\nAs the climate warms, warm April temperatures are more frequent in the Upper Midwest.

It's also a coastal city.\nA $1.5 billion East Side Coastal Resiliency Project at Stuyvesant Cove Park is the largest single coastal flood resiliency undertaking in New York City, Aggarwala said.\n\"This will keep up to 13 feet of tidal surge in the East River and protect the East Side,\" Aggarwala said.\nFurther south in Manhattan, green infrastructure at the new Battery Park Resilience Project isn't just about flood barriers and stormwater drainage. The open green space attracts visitors from all over. On rainy days, the turf on a number of school playgrounds - that students actually help design - aren't just there for good looks. Like the other projects, they avert water that would otherwise overwhelm the city sewer system and treatment plants.\n\"We've estimated that we've been able to capture about 40 million gallons of stormwater each year from our playgrounds,\" Mary Alice Lee of the Trust for Public Land said. \"That's a large chunk of water that's not going into the city's sewer system.\"\nFlooding disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations, professor says\nMinimizing flooding and the spread of toxins in New York hasn't been perfected.

Their pollination is the foundation of Colorado's ecosystem and the magic behind the state's beautiful wildflowers.\nBut each year, researchers are seeing less of certain pollinators.\n\"We used to have many more hummingbirds here. I've been feeding hummingbirds here for 21 years now,\" said Arvind Panjabi, senior research scientist at the Bird Conservancy of the Rockies.\nCBS\nPanjabi still hasn't spotted a hummingbird in his Fort Collins yard. It's the latest he's ever waited for one.\n\"Sadly, this hummingbird feeder has not been used yet this spring. We're still waiting for the first hummingbird. So, I don't know if that's a sign of things to come here,\" said Panjabi.\nPanjabi manages a database tracking North American bird populations, including trends, threats and distribution. He's seen big changes in the state's hummingbird species.\n\"The broad-tailed hummingbird has unfortunately been going through decline,\" Panjabi said. \"It's lost nearly 50% of its population since 1970. On the other hand, the black-chinned hummingbird has been increasing over the last 50 years and moving north.\"\nThe black-chinned birds do well in desert environments, while broad-tailed hummingbirds are suited to cooler climates and higher elevations. They've seen a 30% population decline in the last decade alone.\nAccording to a 2019 Audubon Society report, broad-tailed hummingbirds are one of the birds most vulnerable to climate change in Colorado, with a projected 69% range loss if temperatures warm by three degrees Celsius.\n\"Could we see broad-tails becoming extinct in Colorado at some point?\" asked CBS Colorado's Olivia Young.\n\"That's really hard to say,\" Panjabi answered. \"One thing we could see is their disappearance from the lower elevations. If things get hotter and drier down here, they'll be forced to move up.\"\nIt's a problem another Colorado pollinator is facing with even greater urgency.\n\"Because bumblebees are adapted to those cool, high-elevation environments, as the climate warms, there's only so much more up you can go,\" said Dr. John Mola, CSU professor and bee researcher .\nCBS\nMola took part in a study on the health of native pollinating insects, commissioned by state lawmakers in 2022, which found that one in five Colorado bumblebee species are at risk.\n\"In the next 50 years or so, we could see substantial declines in these species,\" Mola.\nThe researchers are now petitioning for those bees to receive protection under the Endangered Species Act. Right now, only two bumblebee species nationwide make that list. Mola says the western bumblebee, in particular, should be included, as it could be near extinction before the end of the century.\nBut it's not just climate change threatening the pollinators. Non-native species, pathogens, loss of habitat and pesticides might be contributing to declines in population for both the birds and the bees.\nIt begs the question: What would a Colorado without these pollinators look like?\nExperts say the ecosystem could be disrupted.\n\"Hummingbirds play an important role in the food chain. They both eat insects in addition to drinking nectar and are food for other birds and other carnivores,\" Panjabi said.\nColorado's agriculture and tourism industries could also take a hit.\n\"The prices of crops that rely on bumblebee population going up in price or even becoming scarce or lower in their nutritional quality,\" Mola said.\nIt's why researchers want to take steps now to protect the pollinators who put the color in Colorado.\n\"If you love wildflower displays in Colorado, then you really love that bee diversity that enables those displays,\" Mola said.\n\"It sure would be sad to lose such a charismatic bird that is so approachable and lives in such symbiosis with our people here in Colorado,\" Panjabi said.\nMola says some actions that might help bumble populations include restoring habitat, supporting forest ecosystems and increasing floral resources.\nFor both kinds of pollinators, there's a lot even the experts don't know. They say more research on them will be crucial in conserving them. The Recovering Americas Wildlife Act, currently pending in U.S. Congress, would devote $1.4 billion dollars a year to support research and conservation of non-game species.\nColoradans can take small steps in their own backyards to support pollinators:\nPanjabi says feeding hummingbirds can help their populations, especially in drought years when there are less flowers for them to feed on. Panjabi recommends boiling one part sugar with four parts water, cooling it, then filling a hummingbird feeder and hanging it in a shady spot outside. There's no need to use red dye or buy a solution.\nBe sure to replace the nectar every couple days and keep feeders clean. Panjabi does not recommend feeding birds if you have outdoor cats. He also recommends putting reflective stickers or other deterrents on windows to prevent birds flying into them and dying.\nAs for bees, Mola recommends planting flowers or getting a native bee hotel. However, he does not recommend keeping honeybees. Honeybees are not native to Colorado, and they may have negative effects on native bees.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Olivia Young","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/17/ab20d50f-9fb5-4b8a-8957-cd634bba17d4/thumbnail/1200x630/35bff82590e61a2d6aeb566743a75288/cover-vo-hummingbirds-frame-162.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@https://twitter.com/OliviaYoungTV","_score":7.035676,"_id":"a6af31e851eb7f9035462490c0c8024e"},{"title":"4/21: Sunday Morning","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-21 13:00:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/sunday-morning-full-episode-4-21-2024","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Hosted by Jane Pauley.

One, in particular, has captured the hearts of many, sparking a legitimate conservation effort \u2013 the near-threatened piping plover.\nThe story starts with the beloved Monty and Rose, the first piping plover pair to successfully nest and fledge chicks in Cook County in more than 70 years. The lovebird's rise to fame began with Timami Itani, founder of the Chicago Piping Plover Group.\nChicago's lovebirds: Monty and Rose\nThe two birds met at six weeks old and stayed together their entire lives.\n\"I noticed two piping plovers doing courtship displays to each other,\" Itani said.\n\"In the spur of the moment, I said I'm just going to call them the male Monty and the female Rose after Montrose, and the name stuck,\" she said.\nItani is also the vice president of the Chicago Orthnological Society.\n\"In our lifetime, certainly, it's unheard of that piping plovers would be nesting on a beach like Montrose here in Chicago,\" Itani said.\nChanging climate and piping plovers\nThe piping plover was placed on the Federal Endangered Species list in 1986. There must be at least 150 breeding pairs not to be considered endangered. Their numbers dropped to only 13 pairs in 1990. Habitat loss from human development, predation, and climate change were all causes of their decline. With the help of organizations like the Piping Plover Group, there are around 70 nesting pairs in the Great Lakes today.\n\"They are birds that respond more to climatic events,\" Matt Igleski, executive director of the Chicago Bird Alliance, said. \"Things that are more dramatic and might impact things like migration or coastal habitat like here.\"\nRecord high lake levels washed away Monty and Rose's first nest in 2019. CBS 2 has been tracking changing lake levels due to climate change for years.\nClimate change is also shifting seasonal patterns. According to Climate Central, winters are getting shorter, and springs are getting longer. This change has a significant impact on birds.\n\"What we see is an a-synchronicity, kind of this mismatch of when food is available and when the birds arrive,\" Igleski said.\n\"So, if the food is not quite available yet, then that could mess up some of their getting ready for nesting, feeding, and habits like that,\" he said.\nHuman activity is another danger. In 2019, \"Mamby On The Beach\" was set to attract thousands of concert-goers and bring loud music and activities to Monty and Rose's home.\n\"It all kind of came together in this one year where the birds and the music event created this big story that everyone latched on to,\" Igleski said. More than 6,000 people signed a petition opposing the concert in an effort to protect the piping plovers, and they won.\nThen, in 2020, Chicago shut down, and the lakefront was closed during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Chicago Park District shared that the pair came back to try and nest for another season.\n\"Their presence was such a positive in that gloomy year,\" Itani said.\n\"Many people went to become birders and bird lovers because of Monty and Rose and their chicks,\" she said.\nSome grew even more dedicated to protecting the birds' livelihood.\n\"I basically started coordinating the volunteer effort, and the rest is history,\" Itani said. The volunteer group has grown to around 100 people still guarding the piping plovers on Montrose Beach during the nesting season.\n\"We have a significant volunteer effort, and that consists of two volunteers doing two-hour shifts from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. every single day, and often, people will stay past 8 p.m. to 9 p.m.,\" Itani said.\nIt is a serious business for volunteers. In addition to the long hours, if a predatory bird attempts to land in the plover area, they are ready to spring into action. \"We will do big arm gestures! Herons are skittish,\" she said with a laugh.\nForever a part of history\nMonty suddenly died in 2021 due to a severe respiratory infection that is believed to be caused by a natural fungus. Rose did not come back to the beach, which means she likely passed away at the same time, according to Itani.\n\"It was hard for all of us. I absolutely love Monty and Rose. Absolutely love them,\" she said, sporting piping plover earrings and a matching hat.\nItani and many other volunteers spent hours with the birds, getting to know their personalities. Monty in particular was quite bold and enjoyed showing off, Itani said. Rose, on the other hand, was more reserved.\nThe new star of the show is their son, Imani, who hatched on the beach in 2021.\nLast summer, the Fish and Wildlife Service released three other chicks in Chicago, in hopes that one of them is female and can mate with Imani.\nThe hope is for Imani to use the newly renamed and expanded \"Monty and Rose Wildlife Habitat,\" named in his parents' honor. The Chicago Park District dedicated the space to the birds and their love story on Valentine's Day.\nImani is expected to return around the end of April or early May.\nThe human connection\nAs the weather warms and summer approaches, more humans will flock to the beaches. Although people enjoy a day in the sand, the beaches are home to many species and are a part of the city's ecosystem. Igleski hopes the piping plover habitat will remind people that they share these beaches with other animals.\n\"The fact that it is a space that even we can share as citizens of Chicago, I think, highlights the importance of these areas not only for humans but also for birds,\" he said.\nHe said, \"We are protecting spaces for animals so we are not infringing on their rights to be in these spaces with us.\"\nOne of the biggest drivers of climate change is human activity. Climate change has a devastating impact on the earth's biodiversity, or variety of life on Earth, in all its forms, from genes and bacteria to entire ecosystems, according to a United Nations report.\nClimate change and biodiversity loss are part of an interlinked triple planetary crisis the world is facing today, the report found.\nPiping plovers are a part of Illinois and the Great Lake's biodiversity. These birds also offer a unique insight into the condition of an ecosystem for scientists, according to a study by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\n\"Birds and wildlife and nature in general help us mentally, emotionally, physically, and what we do for them eventually comes back to us in many ways,\" Itani said.\nThis Earth Day, Itani wants everyone to remember the legacy of Monty and Rose.\n\"Love piping plovers. Advocate for them,\" she said, \"and continue to care for habitat and birds so they are with us for centuries to come.\"","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Mikayla Price,Tara Molina","media":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/22/0f6e5f5e-f89e-43f9-b459-3e9cf9ce210c/thumbnail/1200x630/9f92c527d208d642ab5bce7a6a4a0cb0/piping-plovers.jpg?v=57e8fa9efcf044a821348136ff26ed69","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSchicago","_score":6.844825,"_id":"0a189cd579e4ee8754bb17c217154d64"},{"title":"Transcript: Pennsylvania Gov.

Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, that aired on April 21, 2024.","summary":"The following is a transcript of an interview with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, that aired on April 21, 2024.\nThe following is a transcript of an interview with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, that aired on April 21, 2024.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro. He joins us this morning from Abington, Pennsylvania. And, Governor, thank you for sticking with us. We've been having some transmission technical issues. So hopefully, we don't get interrupted. I'll get- I'll get straight to it--\nGOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA): Good. I look forward to the conversation.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'll get straight to it, Governor. You have been outspoken against the rising and troubling antisemitism in this country. I know the FBI director said just a few days ago that federal law enforcement is concerned about lone actors targeting gatherings ahead of the start of Passover, which starts tomorrow. Are there known threats in your state?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Well, there's not known threats right now. And I can tell you, the Pennsylvania State Police working in coordination with our federal and local partners are all over this. And we'll let folks know, and communities, if there are specific threats. But we continue to work closely with law enforcement and community leaders to do everything we can to take down the temperature, to address the rise in antisemitism, Islamophobia, other forms of hate. There should be no place for that here in Pennsylvania. Of course, Pennsylvania, founded on the vision of William Penn, a place that would be a place of tolerance and welcome and peace, a place where people could come together and practice their faith, whatever their faith is, we have a special relationship with that, here in this commonwealth, where we respect all, no matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love, or who you choose to pray to. And we're going to continue to do everything we can to make sure everyone feels protected in this commonwealth.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there should be no place for it anywhere in America. I- and I know you agree with that. But let me get to the politics of the moment. President Biden won the state of Pennsylvania in 2020, narrowly. He spent a lot of time in your state this past week. We've seen in our polling, his approval rating among young voters aged 18 to 29 has dropped 12 points since February, from 55% to 43% today. How does the president get that back?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: I think the president gets it back by doing exactly what he's doing: showing up, talking about his record, addressing things like climate change, which are incredibly important issues for young voters, along with many others, obviously. Making sure that young people feel included in the conversation, not just as a vote, but as part of the governing coalition going forward. Young people helped propel me to victory as governor. One of the first things I did was start what I believe is the first ever Next Gen Engagement Commission here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, a place where young people quite literally advise me on policy, meet with me regularly, give me their perspective on what's happening in the community. I think part of the frustration by young people is that they- they oftentimes don't feel heard, and they feel like their voices and their votes are taken advantage of, come election time. This is a moment where the young people deserve to be at the table. And the fact that the President is showing up in these communities and talking about these issues that are going to help young people in the future, I think is a really important step.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So last weekend, Donald Trump was campaigning in Pennsylvania, it's so key. Here's what he said.\n[START SOUND ON TAPE]\nDONALD TRUMP: Biden has imposed a savage natural gas export ban that's putting countless Pennsylvania jobs at risk. He's risking your lives. He's risking your jobs. But he doesn't care, because all he cares about is the green new scam.\n[END SOUND ON TAPE]\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He is speaking to real fear among some of your constituents about President Biden's decision to, at least temporarily, put a pause on new natural gas projects. How do you respond to that?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Look, I've been very clear with the White House, and publicly, I hope that this policy that they put in place is very quick, and then we move forward. Here in Pennsylvania, our energy economy has powered this nation, and it has done so over many generations. And going forward, I think Pennsylvania has an opportunity to be the center of the clean energy economy. Thanks to the president, we're the only state in the nation with two regional hydrogen hubs.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But just to- just--\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Thanks to the president, we've been able to work together.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry, just- you broke up at the beginning. I think you said you've been very clear to the White House that you hope this is a short pause. Does that mean you agree, it is costing your state jobs and money?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Well, I think if the pause goes on for a long time, it has the potential to cost us jobs. That's why I want this to be as quick as possible. And what I went on to say, though, is we have an opportunity here in Pennsylvania to be the center of the clean energy economy. Thanks to President Biden, we have two regional hydrogen hubs. Thanks to President Biden, we are capping methane emissions from abandoned wells, we have billions of dollars of tax credits and other resources coming from the Department of Energy to help us through a transition. Here in Pennsylvania, we're showing that we can both protect the jobs that exist today and create more energy jobs tomorrow. Energy is critical to the future of our commonwealth. Now, listen, the bravado and the bluster from the former president do nothing to actually create jobs in Pennsylvania. He's got an abysmal track record when it comes to that. President Biden has a strong record. And we're going to continue to lead on energy here in Pennsylvania.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned young voters and how key the issue of climate is to them. The Biden administration touts the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA, as a green energy bill even though it wasn't named that. But CBS polling shows half of Americans have not heard much, or nothing at all, about what the administration has done. Only 14% say they've heard a lot. Two thirds don't know if their state has gotten federal funds for climate change projects. This seems a real vulnerability for Democrats when it comes to young voters.\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Well, let me be very clear, climate change is real, it is serious, and we have to address it. And Joe Biden understands that. Donald Trump has made fun of climate change and denies its existence. So there's a clear contrast in this race. Because of the federal dollars that have flown- flowed to Pennsylvania, as I mentioned a moment ago, we are positioned to get two regional hydrogen hubs that are going to help us combat climate change. We're addressing all kinds of infrastructure needs here in this commonwealth, from repairing roads and bridges, to making sure people are connected to the internet, to making sure families in Esplen, which is a minority- predominantly minority community in Pittsburgh, no longer need to drink water out of the lines that contain lead, thanks to Joe Biden cleaning that up. So when it comes to infrastructure investments, when it comes to the kinds of investments that are going to help spur on a clean energy economy, President Biden has been there. Now, we have to make that case. And we've got to make sure folks understand that and hear that, that's why you run a campaign. That's why you'll see stark differences when it comes to combating climate change between the policies of President Biden and what Donald Trump has done in the past and wants to do in the future.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the messaging needs work, is what you're saying?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Well, I think the case- I think the case needs to be made. There's a wonderful track record. There's a wonderful body of work. They need to make that case, and I'll be helping make that case alongside the president.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask about something that has been really damaging your state and that is drug addiction. Pennsylvania, has- I'm sorry, excuse me. The number one public health crisis in Pennsylvania, according to the state, is opioids. The CDC says Pennsylvania recently saw the highest number of xylazine-related deaths in the country. What is driving the addiction?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Listen, 13 Pennsylvanians die every single day from an opioid overdose. It is unacceptable. And here in Pennsylvania, we're trying to come at it with a- a multi-pronged approach. First, we have to understand that drug addiction is a disease, not a crime. Now we have to invest in law enforcement. And I have. We've increased the number of state troopers by 400, and I'm looking to add another 400. As Attorney General, I arrested over 8,000 drug dealers. So we're not going soft on those who are peddling these poisons in our community. But we also have to make sure the treatment is available.

The cause is our changing climate.\nIt's not uncommon to see people enjoying Walden Pond nowadays. Swimming, kayaking, and even field trips are common activities there.\nBut a walk around Walden Pond is a walk through history. Boston University Professor Richard Primack is using that history to his advantage.\nWalking around Walden Pond.\nCBS Boston\nWhy climate scientists use Thoreau's book\nPrimack is a professor of plant ecology and part of a team of researchers studying climate change in Massachusetts. One of their most valuable pieces of data is Thoreau's book.\n\"Thoreau made these very detailed observations, libraries of his observations on flowering time, leafing out, bird arrival time, ice out times in Walden Pond. And so these scattered tables are really what the basis is for building on our own set of observations,\" said Primack.\nAs a naturalist, Thoreau was compulsive in his observations of flora and fauna. He spent hours in a cabin like this, jotting down a thousand words each day on what he saw.\nA drawing of Walden in his cabin.\nCBS Boston\nOldest data for spring in the U.S.\nPrimack said this is really the oldest data set in the United States on the timing of events in the Spring.\nThe data paints a clear picture that winters are shorter, and springs are coming earlier.\n\"Climate change is affecting Concord, Massachusetts,\" said Primack. \"Wildflowers are flowering about 10 days earlier. Trees are leafing out 14 days earlier. Trees are somewhat more responsive wildflowers.\"\nSpring is Massachusetts' slowest changing season, rising about 1.7\u00b0 Fahrenheit over the last 50 years. Spring's earlier arrival may be throwing off the synchronicity of the ecosystem.\nSeasonal warming in Massachusetts\nCBS Boston\nLoss of wildflower species\nBut perhaps the most concerning isn't what we see, but rather what we don't.\n\"When we started to look at the flowering times of plants, we kept encountering wildflower species that we couldn't find or that were extremely rare,\" said Primack.\nWildflowers like fringed orchids or ladyslipper orchids were written about by Thoreau, but Primack's team couldn't find any sign of them.\nThe species that had gone locally extinct were the cold-loving, northern wildflowers, while the species that tended to be persistent were the warm-loving, southern species.\nPrimack's team came to the conclusion that about 27 percent of all wildflower species from Thoreau's time in Concord are completely gone. Another 30 percent had declined in abundance.\nSince publishing their findings, Primack's results have been replicated elsewhere in New England and the Northeast.\nThoreau is \"a very accurate scientist\"\nWhen asked by WBZ if Thoreau should be revered in scientific circles the same way he's revered in literature, Primack was absolute.\n\"He should be. In Thoreau's time and the decades after, people criticized him that he's not a good scientist. We now know that was completely wrong. Thoreau was, in fact, a very accurate scientist,\" he added.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jacob Wycoff","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/22/3719b381-91d8-4daf-b761-fe4f52417624/thumbnail/1200x630/378fbb63e0a592f9ec399d076ad1b030/walden-thoreau-jacob-1-xd.jpg?v=57e8fa9efcf044a821348136ff26ed69","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@https://twitter.com/4cast4you","_score":6.7334247,"_id":"dfa23dccbb6f54ee07dd666413d419af"},{"title":"Future of many species in jeopardy, U.N. report says","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-22 19:46:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/future-of-animal-species-in-jeopardy-un-report-says","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"A recent report by the United Nations warned that 1 million species are at risk of extinction because of climate-related issues, and some scientists say the number could be even higher.

A similar number was reported Wednesday out of Pakistan, where images showed crowds of pedestrians earlier in the week wading through deep water that had pooled in public streets and on bridges. Officials said 65 people have been killed in storm-related incidents as Pakistan has been hammered by spring downpours, in which rain falls at nearly twice the historical average rate.\nAfghanistan was parched by an unusually dry winter which desiccated the earth, exacerbating flash-flooding caused by spring downpours in most provinces.\nDisaster management spokesman Janan Sayeq said \"approximately 70 people lost their lives\" as a result of the rain between Saturday and Wednesday. He said 56 others have been injured, while more than 2,600 houses have been damaged or destroyed and 95,000 acres of farmland wiped away.\nGiving a smaller death toll last week, Sayeq said most fatalities at that point had been caused by roof collapses resulting from the deluges.\nIn Pakistan, most of the deaths were reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in the country's northwest, the Associated Press reported. Collapsing buildings have killed dozens of people, including at least 15 children, said Khursheed Anwar, a spokesman for the Disaster Management Authority, in comments to the outlet.

It has been the wettest April in the past 30 years.\nIn 2022, downpours swelled rivers and at one point flooded a third of Pakistan, killing 1,739 people. The floods also caused $30 billion in damages, from which Pakistan is still trying to rebuild.

His company, Coastal Technology Corp. develops dune guards, oyster stacking devices and cliff stabilizers. Thatos believes the best defense against erosion - an overwhelming problem on Long Island - is simple, and low-tech.\nWhy plants may be better than sea walls to prevent erosion\n\"Native grass species have actually evolved over millions of years to stabilize their environment,\" Thatos said.\nAt Sands Point preserve, Thatos is working to bring them back. As manmade concrete walls crumble, Thatos says there's better natural protection, including dune grasses, bayberry, beach plum, beach rose.\n\"They specifically evolved to grab onto sediments, glue them together with their root systems,\" Thatos said.\nThe plants reduce runoff, making Long Island Sound ideal for his experimental oyster reefs.\n\"These devices are not just for erosion. They are to help integrate human technology with nature,\" he said.\nProfessor Christopher Gobler studies coastal waters and harmful algae at Stony Brook's Marine Sciences Laboratory\n\"When they get like this dense, and then they collapse, that can lead to loss of oxygen in the water,\" Gobler said.\nGobler and his students track the warming water, and coastal changes. That includes rescued tropical fish and seahorses that have been stranded after swimming up from the gulf. They study climate change on clams, oysters, snails, conch and sea urchins, and build oyster reefs to lower nitrogen levels.\nEnvironmentalist calls for \"strategic retreat\" inland\nAdrienne Esposito of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment, says there are ways to overcome the doom and gloom.\n\"We must make a strategic retreat,\" Esposito said.\nShe suggests a regional approach - moving inland to higher ground.\n\"There's a lot of infrastructure we might not be able to move, but we can fortify it and prepare for the floods,\" Esposito said.\n\"Long Island will look really different by the end of this century,\" Alison Branco, climate director for the Nature Conservancy, said.\nBranco predicts six feet or more of vertical sea level rise, changing the shape of Long Island.\nConcern for Fire Island due to climate change\nFire Island, N.Y.: Erosion on the sand dune is seen on the Atlantic Ocean side of the beach at Davis Park, looking west, on Fire Island, New York, on October 3, 2023.\nSteve Pfost/Newsday RM via Getty Images\n\"Fire Island is really a difficult situation because of sea level rise,\" Branco said. \"What it really is is a big sandbar. So over time, the sandbar should overwash, migrate north towards the mainland. But we have houses, and stores and whole communities there. So we need to figure out some solutions to help those folks relocate to a safe spot, so that we continue to enjoy the beaches of Fire Island which are some of the most important, both culturally ad economically for Long Island.\"\n\"The good news is there's a ton of funding available to do some of these really important projects,\" she added.\nThose funds and projects would include helping raise power grids, securing sewage treatment plants, upgrading culverts where roads cross streams, and transitioning to renewable energies.\n\"New innovation is needed desperately now, more than ever before.

As of March, customers' total monthly utility bills, including, water, gas and electricity, averaged nearly $300 \u2014 up roughly 25% compared with 2019.\n\"As climate events and conditions continue to grow in frequency and intensity, households will likely face additional expenditures. For example, households exposed to heat waves and higher average temperatures are more likely to use air conditioning, which could increase their energy consumption and associated expenses,\" the report's authors wrote.\nBank of America used aggregated and anonymized customer data to track utility payments and analyze the growth in costs.\nHigher temperatures put lower-income households in particular under more financial pressure, with average utility payments for individuals earning less than $50,000 a year rising 38% between March 2019 and March 2024.\nThat's also driven by what researchers call the \"urban heat island\" effect. Because low-income people tend to live in hotter parts of the U.S., these households are exposed to more heat than higher-income households. In places like Reno and Las Vegas, Nevada, consumers' utility bills were up by more than 40% in March compared to the same month in 2019, according to the report.\nHigher utility costs are just one expense that Americans have grappled with since inflation began surging during the pandemic. And while the disease has relented, many consumers remain under severe financial pressure. Some 38% of households with incomes under $50,000 say they were unable to pay a bill or to pay it in full at least once over the past 12 months, according to recent Census data.\nIndeed, while air conditioning has gone from a luxury to a necessity, not all Americans can afford to run their units.\n\"We know that some people won't turn them on because they're afraid of the bill,\" Mark Wolfe, executive director of National Energy Assistance Directors' Association, told CBS MoneyWatch.\nAt the same time, old-school approaches to coping with heat waves are no longer adequate, experts said. Cooling centers, which can alleviate discomfort during a short-lived stretch of hot weather, are less effective now that heat waves often last much longer than one or two days, Wolfe explained.\n\"That model doesn't work.

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\nWith inflation rising yet again, many savers would benefit by turning to certificates of deposit (CD) accounts now.\nGetty Images\nNews last week that inflation rose the month prior (after increasing in the month before that) wasn't welcome for millions of Americans, but particularly for borrowers. Not only has inflation made the cost of many everyday products prohibitive, but it's also resulted in higher interest rates in an attempt to rein it in, thus making loans and credit cards more expensive.\nAnd while those higher rates haven't benefited borrowers, they've resulted in a great earnings opportunity for savers. It's not difficult to find a high-yield savings or certificate of deposit (CD) account that's outpacing the inflation rate right now.\nAs with all financial products and services, however, the timing behind opening these accounts is key. This is especially true for CD account holders, who have to deal with different restrictions than those who have savings accounts. For these savers, then, it may make sense to make certain CD moves now with inflation rising again. Below, we'll break down three important steps to take.\nSee how much more you could earn with a top CD account here now.\n3 CD moves to make with inflation increasing\nHere are three CD moves to make with inflation rising again.\nGet started\nWhether you already have a CD or are just starting out, it makes sense to be proactive by taking advantage of today's high rates while you still can. If you already have a CD, consider laddering it by opening another with a different term and rate. This will allow you to earn today's high interest while providing you additional flexibility to access your funds when the initial one matures.\nAnd if you don't have a CD, consider opening one now to earn more on your savings (online banks generally offer higher returns than banks with physical locations). Whatever path you choose, though, just avoid keeping your money in a regular account. With the average rate on a traditional savings account just 0.46% today, you're losing money and failing to keep pace with inflation by keeping your money there.\nGet started with a CD online today.\nConsider your terms\nHistorically, long-term CDs offered higher rates to customers than short-term ones in exchange for savers locking their money away for an extended period. But with the recent rate volatility, banks are now taking the opposite approach, often offering higher rates on short-term accounts (which expire in 12 months or less) than long-term ones. So be sure to carefully consider both terms before getting started.\nWhile the slightly higher rate for a short-term CD can be best for those simply focused on earning the highest return, it may be better to go with a long-term CD which can lock in elevated interest rates for years to come \u2014 and they'll stay there even if the larger rate climate adjusts downward. By considering all options, however, savers will better be able to determine their preferential path forward.\nShop around\nOnce you've committed to being proactive, and you know which CD tem you want to pursue, then get busy shopping around. As noted, the best rates and terms may come from online banks and lending institutions, but you won't know which is truly the best until you've shopped around.\nSimilarly, you may be able to find an account with no maintenances fees and no early withdrawal penalties, which could be a bonus for those unsure about how long they could afford to keep their funds untouched. But don't just automatically use the bank you currently have an account with. Shop around to find the best deal for your money.\nThe bottom line\nA rise in inflation doesn't have to be a total loss. After all, increased inflation likely means higher interest rates for longer. So take advantage of today's inflationary climate with a CD. But be aggressive now to start earning elevated returns as soon as possible and make sure to carefully consider the benefits of both short-term and long-term CDs in order to open the optimal one. Finally, don't become complacent with your current bank and shop around. You may be able to find an ideal account with high rates and minimal fees, allowing you to capitalize on today's rate climate both now and in the months and years ahead.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Matt Richardson,Angelica Leicht","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/15/14371798-3444-42a3-8d93-063b3680397b/thumbnail/1200x630/4130c7745a8b0ad5ae83fc4447ea5589/gettyimages-1166196563-1.jpg?v=c0ff3069549804234360eec4c5e30dea","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cbsmoneywatch","_score":6.3245597,"_id":"23c47b5b3ea220c2516d097b5585a066"},{"title":"Flooding in Central Asia and southern Russia kills scores and forces tens of thousands to evacuate to higher ground","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-15 12:20:47","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flooding-russia-kazahkstan-afgahnistan-deaths-evacuations-2024-climate","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Melting ice and unusually heavy seasonal rains have inundated parts of southern Russia and Central Asia with floodwater.","summary":"Protecting the Planet: The impact of climate change on severe weather\nUnusually heavy seasonal rains have left a vast swath of southern Russia and Central Asia reeling from floods, with dozens of people dead in Afghanistan and Pakistan and tens of thousands forced to flee their homes in Kazakhstan and Russia.\nAuthorities say the flooding \u2014 the atypical intensity of which scientists blame on human-driven climate change \u2014 is likely to get worse, with more rain predicted and already swollen rivers bursting their banks.\nScores killed in Pakistan and Afghanistan\nLightning and heavy rains killed at least 36 people in Pakistan, mostly farmers, over three days, emergency response officials said Monday, as a state of emergency was declared in the southwest of the country.

Despite their importance, oceans are increasingly threatened by global warming and human activity, with rising temperatures impacting fragile marine ecosystems.\nMore than 100 nations, including the United States, have agreed to protect 30% of the world's oceans by 2030, through an initiative known as \"30 by 30.\" This goal involves establishing Marine Protected Areas, or MPAs, where human activities are limited or prohibited to preserve marine life.\nIn the Bahamas, all waters are considered a shark sanctuary. On top of that, the island nation has also designated many Marine Protected Areas, all thought to be aiding the recovery of shark populations, which are critical to coral reef health.\nMany of these areas are part of an ongoing global shark census called FinPrint. In 2018, that study revealed a 63% decline in the five main species of reef sharks, with overfishing and the shark meat industry partly to blame.\nCandace Fields works with FinPrint and is using innovative technology to collect new data to see if these protected areas help reef shark populations rebound.\n\"These MPAs might be the way to kind of help these sharks come back from the brink a little bit,\" she said.\nThere are more than 18,000 MPAs covering about 8% of the ocean's surface, according to United Nations data. However, conservation groups claim most are just lines on a map because about two-thirds of them have little to no enforcement.\nThe Bahamas has strictly enforced no-fishing zones and actively patrols its waters with the Royal Bahamas Defence Force. During the patrols, officials ensure compliance with local laws, deterring illegal fishing activities, especially from foreign vessels. Their rigorous approach is supported by advanced technology, including artificial intelligence and vessel tracking.\n\"We are there 24/7 and if you come we're gonna catch you,\" said Senior Commander William Sturrup, who oversees many of the operations.\n\"We are there on the front lines as a military. That's how important it is to our government to protect our marine resources,\" he said.\nTechnology plays a significant role in these efforts, according to Gregg Casad of WildAid, who illustrated the advanced tools used to monitor and protect the ocean.\n\"This is a big chunk of ocean, right? So we're using this technology to help focus those patrol efforts,\" said Casad.\nAs the world grapples with the warming climate, oceans play a critical role in regulating Earth's temperature by absorbing 90% of the excess heat generated by climate change. Their protection is not only essential for marine biodiversity, but also for mitigating broader environmental impacts.\n\"There's just tons and tons of reasons that we should work towards keeping the oceans as healthy as possible,\" said Fields.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Cbs Sunday Morning.,Ben Tracy,Analisa Novak,Cbs Mornings,Including The","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/22/387766ec-d0a3-4b92-b592-0898ce723710/thumbnail/1200x630/150dc0d9c790fab0615f9c07ba5dd864/0422-cmo-bahamasmarineprotection-tracy-east-2853761-640x360.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@https://twitter.com/benstracy","_score":6.2071624,"_id":"b6ffbb6794036fcab13dc5161056179f"},{"title":"Eastern hellbender's absence from Pennsylvania's waterways is warning sign of bigger problems","author":"Ray Petelin","published_date":"2024-04-17 21:22:57","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/eastern-hellbenders-disappearing-pennsylvania-rivers-streams-climate-change","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Despite being the official state amphibian, hellbenders aren't exactly overflowing in Pennsylvania's waterways these days.","summary":"Scientists researching animals threatened with extinction from climate change\nScientists researching animals threatened with extinction from climate change\nScientists researching animals threatened with extinction from climate change\n03:49\nPITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- To look at the wide, flat, slimy face of a hellbender with its beady eyes and goofy grin, you might not think it's sending us a message.\n(Photo Credit: KDKA)\nHowever, the hellbender's absence from a river or a stream in Pennsylvania is a warning sign that things are not right.\n\"Some people think they're not the most attractive little guys,\" Heather Berkey, the Volunteer Services Manager and an educator at the Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium.\n\"But how could you not fall in love with that little face?\" added Pittsburgh Zoo Aquarist Shanna Gay.\nDespite being the official state amphibian, hellbenders aren't exactly overflowing in Pennsylvania's waterways these days or any waterway for that matter.\n\"We estimate there's only about 2,000 hellbenders left in the wild,\" said Jeff Briggler, the Chief Herpetologist with the Missouri Department of Conservation.\nThe largest salamander in the Americas, at anywhere from 12 to 29 inches, the eastern hellbender should live in rivers and streams throughout Pennsylvania and Appalachia.\nHowever, hellbenders currently face many obstacles.\nIf a hellbender can survive to adulthood, dodging fish, otters and other hellbenders, it then faces another set of problems caused all by one thing - people.\nAmong those problems: habitat destruction and degradation, pharmaceuticals, heavy metals, toxins and other pollutants dumped into the water, agricultural runoff, having fracking wastewater injected into the ground from the oil and gas industry, road or dam construction, and people stealing the animals illegally from the wild.\n\"Humans are the hellbender's number one predator,\" said Gay.\nThe eastern hellbender's cousin, the Ozark hellbender, went through the same thing but has been rescued from the brink, thanks to more than a decade of conservation work.\n\"We knew this animal was probably going extinct, and we had maybe a 10- to 12-year window to try to reverse that,\" said Briggler.\nHe and other scientists with Missouri's Conservation Department built a captive breeding program, collecting Ozark hellbender eggs in the wild to hatch and grow in the safety of the Saint Louis Zoo.\n\"That resulted in a lot of little, baby hellbenders to release in the future,\" Briggler said. \"And a couple of years ago, we reached our 10,000th hellbender released into the wild.\"\nBut that hasn't solved everything. There's still one more increasing risk to hellbenders.\n\"We had a 500 to 750 year flood event, and it devastated the habitat. We lost over half of our population of hellbenders,\" said Briggler.\nClimate change means massive floods that were supposed to happen once a century or even once a millennia are becoming more common.\n\"So if we're going to be having 100 or 200 year floods every 20 years instead, are the hellbenders going to have time to rebound within those systems?\" asked Briggler.\n(Photo Credit: KDKA)\nHe says breeding hellbenders to be released back into the wild needs to be paired with active protection of their habitats. He says that includes things like planting trees along waterways to block runoff and filter out toxins from homes and industries.\n\"The more you can filter that, the more we can limit the damage to the systems,\" Briggler said.\nMeanwhile, experts at the Pittsburgh Zoo say documenting hellbender sightings in western Pennsylvania's creeks and rivers isn't an arduous task. They say it's something anyone who's out fishing can do.\n\"The Kiskiminetas River has been known to be extremely dirty with industry runoff, and I think a year or two ago a fisherman found a hellbender. And from that, it spurred other people to look at water quality and safety measures. And that's now affecting our water. Our water's getting cleaner,\" said Gay.\nShe says just knowing a hellbender is living in any particular waterway can give conservationists an idea of how things are improving in the whole environment of that area.\nGay added, \"We're doing survey work and looking for populations of hellbenders to make sure the environment as a whole stays healthy. So we're helping all the animals and plants that live in that environment.\"\nBut while the Ozark hellbender population is growing at the Saint Louis Zoo, and captive breeding is also underway at other zoos, including the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Ohio and the Good Zoo at Oglebay in Wheeling, West Virginia, the Pittsburgh Zoo's one and only hellbender is still swimming solo.\nMore Earth Day content on KDKA.com.\n\"Captive breeding of hellbenders is still kind of new and the kinks are still being worked out, so the Pittsburgh Zoo does not have plans at this time to start a captive breeding program. But, hopefully, we will someday,\" said Gay.\nSo at this rate, it'll take years of work for Pennsylvania's hellbenders to start to recover like their Ozark relatives. But at least now, there's hope.\nBriggler said, \"We owe it to each one of these animals to give them a voice.\"\nIf you see a hellbender in the wild, you can document it with Penn State Outreach through this link.\nKDKA Investigative Producer Tory Wegerski and Special Projects Manager Corey Martin contributed to this story.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"In Western Pa Since January Of,Ray Petelin","media":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/17/edb5ce9b-493d-43c2-9999-59f664c7d42d/thumbnail/1200x630/9e2a508a1f78926867ee6923e0641769/hellbender-pittsburgh-zoo.png?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@KDKA","_score":6.205968,"_id":"f712a69f05b1b2ba52f3ab65c8a536c3"},{"title":"Puerto Rican parrot threatened by more intense, climate-driven hurricanes","author":"David Schechter","published_date":"2024-04-18 11:00:17","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/puerto-rico-parrot-most-endangered-species-climate-change","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Hurricane Maria nearly wiped out an endangered parrot in Puerto Rico, highlighting the grave threat climate change-fueled storms pose to endangered species.","summary":"There were 56 wild, endangered Puerto Rican parrots living around El Yunque National Forest before Hurricane Maria in 2017. After the storm, there was only one survivor.\n\"I'll admit that a couple of times I just cried,\" said Tom White, a biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who's been working for 30 years to re-establish a wild Puerto Rican parrot population at El Yunque.\nThe parrot is one of the most critically endangered birds in the world, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.\nAbout 60 years ago, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the parrot as an endangered species, a legal status that has resulted in a continuous and challenging effort to rebuild a healthy population of birds in the wild that continues today.\n\"If human beings have caused it, it is basically incumbent upon us to fix it,\" White said.\nThe Puerto Rican parrot is one of the most critically endangered birds in the world, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.\nJose Sanchez / CBS News\nBut the Puerto Rican parrot is also one of the many species whose habitat and survival is threatened by hurricanes, which are becoming more and more destructive due to climate change.\nHurricane Maria killed almost 3,000 people, causing historic floods and landslides. Researchers found Maria's extreme rainfall was 5 times more likely because of climate change.\nBattered by 175 mph wind speeds, White and his wife rode out the storm inside a hurricane shelter with 120 captive, breeding pairs of parrots, protecting them from the storm. Afterwards, they went outside to survey the damage.\n\"We were speechless,\" he said. \"It went from being green and lush to brown and defoliated in a question of hours.\"\nAll the captive birds White had in the hurricane shelter survived the storm. But because of heavy debris, crews could not reach the 56 wild birds that had previously been released and were living in remote areas of the forest.\nWhile some of those wild parrots were killed by hurricane winds, many more died of starvation after the storm, with the island's forests stripped bare of vegetation.\n\"There was nothing for them to eat,\" said Marisel L\u00f3pez Flores, leader of the Parrot Recovery Program.\nBirds in crisis\nAround the world, birds are in crisis \u2014 and not just exotic ones. Over the last 400 years, nine bird species in North America have gone extinct, according to the National Audubon Society. Within this century, the group estimates 314 species are threatened with extinction.\nSome of the largest declines, according to a landmark study from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, are happening in the most common types of birds. The study looked at population decline between 1970 and 2019 and found major losses of:\nWood thrushes, found across the eastern U.S.; 60% of them are gone.\nBaltimore orioles, also an eastern bird; two-fifths have been lost.\nWestern meadowlarks, prevalent in the central and western U.S.; three-fourths have disappeared.\nSome of the major threats to birds come from habitat loss and global temperature rise. But more intense hurricanes also play a role.\nWhile many birds are adapted to survive major storms, they may struggle to overcome damage to their habitats that are needed to nest, forage and roost \u2014 which is what happened to many Puerto Rican parrots.\nWhite explained that protecting the habitats of the parrots can also protect the habitats of thousands of other species.\n\"By doing so, you protect the world for many others at the same time,\" he said.\nGiving the birds a better chance\nSince Hurricane Maria, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is successfully reestablishing a wild population of parrots, now with a new twist.\nBefore the hurricane, the birds were released into remote corners of El Yunque. Now, scientists and staff use behavioral techniques that encourage the birds to stay close to the aviary complex.\nEssentially, this combines wild and captive birds into a single community at the aviary. In future disasters, this may give the birds a better chance of being rescued and fed when the forest is impassable.\nBiologists developed this technique at a sister parrot aviary in Puerto Rico, at Rio Abajo State Forest, where, after Maria, they were able to feed 90 birds and save their lives. The techniques developed in Puerto Rico have since also been successfully used in the release of endangered macaws in Brazil.\nTom White, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologist, said birds survive better with larger flock sizes.\n\"Flocks defend against predators and also to better find food resources,\" White said.\nIn January, the aviary in El Yunque released 22 birds from captivity. Between three aviary locations across Puerto Rico, today there are about 300 parrots living in the wild, a sign that the parrot recovery efforts here are working.\n\"When I'm old and I die, I can say I did something for my country. This is the way I think I'm contributing to my island,\" said L\u00f3pez Flores.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David Schechter,Haley Rush,Grace Manthey,Tracy J.

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\nGold bars and coins may be worth adding to your portfolio now that inflation is rising again.\nGetty Images\nA report last week showing inflation rising month-over-month disappointed many, but it also underlined the importance of having a diversified portfolio. By having one, investors can better offset the damaging influence of inflation and higher interest rates designed to tame it. And one effective way to diversify is by turning to gold and silver.\nBoth precious metals offer unique benefits that other asset classes simply do not. These advantages can depend on the type of gold invested in, however, leading some to wonder if gold bars and coins are currently worth it with inflation on the rise. Below, we'll detail three compelling reasons why they may be worth investing in now.\nStart by exploring your gold options online today to learn more about this unique opportunity.\nAre gold bars and coins worth it with inflation on the rise?\nGold bars and coins can prove valuable in any economic climate but especially in today's still-inflationary one. Here are three reasons why you may want to get invested right now:\nThey can help hedge against inflation\nIn today's inflationary climate, many investors benefit from the protection gold can provide. During inflationary periods, gold often maintains its value or even increases in price (as recent record gold prices demonstrate). This is a major advantage for investors who may otherwise experience uneven performances from stocks, bonds and other investments as this cycle of inflation runs its course.\nBy buying gold bars and coins now, then, you can potentially stem those losses and possibly even earn a quick profit if the price of gold continues its upward movement.\nLearn more about the benefits gold can provide against inflation here.\nThey can diversify your portfolio\nGold bars and coins can also be an effective portfolio diversifier. Thanks to the steady performance of the metal noted above, it may be smart to get into gold now to lessen your chances of portfolio adversity. It won't be a perfect solution, but any way to diversify your portfolio to provide better strength overall is certainly worth considering now.\nJust be sure to invest in the right amount. While a rising inflation rate can make alternative assets like gold bars and coins particularly tempting now, most advisors still recommend limiting the gold portion of your portfolio to 10% or less.\nThey're easy to buy and sell\nGold is ubiquitous right now, with it being sold online, via top gold companies and even big retailers like Costco and Walmart. Costco quickly sold out of the gold bars they had in inventory last fall, but after restocking, quickly saw the asset become worth hundreds of millions of dollars each month.\nThis is good for investors, who can access the precious metal with ease and sell it to others when the market timing is right. And because gold bars and coins are tangible, unlike gold IRAs and other gold investments, they can have an especially attractive edge compared to the alternatives.\nThe bottom line\nWith inflation hanging around for a bit longer, it can be advantageous to explore all of your investment options, including alternative ones like gold bars and coins. This unique type of investment can adequately hedge against inflation and diversify your portfolio in a similar fashion to other gold types. And, in April 2024, it's especially easy to buy, sell and buy more of. For these reasons, gold bars and coins may be worth it for you now that inflation is on the rise again. As with all investment types, however, be sure to do your research and limit the amount invested to truly earn the benefits of this asset.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Angelica Leicht,Matt Richardson","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/15/2f2988f7-8e39-4e44-a9e1-da5a62bc53e9/thumbnail/1200x630/5b30aa35f38502ee6314da3738a8e694/gettyimages-1502148373.jpg?v=6450b1292090ace5f47bbb23ced2a4e3","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@MRichardson713","_score":5.9134746,"_id":"9ab40214ca5ba1e2367c7e9d1bb6f98b"},{"title":"What is cloud seeding and did it play any role in the Dubai floods?","author":"Li Cohen","published_date":"2024-04-18 17:31:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-cloud-seeding-and-did-it-impact-dubai-floods","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Dubai is known for using planes to help prompt precipitation over the region. But experts say it did not play a role in this week's historic downpour.","summary":"Here's why less than half a foot of sudden rain in Dubai had such a major impact\nStranded airline passengers and a cat submerged in floodwaters clinging to a car door handle became notable moments this week in Dubai as the normally arid city was inundated with historic levels of rain. Claims have gone viral that the deluge was brought on by cloud seeding, a technique that aims to increase precipitation, that is heavily utilized in the United Arab Emirates.\nBut is it really to blame?\nDaniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that getting to the bottom of the \"record-shattering extreme rainfall\" requires breaking down the science behind the event and the technique.\n\"There's currently a disconnect in the online discourse between the kind of human activities that likely did affect it (greenhouse warming) versus those which have actually been the focus of the online conversation thus far (cloud seeding), and what this means for how we collectively understand our ability to actively affect the weather on different spatial and temporal scales,\" he said in an emailed statement.\nWhat is cloud seeding?\nMany have questioned since the downpour in Dubai whether cloud seeding was to blame. But what is cloud seeding and how does it work exactly?\nCloud seeding is a technique used to improve precipitation. According to the Desert Research Institute, scientists do this by putting tiny particles called nuclei into the atmosphere that attach to clouds.\n\"These nuclei provide a base for snowflakes to form. After cloud seeding takes place, the newly formed snowflakes quickly grow and fall from the clouds back to the surface of the Earth, increasing snowpack and streamflow,\" the institute says.\nIn the Middle East, instead of precipitation in the form of snow, its cloud seeding program generates increased rain.\nScientists typically go about cloud seeding in two ways \u2013 using either generators on the ground or distributing the nuclei via aircraft.\nA driver walks along a flooded highway after a rainstorm in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on Wednesday, April 17, 2024.\nChristopher Pike/Bloomberg via Getty Images\nWhat caused the rain in Dubai?\nBut was the rain in Dubai from cloud seeding?\n\"Did cloud seeding play a role? Likely no,\" Swain said. \"But how about climate change? Likely yes!\"\nThe world is continuing to see month after month of record-breaking heat and 2023 was the hottest year globally ever recorded. Scientists have found that warmer temperatures increase evaporation, resulting in more frequent and intense storms, such as the one that occurred in Dubai. Those conditions also fuel other extreme weather events, including droughts, putting opposing forces at intense odds that will likely strain communities without adequate adaptation.\nAndrew Kruczkiewicz, senior researcher at Columbia Climate School, told CBS News he doesn't believe there's any current evidence at this time that cloud seeding pushed the downpour over the edge.\n\"This event was forecast fairly well days in advance and I think it's unlikely that a cloud seeding operation would move forward given the well-forecast intense rainfall,\" he said.\nThe nation's National Emergency Crisis and Management Authority issued weather warnings on Monday before the storm's arrival, urging people to comply with local instructions from authorities and asking them to stay at home and only leave in the case of an emergency.\nMeteorologist Ryan Maue, former chief scientist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, gave the Associated Press a more definitive answer: \"It's most certainly not cloud seeding.\"\n\"If that occurred with cloud seeding, they'd have water all the time,\" he said. \"...when it comes to controlling individual rain storms, we are not anywhere close to that. And if we were capable of doing that, I think we would be capable of solving many more difficult problems than creating a rain shower over Dubai.\"\nThe deluge, he said, \"speaks more to questions around what are the resilience measures that are integrated into the urban planning standard operating procedures.\"\n\"Almost everywhere on Earth there is a risk of flash flooding,\" he said. \"Yet, since it's not the most frequent type of extreme event, sometimes it's lower on the priority list when decisions need to be made around infrastructure or resilience, or just urban development more broadly.\"\nHow significant was the flooding in Dubai?\nMore than 5.59 inches of rain fell over Dubai within 24 hours. While a half-foot of rain may not seem like much numerically, that's more than what the city sees in an average year, and other parts of the UAE saw even higher levels.\nIt was a \"historic weather event,\" the state-run WAM news agency said, adding that it was beyond \"anything documented since the start of data collection in 1949.\"\nDubai is normally dry and with a downpour like this being so unprecedented, the city's infrastructure was not prepared. The drainage systems were overwhelmed and Dubai International Airport, one of the busiest in the world, had to temporarily halt operations. One plane passenger told Reuters many people were waiting more than 12 hours to be able to resume travel. Footage from the airport shows planes taxiing in eerie floodwaters.\n\"Over a year's worth of rainfall was experienced in just a few hours,\" Kruczkiewicz told CBS News. \"And why that's important to to understand is that when you see this amount of rainfall in semi-arid arid area, the soil isn't designed to filter the water as fast as in other areas. ... You don't need that much water falling or rainfall falling in a short period of time to cause major issues.\"\nIs cloud seeding effective?\nAccording to the Desert Research Institute, how effective cloud seeding is depends on the specific project in which it's being used. Citing several studies, the institute said it's helped increase overall snowpack in some areas by at least 10% per year. Another study found that a five-year project in New South Wales, Australia resulted in a 14% snowfall increase.\nThe UAE's National Center of Meteorology launched the Research Program for Rain Enhancement Science to advance the technology, saying that for dryer regions across the world, cloud seeding \"could offer a viable, cost-effective supplement to existing water supplies.\" Many regions even beyond the Middle East have been suffering from water scarcity issues, including Colombia, Mexico and Hawaii.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Li Cohen,Tracy J.

These maps are updated every ten years.\nThe USDA changed gardening zones at the end of 2023, and Michigan got a little bit warmer. But that could be a good thing for gardeners and the greenhouses.\n\"Here in Michigan, we've been used to a certain set of plants, whether it's annuals or perennials or trees and shrubs that we can grow, and if the winters become a little bit more mild, then that palette of plants expands. And maybe up here in Michigan, we'll start doing things a little bit more like they might do in Ohio or in Tennessee,\" Papadelis said.\nSo, what does the warmer climate mean for the growing season?\n\"A lot of crops are growing a little bit faster because it's been warmer. Maybe we can grow a few plants that are somewhat marginal for Michigan,\" Papadelis said.\nGreenhouses have to take into account the hardiness zones of the plants they grow and sell. These zones have changed and have affected portions of the US. That can affect both the greenhouses and their customers.\n\"We typically draw the hardiest plants that are available for our customers up here in the north,\" Papadelis said. \"When the pallet has expanded to include more varieties, more cultivars, more species or whatever, then we can offer more plants and maybe some people might be a little bit more excited about growing out something that they couldn't grow before. So that's the good news.\"\nBut Papadelis doesn't see a drawback in the warmer temperatures.\n\"If the summers end up being hotter, then maybe people will buy more heat-loving plants than just sort of regular bedding plants,\" he said. \"If we're growing certain peppers or certain eggplant that have that produced fruit in a shorter amount of time and we're picking those varieties because they yield quicker, now we can pick four more varieties that maybe take an extra week or two to mature because we've got an extra week or two for those to mature.\"\nEssentially, the growing season has just gotten a little longer. Papadelis explains he already has people starting their gardens.\n\"I mean, I've got people coming asking for tomatoes. That's a month earlier than they really should be asking for tomatoes,\" he said.\nRegardless of the climate, people are still keeping a close eye on the weather.\n\"You know, gardeners and farmers, after a while, they kind of ... figure out, 'I've got to watch the forecast,'\" Papadelis said. \"So right now, everyone's watching the forecast. We can see out pretty clearly 10 days.

Those homeowners who refinanced their mortgage in 2020 and 2021 \u2014 or those buyers who purchased a home then \u2014 can attest to this as mortgage rates have more than doubled since. For current owners looking for an extra source of financing, meanwhile, now may be a good time to tap into their home equity.\nWith inflation still stubborn and interest rates stuck at their highest points in decades, home equity borrowing is one of the more cost-effective ways to access extra money. And with the next Federal Reserve meeting scheduled for April 30 and an announcement on the future of rate hikes to be released the following day, many may want to act now. Below, we'll break down three smart home equity moves homeowners should consider making before the Fed's April meeting.\nStart by reviewing your home equity loan options online today.\n3 smart home equity moves to make before the Fed's April meeting\nHere are three smart home equity moves to consider before the Fed's next rate announcement.\nGet started\nOptimism was high at the start of 2024 that this inflationary cycle was permanently cooling and that rate cuts would soon be coming. But a series of disappointing inflation reports since January 1 have cooled that optimism, and now rate hikes are back as a possibility. Understanding this, and the effect it will have on home equity borrowing, owners who know they want to access their equity should get started before any Fed announcement adversely affects today's lower rates.\nThere's no downside to locking in a home equity loan rate today. If rates go up next week and in May, owners will already have a lower option. And if they stay the same or drop later in the year, owners can always refinance their loan to the lower rate at that point.\nGet started with a home equity loan here now.\nChoose a home equity loan over a HELOC\nA home equity loan has a fixed interest rate that will remain the same for the duration of the loan (unless refinanced). A home equity line of credit (HELOC), meanwhile, has a variable rate that will adjust based on the Fed's moves and overall market conditions. That can be favorable if rates are trending downward but, right now, that doesn't appear to be the case.\nAnd, taking out a HELOC with the strong possibility of rate increases could quickly become problematic and difficult to pay back for many homeowners. So, for many, it's smarter to take out a home equity loan instead of a HELOC.\nOnly borrow what you need\nIt's always smart to only borrow what you need but in today's climate, it's particularly important to take this cautious approach. Even if you pursue a home equity loan, with its fixed rate, inflation and interest rates are still making the cost of everyday purchases and daily borrowing difficult for many.\nAgainst this backdrop, you'll want to avoid borrowing more than you actually need, especially when using a home equity loan, which utilizes your home as collateral. So, only borrow a precise amount. With the potential for interest rate cuts low now, you'll want to make sure that you're keeping your borrowing as tight as possible.\nThe bottom line\nWith a new Federal Reserve meeting just days away and the potential for changes to the rate climate high, homeowners considering using their equity should take a smart and nuanced approach. They'll want to get started now, before rates potentially become prohibitive, and most will want to lock in a home equity loan rate versus the volatility that HELOC rates come with. Finally, by taking the traditional approach of only borrowing what they need, homeowners will improve their chances of paying back their loans in a timely manner, which is especially important in today's still fluctuating rate climate.\nConsidering tapping into your home equity now?

Here's what to know now.","summary":"We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\nThanks to low interest rates and a high amount of equity to utilize, a HELOC may be worth pursuing now.\nGetty Images/iStockphoto\nWhile many Americans were hopeful that the worst of this inflation cycle was over, recent reports have dampened that optimism. Inflation increased in February and March, all but ensuring that today's high interest rates designed to tame it will remain elevated \u2014 and possibly tick up yet again. One Fed official has already discussed tabling rate cuts for the remainder of 2024 \u2014 and that was prior to the most recent disappointing inflation report.\nThat's bad news for borrowers, many of whom have already been dealing with higher interest rates on credit cards, personal loans and other popular credit options. With today's inflationary climate, then, it behooves borrowers to explore their alternatives. For homeowners, in particular, this can take the form of home equity borrowing via home equity loans or home equity lines of credit (HELOCs).\nThe latter, form, in particular, has unique advantages borrowers may want to explore right now. Below, we'll break down three of them.\nSee how much you could borrow with a HELOC here now.\n3 advantages HELOCs have over other credit options right now\nHere are three major advantages of using a HELOC right now.\nLower interest rates\nWhile today's home equity loan and HELOC interest rates haven't been immune from a rising rate environment, they're still significantly lower than what you can secure with the alternatives. Credit card interest rates sit around 20% right now while personal loan interest rates are approaching 13%, on average.\nHowever, HELOC rates are currently around 9%. That's a big difference for borrowers and can add to significant savings. Granted, part of that difference is because your home is being used as the collateral. But if you know you can pay back what you borrow on time, these lower rates are worth pursuing.\nExplore multiple HELOC options online today.\nThe potential for even lower rates ahead\nSure, a cut to interest rates seems further off than many had hoped for at the moment. But if inflation gets back under control and the Federal Reserve feels confident in its downward trend, it's certainly possible (if not likely) that interest rate cuts will be issued. That could be a big boost for HELOC borrowers because interest rates on this credit form are variable, meaning that they will adjust as the rate climate evolves. So, if the overall rate environment drops, the rate you pay on your HELOC will too, putting money back in your pocket with no extra work done on your behalf.\nThere's a lot to utilize\nForget about asking to raise your credit card borrowing cap. While that can be a slight help, the average homeowner has around $300,000 worth of home equity right now, around $190,000 of which is accessible, according to a recent report. So, you may have a lot to utilize right now.\nAnd if you've paid off a significant amount of your home loan, or live in one of the many regions of the country that has seen a rise in home values, you may even have more to borrow right now. But because home equity is calculated by deducting your mortgage amount from your home's appraised value, it may make sense to pursue a HELOC now while the numbers are still favorable.\nThe bottom line\nWith interest rates high for borrowers right now, it's important to explore all options. A HELOC could be a better one for many borrowers. Because of its lower interest rates (compared to popular alternatives), the potential for lower interest rates ahead and a substantial average amount of equity owners may be able to tap into now, this could be the best credit type to pursue right now while inflation and interest rates are still higher than many would like. As noted, just be sure to carefully weigh the pros and cons of HELOCs, as you could potentially lose your home if you don't pay back what you borrow on time.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Matt Richardson,Angelica Leicht","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/17/2da6fb90-0eb5-4332-9a61-afa4cffe00f0/thumbnail/1200x630/495dd8e6a35645516e98afe8ad7eb92e/gettyimages-1189942798.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@MRichardson713","_score":5.693956,"_id":"dfc31229dd640b4a04cfb865f78d7869"},{"title":"Climate change threatens habitat of Key Deer, other native species","author":"Dave Warren","published_date":"2024-04-22 21:57:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/saltwater-intrusions-threatens-habitat-of-key-deer-other-native-species","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Their habitat continues to shrink as seas rise and transition to saltwater habitat","summary":"MIAMI - Traveling through the lower Florida Keys it is hard to miss Big Pine Key. It is the largest of the lower Keys and is also home to the Key Deer.\nMIAMI - Traveling through the lower Florida Keys it is hard to miss Big Pine Key. It is the largest of the lower Keys and is also home to the Key Deer.\nIt's hard to miss the signs as you slowly drive through the neighborhoods here with homemade signs reminding you along the way to stay alert as deer are in the area.\nThey are only about two to three feet tall and can be seen everywhere in and around the Key. Backyards to roadsides to their natural habitat, pine rockland.\nThe problem is that habitat continues to shrink as seas rise and transition to a saltwater habitat. This means less food and water for the deer.\nIt's a problem that those in the Keys are facing along with the deer themselves.\n\"Sea level rise is slowing encroaching on the habitat making it smaller and reducing fresh water,\" said Chris Berg, program field director for the Nature Conservancy.\nWhat used to be pine rockland is now just left-over dead pine trees surrounded by new mangroves, a plant that thrives in salt water. All around the Key, you can see the slow and steady advance of this saltwater transition zone, coming in from the coast and pushing farther inland year after year. \"\n\"If we can't stop sea level rise, the habitat will continue to shrink, turning fresh water to salt water,\" said Berg.\nWithout fresh water to drink or to grow food for the deer and other animals that call Big Pine Key home, it leaves them with a bleak future.\n\"Basically, they won't have habitat and will become extinct,\" Berg added.\nSaving the Key Deer helps many other plants and animals in the Lower Keys.\n\"So here in the Florida Keys, the Key Deer is that umbrella species that is helping all the other animals that need this habitat as well,\" said Christina Wilson, a wildlife biologist. \"They play a huge role in the Florida Keys, they are always eating something constantly. Spreading these seeds throughout not only this Key but the surrounding Keys as well since they are good swimmers.\"\nIt is not only the slow rise of the seas that will put this healthy habitat at risk in the near future but also more powerful storms that push saltwater farther inland. Once there it can be tough for that water to drain with roads and other human development.\n\"What happened over time, we would have coastal storms pushing saltwater into the marsh and it wouldn't be able to get out,\" said Kevin Kalis, the coastal program coordinator for US Fish and Wildlife. Key Deer Boulevard on this day was closed to the public for a good reason. It runs right down the middle of Big Pine Key and has acted as a barrier, not letting the saltwater drain back to the sea.\nRestoration work has been underway to install drainage pipes and water control devices along the boulevard.\n\"Once we have this restoration fully functioning, we can manage the water allowing saltwater to escape or even hold back the fresh water,\" said Kalis.\nAnother tactic to help the deer involves the opposite of restoration.\n\"This is something we did on purpose, we call them prescribed burns,\" said Kalis as he escorted CBS News Miami's Dave Warren through what was left over from a fire they set over two years ago. These fires were once a natural process, but now left unchecked it allows these areas to become too overgrown. The fires open the habitat, which give the deer access to new supplies of food and fresh water.\n\"It's things like this we need to do to make space for the deer as seas rise and take away habitat on the fringes,\" said Kalis.\nAs the surrounding habitat shrinks, the deer and human population of Big Pine Key find themselves on top of each other. Those that live there do what they can to protect the deer near the roads with homemade signs telling others to slow down, but according to Berg, a lot more will need to be done in the future.\n\"The real root cause of this problem is people contributing to climate change. We all have a role to play in understanding our contributions along with governments at every level.\" Berg said.\nIt may seem like a losing battle, but it is one the people and agencies continue to fight on Big Pine Key. If that fight is lost it may not mean the end of the deer on the island today, but it could mean the end of the Key Deer.\n\"If they decide to move them to the mainland then they're going to be breeding with the white-tail deer there.

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\nHomeowners contemplating using their home equity may want to act promptly before the rate climate changes.\nGetty Images\nNews last week that inflation is on the rise again has millions of Americans resetting their expectations. With the latest report showing an uptick in inflation in March, which followed an increase in February, many are now wondering when, exactly, economic relief will come. Higher inflation has led to higher interest rates courtesy of the Federal Reserve, and that benchmark rate range is currently stuck at its highest point in 23 years. But with inflation stubborn, a cut to that rate appears delayed.\nIn a time of higher costs for everyday items and higher rates for borrowing, then, it's worth exploring alternative options. But with the Fed's next meeting set for April 30, it's important to get the timing right. If not, borrowers could risk paying more than they would have if they had acted earlier.\nAgainst this backdrop, it's worth considering a home equity loan before the Fed's April meeting. Below, we'll break down three reasons why you may want to pursue this option now.\nSee what home equity loan interest rate you could secure online today.\nShould you get a home equity loan before the Fed's April meeting?\nHere are three compelling reasons why homeowners may want to turn to their home equity in the next few weeks.\nInterest rates are lower than the alternatives\nHave you seen the interest rate many credit card companies are now charging? The average is over 20%. Personal loans are much better but the average rate there is still in the double digits. Alternatively, both home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) both come with rates under 10% right now. Because your home is the collateral in these circumstances, borrowers can often get a better rate than they would with alternative forms of credit.\nAnd while the rates are competitive right now, circumstances evolve quickly, particularly with another Fed meeting approaching. So it makes sense to lock in a lower rate now while they're still widely available.\nGet started with a home equity loan here now.\nInterest rates may rise yet again\nWhile hope was high at the start of the year that interest rates would be cut in 2024, the trio of recent inflation reports has dashed that optimism. And while many would be surprised to see the Fed hike rates in their April meeting, it's certainly more realistic than many would have thought a few months ago.\nOne Fed official recently floated the idea of no rate cuts at all this year \u2014 and that was before the most recent inflation report release. Understanding this dynamic is key, then, and it may be a motivator for homeowners to tap into their home equity while it's still cost-effective to do so.\nYou may have a lot to utilize\nInflation and interest rates haven't been the only big numbers in the news. Recent data has also shown the amount of home equity the average homeowner currently has in their home \u2014 and it's significant. With around $299,000 of equity right now, around $190,000 of which can potentially be tapped into, homeowners are sitting on a substantial sum of money to use as they please.\nBut that equity is largely affected by home prices, so it makes sense to use it now, while values are elevated. Any action by the Fed later this month could have a ripple effect across the economy, including the real estate market. Plus, if you use your home equity for specific spring home repairs and renovations, you may be eligible to write the interest off when you file your taxes next year.\nLearn more about home equity loans today.\nThe bottom line\nAll eyes will be on the Federal Reserve at the end of the month as they meet amid a still-inflationary climate. But homeowners in need of extra financing may want to act now before the Fed announces their next move. By being proactive today homeowners can secure a relatively low interest rate on a home equity loan \u2014 and they can lock it in ahead of any potential rate increases. And with the average owner currently having a significant amount of equity to utilize, now may be the time to do so. As with all financial considerations, however, it's crucial to weigh home equity borrowing against the risks because you may lose your home if you can't pay back what you borrow on time.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Matt Richardson,Angelica Leicht","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/16/4a8e39fc-aa9a-4da9-97b0-d0f027125656/thumbnail/1200x630/1e124f299bc33173cfb27607b95806c4/gettyimages-2147644925.jpg?v=6450b1292090ace5f47bbb23ced2a4e3","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@MRichardson713","_score":5.607955,"_id":"cdaecbc4d058835c8b24f07e53cc0bc4"},{"title":"Endangered species are dying out on Earth.

For some animal cells, the moon is the closest place that's cold enough.","summary":"Plants and animals are dying off at an unprecedented rate on Earth. Some scientists are looking to outer space for a solution.\nThe idea is called a lunar biorepository, a facility that maintains and stores plant and animal cells. But instead of on Earth, this would be on the moon.\nWhy the moon?\n\"There's no place on Earth cold enough to do it,\" explained Mary Hagedorn, a senior research scientist with the Smithsonian National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.\nHagedorn has spent the last two decades studying and theorizing modern ways to try and save coral reefs. She is an expert in cryopreservation, the process of freezing biological materials like animal cells at a temperature so cold, it allows them to remain frozen but alive for hundreds of years.\n\"Let's imagine that, unfortunately, climate change wiped out 90% of the Great Barrier Reef. Well, in 100 years, we might be able to just give them back all that diversity,\" Hagedorn said.\nHer inspiration is the Arctic Svalbard Seed Vault in Norway It is a biorepository that keeps seeds at just under 0 degrees Fahrenheit due to the natural temperature of the permafrost. The low temperature and moisture levels in the vault keep the seeds viable for long periods of time.\n\"Svalbard has done a really great job of saying, 'OK, we need to preserve seeds. Everything on Earth depends on seeds. And how are we going to do that?'\" Hagedorn said.\nHagedorn and her team want to do something similar for animal cells, but they need colder temperatures. At the lunar poles, where deep craters are shaded, temperatures reach as low as minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit or colder.\nPreserving these animal skin cells, called fibroblast cells, allows scientists to transform them into sex cells, which is how they clone animals in labs.\nIn addition to threatened and endangered animals like the African elephant, green sea turtle and great cats, the team at the Smithsonian Institute proposes that the lunar biorepository initially include an array of animal species that serve different purposes, including:\nThose that modify their environment, like coral, beavers, woodpeckers and earthworms.\nPollinators that support the production of food, like bees, moths and bats.\nAnimals that live in extremely warm, cold or acidic environments, like monarch butterflies, polar bears and nematodes.\nOrganisms that support the web of life on Earth, like zooplankton, boreal trees and mosses.\nCryopreserved human cardiac stem cells have also recently been sent to the International Space Station.\nChallenges in space\nAs a trial, the Smithsonian Institute collected 10 specimens of the Starry Goby, a fish found in Kane`ohe Bay in Hawaii. The vision is that these cells will be sealed into cryo-packaging and tested under space-like conditions on Earth, followed by a test run on the space station.\nHow the Smithsonian plans to create cryopreserved cells and test them in space:\nHow the Smithsonian plans to create cryopreserved cells and test them in space:\nTeams at the National Science Foundation's National Ecological Observatory Network are also collecting nearly 100,000 animal cell samples every year from 81 sites. NEON's goal is to expand the kinds of cells used in cryopreservation to include sperm and oocytes, which are found in ovaries.\nWhile a lunar biorepository may be a promising idea for preserving Earth's biodiversity, there are challenges for this program.\nResearchers said one of the most difficult problems posed by a lunar biorepository would be the radiation exposure to samples. Countermeasures to radiation could include antioxidant cocktails, as well as providing physical barriers like water, lead or cement to block radiation.\nTemperatures on the moon's surface, which make freezing possible, are also a concern.\nCertain areas of the moon can reach more than 200 degrees Fahrenheit during the lunar day, which is equivalent to about 14 days on Earth. The much colder temperatures in the craters of the North and South Poles, could make it difficult to transport biomaterials.\nAnother challenge is that those areas, known as \"permanently shadowed regions,\" are believed to have large amounts of ice, conditions that would make human monitoring extremely difficult.\nThe long-term effects of microgravity on cells could also pose a problem.\nSome say seeking a solution on the moon shouldn't be the No. 1 priority.\n\"I don't think it's right idea for right now,\" Noah Greenwald, the endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said.\n\"I think we really need to focus on protecting more of the natural world, so we don't lose species in the first place,\" he said.\nA decades-long effort\nHagedorn isn't the only scientist working to create a biorepository on the moon.\nIn 2021, University of Arizona researchers proposed a concept to send an ark filled with 335 million sperm and egg samples to the moon.\n\"They're engineers,\" Hagedorn noted. \"So, we're more biologists coming at this. We know how to cryopreserve. We started the sample. But they have a great sense of how to use robots.\"\nHagedorn said this is a decades-long effort and that developing a lunar biorepository will require collaboration from an array of nations, agencies, cultural groups and other stakeholders.\nGreenwald said while climate change is finally getting the attention it deserves, the extinction crisis is right there with it.\n\"Species are the building blocks of ecosystems. They clean our air, they clean our water, they moderate our climate, they cycle nutrients. We should all be very concerned because the fact that we're losing species at such an accelerated rate really reflects the degradation of the ecosystems they we ourselves depend upon,\" Greenwald said.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Grace Manthey,Based In Dallas-Fort Worth,David Schechter,Alexis Guerrero","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/02/23/f58a16f9-ea81-4026-9a6c-64f4ee929974/thumbnail/1200x630/a8359a6202dd5208174eada2330bdbe0/cbsn-fusion-us-company-achieves-first-american-moon-landing-since-1972-thumbnail.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSNews","_score":5.5624366,"_id":"a251177a483e5ea65310ad1e35e26b4e"},{"title":"What is biodiversity and why is it important?

They all play vital roles in each other, their ecosystems, and the planet's overall health and they make up what is known as biological diversity.\nBut what exactly is biodiversity? It's a shortened version of two scientific terms \u2013 biological diversity. Essentially, all it means is having a variety of living things. There are three main levels of biodiversity scientists typically refer to, according to the Smithsonian, including species, genetic and ecosystem diversity. Under these categories, researchers are looking to identify how many and what kind of species are around, what the genetic makeup of those individual species are and passing down to generations and what species populations are in various environments, such as waterways and forests.\n\"These levels cannot be separated,\" the Smithsonian says. \"Each is important, interacting with and influencing others. Changes at one changes at other levels.\"\nWhy is biodiversity important?\nA species' ability to thrive isn't only essential for its survival, but in many cases, for the survival of others as well. One of the clearest examples of this is bumblebees. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there are 49 species of bumblebees across the U.S., and they all will go flower-to-flower, picking up nectar and pollen as they go. Not only does that help feed individual bees, but the transporting of the nectar and pollen also helps plant species thrive.\nHowever, studies have found that climate change is threatening their survival, with researchers finding the likelihood of a bumblebee population surviving has declined by an average of 30% within a single generation of humans.\nHoneybees also serve a vital role in biodiversity. The USDA says they pollinate $15 billion worth of crops every year, helping support life for more than 130 agricultural products. The honey they produce, which humans have grown to love and enjoy, is also worth millions.\nWhat is biodiversity loss?\nAs important as biodiversity is, it's come under significant threat. In 2019, a United Nations report found that roughly 1 million plant and animal species could be threatened with extinction, while a newer report found an even more dire state \u2013 up to 6 million species extinct over the next 50 years.\n\"Major direct threats to biodiversity include habitat loss and fragmentation, unsustainable resource use, invasive species, pollution, and global climate change,\" the American Museum of Natural History says. \"The underlying causes of biodiversity loss, such as a growing human population and overconsumption are often complex and stem from many interrelated factors.\"\nHow many species are there?\nScientists estimate that there are roughly 8.7 million species of plants, animals, fungi, and other organisms on Earth, including roughly 2.2 million species that live in the world's oceans. But even that number is low for the true amount of life on the planet.\n\"In spite of 250 years of taxonomic classification and over 1.2 million species already catalogued in a central database, our results suggest that some 86% of existing species on Earth and 91% of species in the ocean still await description,\" researchers said in a 2011 study. \"Renewed interest in further exploration and taxonomy is required if this significant gap in our knowledge of life on Earth is to be closed.\"\nBut new species are constantly being discovered. In 2023, scientists at London's Natural History Museum say they've uncovered 815 new species, from geckos to algae to swamp eels. And that's just one group of scientists.\nThousands of other species have been discovered since Earth Day 2023, including more than 5,500 species in a single area, the Clarion-Clipperton Zone between Hawaii and Mexico. Researchers have also found new species of hedgehogs, a deepwater catshark, an \"electrical\" blue tarantula, and a deep-sea octopus.\n\"The bad news, however, is that biodiversity is declining,\" says the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUNC) Red List, the world's most comprehensive list of species conservation status.\nThe Red List holds more than 157,100 species, including 44,000 the group says are threatened with extinction \u2013 more than a quarter of all the species the IUCN has assessed.\nHow to help and protect biodiversity\nEven though species decline continues to be a serious ongoing issue, there are things that everyone can do to help what's happening in their own backyard.\nIf you have a garden, for example, opting for native plants and wildflowers can be a huge boost for the local ecosystem. Native plants, which are those that grow naturally in a region, are vital to an area's biological web, help reduce the amount of needed fertilizers and pesticides and provide ample pollinating opportunities. According to the National Audobon Society, they also require less water to maintain and can help store greenhouse gases, which are a key driver of climate change when they are in the atmosphere.\nIf you enjoy hiking or spending time outdoors, it's also key to respect nature. Sticking to walking paths and trails isn't just for your safety but for that of the species around you. Constantly disrupting habitats or walking on plant life can tarnish an ecosystem.\nReducing and reusing materials is also key, as landfills and pollution can be detrimental to life on Earth, especially marine life. Consider buying items second-hand and instead of throwing away old clothes or things around the house, find a way to repurpose them, sell them or donate them.\nEssentially, it's all about taking care of the home outside of your home.\n\"It is within our power to change our actions to help ensure the survival of species and the health and integrity of ecological systems,\" the American Museum of Natural History says. \"...While we might not be able to prevent all negative human impacts on biodiversity, with knowledge we can work to change the direction and shape of our effects on the rest of life on Earth.\"","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Li Cohen,Trending Content Writer","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/21/a6eef727-a0b7-4a8f-b104-77e1f8a502df/thumbnail/1200x630/9064889fd1879f2a01d6355a5f083aaf/gettyimages-1334442670.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSNews","_score":5.491015,"_id":"f59c4111f3052ba5a871c9a3479fc618"},{"title":"A look at California's major advancements in renewable energy usage","author":"Andrew Haubner","published_date":"2024-04-16 01:23:26","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/california-major-advancements-renewable-energy-usage","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"California has quietly passed a major energy milestone this week signaling advancements in renewable energy usage across the state.","summary":"SACRAMENTO \u2014 California has quietly passed a major energy milestone this week signaling advancements in renewable energy usage across the state.\nStanford Professor Mark Jacobson has seen a surprising trend.\nFor a period of time -- 15 minutes to 6 hours -- each day for the last month or so, the state's energy grid has been fueled 100% by clean renewables.\n\"California has exceeded 100% of its demand on the grid by just wind, water and solar,\" Jacobson said.\nJohanna Neumann, a senior director for Environment America, calls it a sign of massive progress.\n\"The idea of getting all our energy from renewable energy felt like some fringe futuristic notion, and today, it is our lived experience,\" she said.\nThat only scratches the surface of what the state is capable of.\n\"California has the technical potential to meet all of its electricity needs 38 times over from solar alone,\" Neumann said.\nSo what does that mean for future energy bills?

But then, an ominous realization washed over me: Sharks plus blood in the water equals not good news.\nAlmost immediately, all of my false bravado about swimming with sharks disappeared and I turned to Fields with a look of slight panic. Did I just escape an almost-certain shark attack brought on by a 450-million-year-old uncontrollable feeding frenzy instinct?\n\"No, you're fine,\" Fields reassured me.\nTurns out, the assumption that human blood attracts sharks is one of the many misconceptions that have conspired to give the apex predator of the seas an unfairly bad rap.\n\"Of course they have the capacity to smell your blood, but that tiny drop of blood isn't going to create any real scent,\" she said.\nAs I considered objecting to her characterization \u2014 it was more than \"a tiny drop\" of my blood \u2014 she calmly informed me that sharks crave fish blood, not human blood.

But you don't really want to go check out the garbage, while you definitely will check out the cookies.\"\nReeling a bit from being compared to rotting garbage, I asked for some proof on the subject.\nA few years ago, she said, researchers in the Bahamas ran an experiment where they put human blood in the water with a bunch of sharks \u2014 and the sharks didn't really have a significant reaction. But when the researchers put fish blood in the water, those same sharks went crazy. You can see that video below:\n\"So it's just showing they're not really driven toward the smell of human blood, at least not the way that people think,\" she said. \"You know, like if they have a little cut, it's going to be the end of the world.\"\nAnd just like that, my chance to gloat, to revel in risking life and limb for the sake of journalism, had dissolved like tiny drops in a big blue ocean.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Chris Spinder","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/22/1330b212-489d-470c-bdc7-6baffb7682af/thumbnail/1200x630g2/7873c17f3a26229395a32a3eb45ac597/spinder-3.png?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSNews","_score":5.2695136,"_id":"76d67edd147ad732311577bc4a0b50f4"},{"title":"Gold bars and coins vs. gold stocks: Which is better for investors right now?","author":"Angelica Leicht","published_date":"2024-04-18 18:35:50","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gold-bars-and-coins-vs-gold-stocks-which-is-better-for-investors-right-now","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Both types of gold assets could be a smart bet in today's economic environment.

And, with a diverse array of gold-based assets to choose from, including physical gold bars and coins, gold individual retirement accounts (IRAs), gold futures and options and gold stocks, the question of which option makes the most sense in today's economic environment has become increasingly relevant.\nConsidering that physical gold and gold stocks are two of the more popular gold investing options, it makes sense to determine which one is the right move in today's unusual economic environment.\nExplore the benefits of adding gold to your investment portfolio today.\nGold bars and coins vs. gold stocks: Which is better for investors right now?\nSo, do gold bars and coins or gold stocks make more sense for investors right now? Here's what you should know.\nWhy physical gold bars and coins could make more sense today\nFor investors seeking more tangible and direct exposure to gold, physical bars and coins may be the way to go. Unlike gold-linked financial instruments, physical gold offers the reassurance of direct ownership, with the ability to hold the metal in your possession or store it in a secure facility.\nOne of the primary advantages of physical gold is its perceived status as a time-tested hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. As the value of traditional currencies erodes due to rising prices caused by inflation, gold has historically maintained its purchasing power, providing a measure of stability and security for investors. So, in the current climate of high inflation and economic uncertainties, this attribute has become increasingly appealing if you're seeking to safeguard your wealth.\nAnd, physical gold is not subject to the same counterparty risks that can plague financial instruments like stocks or ETFs. When you own gold bars or coins, you are not relying on the performance of a company or the stability of a financial institution to maintain your investment's value. This can be particularly reassuring in unusual economic climates, when trust in other assets may be shaken.\nHowever, investing in physical gold also comes with certain drawbacks. Storing and securing the metal can be a logistical challenge, requiring specialized storage facilities or home safes, which can add to your overall cost of ownership. The liquidity of physical gold may also be lower than that of gold-linked financial products, as selling bars or coins may involve more friction and potential transaction fees. So, it's important to keep those factors in mind when making a decision.\nLearn more about the gold investing options available to you here.\nWhy gold stocks could make more sense today\nIf you're more interested in the potential for capital appreciation, gold stocks may offer a more compelling option right now. By investing in the shares of gold mining companies, you can potentially benefit from the underlying rise in gold prices, as well as the operational and financial performance of the companies themselves.\nOne of the key advantages of gold stocks is their ability to provide leveraged exposure to the gold market. As the price of gold rises, like it is today, the profits and share prices of gold mining companies tend to increase at a faster rate, potentially delivering outsized returns. This can be particularly appealing if you're seeking to maximize your gains from the current gold rally.\nMoreover, gold stocks can offer a degree of diversification that physical gold may lack. By investing in a portfolio of gold mining companies, you can spread your risk across different geographic regions, production profiles and management teams, potentially mitigating some of the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual gold mining companies.\nAnd, gold stocks may offer greater liquidity than physical gold, as they can be traded on public exchanges with relative ease. This can be beneficial if you think you may need to access your capital more quickly or if you prefer the flexibility of being able to buy and sell your holdings on a regular basis.\nHowever, investing in gold stocks also introduces a different set of risks. Unlike physical gold, which maintains its intrinsic value, the performance of gold stocks is heavily dependent on the operational and financial success of the underlying companies. This means if you're investing in gold stocks, you must not only navigate the volatility of the gold market but also the specific challenges and risks facing the companies you've invested in.\nThe bottom line\nUltimately, the decision between investing in physical gold bars and coins or gold stocks will depend on your risk tolerance, investment objectives and personal preferences. Both options offer unique benefits and drawbacks, however, and if you are focused on building a well-diversified portfolio, you could also incorporate a combination of these gold-based assets to achieve a balance between stability, growth and risk management.\nIn either case, it would be wise to carefully weigh the merits of each approach, ensuring that your investment strategy aligns with your long-term financial goals and risk appetite. By doing so, you can position yourself to capitalize on the current gold rush and potentially weather the economic storms that may lie ahead.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Matt Richardson,Angelica Leicht,Edits Articles On A Range,Interest,Managing Your Money,Housingwire,Where She Writes","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/18/75a76ac0-6d24-4c00-9669-fb81fb96a94a/thumbnail/1200x630/7f24a368e8e82242d63c7dd573023332/gettyimages-1207344944.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cbsmoneywatch","_score":5.250717,"_id":"60e125190a99e7cd90d747bf7413d502"},{"title":"Morning showers come to Pittsburgh ahead of a weekend cooldown","author":"Ron Smiley","published_date":"2024-04-19 12:07:27","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/morning-showers-come-to-pittsburgh-ahead-of-a-weekend-cooldown","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"We'll get some morning rain on Friday with cooler temperatures this weekend.","summary":"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) - Taylor Swift drops a double album and everyone's excited.

Inside, a sanctuary for more than 60 species of birds.\nThe Preserve is one of the most visited nature areas in the state of Texas. The 600-acre natural habitat also offers up nine miles of hiking trails. \"Many people live with either a very small yard or they live in apartments,\" says David Hurt with Wild Birds Unlimited. \"This is a huge backyard for a lot of people.\" But as more homes, apartments and buildings go up, space for birds disappear. Hurt says the U.S. has lost a third its bird population since the 70s. The main culprit: habitat loss. Climate change is starting to play an even bigger role, reducing living space as drought and wildfires shrink forests and rising seas take marshland. Rapidly changing weather patterns affect the timing of food supply along migratory paths, adding even more stress to the bird population.\nA sixth mass extinction\nIn a study from the University of Helsinki and Aarhus University in Denmark, it is estimated 14% of the world's bird species are currently on a path toward extinction. This is part of a larger picture, a loss of animal and plant species at a current rate that rivals major extinction events in our geological past. We are not only losing birds, but we are also losing a wide range of mammals, reptiles, fish, insects, amphibians, and plants. Author Elizabeth Kolbert refers to it as the sixth extinction, the latest mass extinction event the planet has witnessed over the last half billion years. The last extinction event wiped out most dinosaurs. Birds, a direct descendant of dinosaurs, however, survived and thrived. That is until the industrial age of man. Birds eat insects that destroy crops and spread seeds to help plants colonize new areas. \"Birds are a wonderful indicator species for habitat health,\" says Jake Poinsett with Trinity River Audubon Center. \"These plants are good for carbon sequestration from absorbing potential pollutants from the atmosphere. So, loss of habitat can be a contributing factor to the impacts of climate change.\"\nBut mankind is doing its part: a consortium of non-profits, local municipalities and citizens are working to slow the demise of birds. In the Dallas-Fort Worth Area the Dallas Audubon Society, a non-profit dedicated to birds' conservation, operates two nature centers to preserve bird habitat, the Preserve and Trinity River Audubon Center. Both green spaces are surrounded by urban and suburban sprawl yet are home to over a hundred species of birds, including several with a growing population, particularly in the Preserve. For example, the Golden-cheeked Warbler, a songbird, nests exclusively in Texas. After 60 years, it has returned to the area, driving home the point that a protected green space can help heal a stressed bird population.\nBird City\nCedar Ridge Preserve sits along a limestone escarpment inside the incorporated area of the city of Cedar Hill. This is a geological-unique, hilly terrain surrounded by an expanding Metroplex with more than 8 million people. The city has a deep commitment to green space that goes back to the founding of the area back before the Civil War. Now, as one of ten Texas citied dubbed a \"Bird City,\" Cedar Hill maintains it is commitment to protecting the ecosystem from overdevelopment. They are hoping to designate 25% of their city to green space, linking parks and bike trails to preserve green corridors to help wildlife. Many of the visitors to Cedar Hill Preserve are city residents and have become vocal advocates to keeping the land protected. \"What they are looking for is a very unique balance of development and nice places to live and play, but also this natural open space stuff that attracted them in the first place\" says Porter.\nWhile not every city has 600 acres of protected habitat for birds, there is a backyard approach that can help: plant a more bird-friendly yard. Texas A&M Agrilife offers suggestions, which include putting in native plants, and seeds that provide food not only for birds, but bees and butterflies as well. A plant healthy for birds, is a plant healthy for us.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jeff Ray,Jeff Joined Cbs","media":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/22/29f8f67f-0d1b-4aff-9caf-701ffb31f7f3/thumbnail/1200x630/e9c42a15e82d8b47ac1c3daee1e8a52a/gettyimages-1838929607.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSNewsTexas","_score":5.1221886,"_id":"1eebc977be6c84a7c6a1699fc93addcc"},{"title":"Pennsylvania's state government pledges to get half of its electricity from solar power","author":"Madeline Bartos","published_date":"2024-04-22 18:55:18","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/pennsylvania-state-government-solar-power","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Pennsylvania is pledging to get half of the state government's electricity from solar power by next year.","summary":"YORK, Pa.
