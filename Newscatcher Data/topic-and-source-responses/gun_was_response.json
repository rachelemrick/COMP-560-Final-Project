            "excerpt": "State lawmakers are taking very different approaches to public safety following high-profile shootings",
            "summary": "Six months after a deadly mass shooting by an Army reservist, Maine lawmakers this week passed a wide-ranging package of new gun restrictions.\nThree months after a fatal school shooting, Iowa lawmakers this week passed legislation allowing trained teachers and staff to carry guns on school property.\nTwo states. Two tragedies. Two different approaches to improving public safety.\n'We live in two different Americas, in essence,' said Daniel Webster, a health policy professor affiliated with the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions.\n'We see terrible acts of gun violence; no one wants them, of course,' Webster said. 'But we see this through different lenses.'\nLegislatures in about 20 states already have passed measures this year to expand gun rights or restrict access to firearms. Dozens more proposals are pending. The divide continues a trend seen last year, when more than half the states enacted firearms legislation, with Democrats generally favoring more limits and Republicans more freedoms for gun owners.\nLIMITS ON GUNS IN MAINE\nMaine has a tradition of hunting and gun ownership. But after an Army reservist killed 18 people and wounded 13 others in Lewiston, Democratic Gov. Janet Mills called for a variety of new laws aimed at preventing dangerous people from possessing guns and strengthening mental health services.\nAdvertisement\nBefore adjourning its 2024 session early Thursday, lawmakers approved measures imposing a 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases, expanding background checks on private gun sales and criminalizing sales to certain prohibited people. They also passed a ban on devices that convert semi-automatic firearms into rapid-firing weapons like machine guns, and enhanced an existing law that allows judges to temporarily remove guns from people during a mental health crisis.\nA gun safety coalition praised it as a significant step forward in response to constituents' concerns after the Lewiston shooting. But Republican state Sen. Lisa Keim criticized colleagues for 'using the tragedy to advance legislation' that had been unable to pass previously.\nGUNS IN IOWA SCHOOLS\nIn Perry, Iowa, a school principal and sixth-grade student died and several others were wounded when a 17-year-old student opened fire in January.\nAdvertisement\nA 2021 state law already allowed schools to authorize individuals to carry firearms, though some districts have not done so because of concerns about insurance coverage.\nThe legislation given final approval Monday by the Republican-led Legislature builds upon the prior law by allowing teachers and staff who undergo gun safety training to get a professional permit to carry guns in schools. If they do, they would be protected from criminal or civil liability for use of reasonable force.\nThe legislation also requires large school districts to station a police officer or private security guard at each high school, unless the school board votes not to do so. Most of those school districts already have security staff.\nDIVERGING STATE LAWS\nRepublican-led legislatures in Kentucky, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee and Utah also passed measures this year that would expand the ability of some people to bring guns into schools. A bill passed in Wyoming allots $480,000 to reimburse schools for the cost of training employees to carry guns on school property.\nAdvertisement\nLouisiana and South Carolina, led by Republican lawmakers and governors, each enacted laws allowing people to carry concealed guns without a permit. The National Rifle Association, which supported the measures, said similar laws now exist in 29 states.\nBy contrast, the Democrat-led Delaware Legislature passed legislation requiring people wanting to buy a handgun to first be fingerprinted, undergo training and obtain a state permit.\nNew Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, signed a pair of new laws imposing restrictions. One sets a seven-day waiting period to purchase firearms — more than double the three-day period required by the federal government for a background check.\nAnother new law in New Mexico prohibits carrying firearms within 100 feet (30 meters) of polling places, with an exemption for concealed-carry permit holders. Voting site restrictions on guns now exist in about one-third of the states and Washington, D.C., according to the gun-violence prevention group Giffords.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBUCKING PARTY TRENDS\nNot all new gun policies diverge along partisan lines.\nAdvertisement\nRepublican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin this year vetoed 30 gun-related bills passed by the Democratic-led General Assembly that he said would have trampled on constitutional rights. Yet Youngkin also signed some gun restrictions: One bans devices that convert semi-automatic handguns into automatic weapons. Another allows felony charges against parents who let a child have access to a firearm after being notified the child poses a threat of violence.\nWhile signing several gun rights measures, Republican Gov. Mark Gordon of Wyoming also vetoed legislation that would have allowed people to carry concealed guns in public schools and government meetings. Gordon cited concerns the bill could have exceeded the separation of powers provision in the state constitution.\nAnd in some cases, high-profile shootings have prompted lawmakers to avoid taking action on proposals they might otherwise have considered.\nAdvertisement\nMissouri's Republican-led House had been prepared to debate bills exempting guns and ammunition from sales taxes and allowing people with concealed-carry permits to bring guns onto public transportation. But after the deadly shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl celebration, House Majority Leader Jon Patterson said those bills would not be brought up this year.\n___",

The bill also funds violence prevention initiatives and opens a mental health crisis receiving center in Lewiston.\nMore votes are necessary in the Democratic-controlled Legislature before it adjourns Wednesday. The House also will be voting on two bills approved by the Senate: waiting periods for gun purchases and a ban on bump stocks.\nAdvertisement\nOne bill that failed was a proposal to let gun violence victims sue weapon manufacturers. And so far, neither chamber has voted on a proposal for a red flag law that allows family members to petition a judge to remove guns from someone who's in a psychiatric crisis. That proposal differs from the state's current yellow flag law that puts police in the lead of the process.\nMeanwhile, another measure sponsored by House Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross to fund a range of mental health and violence prevention initiatives awaits money in the final budget.\nThe state has a strong hunting tradition and an active lobby aimed at protecting gun owner rights. Maine voters rejected universal background checks for firearm purchases in 2016.\nThe Oct. 25 shooting that killed 18 people and injured 13 others in Lewiston prompted lawmakers to act, saying constituents were demanding that they do something that could prevent future attacks.",

            "excerpt": "The Biden administration and challengers to its rule agreed that they wanted the justices to take up the case.",
            "summary": "The Supreme Court on Monday said it would weigh a challenge to a Biden administration rule on 'ghost guns,' weapons made from homemade kits that can be assembled into firearms.\nThe administration in 2022 imposed a federal rule requiring that these kits must include serial numbers and mandating background checks for people who buy them from dealers, saying the change was needed to contend with people getting and using weapons that could not be traced by law enforcement officials. Last year, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit concluded that the Biden administration had overstepped and said its rule constituted 'unlawful agency action.'\nSolicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar asked the Supreme Court to hear its appeal of the decision, saying the lower court's conclusions were incorrect and that leaving them in place would imperil public safety. Challengers to the Biden administration's regulation — a group that includes companies that make or sell such kits, along with a gun-rights organization — disagreed, saying the circuit court's conclusions were correct and should be upheld.\nAdvertisement\nBoth the Biden administration and opponents of its rule did agree on one thing, however: They wanted the Supreme Court to take up this case and decide the issue.\nThis case marks the latest gun-related debate the justices have agreed to consider. In recent months, the court has heard arguments about a federal law prohibiting people under domestic-violence restraining orders from having guns and about the federal ban of bump-stock devices.\nThe justices have also addressed the Biden administration's rule involving ghost guns before. Last year, the Supreme Court allowed these regulations to remain in place amid numerous challenges.\nA federal judge in Texas had ruled that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) exceeded its authority by regulating these kits under the Gun Control Act of 1968. The Supreme Court reinstated the Biden administration's rule last summer while other legal challenges continued around the country, then did that again weeks later following more lower court rulings.\nAdvertisement\nThe two sides in this case disagree on whether the kits count as firearms under the 1968 act. The Biden administration says they fall 'within the plain meaning of the act's definition of ‘firearm.' ' Opponents say the 2022 rule 'expanded the regulatory definition of ‘firearm' beyond the Gun Control Act's bounds.'\nThe 5th Circuit panel said in November that weapons parts kits are not 'firearms' under the 1968 act, and the judges concluded that the ATF had acted improperly.\n'Because Congress has neither authorized the expansion of firearm regulation nor permitted the criminalization of previously lawful conduct,' the panel wrote, 'the proposed rule constitutes unlawful agency action, in direct contravention of the legislature's will.'\nIn asking the Supreme Court to hear this case, Prelogar wrote that the 5th Circuit panel had 'declared invalid key provisions of an important regulation and adopted an interpretation of the act that would effectively nullify its central provisions.'\nAdvertisement\nPrelogar wrote that the panel's decision would allow 'a flood of untraceable ghost guns' nationwide, creating danger for the public and difficulties for law-enforcement officials seeking to solve crimes.\nIn a brief supporting Prelogar's petition, attorneys general for more than a dozen states and Washington, D.C., defended what they called 'a common-sense regulation.' They said individual states have tried to fight gun violence, but cited 'a natural limit to states' abilities to combat a nationwide problem that crosses state borders.' The federal rule, they said, helps by trying 'to keep ghost guns out of the hands of violent criminals.'\nChallengers to the federal rule say the Biden administration's directive is unlawful and that ATF 'overreached by effectively attempting to amend the [Gun Control Act] itself.'\nAdvertisement\nThe federal rule 'upsets the delicate balance struck by Congress between the commercial production and sale of firearms and the noncommercial making of firearms by law-abiding citizens,' wrote the challengers.\nIn addition to the businesses and gun-rights group, the challengers also include two people — Jennifer VanDerStok and Michael Andren — who own items impacted by the rule and wish to buy more, according to court papers.\nThe challengers also note that there has been clear confusion in lower courts about the way the Biden administration rule coexists with the Gun Control Act, saying the justices needed to weigh in to help resolve this.",

            "summary": "After a gunman killed 18 people last year at a bowling alley and bar in Maine, legislators pledged to revisit the state's gun laws.\nThis week, after months of debate, they approved new restrictions on weapons sales but did not pass a measure that would have significantly strengthened the ability to remove guns from those deemed dangerous.\nMaine, a largely rural state where gun ownership is common, is a place where even some Democratic lawmakers had been reluctant to enact fresh limits on guns.\nThat dynamic changed considerably after the Oct. 25 shooting, the deadliest in the state's history.\nAdvertisement\nAnother bill passed by the legislature this week will ban bump stocks, accessories that increase the firing rate of semiautomatic weapons.\nHowever, the state's legislators did not vote on a proposed 'red-flag' measure, which would have given both family members and law enforcement a way to remove guns from those deemed a danger to themselves or others.\nMaine Gov. Janet Mills (D) has yet to sign the bills passed by the legislature.\nThis week's votes mark the culmination of a legislative session that opened with hundreds of people gathering at the State House to press for tighter gun laws. In emotional testimony, family members of the victims pleaded with legislators to act.\nAfter last year's shooting, there were wrenching revelations about missed chances to stop the gunman. People who knew the shooter — Army reservist Robert Card — had repeatedly told authorities that they were concerned about his mental state and access to weapons.\nAdvertisement\nA friend and fellow member of the Army Reserve informed a sheriff's office in September that he believed Card was 'going to snap and do a mass shooting.' A sheriff's deputy visited Card's home to check on him and spotted someone inside but left after no one answered the door.\nGun violence prevention groups had pushed for the passage of a red-flag law in response to the shooting. Such measures typically allow relatives and police to petition a judge to remove weapons from someone likely to harm themselves or others. More than 20 states have enacted such statutes.\nMaine, by contrast, has an unusual 'yellow-flag' law, which sets a high bar for the removal of firearms. The process begins with taking someone into protective custody, meaning police must first locate the person.\nAdvertisement\nThen a clinician conducts a mental health evaluation to determine whether the person is likely to harm themselves or others. If so, law enforcement can petition a judge to prevent the person from possessing or buying weapons.\nAn independent commission investigating the shooting in Lewiston issued an interim report last month finding that sheriff's deputies should have initiated the yellow-flag process in Card's case. It also acknowledged that taking Card into custody 'might not have been without difficulty and potential risk.'\nThe legislature adopted a proposal from the governor adjusting the yellow-flag law. It would allow law enforcement officers to seek a warrant to take someone into protective custody under the statute if other attempts to do so have failed.\nNacole Palmer, executive director of the Maine Gun Safety Coalition, said the narrow change wasn't sufficient. 'It would be a mistake to legislate purely to the last crisis, the last tragedy,' she said. 'The next one isn't going to look like that.'\nnarrow change wasn't sufficient. 'It would be a mistake to legislate purely to the last crisis, the last tragedy,' she said. 'The next one isn't going to look like that.'\nAdvertisement\nGun rights advocates, meanwhile, decried the slate of restrictions ultimately passed by the legislature. The measures reflect 'cookie-cutter' legislation pushed by national advocacy groups and are 'out-of-step' with Maine's 'proud gun-owning heritage,' Justin Davis of the National Rifle Association and Laura Whitcomb of Gun Owners of Maine wrote in an opinion piece last month.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAdvocates galvanized by the October mass killing vowed to keep going. Joe Anderson, a physician at Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston, was working at the hospital the night of the shooting and treated one of the victims.\nThe following night he couldn't sleep, he said. He knew he had to do more. He went on to organize a rally of hundreds of health-care providers in November, an effort that grew into a new advocacy group called Maine Providers for Gun Safety.\nAdvertisement\n'Any progress is progress, and we're certainly happy with whatever we can get this session,' Anderson said. But the failure to pass the red-flag bill is 'just not acceptable.'\nFor a long time, he said, many Maine residents persisted in the belief that their state was different when it came to the national scourge of gun violence.",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The Justice Department is ramping up its efforts to reduce violent crime in the U.S., launching a specialized gun intelligence center in Chicago and expanding task forces to curb carjackings.\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said there is 'absolutely much more to do' to make communities safer, even as many places have experienced a downward trend in crime after a coronavirus pandemic-era spike.\n'No level of violence is acceptable,' Monaco said during a trip to Chicago this week. 'We are seeing progress, but we're far from done. We have to double down on the strategies that work, by bringing federal resources to act as force multipliers.'\nThe initiatives are part of a broad effort by President Joe Biden's administration to address violent crime — an issue the Democratic president has featured in his reelection campaign to reach young voters concerned about gun violence. Republicans have seized on violence in some American cities, including the nation's capital, to try to paint Democrats as weak on crime.\nAdvertisement\nLast week, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives announced it had finalized a new rule requiring thousands more firearms dealers to run background checks on buyers at gun shows or other places outside brick-and-mortar stores. Gun rights groups are expected to mount legal challenges.\nIn Chicago, the gun crime intelligence center at the city's ATF office brings together federal agents and state and local police as well as federal and local prosecutors to share and analyze firearm intelligence to better identify traffickers and the most prolific shooters, officials said.\nIt's modeled after dozens of similar centers run by the ATF across the country. The Chicago center will house 65 agents, officers, analysts and prosecutors.\n'The goal is to catch more violent people, truly violent. And, second, to do a better job at seeing if we can prevent them from getting armed in the first place,' ATF Director Steve Dettelbach said in an interview. 'The first days and hours after an incident are crucial to the investigation, and being able to have everybody together, looking at that data every single day and making decisions, is a real game changer.'\nAdvertisement\nChicago is one of the nation's gun violence hotspots, even as police data shows shootings and killings declined there last year. The announcement comes days after a young girl was killed and 10 other people were wounded in a shooting police believe was gang-related on the city's South Side.\n'Every innocent life lost to gun violence is one too many,' Monaco said. 'And every shooter evading justice is one too many.'\nRecently released FBI data based on numbers sent from about 80% of U.S. law enforcement agencies shows murders overall dropped 13% and violent crime overall was down 6% in the last three months of 2023 compared with the same period the year before. Final detailed data for 2023 is expected to be released in the fall.\nAmid a scourge of carjackings nationwide, the Justice Department has also created new task forces to combat the issue in seven more U.S. attorney's offices, including the Eastern District of Texas, the Northern District of Alabama and the Northern District of California. The task forces, which are now in 11 offices, include federal prosecutors, ATF and FBI agents and state and local law enforcement.\nThe goal is to get federal officials involved at the beginning of carjacking investigations — even if the cases ended up being prosecuted locally — to help with duties like tracing firearms, performing forensics analyses or getting search warrants and subpoenas.\n___",

She has spent more than a month in a county jail awaiting her sentencing, according to the Associated Press.\nThe sentence was issued by Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer. Gutierrez-Reed faced a potential 18 months in state prison.

During filming, Alec Baldwin was rehearsing a scene with a revolver when the gun went off with live ammunition, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin, who claimed he never pulled the trigger, was indicted by a grand jury for involuntary manslaughter in January with a trial set for this summer.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nProsecutors argued Gutierrez-Reed's 'unprofessional and sloppy' conduct led to there being live ammunition on set, which ultimately resulted in Hutchins's death. The prosecution alleged in court filings that the armorer was hung over while loading the gun and tampered with evidence by handing drugs to someone else involved with the film.\nBut the defense argued that Gutierrez-Reed was rushed to do her job and wasn't given enough resources to properly prepare the weapons on set. Her attorney Jason Bowles argued that Baldwin's failure to handle the gun on set led to the fatal shooting.\nAdvertisement\nGutierrez-Reed's verdict and trial were a glimpse at what Baldwin could face when his trial starts on July 9. Baldwin was originally charged with involuntary manslaughter by New Mexico prosecutors in January 2023 before those charges were dropped as prosecutors sought more time to investigate. Baldwin has said he pulled the gun's hammer — not the trigger — in the shooting. But a forensics expert noted that the gun couldn't have gone off without pressure on the trigger.

He said he eventually shot Goodson in the doorway of his grandmother's home because the young man turned toward him with a gun.\nGoodson's family and prosecutors have said he was holding a sandwich bag in one hand and his keys in the other when he was fatally shot. They do not dispute that Goodson may have been carrying a gun and note he had a license to carry a firearm.\nGoodson's weapon, a handgun with an extended magazine, was found on his grandmother's kitchen floor with the safety mechanism engaged.",

            "summary": "Republican Senate candidate Tim Sheehy apologized and asked for leniency in 2015 after he said a gun he kept in his vehicle for bear protection fell and discharged, striking him in his right forearm in Glacier National Park, according to new National Park Service documents released through a Freedom of Information Act request.\nThe new documents, which provide additional detail about an incident first reported by The Washington Post this month, include a detailed written statement from Sheehy to a law enforcement officer regarding Sheehy having accidentally shot himself on Oct. 18, 2015 — an account that he now says was a lie.\n'As a highly trained and combat experienced wounded veteran, I can assure you this was an unfortunate accident and we are grateful no other persons or property were damaged,' Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL, said in the 2015 statement apologizing for illegally discharging his weapon in the park. 'Due to my ongoing security clearance and involvement with national defense related contracts, I request leniency with any charges related to this unfortunate accident.'\nAdvertisement\nSheehy, who has told voters he has a bullet in his arm from his time serving in Afghanistan, told The Post he made up the 2015 accidental gunshot story on that October day to cover up a wound he says he received in a 2012 firefight in Afghanistan.\nA National Park Service summary of the incident, which was also included in the newly released documents, says an unidentified park visitor reported an accidental gun discharge in Logan Pass. That differs from Sheehy's current account, that law enforcement was first contacted by personnel at a hospital that treated him for wounds that he now says he received from falling during a hike. The summary does not identify the park visitor who made the report of a gun discharge.\nSheehy, a decorated war veteran, is favored to win the GOP nomination to take on the vulnerable Sen.

He went to the hospital in Kalispell to treat his wounded arm, the records say, and first spoke to the ranger who responded to the incident there.\ntold a ranger that he accidentally shot himself in the right arm that day when his Colt .45 revolver fell and discharged while he was loading his vehicle in the park. He went to the hospital in Kalispell to treat his wounded arm, the records say, and first spoke to the ranger who responded to the incident there.\nSheehy said in his 2015 statement that a weapon kept in the vehicle for bear protection had been improperly placed and fell out when he was reloading his SUV. 'My deepest apologies for any inconvenience this incident caused,' Sheehy said in the statement.\nIn The Post story published this month, however, Sheehy says that his gunshot wound that day was old, not fresh, and that he sought medical attention because he fell during a hike and feared he had dislodged a bullet in his arm from Afghanistan that he had never reported to his superiors, for fear of sparking an investigation into its origins. Sheehy said he believed the bullet may have been the result of a friendly fire ricochet during a nighttime firefight in April or May of 2012.\nAdvertisement\nSheehy also told The Post said that hospital staff told him they were required to report the gunshot wound to authorities and so he decided to lie — first to hospital staff and then to the ranger — to ensure the story of his older wound wouldn't trigger a military investigation that could harm his former platoonmates' careers, according to his campaign and an attorney representing him.\n'I guess the only thing I'm guilty of is admitting to doing something I never did,' Sheehy said of paying a $525 fine for illegally discharging his weapon in the national park. He now says the gun never went off.\nThe ranger's report says 'a park visitor called park dispatch' to report an accidental gun discharge at Logan Pass that day. The ranger was headed to Logan Pass to investigate the report from that unnamed visitor when park dispatch informed him that the person who fired the gun was at the Kalispell emergency room with a gunshot wound, the report said. The ranger drove there instead.\nwhen park dispatch informed him that the person who fired the gun was at the Kalispell emergency room with a gunshot wound, the report said. The ranger drove there instead.\nAdvertisement\nA lawyer for Sheehy, Daniel Watkins, called into question the existence of the park visitor, stating in a letter that the ranger never indicated that he interviewed that person as part of his report. Watkins posited that hospital staff, not a park visitor, notified park dispatch that Sheehy had shot himself at Logan Pass — after he lied to them — and that park dispatch later 'clarified' to the ranger that the person was already at the hospital.\nThe Park Service has not released a copy of the dispatch logs from that day. Many Park Service records are retained for only five years.\nHospital officials have declined to comment on the specific incident. A spokeswoman said the hospital follows Montana state law requiring them to report gunshot and stabbing victims to the police. The campaign said this month that Sheehy was attempting to obtain medical records from his ER visit that day. Asked last week about whether he had received his medical records, the campaign declined to comment and directed The Post to Sheehy's lawyer.\nThe campaign said this month that Sheehy was attempting to obtain medical records from his ER visit that day.

In his 2023 memoir, 'Mudslingers,' Sheehy wrote in one passage that he received multiple bullet wounds in Afghanistan. In another, he wrote that his body was hit by a bullet just once. In the book, he also offers varying accounts of how he was shot.\nAdvertisement\nIn one such account, Sheehy writes that he didn't report being struck by a ricochet bullet because it was caused by friendly fire and he didn't want the 'total stud' who shot him to get into trouble. He now says he does not know for sure if he was wounded by friendly or enemy fire, and that there was not one particular person he believed could have been responsible.\nSheehy was awarded a Bronze Star with 'V' for Valor and a Purple Heart for two separate incidents during his time serving as a SEAL in Afghanistan. The Purple Heart was awarded after he was knocked unconscious by an improvised explosive device blast, according to a local news report.\nA former teammate recalled Sheehy saying he was struck by a ricochet bullet while they were serving together in 2012. That person, who was interviewed at the request of the Sheehy campaign, spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is a military reservist and said he was not authorized to talk to the media. Other service members who served with Sheehy in Afghanistan either declined to comment or could not recall him discussing a gunshot wound.\nAdvertisement\nWatkins, Sheehy's lawyer, previously argued Sheehy could not have accidentally discharged the Colt .45 by dropping the gun in 2015 because 'doing so is not possible based on the design of the weapon's firing mechanism.'\nRick Vasquez, a firearms expert and former Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives official, said it would indeed be 'very unlikely' for that weapon to misfire when dropped as Sheehy told the ranger.\nSheehy has campaigned in part on his experience as a combat veteran, saying the Biden administration's chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 inspired him to run.\nSheehy was handpicked to run by Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), the National Republican Senatorial Committee chair who helped to effectively clear the primary field for the wealthy businessman and veteran who he believed was best positioned to defeat Tester. Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.) dropped out of the race in February following former president Donald Trump's endorsement of Sheehy.\nAdvertisement\nDaines and other prominent Montana Republicans defended Sheehy last week following the initial Post report.\nDaines said veterans in the state are 'outraged' by news coverage of the incident that he described as attacking an 'American hero.'\n'Tim Sheehy is only strengthening,' he said. 'The guy is a Purple Heart American war hero.'\nDaines said it was up to Sheehy whether he should release the medical records from the hospital.\n'That's his decision to sort that out,' Daines said of whether to release medical records.\nRep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.), who is also a former Navy SEAL and Sheehy supporter, noted that Sheehy already has a Purple Heart from a separate action in Afghanistan and that he believed veterans and service members would not have any concerns about the story. Zinke said it was Sheehy's decision whether to release his records from his ER visit.\n'I released my entire record and they were shocked on what an outstanding record looks like,' Zinke said of his 2014 House race, when he released military records after facing questions about his years serving in SEAL Team 6.\nWhile Daines and other Republicans backed Sheehy, some have said the story has exacerbated tensions among Rosendale supporters in the state who resented Rosendale's exit from the Senate race.\nRosendale lost to Tester in 2018 but nonetheless had a passionate following among some grass-roots conservatives in Montana.\n'There was a lot of hostility from Rosendale supporters toward Sheehy and these kinds of stories about Sheehy are not going to help heal that rift,' said Matthew Monforton, a former Republican member of the Montana state legislature who broke with the party and is now a libertarian. 'There's a real fear that Sheehy was not vetted well.'\nBrad Johnson, the former secretary of state of Montana and Sheehy challenger in the June Republican primary, slammed Sheehy in a statement provided to a local TV outlet. 'This is what you get when a couple of DC insiders like Mitch McConnell and Steve Daines anoint an unknown, untested and unvetted candidate and then dictate to Montana Republicans who their nominee to the United States Senate is going to be,' he said.",

            "summary": "For seven years, the killing of D.C. police Sgt. Tony Mason Jr. had been a mystery. Mason was sitting in his car in Baltimore while on a date when two men pulled up and fired at the off-duty officer — violence that investigators initially believed to be motivated by a domestic dispute.\nBut new details emerged in the case this week alleging that Mason was fatally shot after he had the misfortune of parking his black Nissan Versa in the middle of a drug gang turf. The 17-year-veteran of the police department, who was not armed or wearing any clothing that identified him as a police officer at the time, was mistakenly targeted by assailants who believed he was part of a rival crew, according to police and court documents.\nFresh developments in the cold case were revealed after Baltimore authorities announced a murder charge against Dion Thompson, a 24-year-old man in federal prison in New Jersey following his conviction for drug distribution.\nAdvertisement\n'For far too long, the details surrounding Sergeant Mason's tragic death have remained a painful mystery,' D.C. Police Chief Pamela A. Smith said Wednesday at a news conference in Baltimore, joining that city's police commissioner, state's attorney, federal authorities and others. 'While we cannot erase the pain of loss or the memories of that day, we can take solace in the fact that the person responsible is being brought to justice.'\nBaltimore State's Attorney Ivan J. Bates said Thompson will be prosecuted by his office's new cold case unit, which is devoting attorneys to help police solve old cases that produced few initial leads.\n'A cold case is still very much fresh in the hearts and minds of the victim's family,' Bates said. 'It is critically important that we utilize the latest investigative techniques and technology to put fresh eyes on once-forgotten crimes.'\nIn addition to first-degree murder, Bates said, Thompson has been charged with numerous other counts involving illegal firearms, conspiracy and assault. Prosecutors said they are working to get Thompson arraigned on the charges in Baltimore. It could not be determined if he has an attorney in the murder case.\nAdvertisement\nPolice said in the charging documents distributed by prosecutors that detectives found no evidence of domestic issues with either Mason or his girlfriend, and that neither had been involved in any criminal activity.\nEfforts to reach Mason's family after he died in 2017 and this week were not successful. The 40-year-old had worked in some of the District's highest-crime neighborhoods, and he lived in Baltimore, where in 2017 more than 300 people were killed in homicides.\nAfter his death, Mason's colleagues recalled an officer who mentored young colleagues, was the 'life of the party' at poker nights and made efforts to collect blankets for those in need. His onetime partner said he taught her the street lingo when they rode together in a drug unit in D.C., and how he saved her in 2008 when a man pulled a gun on her while they were undercover.\nAdvertisement\nAt the time he was killed, Mason had been on desk duty after being accused of pointing a gun at a subordinate.\nCourt documents describe Thompson as the leader of the Slickest Ones gang, whose territory Mason was in when he was fatally shot on Nov. 4, 2017.\nThe court documents say Mason and the woman he was with that night had been dating for about one month. He picked her up the night of Nov. 3 and went shopping at a Walmart just outside Baltimore, then went to a liquor store before returning to her home around 12:20 a.m. on Nov. 4. She unloaded the purchases, and he moved his car from the townhouse parking lot to Elgin Avenue on the city's west side near Mondawmin Mall. She then joined him in the vehicle, and they began listening to music and drinking.\nAt the same time, the court documents say, Thompson was visiting a residence on the same street. As he left, he spotted Mason's Nissan and got worried, the documents say. He called for two others in the residence to meet him with guns, the documents say.\nAdvertisement\nThe person who provided the tip that led to the arrest told detectives that Thompson thought the occupants of the Nissan were waiting 'either to rob him or retaliate against him for all the robberies he was committing.'\nThe court documents say Thompson and two other men got into a vehicle and pulled up next to the Nissan.\nOne man on the street yelled 'Yo' or 'Hey Ya'll' and, along with another man, started shooting with no warning, the documents said.\nMason was killed; the woman was struck in the leg and survived.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAfter the shooting, charging documents say, Thompson went to his brother to get additional bullets for his now-empty gun.

Brock has pleaded not guilty.\nAdvertisement\nPolice said Brock called 911 before noon to say he had shot someone at his South Charleston home, claiming Hall had tried to rob him. Investigators later said the driver was unaware of the scam call that Brock had received with threats and demands for money, citing an incarcerated relative.\nHall 'made no threats or assaults toward Mr. Brock, and made no demands, other than to ask about the package she was sent to retrieve through the Uber app,' the Clark County Sheriff's Office wrote in an April 11 release. The police agency said Brock 'produced a gun and held her at gunpoint, making demands for identities of the subjects he had spoken with on the phone.'\nPolice have said the Hall's Uber trip to pick up a package was ordered by the same person who made scam calls to Brock, or by an accomplice.

            "summary": "SYDNEY — A teenager has been accused of wounding a Christian bishop and priest during a church service in a second high-profile knife attack to rock Sydney in recent days that authorities on Tuesday declared an act of terrorism.\nThe 16-year-old was overpowered by the shocked congregation at Christ the Good Shepherd Church after he allegedly stabbed Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel and Fr. Isaac Royel during a service on Monday night that was being streamed online.\nPolice have not commented on reports that the boy's fingers were severed by parishioners in the Orthodox Assyrian church in suburban Wakeley, but confirmed his hand injuries were 'severe.'\nVideo of the attack spread quickly on social media and an angry mob converged on the church demanding vengeance. They hurled bricks and bottles at police, who temporarily barricaded the boy inside the church for his own safety.\nAdvertisement\nSeveral people including police officers required hospital treatment following the hourslong riot.\nPolice and community leaders said that public anxiety had been heightened by a lone assailant's knife attack in a Sydney shopping mall on Saturday that killed five women and a male security guard who attempted to intervene. The 40-year-old assailant Joel Cauchi had a history of mental illness. He was shot dead by police.\nNews South Wales Police Commissioner Karen Webb on Tuesday declared the church attack a terrorist incident, but not the shopping mall rampage.\nThe terrorism categorization allows more law enforcement resources to be focused on the crime. The declaration also gives police expanded powers to stop and search people, premises and vehicles without a warrant.\nWebb said the teen's comments and actions pointed to a religious motive for the attack. She didn't detail the wording of the comments that led her to believe he had been religiously motivated.\nAdvertisement\n'We believe there are elements that are satisfied in terms of religious-motivated extremism and of course the intimidation of the public through that person's acts, by attending that church, whilst it was being live-streamed, intimidating not only the parishioners in attendance but those parishioners who were watching online and subsequently, those people that turned up to the church on the outside and the subsequent riot that happened,' Webb said.\nThe Australian Security Intelligence Organization, the nation's main domestic spy agency, and Australian Federal Police have joined state police in a counterterrorism task force to investigate who else was potentially involved.\nASIO director-general Mike Burgess agreed with Webb that the mall attack was not terrorism.\nTo call it a terrorist attack, there must be 'information or evidence that suggests actually the motivation was religiously motivated or ideologically motivated,' Burgess said. 'In the case of Saturday, that was not the case. In this case, the information we and the police have before us ... would indicate strongly that that is the case and that's why it was called an act of terrorism.'\nAdvertisement\nA coronial inquest will investigate the circumstances of the six knife deaths in the mall attack and what policy changes could be made to prevent similar attacks from occurring in the future. The coroner will also consider whether security guards should be armed. Westfield Bondi Junction mall guards, including knife victim Faraz Tahir, do not carry guns.\nNew South Wales Premier Chris Minns said he was reviewing government restrictions on how security guards could be armed following the knife attack. But he has ruled out allowing them to carry guns, saying the fewer firearms in the community, the better.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nMass killings are relatively rare in Australia because assault rifle-style semi-automatic firearms are banned from public ownership under tough national gun laws.\nThe risk of a terrorist attack in Australia is rated as 'possible,' according to ASIO's tier system. That is the second-lowest level after 'not expected' on the five-tier National Terrorism Threat Advisory System. The threat was downgraded from middle-tier 'probable' in 2022 with the decline of the Islamic State group.\nAdvertisement\nWebb said the teen suspect in the church attack had been known to police, but had not been on a terror watch list. He had been convicted in January of a range of offenses including possession of a switchblade knife, being armed with a weapon with an intention to commit an indictable offence, stalking, intimidation and damaging property, Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported.\nA Sydney court released him on a good behavior bond, the ABC reported.\nThe boy used a switchblade, which is an illegal weapon in Australia, in Monday's attack, the ABC reported.\nJuvenile offenders cannot be publicly identified in New South Wales.\nThe church in a message on social media said the bishop and priest were in stable condition and asked for people's prayers.\n'It is the bishop's and father's wishes that you also pray for the perpetrator,' the statement said.\nAdvertisement\nThe church said in a statement on Tuesday the 53-year-old Iraq-born bishop's condition was 'improving.'\nEmmanuel has a strong social media following and is outspoken on a range of issues. He proselytizes to both Jews and Muslims and is critical of liberal Christian denominations.\nHe also speaks out on global political issues and laments the plight of Palestinians in Gaza.\nThe bishop, described in local media as a figure sometimes seen as divisive on issues such as COVID-19 restrictions, was in the national news last year over comments about gender.\n__",

'Abusing that trust as the NRA did violates both the public interest and District law.'\nThe NRA did not acknowledge any wrongdoing in the settlement, and previously denied the lawsuit's claims in court filings.

'The NRA confronted this political attack — and emerges from this lawsuit strong, secure, and vindicated.'\nAdvertisement\nThe conclusion of the two cases caps one of the most tumultuous chapters in the history of the nation's largest gun group. Since 2019, political infighting and accusations of lavish spending have tarnished the NRA's reputation and drained its coffers. Fundraising has plunged, while legal fees soared, leaving the gun lobby poorly positioned to influence the high-stakes 2024 election.\nUnder the District's laws, prosecutors can't collect financial penalties from wayward nonprofits.

Greene had fallen out of favor with the far-right House Freedom Caucus and doesn't have many allies.

Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has upended that.\nRep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has upended that.\nAt Tuesday morning's closed-door Republican conference meeting, Massie announced that he had signed on to Greene's motion to vacate Johnson as House speaker after Johnson proposed funding aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan with no border-security provisions.\nThat turned heads for multiple reasons.\nMassie moved the needle\nRepublicans are now taking Greene's effort seriously.\nOn the one hand, Massie's support moves Greene one vote closer to being able to vacate Johnson. She now only needs one more vote in their narrow two-seat majority unless Democrats come to his rescue. (They have said they will if Johnson puts a bill similar to the Senate-passed bill with funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan on the floor for a vote.)\nAdvertisement\nBut Massie's support is significant in another way, too.\nRepublicans mostly dismissed the motion to vacate because Trump, who is worried about GOP chaos six months before the election, stood with Johnson at Mar-a-Lago last week and said he supports the speaker.\nRepublicans were skeptical that Greene would cross Trump — and Republicans frustrated with Johnson didn't want to cross Trump, either.\nMassie is, in some ways, immune to pressure from Trump. He's not particularly close with him. He cares little about what Trump thinks and the former president doesn't influence his actions or his votes. So a call from Trump would probably do little to dissuade him from voting to oust Johnson.\nFull circle\nAs recently as last Congress, both Massie and Greene were outsiders looking in.\nMassie, a libertarian who opposes nearly all government spending bills , is one of only a handful of Republicans who joined no conference or faction. He was a happy lone warrior warning his colleagues about the rising debt.

He successfully brought both of them into the fold, giving Massie a spot on the Rules Committee, a position of leadership allies, and using Greene as an informal adviser. His actions turned them into team players who defended McCarthy during his ouster.\nJohnson, however, has failed to build a strong relationship with them. And now they could lead his political demise.\nMassie says the motion to vacate 'will happen' and has predicted that more than eight Republicans will support it, which would make it more popular than the effort by Rep.

I think it's dead wrong. It's not what motion to vacate was designed for,' Rep. Dan Meuser (R-Pa.) said.

            "summary": "Earlier this week, I was asked a question for which I didn't know the answer: What could President Biden do to firm up his support among younger voters?\nRecent polling has shown that Biden is performing more poorly than expected with Americans under 30, though, as I've written, that varies depending on the poll and whether it screens for the likelihood that the respondents will vote.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nConsider, for example, new polling from the Harvard Institute of Politics that considers only the views of adults 18-29. Overall, Biden leads former president Donald Trump by eight points, 45 percent to 37 percent. Among registered voters, though, he's up 13 points — 50 percent to 37 percent. And among those who say they're most likely to vote, he's up 19 points. Biden has 56 percent of support and Trump, again, 37 percent.\nThat Trump doesn't gain ground as the pool of respondents is narrowed is important. It suggests that indifference to the candidates and voter apathy are linked — and that there's potentially an opportunity for Biden if his campaign can compel more young Americans to vote.\nAdvertisement\nThis comes back to the initial question: What's the pitch?\nRecent YouGov polling conducted for the Economist included a battery of issues on which respondents were asked to offer their opinions. This allows us to see where Americans stand on the election and also how younger (those under 30) voters differ from older ones.\nWhat we find is that there are only a handful of issues to which younger voters ascribe more importance than older ones, whether we're considering issues respondents identify as the most important (red, below), very important (purple) or at least somewhat important (orange). Younger Americans are more likely to point to jobs and abortion as the most important issue to them, but the gap between younger voters and voters overall is wider when describing climate change or civil rights as very important issues.\nThe issue that scored the highest in importance to younger Americans? Inflation, same as everyone else.\nThat holds in the Harvard Youth Poll as well. Its methodology was different, presenting respondents with two options from a lengthy list and asking them to identify which was more important. The issue that was most commonly selected as most important relative to alternatives was, once again, inflation.\nBy virtue of focusing on younger respondents, the Harvard poll allows a breakdown by gender. You can see that, on several issues, there's a substantial difference in the views of young men and women, like reproductive rights. The three issues on which there's the widest difference by gender are three of the most commonly associated with liberal politics: reproductive rights, climate change and gun violence. Young women were at least 10 points more likely to identify those issues as important than were young men.\nA key finding in the Harvard poll centers on the divide by gender. Support for Biden is higher among likely voters than among young people overall — but among young men who are likely to vote his advantage is only six points compared with a 33-point advantage with young women who are likely to vote.\nSince 2020, the Harvard Youth Poll has seen the partisan advantage for Democrats evaporate among young men. In 2020, men and women were about 20 points more likely to identify as Democrats than as Republicans. Now, women are 26 points more likely to, while among men, there's virtually no difference.\n(It's worth noting that Gallup polling of partisan identity shows a rightward shift among young voters that comports with the data above.)\nAdvertisement\nOn the issue importance question, the views of young women correlate strongly to the views of young Democrats. The views of young men correlate slightly less strongly to the views of young Republicans.\nThe question of how Biden appeals to these voters, though, remains unanswered. He's put a big focus on student loan relief, as you're probably aware, and it's the issue on which Harvard found the highest level of approval for Biden from younger Americans. It is also the issue that was least likely to be identified as important in Harvard's battery. On inflation and gun violence, issues seen as more important, his approval rating was around 25 percent. On the issue of Israel — which was also surprisingly low on the importance list — his approval was under 20 percent.\nYouGov found that younger Americans were more critical of Biden across the board than Americans overall, including on education and civil rights, issues that they were more likely to identify as important.\nThe situation, then, is that the issues important to young people and those important to Americans overall don't differ that much as Biden's party has lost ground with young men. (A plurality of young men in the poll identified as independent.) Analysis from Pew Research Center found that voters under 30 backed Biden by a 26-point margin in 2020, down from the 30-point margin Hillary Clinton enjoyed four years before. If the margin had instead matched that seen in this poll — 19 points — it would have meant a shift of more than 4 million votes from Biden to Trump.",

The gold was melted down and used to purchase illegal firearms, police said.\nThose charged include an Air Canada warehouse employee and a former Air Canada manager who gave police a tour of cargo of the facility after the theft. A jewelry store owner is also charged.\n'This story is a sensational one and which probably, we jokingly say, belongs in a Netflix series,' Peel Regional Chief Nishan Duraiappah said.\nPeel Regional Detective Sgt. Mike Mavity said the gold bars, weighing 419 kilograms (923 pounds), and foreign currency, ordered from a refinery in Zurich, Switzerland, were transported in the haul of an Air Canada flight on April 17 last year.\nAdvertisement\nHe said that late afternoon a truck driver arrived at the airline's cargo warehouse with a fraudulent bill that was provided to an airline warehouse attendant.\nMavity said a bill for seafood that was picked up the day before was used to pick up the gold.

He said that manager left his job last summer and said they have an idea of where he is.\nMavity said some of the suspects were known to police and some were not. He said they seized six crudely made bracelets made of gold.\nAdvertisement\n'I don't think I ever imagined they would have to deal with the largest gold heist in Canadian history,' said Patrick Brown, the mayor of Brampton, Ontario.

Mavity said they have been released on bail conditions and will be in court at a later date.\nMavity said the truck driver that allegedly picked up the gold, Durante King-Mclean, a 25-year-old from Brampton, is currently in custody in the U.S. on firearms and trafficking related charges.\nPolice are searching for former Air Canada manager Simran Preet Panesar, 31, from Brampton as well as Archit Grover, 36, from Brampton and Arsalan Chaudhary, 42, from Mississauga Ontario.\nAdvertisement\nPeel Regional Deputy Chief Nick Milinovich said only CA$90,000 ($65,000) of the more than CA$20 million has been recovered.\nU.S. ATF Special Agent, Eric DeGree, said King-Mclean, was arrested in Pennsylvania after a traffic stop and that led to the seizure of 65 illegal firearms that were allegedly destined to be smuggled into Canada. DeGree said he tried to flee after police discovered the firearms in his rental car.\nBrinks, an American cash handling company, arrived at the airport cargo facility the night of April 17 to pick up the gold and were told the gold and currency was missing after a search.\nBrinks sued Air Canada over the theft last year. According to the company's filing last year, a thief walked away with the costly cargo after presenting a fake document at an Air Canada warehouse on April 17.\nAdvertisement\nIn a Nov. 8 statement of defense, Air Canada rejected 'each and every allegation' in the Brink's lawsuit, saying it fulfilled its carriage contracts and denying any improper or 'careless' conduct.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe country's largest airline also said Brink's failed to note the value of the haul on the waybill — a document typically issued by a carrier with details of the shipment — and that if Brink's did suffer losses, a multilateral treaty known as the Montreal Convention would cap Air Canada's liability.\nIn Federal Court filings that claim breach of contract and millions of dollars in damages, Brinks said an 'unidentified individual' gained access to the airline's cargo warehouse and presented a 'fraudulent' waybill shortly after an Air Canada flight from Zurich landed at Pearson.\nThe statement of the claim says the staff then handed over 400 kilograms of gold in the form of 24 bars plus nearly $2 million in cash to the thief, who promptly 'absconded with the cargo.'\nAdvertisement\nDeGree said dozens of firearms were seized, including two fully automatic weapons and five guns that were untraceable.\n'I'm proud to say that we successfully put an international gun trafficking operation out of business. We kept 65 firearms off the streets of Canada and prevented them from being used in any number of crimes,' DeGree said.",

            "summary": "A Maryland teenager was charged with threatening mass violence after investigators in Montgomery County found a 129-page 'memoir' the 18-year-old had written that described shooting up a high school and elementary school, according to court documents filed Thursday.\nAlex Ye, of Rockville, was charged with a single count of threat of mass violence, a Maryland law that makes it illegal to 'knowingly threaten' to carry out an act that would place people at substantial risk of death or serous physical injury.\nThe recently discovered document told the story of a character named 'James Wang.' Ye had described the work, told in the first-person from Wang's perspective, as fictional but an acquaintance of Ye's told detectives the character bore 'striking similarities' to Ye.\n'As I walk through the hallways, I cherry pick the classrooms that are the easiest targets,' Ye had written, according to the filings, adding one page later: 'I have also considered shooting up my former elementary school because little kids make easier targets.'\nAdvertisement\nHe was arrested on Wednesday, according to court records, and was being held at the Montgomery County Detention Center without bond.\nYe had attended Wootton High School in Rockville, according to court filings, though it wasn't immediately clear when he was last a student there. Ye appears to have spent much of the last 15 months hospitalized under psychiatric care, according to charging documents, most recently over the last several weeks. There is no indication from the filings that Ye had any firearms or specific plans to obtain any. Court records do state that Ye purchased a BB gun online without his parents' knowledge. The records indicated he was considering it to commit 'suicide by cop,' a term that describes a person who points a weapon at police officers because they want to be shot.\nThe charge against Ye specifically stated that Wootton was the target of his threat, and police had recently increased their presence outside the building as a deterrent.\nAdvertisement\nAn attorney listed in court records for Ye could not immediately be reached.

The counselor told investigators that 'Ye would express violent thoughts such as shooting up the school, wanting to hurt other people and would smile while saying it.'\nIn their court filings investigators also cited what they said were social media messages written by Ye, who was charged under his birth name, saying he felt it would be fun to shoot people. Ye's recent internet searches, the court records allege, stated 'gun range near me' and 'I do recognize that my plan is fully ethical. It's selfish and evil.'\nAdvertisement\nShiera Goff, a Montgomery County police spokeswoman, said the department deeply appreciates assistance it received in the case.\n'This could have been something that was potentially catastrophic had people not come forward with information,' she said.\nThe department is expected to announce more information on the case soon.\nOn Thursday morning, a spokesperson for the Montgomery County public school system did not immediately provide comment.\nThe filings describe Ye's past mental health struggles.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAround late December, 2022 and early January, 2023, a Wootton High School therapist referred Ye to the Montgomery County Crisis Center, according to the court records.

The person alerted authorities to the teen's writings, which were labeled a fictional account by their author, according to court records. But investigators wrote that they believed the document was based on the teen's life, not entirely fictional.\nThe writings, which the teen called a memoir, spanned 129 pages and included an account of a character who plans a school shooting but ultimately is taken into law enforcement custody and then receives psychiatric treatment, according to police.\nAdvertisement\nBut the document opened with a disclaimer calling it a work of fiction, according to court papers.\nPolice later obtained a search warrant and uncovered 'internet searches, drawings and documents related to threats of mass violence,' officials said. Some recent searches included queries about gun ranges, prison sentences and a long list of past school shootings, according to court documents.\nSocial media messages and posts by the teen also reference a desire to become famous by committing a school shooting, police wrote in charging documents.\nMontgomery County Public Schools officials said in a statement that the student was completing schoolwork through a virtual learning program. They said the student 'has not physically attended an MCPS school since the fall of 2022.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nSchools officials called the charges 'extremely serious.'

            "summary": "A 15-year-old girl was fatally shot Sunday night when someone in a vehicle opened fire on a group of people outside an apartment building in Southeast Washington, according to D.C. police.\nAuthorities said the girl, Niomi Russell, ran inside the building at the Forest Ridge Vistas complex and was found dead in a hallway. Police said she lived in Northwest Washington.\nThe shooting occurred about 10:45 p.m. in the 2400 block of Elvans Road SE, near the old Barry Farm area off Suitland Parkway. Police said they were looking for a silver SUV with a black top.\nIn a statement, police said officers in the area heard gunshots and rushed to the scene. Police said they learned Niomi was in a group of people; authorities did not say whether anyone was targeted. A D.C. police report lists 'multiple firearms' being used, among them a handgun.\nAdvertisement\nNiomi was the fourth person under 18 to be fatally shot in D.C. this year. A 17-year-old was killed in February and two 14-year-olds were fatally shot in separate attacks on April 3 and April 4. Police arrested a 16-year-old in the killing of one of the 14-year-olds, who was shot on the platform of the Brookland-CUA Metro station in Northeast. They also arrested a man in the fatal shooting of the 17-year-old killed in Northwest.\nD.C. ended 2023 with 274 killings, the highest yearly tally in more than a quarter-century, which put debate over crime and public safety, particularly involving juveniles, at the forefront of the District's political discussions. The D.C. Council has enacted new measures with stiffer penalties for gun crimes, while other provisions have walked back some progressive changes that had previously been enacted.\nThe 48 homicides recorded in D.C. through Sunday represent a 25 percent drop over this time last year, police statistics show. Violent crime is down 22 percent over that same period. Nineteen teenagers and children were killed in all of 2023, including 16 from gunfire.",

Police arrested the shooting suspect the next day. He was 15 years old.' That was the beginning of a 2016 column I wrote describing this city's grim juvenile crime picture as it existed eight years ago.\nThe column noted that between Jan. 1 and Aug. 16, 2016, more than 2,000 juveniles had been arrested in the District. Nothing much has changed since.\nIn the intervening eight years, this business of D.C. youth robbing, stealing, shooting and stabbing one another has gone on unabated, notwithstanding the anti-crime posturing of elected leaders with six-figure salaries luxuriating in their cushy, well-guarded John A. Wilson Building.\nAdvertisement\nD.C. police continued to average annually more than 2,000 arrests of those under 18. There have been 29 juvenile carjacking arrests thus far in 2024 — there were 13 at this point last year — and 16 juveniles have been shot since Jan. 1.\nYoung people breaking laws in the District is so commonplace that most instances get little media coverage. Oh, you may hear about sensational crimes, such as the alleged beating death of a disabled man by three girls — two of them 13, the other 12. But many violations don't make the news.\nConsider the dated police announcements thus far in April. It's a long list:\nApril 2: Two males, 14 and 15, arrested and charged in a March 30 robbery.\nApril 3: 15-year-old arrested and charged with armed robbery with a handgun.\nFollow this author Colbert I. King 's opinions\nFollow this author\nColbert I. King\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nApril 4: 14-year-old male found with gunshot wounds on April 3. He died at the scene.\nAdvertisement\nApril 5: 14-year-old male found with gunshot wounds on April 4. He also died at the scene.\n(Yes, back to back.)\nApril 5: 14-year-old male arrested on April 3 for car theft on Just Street NE; 16-year-old male arrested for unauthorized use of a vehicle on Minnesota Ave. NE.\nApril 8: 14-year-old male arrested in a burglary committed on April 5 and a robbery committed on March 22.\nApril 8: Two 14-year-old males arrested — one charged with unlawful discharge of a firearm, the other with possession of an unregistered firearm — on April 7. One was also charged in a robbery committed on Feb. 27.\nApril 8: 16-year-old male turned himself in and was charged with assault with a dangerous weapon (gun) on April 5.\nApril 9: 16-year-old male arrested and charged with second-degree murder while armed in the death of the 14-year-old youth on April 4 (see above).\nAdvertisement\nApril 10: 16-year-old male arrested and charged with armed robbery committed on March 17.\nApril 11: Two 16-year-old males arrested on April 9 and charged with an outstanding failure-to-appear warrant, carrying a pistol without a license, and possession of unregistered firearms and ammunition. One was also charged with unlawful possession of a machine gun.\nApril 11: 16-year-old male, 15-year-old female and 14-year-old female arrested and charged with robbery.\nApril 12: Three male youths — two 14, one 13 — arrested and charged in an armed carjacking committed on April 11.\nApril 14: 15-year-old arrested and charged in a robbery allegedly committed with a 23-year-old male on April 12.\nApril 15: Police disclose the identity of a 15-year-old female who was found fatally shot on April 14.\nApril 15: Two male youths — 13 and 14 — arrested and charged in a robbery committed on April 13.\nAdvertisement\nAnd that's just half of this month.\nThis litany of youth crime hardly makes the news.\nFamilies, friends and neighbors mourn the loss of young homicide victims. And those robbed of their cars, purses and wallets, or who have been punched and kicked for their worldly belongings, know all too well what those hellish moments are like. But rampant youth crime is reduced to snippets that appear and fade like raindrops.\nSo, too, this commentary — which, if I don't stop, will morph into another recital of the problem of young people leaving school and entering the criminal justice system, or the 'school-to-prison pipeline.' No, this is not another discourse on the need for early intervention in the lives of 'at-risk' youth to prevent them from falling into the kind of behavior that lands them in the hands of police and judges. No pleas today to get at the 'root causes' of children getting in trouble with the law.\nAdvertisement\nOne of my many critics accused me this week of having spent years tiresomely saying the same things over and over about D.C. youth and the justice system. To which I plead guilty. No repeat performance today.\nInstead, let's look at a condition that all arrested young D.C. girls and boys have in common: Each has a father.\nWhat of fathers? The father of the 15-year-old who shot that man in the face in the McDonald's at Verizon Center eight years ago. The father of the 16-year-old charged with armed robbery. The fathers of the girls charged with beating that disabled man to death.\nWhat about the fathers?\nDon't deflect that question to a rant against wealth inequality and the unfairness of an economic and social system that marginalizes and criminalizes Black men. Wealth inequality exists. Racially prejudiced, callous and deceitful White people are as plentiful as the air we breathe. They can't defeat or stand in the way of men who want to act as fathers. Net worth doesn't make good fathers.\nFathers are pillars.\nReturn to the litany of youth crimes. What's with the father?",

            "summary": "During a visit to a small convenience store in Upper Manhattan on Tuesday, Donald Trump distilled his party's approach to crime — and, really, everything else.\nTrump had come directly from the courthouse where, for the second day in a row, he observed as prospective jurors were questioned for the trial in which he stands accused of falsifying business records, part of an effort before the 2016 election to hide an alleged sexual encounter with an adult-film actress. The stop at the bodega was meant to draw a contrast between how Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg handled a killing that occurred at the store in 2022 — charges were eventually dropped against a clerk who argued he was acting in self-defense — and Trump's situation.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\n'Everything is screwed up in New York, and the whole world is watching,' Trump insisted while speaking to reporters. In his case, he added, 'there's no crime. You know where the crime is? In the bodegas, where they come and rob them every week.' As is his recent habit, he included a separate excoriation of recently arrived immigrants, who, he insisted, were taking all the jobs and who were 'prisoners and people from mental institutions, largely.'\nAdvertisement\nViewed through a sympathetic lens, you see what Trump is arguing: They're coming after me when there's real crime out there? Step back one degree from that sympathetic view, though, and you come to a more useful position: Rather than being assessed on a sliding scale, crimes should generally be subject to accountability.\nFor years, Trump has offered his base a bifurcated view of law enforcement. Local police are lionized, both as a statement of allegiance and as the thin blue line keeping America safe from salivating hordes of leftist rioters, urban criminals and immigrant savages. Federal law enforcement, though, is suspect and corrupt, a position intertwined with long-standing investigations into Trump at the federal level. With his indictments at the local level in Georgia and Manhattan, Trump simply tied the local district attorneys back to his federal political opponents. ('By the way, this trial that I have now?' he said at the bodega. 'That's a Biden trial.')\nAt the moment, though, this divergent view of crime — Trump and his allies are innocent political targets while liberal prosecutors let other criminals slide — is more distant from reality than usual.\nAdvertisement\nCrime, by most available metrics, is down in recent years. That includes homicides, which, as the Wall Street Journal reported this week, have dropped sharply in several cities. In New York City, violent crime is down 3 percent year-to-date. Grand larceny is similarly down 3 percent, though the number of robberies is up 4 percent.\nBut it is an election year, so, as was the case in 2020 and 2022, warnings from Trump and his allies about criminal activity are omnipresent and breathless.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'The next six months is going to be intense,' Kari Lake, a Republican candidate for Senate in Arizona, said at a rally over the weekend, as the New York Times reported. She told listeners to get ready: 'We are going to put on the armor of God. And maybe strap on a Glock on the side of us just in case.'\nThe New York Post — a perpetual engine of fearmongering about crime — reported that 'Californians are buying up guns after Border Patrol starts dumping thousands of migrants on streets.' In March, there were about 131,000 background checks conducted in California, a process that generally precedes a gun sale. Last March there were 128,000; the March before that, 129,000. In March 2021, there were 144,000.\nAdvertisement\nNone of this is to say that violent crimes don't occur; they do. It is, instead, to point out that heightened rhetoric about the dangers of crime doesn't comport with the reality of trends in crime data.\nThis rhetoric sits alongside a willingness to give Trump and his allies a pass. Polling from the Associated Press, conducted by NORC this month, shows that only a small fraction of Republicans think Trump did anything illegal concerning the four indictments he faces. Only 6 percent of Republicans think he did anything illegal in the New York case.\nThis idea that Trump is being unfairly targeted for scrutiny and sanction — an idea Trump has relentlessly promoted for obvious reasons — extends to his allies. On Tuesday night, Newsmax host Greg Kelly (son of the former commissioner of the New York Police Department) encouraged viewers to write to former Trump adviser Peter Navarro, imprisoned in Florida.\nLet's all WRITE Peter Navarro. He's in JAIL and that's a TOTAL CRIME. Send him a note! (Message: We Care!) PS: No contraband. pic.twitter.com/QSPjxcAAXK\n— Greg Kelly (@gregkellyusa) April 17, 2024\n'He's in JAIL and that's a TOTAL CRIME,' Kelly wrote on social media on Wednesday morning. The reality is that Navarro ignored a congressional subpoena and was found guilty of contempt of Congress.\nAdvertisement\nBut Navarro was just stonewalling the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, hardly something a Trump supporter is going to be overly worried about. Likewise the actions of Trump: Oh, he tried to block Joe Biden's presidency? Why not focus on the real criminals?\nreal criminals?\nIt's all about how the criminal actions are perceived. Trump keeping classified documents gets a shrug, but the specter of tattooed immigrants lying in wait in the dingy streets of New York is indelible. That the former happened and the latter is wildly overheated is neither here nor there. They are the bad guys, not us. They deserve to be cracked down on, to be constrained or punished. Not us. They are the ones we should be worried about.\nThey are the bad guys, not us. They deserve to be cracked down on, to be constrained or punished. Not us.

            "summary": "LITTLETON, Colo. — EDITOR'S NOTE — On April 20, 1999, two teenage boys dressed in black trench coats went on a killing rampage at Columbine High School in suburban Denver. They shot and killed 12 classmates and a teacher and wounded two dozen others before taking their own lives.\nTwenty-five years later, The Associated Press is republishing this story about the attack, the product of reporting from more than a dozen AP journalists who conducted interviews in the hours after it happened. The article first appeared on April 22, 1999.\n___\nA moment of surprise, then hours of terror\nBy TED ANTHONY\nAP National Writer\nLITTLETON, Colo. — Her favorite lunchtime meal was ready — 'my only meal,' jokes Sarah DeBoer. So, nachos in hand, she headed toward the commons area of the Columbine High School cafeteria.\nAdvertisement\nIt was a sunny Tuesday morning, maybe 60 degrees, only 17 school days before graduation, and a spring mentality was afoot — the kind that says summer is on the horizon.\nOutside, two disaffected young men knew something their classmates didn't. Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris had endgame in mind.\nMs. DeBoer, who knew the pair in passing, had talked to them Friday. True, they liked to bluster about guns and vengeance and Adolf Hitler. But they seemed — for them, at least — fine.\nUpstairs in the school library, four dozen students were studying their way through the lunch period.\nDown the hall, Dave Sanders, a popular instructor and coach, was teaching a science class. Nearby, Stephanie Williams, 16, a junior, was in the choir room singing.\nThen, at about 11:15 a.m., a sound from outside: pop-pop-pop-BANG.\nAdvertisement\nIn the cafeteria, they thought it was a lunchtime prank. Whatever it was, it was getting closer.\nSarah DeBoer, a 16-year-old sophomore, hit the floor with her lunch companions. As realization washed over her, she uttered one thing. Whether it was aloud or just to herself, she doesn't quite remember.\n'I think that I'm going to die.'\n___\nIn moments of chaos and hours of confusion, memories can cloud. But, through myriad interviews and briefings, an intelligible if still imprecise portrait emerges of what unfolded behind a suburban school's pale brown walls.\nJust after lunch period begins, two young men in black trench coats open fire in the parking lot. Senior Wade Frank, 18, outside in the parking lot next to a picnic area, hears popping sounds and sees a girl lying against a curb, shot in the leg. As he watches, another youth is shot in the back and falls forward.\nAdvertisement\nThen one gunman throws a bomb into the parking lot and heads inside.\n'He was just casually walking. He wasn't in any hurry,' says Frank.\nSophomore Denny Rowe, 15, is outside having lunch with friends. 'These guys opened fire on everything that looked human,' says Rowe. Bullets are bouncing everywhere.\n'One boy was running and suddenly his ankle just puffed up in blood,' says sophomore Don Arnold, 16. 'A girl was running and her head popped open.'\nAs the gunmen walk into the school, two students lie dead outside. Still shooting, the two walk to the cafeteria, where food server Karen Nielsen hears someone yell, 'Get down!'\nKlebold, 17, and Harris, 18, are heavily armed — an assault rifle, sawed-off shotguns, handguns. In the cafeteria, one removes his trench coat to reveal home-made grenades. He tosses a pipe bomb.\nAdvertisement\nGunshots echo. Students fall. One gets up to run and others follow.\nWord spreads: The 'Trenchcoat Mafia' has gone nuts. Many of the 900 students in the building duck into closets and bathrooms, under tables and chairs. A couple call 911 with cellular phones. Dozens flee the building and hide in brush around the school.\nSenior Nick Foss, 18, and a friend push two teachers, a cook and another woman into a bathroom. 'I heard people praying for their husbands and their children,' says Foss. The attackers bang on doors, yelling: 'We know you're in there.'\nCasey Brackley, 15, is in the gym when an administrator herds kids into the equipment room.\n'I hit my knees and prayed,' Ms. Brackley says. They stay for 15 minutes before the administrator directs them outside.\nNeil Gardner, the Jefferson County sheriff's deputy assigned to the school full-time, hears shots and spots one of the gunmen in a first-floor hallway. He radios for backup and returns fire as bullets ricochet off lockers. Within minutes, seven officers arrive and begin pulling students, including a few shooting victims, from the building.\nAdvertisement\nIn the choir room, above the commons, Stephanie Williams and her classmates hear the sounds.\nSomeone comes to the door and, with a thumb-forefinger gesture, gives them a warning: gun.\nHer teacher tells everyone to sit. But in moments, the school's two-level auditorium next door seems a safer place, so some go; then, after about 10 minutes, they run into the main hall.\n'The group I was in headed straight for the door. He was shooting at us,' Stephanie says. 'All we knew was to run.'\nAs they flee, a door behind them explodes in gunfire.\nSarah DeBoer, separated from her friend who had run into the weight room, lies on the cafeteria floor until she hears a car explode outside. Then she runs into the auditorium and lies down between seats.\nThere she stays for some time. Fellow students — 15, maybe 20 — cry softly. Teachers warn them to be silent. In the distance, they hear sharp reports and dull explosions. Finally, a janitor enters and tells them: Go!\nAdvertisement\nThey run, and gunfire follows.\n'I turned, and I saw Dylan was the one who turned and shot at me,' Sarah says. 'He didn't know it was me; we were just running out of the auditorium.'\nThe gunmen head upstairs toward the library.\n___\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'All jocks stand up! We're going to kill every one of you,' one gunman yells in the library.\nStudent Aaron Cohn, a ballplayer, is spared because a girl leaps onto his back while he lies on the floor, covering the baseball slogan on his shirt.\n'They were laughing after they shot,' Cohn says. 'It was like they were having the time of their life.'\nSome students are slain at their desks, one with pencil still in hand. The gunmen play 'peek-a-boo' with others, finding them cowering under desks and opening fire. Isaiah Shoels, who is black and has tangled with the gunmen before, is one of those to fall.\nAdvertisement\nSays one assailant: 'Oh, my God. Look at this black kid's brain. Awesome, man!'\nSome kids play dead. By the time it is over, 12 aren't playing.\nKlebold and Harris leave behind shattered windows, bloody floors and a quiet unlike any the library has ever heard. Elsewhere upstairs, Sanders, the teacher, has been shot twice in the chest but manages to get students down a hallway away from danger. He stumbles into a science room, bleeding and coughing blood.\nOutside, the first SWAT team is on the scene 20 minutes after the first 911 calls, joining the sheriff's deputies. It finds several explosive devices around the school and treads cautiously.\n'We had initial people there right away, but we couldn't get in,' Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone says. 'We were way outgunned.'\nAbout 45 minutes after the shooting begins, at noon, ambulances take the first wounded students — the ones who managed to run outside — to hospitals. Bomb teams, firetrucks, more SWAT units and paramedics arrive.\nAdvertisement\nNick Foss and other students manage to crawl into a space between the ceiling and acoustic tiles. Foss falls through a tile, crashing onto the floor of the teacher's lounge. He runs.\nKammi Vest, 18, hides in the choir-room closet with up to 60 other students. Others try to crawl through heating vents to safety.\nIn the science room, Dave Sanders is dying. Students cover the 47-year-old teacher with their shirts and a blanket and keep him talking. But his pulse slows, and he grows cold.\nShots are heard until almost 12:30. About that time, in the library, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris turn their guns on themselves, though no one will be sure of this for hours.\nAs 12:30 passes, after no shots echo for several minutes, SWAT teams begin sweeping the building room by room. It is, quite literally, a minefield: Dropped backpacks are everywhere, each a potential bomb. In the coming days, bombs will turn up in various shapes and sizes. They include two 35-pound propane bombs hidden in the school's kitchen.\nAt about 2:30, SWAT teams begin freeing those in hiding. In small groups, hands behind their heads, they run from the school to a holding area. They are frisked, questioned, offered medical care and bused to Leawood Elementary School to be reunited with parents.\nBy now, the world is seeing it all on TV. Escaped students cling to each other. Tears flow freely for some; for others, it will take time. Even the tough guys, the ones with the backward baseball caps and the baggy camo pants, cry.\nAt 4:30, with the gunmen's bodies found, authorities declare the school under control. In goes Dr. Chris Colwell, summoned for a medical synopsis. In the sun-dappled, silent library is the worst sight he has ever seen.\n'You walk in there with that hope that there might be somebody who's still alive and still salvageable,' Colwell says. 'It didn't take long to see that wasn't the case.'\nHe pronounces them all dead — 10 students and two alienated schoolmates who let their anger consume them.\nThe bodies will stay there for an entire day, until the known bombs are cleared.\n___\nBy the following afternoon, nearby Clement Park has become a place of mourning. Students and teachers and gawkers, they come to commiserate, to speak of faith and perseverance, to see the spectacle and talk to the press.\nAmong the pilgrims: Sarah DeBoer, wearing her Columbine football jersey, and Stephanie Williams, accompanied by a friend to comfort her. They stand together, yards from the scene of their lives' greatest terror, and they try to process the scenes running through their mind.\n'Yesterday I was so scared,' Ms. DeBoer says, her voice falling.",

            "summary": "MEXICO CITY — A mayoral candidate in a northern Mexico border state was killed on Friday, the 16th political hopeful slain ahead of the June 2 national elections that are shaping up to be the country's most violent on record.\nNoé Ramos Ferretiz was a candidate of the coalition between the opposition National Action Party and Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which governed Mexico until 2000. He was running for reelection as mayor of the city Ciudad Mante.\nProsecutors in the northern border state of Tamaulipas said he was attacked on Friday, but did not give details beyond saying they're investigating.\nLocal media reported he had been stabbed and posted photos showing a bloodied body lying on a sidewalk. Tamaulipas has long been riven by drug cartel turf wars. Ciudad Mante is located in the southern part of the state, relatively far from border cities like Reynosa and Matamoros.\nAdvertisement\n'We will not allow violence to decide these elections,' PRI party leader Alejandro Moreno wrote on social media following the news of Ramos' killing.\nThe killing was the latest in the increasingly bloody runup to Mexico's June elections. Ramos is at least the 16th candidate or aspirant killed since the start of 2024 — and expressions of regret have become routine.\nIn early April, mayoral candidate Bertha Gaytán was gunned down, hours after she requested protection and started campaigning. Gaytán was fatally shot on a street in a town outside the city of Celaya, in the north-central state of Guanajuato. She had just launched her campaign for Celaya mayor.\nMexico's drug cartels have often focused assassination attempts on mayors and mayoral candidates, in a bid to control local police or extort money from municipal governments.\nAdvertisement\nPresident Andrés Manuel López Obrador acknowledged in early April that drug cartels often seek to determine who will serve as mayor — either by running their own candidate or eliminating potential rivals.\n'They make an agreement and say, ‘this person is going to be mayor; we don't want anyone else to register to run,' and anybody who does, well, they know' what to expect, he said.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe recent slayings have prompted the government to provide bodyguards for about 250 candidates, but those running for municipal positions — while the most endangered — are the last in line for security.\nViolence against politicians is widespread in Mexico. In early April, the mayor of Churumuco, a town in the neighboring state of Michoacán, was shot to death at a taco restaurant in the state capital, Morelia.\nIn late February in another town in Michoacán, two mayoral hopefuls were shot to death within hours of each other.\n___",

            "summary": "The curse of writing about Las Vegas is that it's hard to avoid clichés about luck or chance or the roll of the dice. And the fact is, that's the provenance of tourists anyway; locals don't care much about such things. They know they live in a city built by mobsters to rip off rubes. If residents want to gamble — and most don't — they hit up the casinos off the Strip, where at least you don't have to pay to park. Those joints are the kinds of places you used to read about in noir novels, back when the edge of town was the open desert and those casinos were your last stop before the proverbial dark ride. These days, the edge of town means greenbelts and master-planned communities, places that even sound pleasant: Summerlin, Centennial Hills, Green Valley. It's hard to fear you're going to get whacked in view of a Pottery Barn.\nsound pleasant: Summerlin, Centennial Hills, Green Valley. It's hard to fear you're going to get whacked in view of a Pottery Barn.\nBut there's still a lingering touch of something insidious about the place, and Chris Bohjalian has a track record of making places come to full life in his novels. So when his latest, 'The Princess of Las Vegas,' starts with the co-owner of a fictional casino (the British-themed Buckingham Palace) catching one in the temple out in what used to be the middle of nowhere — Red Rock Canyon — but which is now just an Instagram post away, it's a bang-up way to get things going. That it's staged to look like a suicide is even more compelling. Surely this won't be a Las Vegas novel where everything hinges on antiquated notions about mystical odds, not with this kind of blackness.\nstarts with the co-owner of a fictional casino (the British-themed Buckingham Palace) catching one in the temple out in what used to be the middle of nowhere — Red Rock Canyon — but which is now just an Instagram post away, it's a bang-up way to get things going. That it's staged to look like a suicide is even more compelling. Surely this won't be a Las Vegas novel where everything hinges on antiquated notions about mystical odds, not with this kind of blackness.\nBut the next chapter begins with a single word: 'Luck.'\nAdvertisement\nThe word is our introduction to Crissy Dowling, a 35-year-old Princess Diana impersonator who performs a twice-nightly cabaret show based on Diana's life at Buckingham Palace. The show is replete with songs by Petula Clark, Dusty Springfield and Bonnie Tyler, but the overall effect is more like when 'Hal Holbrook did Mark Twain.' The show is called 'Diana, Candle in the Darkness,' which is both amusing and sad; if this is luck, good or bad, the whole notion needs to be reevaluated.\nCrissy lives in a suite at Buckingham Palace, has her own cabana and has been sleeping with a powerful senator, but she's also bulimic and pops pills like Skittles, and now her bosses at the Palace keep dying. First it was Richie Morley in the fake suicide and then, days later, his brother Artie, by a questionable hanging. Problem is, the last person Artie talked to was Crissy. And he didn't seem like he was preparing to fold, or hang. Far from it. He was worried about a hostile business takeover. 'They sent me a message when they killed Richie,' he tells her, 'but I'm not surrendering.'\nIf that's not enough, Crissy's estranged doppelgänger sister, Betsy, has just moved to Las Vegas, along with Betsy's newly adopted 13-year-old hacker daughter, Marisa. They're joining Betsy's new boyfriend, Frankie, an executive at an obviously dubious crypto outfit called Futurium, which is positioned to buy Buckingham Palace. Convenient.\nIf this sounds borderline zany, it is. But Bohjalian has long been able to elevate these kinds of tales by writing about inward madness as well as outward. He draws characters with whom we immediately empathize, like Cassandra Bowden in 'The Flight Attendant,' whose addictions and every-woman approach to an international conspiracy make us trust her even when we shouldn't. He also tends to employ a deep entrenchment in setting — Tanzania in 'The Lioness,' for instance, or Colonial Boston in 'Hour of the Witch' — to beget fast-moving action. The heat burns, the wind chafes, the witches get rounded up, verisimilitude becomes narrative, and you buy the world.\nAdvertisement\nHere, however, Bohjalian lacks his trademark acuity. His Las Vegas is both geographically and tangibly hard to recognize, the aesthetic of the Strip more like it was 30 years ago, when meals were cheap and mediocre, not exorbitant and Michelin-starred; sold-out showrooms were filled with Liberace and Sinatra impersonators, not U2 and Adele; when organized crime syndicates could still plausibly buy into casinos and, more saliently, when the city wasn't one of the most surveilled in the world. That Bohjalian plays loose with all of these facts doesn't ruin the story, but it does give one the sense that he parachuted into the backdrop. 'Princess' could have taken place in Branson, Mo., and the story would have been the same. The core concern here is not place but tone: Crissy is living in a black comedy, and everyone else is in a thriller. That mismatch eventually saps drama and mystery.\nLate in the novel, for instance, when Crissy is faced with a mounting death toll, including the cryptic loss of a lover, a friend offers her a gun and her response is:\n'You ever read Chekhov?' I asked.\n'What about him?'\n'This is a paraphrase, but Chekhov said if you reveal a gun in the first act, it best go off by the third.'\nIt's a playful reference, and surrounded by the violence other characters are experiencing and Crissy's own deepening despair, it feels like a misstep. The novel also features some anachronistic ancillary plot points, including the blackmail of a politician over extramarital proclivities: That may have worked in 'The Godfather,' but that was before a presidential candidate allegedly paid off a porn star and still swept the Bible Belt.\nAdvertisement\nWe see this story through alternating points of view — including Betsy's and, in brief interludes, Marisa's — but Crissy's sections could be their own book. She's a fascinating character, a woman subsumed by childhood trauma who has taken on the life of her famous look-alike, right down to mannerisms and speech patterns, smiling flirtatiously from beneath her bangs, Diana alive again. Bohjalian's writing about the weirdness and pain of Crissy's life is powerful, even at times audacious. If only the rest of the novel had been as daring.\nTod Goldberg is the author of 14 books of fiction, including, most recently, 'Gangsters Don't Die.'

            "excerpt": "Former militia member charged with making ricin deepens intrigue in a case that's shining a light on the evolution of the anti-government movement.",
            "summary": "A court appearance Monday solved one part of the mystery surrounding a Virginia man whose alleged talk of explosives landed him in a federal investigation: Russell Vane IV is alive.\nVane, 42, who uses the nickname 'Duke,' had gone silent early this month after an anti-government militia he belonged to publicly disavowed him over concerns about his repeated references to bombmaking.\nAn obituary for Vane popped up online in early April, saying that he'd died in mid-March, but the notice disappeared after a couple days. A man who answered Vane's phone last week told The Washington Post that 'Duke killed himself.'\nBut Vane appeared, very much alive, in federal custody Monday for a hearing on charges related to manufacturing the deadly poison ricin, indications of which FBI agents found during a search of his home on April 10, according to filings in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.\nAdvertisement\nThe courtroom resurrection of a 'dead' defendant and the specter of biological weapons are the latest installments in a strange story that shows how anti-government groups are evolving in an era of greater FBI scrutiny and landmark Justice Department prosecutions of far-right extremists.\nEarlier this month, members of the Virginia Kekoas 'prepper' militia took the unusual step of going public with their fears that Vane, who formally joined last summer, might be either a government informant or a dangerous militant. They gave the independent journalist Ford Fischer chat logs and other documentation showing how Vane's talk of homemade explosives, Russian operatives and presidential assassination alarmed the group, which eventually removed him on March 10.\nassassination alarmed the group, which eventually removed him on March 10.\nActing on tips generated by Fischer's report, according to court papers, the FBI conducted a search and found supplies for manufacturing ricin in the laundry room of a Vienna, Va., home that Vane shares with his wife and their young children. Prosecutors say in court papers filed Monday that laboratory tests indicated the presence of ricin, which authorities described as 'highly toxic, and can be fatal, if ingested, inhaled, or injected.'\nAdvertisement\n'He stored it as haphazardly as one might an extra box of lightbulbs: on an ordinary high shelf in the laundry room, in a plain cardboard box, without even sealing it up,' prosecutors wrote in a memo arguing against Vane's pretrial release. They wrote that Vane showed 'disregard for the extraordinary danger he created for himself, his family, and his neighborhood.'\nDuring the search, officers found 23 firearms scattered throughout the house, 'including multiple unsecured guns in a filing cabinet drawer and closets, and one loaded shotgun leaning against the wall in the master bedroom, easily accessible by the children in the house.'\nVane's attorney, federal public defender Geremy Kamens, said in court papers that the government's charges are 'extraordinarily serious and overblown.' The government, Kamens wrote, alleged that Vane 'attempted to produce weapons-grade Ricin without evidence of such a capability, a means of dispersion, and without conducting a full investigation.'\nAdvertisement\nKamens declined to comment.\nRelatives and friends submitted letters to the court advocating for Vane's pretrial release, describing him as a family man and noting his eight years as a reservist in the U.S. Marine Corps. (The Post verified his service.) They said Vane doesn't pose a flight risk because of his devotion to his children — two from a previous marriage and two with his current wife. Both women added letters of support. Writing from a cruise ship in the Pacific Ocean, Vane's parents also told the court that their son was trustworthy, noting that he manages their retirement plans and rental properties.\n'He has always been protective of others,' Vane's mother wrote to the judge.\nThat's a markedly different portrayal from the one that emerges in interviews with the Kekoas and in prosecutors' court filings.\nAdvertisement\nDuke drew suspicions as soon as he contacted the militia in April 2022 to express interest in membership. In interviews with The Post, they said he told them he was a U.S. Marine veteran who worked in the intelligence field and lived in Northern Virginia. After an extensive vetting process lasting more than a year, the Kekoas said, Vane was voted in as an official member last August. Within weeks, the militia members said, Vane began raising alarm with repeated references to explosives and their precursor chemicals.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nOn Feb. 5, according to screenshots published by Fischer and seen by The Post, Vane wrote to one Kekoas member: 'Would you be interested in learning some things about HME or is that too spicy for this stage of the game.'\n'HME?' the member replied. Homemade explosives, Vane explained, using a blast emoji.\nAdvertisement\nThat night, leaders of the Kekoas said they warned Vane that 'we're not about that.' Even after putting him on notice, they said, Vane's behavior and remarks continued to raise suspicions over the following weeks, culminating in their decision to sever ties last month and publicly broadcast their concerns.\nIn court papers, prosecutors say Vane 'engaged in an escalating sequence of unusual behavior that included apparent provocations for the group to develop homemade explosives.'\n'Throughout his interactions with the Kekoas members, Vane made comments indicative of his interest in and knowledge of chemistry and the use of chemistry to manufacture dangerous substances,' according to the charging papers.\nAccording to Fischer, who attended the hearing and summarized it on his X account, prosecutors said the FBI watched Vane for days before his arrest, noting repeated visits from Matthew Miller, a convicted Jan. 6 Capitol rioter who received a 33-month sentence for assaulting law enforcement officers and other charges.\nAdvertisement\nProsecutors also wrote in documents that, before Vane's arrest, 'he was an employee of a United States government agency,' though Fischer reported that the employer wasn't identified in court. Two Kekoas leaders — Eddie 'Ice' Ray and Cody 'Sasquatch' Beckner — said Vane had told them he worked as an intelligence analyst and boasted of ties to the CIA.\nOn March 9, Vane handed Beckner a manila envelope allegedly containing government documents about explosives precursors that Vane printed at work, according to court filings. Fischer reported that the passing of the documents was cited in court as the basis for the search warrant.\nIn making the case against pretrial release, Fischer reported, prosecutors described Vane's 'prepper' equipment, including cash and precious metals, guns and an 'Apocalypse check list.' The materials were legal but made Vane 'unusually well-equipped to leave jurisdiction,' Fischer quoted prosecutors as saying. Court papers say that Vane also tried to legally change his name on April 3, the same day an obituary appeared on Legacy.com.\nAdvertisement\nFederal prosecutors declined to comment.\nWhen asked by U.S. Magistrate Judge William B. Porter about the claim that Vane had tried to change his name and fake his death, Vane's attorney said the conduct was intended to throw off 'the jokers in that militia,' not the government, Fischer reported.",

            "summary": "LONDON — Hundreds of people attended a vigil in central London on Wednesday to commemorate the life of a police officer who was shot dead 40 years ago from inside the Libyan embassy in the British capital.\nConstable Yvonne Fletcher, 25, was killed when men armed with submachine guns fired from the embassy's windows while she was policing a demonstration outside the building against the regime of then-Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.\nAttendees laid flowers at the base of a memorial at the site where Fletcher died. The ceremony ended with the release of seven white doves in tribute to the slain police officer.\nNo one has been brought to justice for the death of Fletcher, even though campaigners, including her colleague John Murray, won a victory in a civil case at Britain's High Court three years ago. A judge ruled that a former Libyan minister, Saleh Ibrahim Mabrouk, had been 'jointly liable' for the plan to use violence during the anti-government protest, though he didn't fire any shots\nAdvertisement\nMabrouk, who denied responsibility, had been arrested in London in 2015 but the case was dropped two years later by prosecutors because key evidence had to be kept secret on national security grounds. He was barred from the U.K. in 2019 over his suspected involvement in war crimes, and is believed to be in Libya.\nMurray, who cradled Fletcher as she lay dying and promised to find those responsible for her murder, said Wednesday at the memorial that campaigners have launched a fundraising campaign for a private criminal prosecution and a request for Mabrouk's extradition to the U.K. to stand trial.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'The terrorist murder of Yvonne Fletcher 40 years ago ... was one of the worst atrocities executed by Gadhafi,' he said. 'Justice is what we will get for a fallen colleague because we will never and can never forget her.'\nAdvertisement\nGadhafi, whose regime was linked to a number of terrorist acts, was killed by opposition fighters in 2011 during the NATO-backed Arab Spring, ending his four-decade rule of Libya. The north African country has been divided between rival administrations and beset by militia conflict ever since.\nLondon's Metropolitan Police said there are currently no active lines of inquiry and the likelihood of finding further evidence remains low. However, it said the murder investigation will never be closed and any relevant new information that comes to light will be assessed and investigated further.\n'She had her whole career and her whole life ahead of her,' said Mark Rowley, the commissioner for the Met.\n'Today, 40 years on from that terrible day, I join with all in the Met and across policing in paying tribute to her, in recognising her sacrifice and in keeping her family, friends and colleagues in our thoughts,' he added.\nFletcher's family thanked the Met for its continued support.",

            "excerpt": "Spy chief Kyrylo Budanov is the 'man without a smile' and the driver of efforts take the fight to Russia.",
            "summary": "KYIV — Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov's glowering face is barely visible in the half-light of his office. He likes to work in the dark, as befits the chief of Ukraine's military intelligence service, the GUR. Behind him in the gray gloom, you can see a painting of a giant owl, the symbol of his service, savagely devouring a bat that is the motif of its Russian counterpart.\nBudanov is the dark prince of the Ukraine war. His drop-dead stare has become an icon for Ukrainians — a symbol of bravery and defiance in this third year of conflict with Russia. Ukraine's NV news outlet calls him the man 'without a smile.' A meme that circulates on the internet shows nine identical pictures of his scowling face, labeled 'happy,' 'angry,' 'troubled,' 'excited' and so on.\nBudanov spoke with me for 90 minutes last month in his forbidding office on what Ukrainians call 'the Island,' a derelict string of buildings on a peninsula on the Dnieper River. He was, as always, the voice of resistance — promising to take the fight into Russia with drones and special operations, confirming reports that he's battling with Wagner mercenaries in Africa and scoffing at a Korea-style negotiated settlement.\nWith the House of Representatives nearing a final vote on additional military aid to Ukraine, Budanov delivered a clear, emphatic message to the United States: 'You should keep helping us, and you should, at last, deliver the assistance we need. We will have a common victory together.'\nWar always has an element of theater, and Budanov might be this conflict's most colorful character. He's just 38, and he's famously courageous in battle. He fought behind Russian lines between 2014 and 2016 in Donbas and was injured three times, including taking shrapnel in his heart, neck and back. In 2016, he led a raid that killed a lieutenant general from Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB.\nAdvertisement\nThere's a pile of armor and a .50-caliber machine gun heaped next to his desk, and they're not for show. Budanov travels regularly to the front lines in Bakhmut, Avdiivka, 'everywhere,' he said. 'Sometimes it's necessary for me to be with my people to motivate them. I'm not taking excuses for why someone can't do something. That's why the task will always be accomplished.'\nFollow this author David Ignatius 's opinions\nFollow this author\nDavid Ignatius\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nBudanov predicted that Russia will launch a big offensive starting in June to try to capture all of Donetsk and Luhansk, the two provinces known as the Donbas region, which Russia has claimed but doesn't control. The Russians will then focus on the November elections in the United States and the aftermath. 'Until the inauguration of your president, they will try to get as much as possible of the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk,' perhaps hoping that a reelected President Donald Trump can ratify their gains.\nTo counter the Russians, Budanov plans more cross-border attacks by the 'Russian volunteers' who operate inside Russia with support from his service, along with more drone attacks. He explained: 'We've offered a plan aimed at reduction of Russian potential. It encompasses a lot of aspects, like the military industry … critical military targets, their airfields, their command-and-control posts.'\nAdvertisement\nThe goal is to show that President Vladimir Putin cannot 'protect the population from the war getting into Russia,' he explained. 'When you're sitting, say, in St. Petersburg, and you're seeing the war only on TV, you will always be supportive. … But people start to get nervous when some facility [is attacked] near their house.'\nBudanov scrolled his phone for images from a Telegram channel that show Russian civilians in the town of Belgorod surveying damage to local buildings. The bombs that had caused most of the destruction were Russian S-300 antiaircraft missiles shot at Ukrainian drones, he said, rather than the drones themselves, but the traumatizing effect on the population was the same.\n'In reality, the damage done by those [antiaircraft] missiles is a lot higher than the damage that would potentially be done by a drone,' he said.\nWhen I asked if Ukrainian attacks inside Russia would continue, Budanov offered a rare trace of a smile. 'I hope so,' he said. A cartoon circulating on the internet shows Putin meeting Budanov in a park and asking if his dog bites. Budanov answers no, and Putin pets the animal. The dog takes a gun and shoots Putin dead.\nBudanov's celebrity in Ukraine stems partly from the fact that he was the only senior leader to warn unequivocally that the Russians were coming before they invaded on Feb. 24, 2022. He led his special forces at Hostomel airport in the early days of the war to help repel a Russian landing there that nearly led to the capture of Kyiv.\nAdvertisement\nThe Russians have tried to assassinate Budanov at least 10 times, according to Ukraine's count, including at least two missile strikes on his headquarters at the Island. A Moscow court issued a warrant for his arrest last year for allegedly plotting to destroy the Kerch Strait bridge. His wife, Marianna, was poisoned by heavy metals, according to Ukrainian reports last year.\nBudanov doesn't appear fazed. If anything, he seems to relish the danger. Some friends worry that he can be reckless. 'Kyrylo has succeeded in so many risks, he doesn't have good risk assessment,' one told me.\nAs special forces chief, Budanov is always looking for new ways to cause trouble for Putin and his forces. I asked him about rumors that some of his GUR operatives are fighting in Africa against mercenaries of the Wagner militia. 'We conduct such operations aimed at reducing Russian military potential, anywhere where it's possible,' he said. 'Why should Africa be an exception?'\nAdvertisement\nFor all his panache, Budanov has a clear-eyed assessment of Putin and Russia. 'He became a victim of his own propaganda,' Budanov said. 'They overheated their society … saying that they're the most mighty and all-powerful in the world, and he started believing that himself. But it turned out their military is not as powerful as they thought.'\nPutin made a 'strategic mistake' in launching the war, he said. 'But Russians recover fast, and that's a fact that you should keep in mind. They have proved that dozens of times. We should not underestimate this characteristic.' Putin's war was supported by over 70 percent of Russians, he said.\nHow will this war end? Budanov was wary about making predictions. He said he 'wouldn't mind' an eventual breakup of Russia into small pieces. But he cautioned: 'In Russian dreams, they have occupied all of Ukraine, and in our dreams, we have a victory parade … into Moscow.' In other words, neither outcome is likely.\nAdvertisement\n'This war will be ongoing while this regime remains in place in Russia,' he said. 'Under the next regime, it might change or not, but there will be a window of opportunity.' When I asked about a 'Korea solution' through negotiations, he bristled and asked if I wanted Ukraine to become North Korea.\nNear the end of our conversation, I asked Budanov if he was worried that if Trump were elected, he might try to impose a settlement. His answer surprised me, but perhaps it underlined what a canny intelligence operator he is. He's already recruiting a potential asset.\n'I have a huge respect for the personality of Trump,' Budanov said. He noted that the former president had attended a military academy, and he lauded his tenacity. 'There have been nine instances in his life when he went to the top, fell to the very bottom of life, and went back again.' But as for any Trump peace plan, he said: 'Even a person like him won't be able to resolve this issue in one day.'\nAdvertisement",

Harvard University remains in an almighty mess after months of turmoil over hate speech. There is a way to fix this: Appoint former Massachusetts governor and retiring U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) university president.\nThough I am a lifelong Democrat, did not vote for Romney when he ran for U.S. president in 2008 and have no personal connection to him, I make this suggestion in the sincere and robust hope that he is someone who can navigate the university through painful but necessary reform and drive back the antisemitism that is tarnishing the institution's credibility.\nAs the grandson of Holocaust survivors and president of the American Jewish Congress, I find it devastating that Harvard has failed to vigorously address the unchecked antisemitism on campus. Anyone who has studied there can attest that Harvard is not an antisemitic institution. I never for a moment felt oppressed or marginalized as a student on the Harvard campus. But to my dismay, recent years have seen an unconscionable spike in — and even worse, an administrative tolerance of — hate speech directed at Jews, including targeting Jewish students. The university's response has thus far been ramshackle and unproductive, to put it mildly.\nAdvertisement\nHarvard knows there is a problem. Increasing numbers of students, faculty, alumni and donors have expressed discomfort, even horror, at the hostile environment on campus. But in its most talked-about response — the appointment of a task force to combat antisemitism — Harvard included as co-chair a professor who referred to Israel as a 'regime of apartheid.' How was this allowed to happen?\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAs we saw with the disastrous congressional testimony of then-President Claudine Gay, leadership matters. The university president must be the flag-bearer of our values. There is no doubt that there are other Americans of similar standing and stature, but Romney's unique bridge-building character is precisely what Harvard needs in an age of toxic polarization. A Harvard alumnus, he is an eloquent and experienced administrator who has consistently demonstrated his political independence in defense of what is right, rather than what is expedient.\nRomney has been nothing short of a profile in courage in the Senate, supporting gun safety reform and voting to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson as the first Black female Supreme Court justice. Importantly, he has been a staunch supporter of civil rights for all, including leveling heartfelt criticism at Harvard for failing to protect Jewish students. He can guide Harvard as it faces intense scrutiny from Congress and from an increasingly anxious — even angered — Jewish community.\nAdvertisement\nAlthough many at Harvard might not share Romney's politics — a 2022 Harvard Crimson poll shows that more than 80 percent of Harvard's faculty identify as liberal — choosing him would be an ideal way to nurture a culture and atmosphere of open inquiry and respectful dialogue. What matters more than political leanings is that Romney has the moral courage and independence to identify the root sources of antisemitism at the university, address the decline in Jewish student applications and enrollment and teach a new generation of young adults the importance of mutual tolerance and civilized coexistence.",

            "summary": "In their first televised primary debate, Rep. David Trone and Prince George's County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks each sought to position themselves as the Democratic Party's best chance of defeating the state's popular, two-term former Republican governor in November.\nWith similar stances on key issues such as education and reproductive rights, the leading Democrats in the race for U.S. Senate emphasized contrasting experience in making their pitch to primary voters — all while agreeing on the stakes. The race is one of a handful of contests across the country with the power to determine control of the chamber in November, which Democrats currently hold by a razor-thin margin.\nTrone, a multimillionaire founder of Total Wine & More, highlighted his record in Congress, his business experience and a challenging upbringing over the course of an hour-long live program on Fox45 and WJLA7. Alsobrooks, who was previously Prince George's state's attorney, pointed to her own experiences as a woman and mother, her criminal justice background and her record leading the state's second-most populous county.\nAdvertisement\nTrone swiftly declared victory in a news release after the debate. Alsobrooks hailed her 'standout performance.' Each claimed momentum heading into the next phase of the contest.\nAs May 14 approaches, attention is building on what had largely been seen as a sleepy contest for a reliably blue seat until Hogan launched a surprise bid two months ago. Endorsements are flying, yards signs are popping up and airwaves are thrumming with campaign messaging — and money.\nThis week alone saw the liberal super PAC Fight Corporate Monopolies launch the cycle's first negative ad, swiping at Trone's business practices and comparing him to former Republican president Donald Trump. On Wednesday, Hogan deployed a nearly $1 million television ad buy half bankrolled by national Republicans eager to flip the open Senate seat red.\nAdvertisement\nNational dollars are flowing into a contest that had been largely shaped by Trone's deep pockets. He has loaned his campaign at least $41.7 million since the start of the primary race, campaign finance records show.\nAlsobrooks, an underdog in the race, according to recent polls, repeatedly focused attention on Trone's fortunes and interrogated his argument that self-funding helps insulate him from special interests — repeating a line of attack she and her surrogates have raised about him 'buying' the seat.\nDuring the debate, she took aim at contributions Trone has made in a personal capacity and through his company, Total Wine & More, to conservative leaders such as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) who have worked to quash abortion access.\nThat fact, she said, contrasts with a record of giving that Trone has touted. He helped establish an abortion clinic in Western Maryland near the border with West Virginia after that state effectively shut down the procedure.\nAdvertisement\n'He cannot claim credit for the good his company does and distance himself from the bad that it does,' Alsobrooks said.\nTrone, in turn, swatted at her accusations by insinuating her interests would lie with companies that have supported her campaign, referencing by name Exxon, Pfizer and Cigna.\n'When you take the money … then they must expect something [of politicians],' Trone said. 'They're not charities.'\nAlsobrooks has brought in more individual contributions than any other candidate so far, and filings show she has just under $3.2 million on hand. Still, Alsobrooks's performance Friday carried extra weight in a race with lopsided resources at a time when she is seeking to boost name recognition.\nPolls released over the past six weeks show Trone consistently leading her, and Hogan, who left office last year with high favorability ratings, leading them both.\nHogan has maintained that he is an underdog in a state where registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans 2 to 1. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll conducted in March found that while Hogan is better known than Trone and Alsobrooks, he faces a crosscurrent Democrats hope to exploit: Maryland voters said by a 20-point margin that they prefer Democratic control of the U.S. Senate.\nHogan was out front in a poll released this week by FOX45 News, the Baltimore Sun and the University of Baltimore and conducted by OpinionWorks. The results show Trone leading Alsobrooks, 49 percent to 28 percent.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Trone on Friday detailed a bipartisan spirit he said helped him compete with Hogan, Alsobrooks took the opportunity to question a record of political giving to the man he hopes to beat. In 2014, eight of Trone's businesses gave $30,000 to Hogan in an effort to help him get rid of campaign debt, The Post reported.\n'What we don't need is a Larry Hogan donor trying to take on Larry Hogan in the fall,' Alsobrooks said.\nAmong the sharpest jabs Friday was an exchange on endorsements, with Trone noting he had secured the support of prominent politicians from the county Alsobrooks represents.\nOn Thursday, he received an endorsement from Aisha Braveboy (D), the Prince George's County state's attorney who holds Alsobrooks's former position. Democratic Prince George's County Council members Krystal Oriadha and Edward Burroughs III — both of whom have endorsed Trone and been critical of Alsobrooks in the past — were in the studio Friday, at times huddling around Trone during commercial breaks.\nAdvertisement\n'The folks that really matter the most are those that know you the best,' Trone said. 'Prince George's County supports us. The list goes on and on and on.'\nAlsobrooks has picked up Democratic heavyweights from the local to the federal level. Among her supporters are Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Rep. Jamie Raskin and former Prince George's county executive Rushern Baker IV.\nThe pair didn't spar over topics such as the Israel-Hamas war, on which they both agree that Hamas should be defeated, a cease-fire is needed and that hostages must be released. They also said cities should have access to federal data currently withheld from the public to enhance law enforcement's ability to trace guns and quell crime.\nand that hostages must be released. They also said cities should have access to federal data currently withheld from the public to enhance law enforcement's ability to trace guns and quell crime.\nBoth contenders have made protecting abortion rights a centerpiece of their campaign, tapping into an issue that has galvanized voters since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the constitutional right to abortion.\nprotecting abortion rights a centerpiece of their campaign, tapping into an issue that has galvanized voters since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the constitutional right to abortion.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAdvertisement\nThey have sought to paint Hogan, who would not say in an interview whether he would codify abortion protections in federal law, as an enemy of reproductive rights. Hogan said he would not vote for a national abortion ban, but he also said he would not take a position on hypothetical legislation that would codify Roe v. Wade .\nRoe v. Wade.\nCracks in their positions appeared when asked about repealing the death penalty.\nAlsobrooks supported the death sentence of a man convicted of killing four people including two children when she was Prince George's state's attorney, a panelist noted. But as the federal government reconsiders the death penalty, Alsobrooks noted that she, too, has evolved on the issue.\nMarylanders have decided that the death penalty is no longer the law of the land in Maryland, 'and I agree with Maryland voters,' Alsobrooks said. I can tell you that I would also not support the death penalty on the federal level. … Having said that, what I believe is that anyone who harms a child or who murders a child in particular deserves the stiffest penalty available to that person. And right now in Maryland, that penalty is life without parole.\nIn his rebuttal, Trone emphasized his steadfast opposition to it. 'It's clearly cruel and unusual punishment, and it's clearly racist,' he said.\nEarly voting in Maryland's Democratic and Republican primaries begins May 2.",

Kevin Coleman, a Democrat, won the district by 26 percentage points in 2022.\nMichigan Republican Party Chair Pete Hoekstra said Republicans still 'forced the candidates and Democrat committees to spend money to protect these seats.'\nAdvertisement\n'Win or lose, I'm more convinced than ever that Republicans are motivated and the Democrats are not,' Hoekstra said in a statement sent to The Associated Press.\nAfter Tuesday's special elections, lawmakers are expected to turn their focus to a state budget with a self-imposed July 1 deadline. Whitmer used her January State of the State speech to propose an $81 billion budget that would provide free community college for all high school graduates and preschool for 4-year-olds.\nIn recent months, Democrats have also considered expanding the state's hate crime law and enacting a comprehensive school safety package spurred by the 2021 mass shooting at Oxford High School. A majority in the House would let them more easily move those proposals.",

            "summary": "RAFAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah overnight killed 13 people, including nine children, health officials said Sunday, as the United States was on track to approve billions of dollars of additional military aid to its close ally.\nIsrael has carried out near-daily air raids on Rafah, where more than half of Gaza's population of 2.3 million has sought refuge from fighting elsewhere. It has also vowed to expand its ground offensive to the city on the border with Egypt despite international calls for restraint, including from the U.S.\nThe House of Representatives approved a $26 billion aid package on Saturday that includes around $9 billion in humanitarian assistance for Gaza.\nThe first strike killed a man, his wife and their 3-year-old child, according to the nearby Kuwaiti Hospital, which received the bodies. The woman was pregnant, and the doctors managed to save the baby, the hospital said.\nAdvertisement\nThe second strike killed eight children and two women, all from the same family, according to hospital records. An airstrike in Rafah the night before killed nine people, including six children.\nThe Israel-Hamas war has killed over 34,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, devastated Gaza's two largest cities and left a swath of destruction across the territory. Around 80% of the population have fled their homes to other parts of the besieged coastal enclave, which experts say is on the brink of famine.\nThe conflict, now in its seventh month, has sparked regional unrest pitting Israel and the U.S. against Iran and allied militant groups across the Middle East. Israel and Iran traded fire directly earlier this month, raising fears of all-out war between the longtime foes.\nTensions have also spiked in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The Israeli military said troops 'neutralized' two Palestinians who attacked a checkpoint with a knife and a gun near the southern West Bank town of Hebron early Sunday. It was not immediately clear if they were killed. No Israeli forces were wounded.\nAdvertisement\nAt least 469 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers and settlers in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Most have been killed during Israeli military arrest raids, which often trigger gunbattles, or in violent protests.\nThe war in Gaza was sparked by an unprecedented Oct. 7 raid into southern Israel in which Hamas and other militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250 hostages. Israel says militants are still holding around 100 hostages and the remains of more than 30 others.\nThousands of Israelis have taken to the streets to call for new elections to replace Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a deal with Hamas to release the hostages. Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war until Hamas is destroyed and all the hostages are returned.\nAdvertisement\nThe war has killed at least 34,049 Palestinians and wounded another 76,901, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between combatants and civilians in its count but says at least two-thirds have been children and women. It also says the real toll is likely higher as many bodies are stuck beneath the rubble left by airstrikes or are in areas that are unreachable for medics.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIsrael blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the militants fight in dense, residential neighborhoods, but the military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The military says it has killed over 13,000 Hamas fighters, without providing evidence.\n___\nMagdy reported from Cairo.\n___",

            "summary": "BRENTWOOD, N.H. — David Meehan, whose allegations of abuse at New Hampshire's youth detention center sparked nearly a dozen arrests and more than a thousand lawsuits, finally took the witness stand Wednesday, seven years after he first told his wife, 'They raped me.'\n'I think I'm more ready than anybody else in this room to do this right now,' he said.\nMeehan, 42, spent three years at the Youth Development Center, where he alleges he was repeatedly beaten, raped and locked in solitary confinement in the late 1990s. He went to police in 2017 and sued the state three years later. His lawsuit went to trial last week, and he began testifying Wednesday, describing his early years and arrival at the facility as a 14-year-old in 1995.\nHis attorneys displayed a photo of him as a smiling toddler clutching a football as he testified about physical abuse by his parents, including his mother's habit of putting her cigarettes out on his face. They later displayed a closeup photo of Meehan's face taken when he arrived at YDC and asked him to describe what he saw.\nAdvertisement\n'It's hard to describe this scared little boy, who at the same time feels safe,' he told jurors as he remembered being handcuffed to a wooden chair during the intake process at YDC. 'I'm not worrying about where I'm going to sleep tonight, I'm not worrying about what I'm going to eat. It's hard to explain that amount of emotion and distress.'\nSince Meehan came forward, authorities have arrested 11 former state workers, and more than 1,100 former residents have filed lawsuits, arguing the state's negligence allowed six decades of abuse. The state argues it is not responsible for the actions of 'rogue' employees.\nMeehan was the first to sue and go to trial. In testimony punctuated by long pauses, he described running away, breaking into homes to steal food and clothing, and once a gun that he hoped to sell. He said he and another teen escaped from a sheriff's cruiser on their way to court after the older boy warned him of sexual abuse at YDC, and he spent time in a pre-trial detention center in Concord where he was involved in an attempted escape that resulted in a riot.\nAdvertisement\nEarlier Wednesday, Michael Gilpatrick, another former resident whose time at the facility overlapped with Meehan's, continued testifying about the 'constant horror.' A staffer choked him until he lost consciousness and he awoke to find another man sexually assaulting him, he said. In another attack, two staffers beat and raped him, he said.\n'I just remember sitting on my bed crying,' he said. 'Blaming myself for being there, feeling ashamed, wondering what I did in this world to deserve this.'\nEvery assault 'seemed like it lasted forever, because it kind of did,' Gilpatrick said.\nReleased just shy of 17, Gilpatrick said he quickly ended up in the adult criminal justice system, spending a dozen years behind bars for drug-related crimes. For many years, he didn't recognize that he was abused as a child, he said.\nAdvertisement\nNow a married father of three who owns a waterproofing business, Gilpatrick said all he learned at YDC was how to become a hardened criminal, take a beating and keep his mouth shut.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'Everything I went through there, I normalized,' he said. 'That's what I felt like life was supposed to be. When I got out of there, all the way to 2015, I was in and out of jails and prison because I thought that was where I was supposed to be.'\nGilpatrick also confirmed to attorneys for the state that he had no personal knowledge of Meehan being physically or sexually abused.",

            "excerpt": "Dozens of the children of Flint, Michigan's lead-contaminated water crisis have turned their trauma into advocacy 10 years after it began",
            "summary": "FLINT, Mich. — Their childhood memories are still vivid: warnings against drinking or cooking with tap water, enduring long lines for cases of water, washing from buckets filled with heated, bottled water. And for some, stomach aches, skin rashes and hair loss.\nTen years ago in Flint — April 25, 2014 — city and state environmental officials raised celebratory glasses as the mayor pressed a button to stop the flow of Lake Huron water supplied by Detroit for almost half a century. That set in motion a lead and bacteria public health crisis from which the city has not fully recovered.\nBut dozens of children of the water crisis — now teenagers and young adults — have turned their trauma into advocacy. They provide input on public health initiatives, participate in social issue campaigns, distribute filters and provide free water testing for homeowners.\nAdvertisement\nThey know that Flint is a place that still struggles. The population has fallen by some 20,000 in the past decade, leaving abandoned houses as targets for arsonists. Almost 70% of children live in poverty, and many struggle in school. Although the water has been declared safe to drink, distrust runs deep, and hundreds of lead water pipes remain in the ground because homeowners were allowed to opt out of replacing them.\nBut the young activists say they want to help make a difference and change how their city is perceived by outsiders. And they want to defy expectations.\n'One of the biggest issues about growing up in Flint is that people had already decided and predetermined who we were,' said 22-year-old Cruz Duhart, a member of the Flint Public Health Youth Academy.\n'They had ideas about our IQ, about behavioral things, but they never really stopped to speak to us and how we thought about it and the type of traumas that we were going through.'\nAdvertisement\n___\nIt's always been easiest for 16-year-old Sima Gutierrez to express herself through art. Drawings, paintings and wire sculptures decorate her family's tidy bungalow.\nNow the self-described 'very shy' teen who rarely spoke up for fear nobody wanted to hear what she had to say collects water samples in people's homes and takes them to the Flint Community Water Lab, where more than 60 high school and college interns have provided free testing for thousands of residents since 2020.\nShe helped plan public awareness campaigns about topics like gun violence and how racism affects public health as a member of the Flint Public Health Youth Academy.\n'I wanted to be surrounded by people who weren't going to cover up the whole fact that people are still having problems,' said Sima. 'I was able to ... share my life (with) anybody else who's going through what I'm going through.'\nAdvertisement\nIt was a decade ago that she complained her stomach hurt when she drank water. Her mom insisted it would help Sima's body flush out medication she took for an autoimmune disorder that was causing her hair to fall out in patches and leaving her skin with light splotches.\nResidents had begun reporting skin rashes and complaining about discolored, smelly and foul-tasting water soon after the city began drawing from the Flint River to save money, until it could hook into a new Lake Huron pipeline. But they were assured everything was fine.\nSima said she wasn't aware of problems until one of her elementary school classmates, Mari Copeny — then a 7-year-old beauty pageant winner known as Little Miss Flint — began protesting. Mari became the face of the crisis, and continues to highlight environmental justice issues to almost 200,000 Instagram followers and to raise money, including for water filters that she gives out in communities across the U.S.\nAdvertisement\n'I want to keep on using my voice to spread awareness about the Flint water crisis because it's not just Flint that has a water crisis,' Mari said. 'America has a water crisis.'\n___\nAlmost a year and a half after Flint made its switch, residents frustrated with the water quality reached out to an expert who then found high lead levels caused by the city's failure to add chemicals that prevent pipe corrosion. State officials had said these were unnecessary. Around that same time, a pediatrician discovered that levels in kids' blood had doubled after the switch.\nOutbreaks of Legionnaire's disease, including a dozen deaths, ultimately were also linked, in part, to the city's water supply.\nFlint reconnected to its old water line shortly afterward, but because pipes continued to release lead. The state provided residents filters and bottled water.\nAdvertisement\nLead is a potent neurotoxin that can damage children's brains and nervous systems and affect learning, behavior, hearing and speech. There is no safe childhood exposure level and problems can manifest years later.\nData collected over a decade now show that children in Flint have higher rates of ADHD, behavioral and mental health problems and more difficulty learning than children assessed before the water crisis, said Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, the pediatrician who first flagged rising lead levels in Flint kids' blood. She said other issues, including nutrition, poverty, unemployment and systemic inequalities also could be factors.\nSima and three of her sisters were found to have elevated lead levels and have since been diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; Sima also has a learning difficulty.\nAdvertisement\n'I felt responsible for forcing my child to drink something that was hurting her so bad, and I didn't believe her,' said her mother, Jessica Gutierrez, who works as a public health advocate for hospitals and nonprofits and fears for her daughters' long-term health.\nGuilt and anxiety are 'part of the trauma of the crisis,' Hanna-Attisha said.\nThat's why it's important for kids from Flint to feel they're being heard, to be part of the solutions, she said. For example, the Flint Youth Justice League, an advisory board to her Pediatric Public Health Initiative, has offered suggestions on programs that include prescribing fresh fruits and vegetables, reducing poverty and connecting residents to public services.\n'Our young people are amazing,' said Hanna-Attisha. 'They are not okay with the status quo and they are demanding that we do better for them and for generations to come.'\nAdvertisement\n___\nAsia Donald remembers feeling helpless and bewildered when her little sister developed rashes and her mom boiled pot after pot of bottled water for baths.\nBut just a couple years later, she was talking to kids from Newark, New Jersey, guiding them through their own lead-in-water crisis. Over Zoom meetings, the kids from Flint explained parts per billion, how to test water for lead and how they had coped with fear.\n'They felt the exact same way that I felt when I was ... going through it,' said Asia, 20, now an aspiring accountant and one of 18 interns at the Flint Public Health Youth Academy.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThey're paid a monthly stipend to run the academy — writing grants, creating budgets, analyzing data, conducting focus groups and creating public awareness campaigns. They have a biweekly talk show on YouTube, where they've discussed everything from mental health to COVID.\nAdvertisement\nLast summer, they planned and hosted a summer camp for dozens of kids that focused on gun violence and school shootings. This year, together with the Community Foundation of Greater Flint, they're coordinating a youth summit on community violence.\nDr. Kent Key, a public health researcher with the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine in Flint, started the academy after studying health disparities in the Black community as part of his doctoral dissertation.\nHe wanted to introduce Black kids to potential health careers, but also felt like 'everyone had written Flint youth off because of the impacts of lead.' So he gave them more than a voice, he said. He gave them control.\n'I did not want (the water crisis) to be a sentence of doom and gloom for youth,' he said. ' I wanted it to be a catapult ... to launch the next generation of public health professionals.'\n___\nDionna Brown, who was 14 when the water crisis began, became interested in advocacy after taking a class on environmental inequality at Howard University. Now she's planning her life around it — completing a master's degree in sociology from Wayne State University with plans to become an environmental justice attorney.\nShe's also national director of the youth environmental justice program at Young, Gifted & Green, formerly called Black Millennials for Flint and founded by advocates from Washington to support Flint after the crisis.\nBrown holds a two-week summer environmental justice camp in Flint every year to teach teens about issues such as policy, climate justice, sustainability and housing disparities. She also works with kids in Baltimore and Memphis.\nShe said the water crisis made Flint kids resilient.\n'I tell people all the time: I'm a child of the Flint water crisis,' said Brown. 'I love my city. And we put the world on notice that you cannot just poison a city and we'll forget about it.'\n___\nAssociated Press video journalist Mike Householder contributed to this story.\n___",

            "summary": "StarSolid StarSolid StarOutline StarOutline ( 2 stars )\nStarSolid StarSolid StarOutline StarOutline ( 2 stars )\nAs much as Guy Ritchie's uber-violent, stakes-free, World War II action comedy caper 'The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare' milks its 'based on a true story' bona fides, it's more akin to the last decade's glut of slick, cool-guy popcorn pictures (including his own) than any meaningful retelling of real heroism.\nIts contemporary ties don't stop Ritchie (the man who brought us 'Sherlock Holmes,' 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E.' and 'The Gentlemen') from aping famous bits from much better, more serious classic war films. Like the sequence on a fishing trawler straight out of 'The Guns of Navarone' that opens this liberally fictionalized account of a covert 1942 mission. Dubbed Operation Postmaster, its goal was to take down a German supply ship full of U-boat carbon dioxide filters, which would factor into a crucial turning point in the war.\nTo turbocharge the bro-historic intrigue and get the astronomical body count going in this shoot-'em-up grand theft aquatic, Ritchie must first assemble a ragtag squad of lethal (and lethally photogenic) heroes so rascally you know they'll get the bloody job done. You see, Hitler is marching across Europe, Britain's in a bind, and Winston Churchill (Rory Kinnear, beneath a mountain of prostheses) is desperate enough to clandestinely okay a deniable, off-the-books mission. Luckily, Brigadier Gubbins (Cary Elwes), head of the secret Special Operations Executive (SEO) org, knows just the rakish rule breaker for the job.\nAdvertisement\nEnter Gus March-Phillips (Henry Cavill), leader of a team of ruthless killers willing to play dirty to disrupt Nazi business off the African coast. His squad is Anders Lassen (Alan Ritchson), a Danish hulk with an exaggerated lilt and astounding archery skills; Freddy Alvarez (Henry Golding), a frogman with a talent for explosives; Geoffrey Appleyard (Alex Pettyfer), a master strategist; and cunning young Irish sailor Henry Hayes (Hero Fiennes Tiffin).\nThey're not in it alone. Already in place on the Spanish island of Fernando Po, where the Germans have set up shop in neutral territory, are SOE agent-slash-actress Marjorie Stewart (Eiza González, who holds her own, if not always her British accent), tasked with seducing a sadistic Nazi officer (Til Schweiger), and suave undercover fixer Richard Heron (Babs Olusanmokun), whose popular casino bar serves as such an unsubtle nod to 'Casablanca' that a character drops one of Humphrey Bogart's most iconic quotes while sitting in his cafe.\nOff in their own glam spycraft 'n' subterfuge romp for half the film, they're two of the more interesting figures in an overstuffed ensemble that includes Eton-educated West African prince Kambili Kalu (an excellent Danny Sapani), who lends his resources 'because the Nazis are gauche,' and young wartime secretary Ian Fleming (Freddie Fox), who must have gotten plenty of 007 inspiration from his wartime stint.\nAdvertisement\nShot on location in Turkey and Britain, the film's handsome production design is undone by its dull photographic patina. Costume designer Loulou Bontemps's standout achievement is a stunning replica of Claudette Colbert's 1934 'Cleopatra' cutaway gown that Stewart wields like a weapon. Christopher Benstead's score goes from whistling spaghetti Western motifs to jazzy percussives. Yet the plot breezes on with flimsy banter and bloodshed to go along with scant character development.\nAdapted from Damien Lewis's 2014 book 'Churchill's Secret Warriors: The Explosive True Story of the Special Forces Desperadoes of WWII,' the screenplay by Paul Tamasy, Eric Johnson, Arash Amel and Ritchie is oddly weightless given that its real-life commandos, heralded as precursors to the British Special Air Service (SAS) and modern black ops warfare, died in combat before war's end.\nIf you come, come for Cavill sniping Nazis by the hundreds with manic deadpan abandon, and stay for Ritchson looking like he stepped out of a Gold's Gym to destroy hordes of German hostiles with a bow and arrow. Then dive into the real history of the SOE, whose men and women could fill dozens more fascinating spy films without blunting the edges of history with fizzy bromantic antics.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare",

They later asked her to clean the interior of their Chevrolet pickup when they returned home about noon, the court document said.\nAdvertisement\n'CW asked Cora what had happened and was told things did not go as planned, but they would not have to worry about her (Butler) again,' the affidavit said. 'CW asked Cora if their bodies were put in a well, and Cora replied ‘something like that.'

Maybe the silence was the real message — a desire on all sides to prevent escalation by word or deed.\nOver the past week, we've seen what looks to me like a considered decision by Israel to subtly reshape its strategy for deterring Iran and Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah. Israeli deterrence is usually about massive use of offensive military force — a roundhouse punch that seeks to compel compliance through coercion.\nBut this time was different. When Iran launched a missile and drone barrage last weekend in retaliation for Israel's April 1 strike on Iranian military leaders in Damascus, Syria, Israel used its Iron Dome defense system and help from allies to absorb the blow. The reported destruction of 99 percent of Iran's incoming munitions was an astonishing display of missile defense. Some Israelis wanted to respond immediately with a big counter-barrage. But under pressure from President Biden, they waited.\nAdvertisement\nWhen the Israeli response came early Friday, it was muted. Iranian and Israeli reports suggest that the Israeli air force attacked a site near some of Iran's largest nuclear facilities. Those facilities weren't damaged, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. But Israel sent the message that it can penetrate Iranian air defenses and hit strategic targets when it chooses.\nIsrael wanted the last word in this exchange, and it seems to have succeeded. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday, after talks with officials in Tehran, that 'Iran does not want an escalation.' Iranian public statements scoffed at the limited action, but Israel showed it can strike when it wants — in this case a jab, but next time, maybe not. In this sense, Israel maintained what strategists call 'escalation dominance.' It landed the first blow and the last one.\nand the last one.\nHow to explain Israel's actions over the past week? What accounts for its restraint, in a situation where hawks in the Israeli government were screaming for all-out assault?\nAdvertisement\nHere's my take: Israel is behaving like the leader of a regional coalition against Iran. In its measured response, it appeared to be weighing the interests of its allies in this coalition — Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan — which all provided quiet help in last weekend's shoot-down. It's playing the long game, in other words.\nFollow this author David Ignatius 's opinions\nFollow this author\nDavid Ignatius\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nThis would amount to a paradigm shift for Israel. Rather than seeing itself as the embattled Jewish state fighting alone for its survival against a phalanx of Arab and Muslim enemies, Israel knows that it has allies. Top of the list, as always, is the United States. But America is joined by Arab states that oppose Iran and its proxies as much as the Israelis do.\nThat's the new shape of the Middle East. But for now, at least, this ripening friendship between Israel and its former adversaries in the region must remain unspoken.\nAdvertisement\nIsrael over the past week has gained another precious asset. After absorbing Iran's missile assault so deftly, it's seen at once as a victim of attack and a master of high-tech defense. That's a welcome reversal, after six months of grueling combat against Hamas in Gaza that severely tarnished Israel's international reputation. After Iran's cascade of missiles and the limited response from Jerusalem, Israel now appears to have support of the Group of Seven advanced industrial nations.\nIsraeli hard-liners will say that a weak Biden administration has pressured Israel to pull its punches. In the brutal combat of the Middle East, it's kill or be killed, these critics will argue. This hard-bitten Israeli conception of deterrence can seem compelling. But I've been watching Israel's go-it-alone approach to security for nearly 45 years, and I would say that its results have been mixed, at best.\nWe're looking at something new, after 'the guns of April.' Maybe the worst is yet to come, if Iran decides to 'sneak out' toward acquiring nuclear weapons, Hezbollah attacks from the north or Israel opts for devastating preventive war against Hezbollah in Lebanon. But good or bad, this is a new chapter in the story.\nAdvertisement\nBringing a rapid end to the Gaza war is essential now. We're at an inflection point, where it's in the overwhelming interest of Israel, the Palestinians and the entire Middle East to conclude this conflict. As veteran diplomat Dennis Ross recently observed, Israel is accomplishing the effective demilitarization of Hamas, with 19 of its 24 battalions gone. The de facto military alliance of Saudi Arabia and other Arab states with Israel is an open secret. We're moving, at last, toward 'the day after.'",

            "summary": "OKLAHOMA CITY — A two-week search for two missing Kansas women came to a fatal end last weekend when Oklahoma authorities confirmed the two were dead and announced the arrests of four people who allegedly belonged to an anti-government group that called themselves 'God's Misfits.'\nVeronica Butler, 27, and Jilian Kelley, 39, of Hugoton, Kansas, disappeared on March 30 while driving to pick up Butler's two children for a birthday party. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation confirmed on Tuesday that the bodies found in Texas County were those of the two women.\nOne of the suspects charged in the case is the children's grandmother, who authorities say was in a bitter custody dispute with Butler. The four face charges including murder and are expected to make their first court appearance Wednesday in Guymon, in the rural Oklahoma panhandle.\nAdvertisement\nHere are some things to know about the case.\nWHAT DO AUTHORITIES SAY HAPPENED ?\nInvestigators have been tight-lipped about the case since the car Kelley and Butler were riding in was found in a rural area of Texas County, which is along the border with Kansas. But arrest affidavits unsealed Monday painted a gruesome picture of the scene.\nAccording to court records, blood was left on the road and Butler's glasses were found near a broken hammer. A magazine for a pistol was inside Kelley's purse but authorities disclosed they did not find any firearm.\nEvidence suggests the killings were planned, according to the arrest affidavit, which states that Tifany Adams, the grandmother of Butler's children, had bought pre-paid 'burner' cellphones and five stun guns. Her internet searches included inquiring about pain levels using the weapons, according to the affidavits.\nAdvertisement\nThe Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation announced over the weekend that they had found two bodies, more than two weeks after the women disappeared. The state medical examiner's office has not yet released a report revealing how they were killed.\nWHO WERE THE VICTIMS?\nInvestigators say Butler was involved in a custody fight with Adams and her son and was only allowed supervised visits with the children on Saturday. Kelley was authorized to supervise the visits, according to the affidavits.\nKelley was a pastor's wife and mother of four. Her husband, Heath Kelley, was the pastor of First Christian Church in Hugoton. In recent months, he had accepted a new job with Willow Christian Church in Indianola, Nebraska, but hadn't started there yet.\nAt Willow's sister congregation, McCook Christian Church, Sunday's service opened with news of the killings. 'We had longed for a different outcome,' a pastor told the congregation during the service, which was posted on Facebook.\nAdvertisement\nMessages left with several members of Butler's family have not been returned\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nWHO ARE THE SUSPECTS?\nAll four suspects are charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping and conspiracy to commit murder. They are being held without bond at the Texas County Jail in Guymon.\nIn addition to Adams, 54, the others charged are Tad Cullum, 43; Cora Twombly, 44; and her husband Cole Twombly, 50, both of Texhoma, Oklahoma.\nCourt records on Tuesday did not indicate if any had attorneys who could speak on their behalf. Relatives of Tad Cullum and the Twomblys have not returned phone messages seeking comment. Tifany Adams' stepmother, Elise Adams, said she had no information on the case.\nAccording to a witness who spoke to OSBI investigators, all four suspects were part of 'an anti-government group that had a religious affiliation,' according to the affidavit. OSBI investigators learned the group called themselves 'God's Misfits' and held regular meetings at the home of the Twomblys and another couple.\nAdvertisement\nTifany Adams, who was involved in the custody dispute with Butler, is the current chair of the Cimarron County Republican Party, according to Oklahoma Republican Party Chairman Nathan Dahm. Cimarron County is the westernmost county at the tip of the Oklahoma Panhandle with a population of fewer than 2,300 people.\nDahm said officials at the state party did not know Adams. He said given how rural the county is, 'it could have been three people who showed up at the county convention and elected her.'\nWHAT'S NEXT?\nAll four suspects were scheduled for an initial appearance Wednesday in Texas County District Court.\nDuring an initial appearance in Oklahoma, a judge will typically review the formal charges and enter a not guilty plea on behalf of the defendant. The judge also will determine if the defendants have hired an attorney or will have a state-appointed attorney represent them and will schedule another court date for the defendants to appear.\n___",

            "summary": "For three-and-a-half long hours on Jan. 29, the cellphone in 6-year old Hind Rajab's hands was the closest thing she had to a lifeline. Alone in the back seat of a car outside a Gaza City gas station, she was drifting in and out of consciousness, surrounded by bodies, as she told emergency dispatchers that Israeli tanks were rumbling closer.\nFrom the operations room of the Palestine Red Crescent Services (PRCS), roughly 50 miles away in the city of Ramallah, the team on duty had done their best to save the child. Paramedics were on their way, the dispatchers kept telling her: Hold on.\nThe paramedics were driving to their deaths.\nFrom left: Hind Hamada, 6, Bashar Hamada, 44, and his daughter Layan, 13, were killed, along with four other family members, as well as paramedics Yusuf Zeino and Ahmed Al-Madhoun. (Mohammed Hamada and Palestine Red Crescent Society )\nTwelve days later, when a Palestinian civil defense crew finally reached the area, they found Hind's body in a car riddled with bullets, according to her uncle, Samir Hamada, who also arrived at the scene early that morning. The ambulance lay charred roughly 50 meters away (about 164 feet) from the car, its destruction consistent with the use of a round fired by Israeli tanks, according to six munitions experts.\nroughly 50 meters away (about 164 feet) from the car, its destruction consistent with the use of a round fired by Israeli tanks, according to six munitions experts.\nIn a statement, the Israel Defense Forces said they conducted a preliminary investigation and that its forces were 'not present near the vehicle or within the firing range' of the Hamada family car. Nor, they said, had they been required to provide the ambulance permission to enter the area. The State Department said it has raised the case repeatedly with the Israelis. 'The Israelis told us there had, in fact, been IDF units in the area, but the IDF had no knowledge of or involvement in the type of strike described,' said spokesman Matt Miller.\nA Washington Post investigation found that Israeli armored vehicles were present in the area in the afternoon, and that gunfire audible as Hind and her cousin Layan begged for help, as well as extensive damage caused to the ambulance, are consistent with Israeli weapons. The analysis is based on satellite imagery, contemporaneous dispatcher recordings, photos and videos of the aftermath, interviews with 13 dispatchers, family members and rescue workers, and more than a dozen military, satellite, munitions and audio experts who reviewed the evidence, as well as the IDF's own statements.\nThe Palestine Red Present Society (PRCS) as well as representatives from Euro-Med Monitor and the Civil Defense who visited the scene on Feb. 10 provided visuals to The Post, which it verified by independently confirming the location using satellite imagery, open-source maps and eyewitness interviews.\n(Euro-Med Monitor)\nThe Post's review also found that the ambulance was discovered along a route provided by COGAT, an arm of the Israeli Defense Ministry that generally coordinates safe passage for medical vehicles with the IDF. COGAT initially referred specific questions about the ambulance to the IDF. In mid-March, Elad Goren, head of Coordination and Liaison Administration at COGAT, told The Post that the agency 'coordinated everything … including the ambulance that wanted to go and find Hind,' but said he was 'not aware' of the specifics. COGAT did not respond to repeated requests to clarify.\nThe IDF denied that any coordination had taken place, repeating its assertion that its forces were not in the area. It did not comment on two detailed timelines of the incident, or on the expert findings, provided by The Washington Post.\nIt was not possible to reach Hamas's military wing for comment on the incident.\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nHumanitarian officials have warned that a system of coordination with Israel's military, designed to protect their aid deliveries and lifesaving ambulance maneuvers, is broken. Israeli strikes on a World Central Kitchen convoy that killed seven aid workers in Gaza on April 1 and stirred global outrage came after failed deconfliction efforts.\nMore than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israeli military operations in Gaza, according to local health authorities. Amid a war of unyielding horror, Hind's case touched a nerve around the world, in large part because her recorded cries for help offered a glimpse into the terrors faced by civilians.\n9:32 a.m.\nGenerations of the Hamada family had lived on al-Wahda Street in the northern part of Gaza City for decades. Everything changed on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas militants stormed border communities in southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, including civilians in their homes and young people at a concert, and taking about 240 hostages back to Gaza. The assault drew a punishing response from Israel which insists its campaign is necessary to destroy Hamas's military capabilities.\nMore than 75 percent of Gaza's 2.2 million population has been displaced by the fighting, many of them multiple times, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The Hamada family fled their houses; some went south, while others sheltered closer to home, in the nearby Tel al-Hawa neighborhood in western Gaza City.\nBut late on Jan. 28, Israeli forces returned to western Gaza City in numbers. Posts on social media show heavy gunfire and airstrikes in that part of the city just after midnight local time. At 9:32 a.m., the IDF issued a call in Arabic on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, asking residents in the west of Gaza City — including the Tel al-Hawa area — to evacuate immediately.\nHind's uncle, Bashar, and his wife packed her into the car along with her four cousins, Bashar's brother Samir said. They planned to drive north, out of the evacuation zone and back toward the family home in northern Gaza City.\nThe family stopped less than a quarter of a mile from where they started.\nAround 1 p.m., Hind's cousin, 15-year-old Layan, called Samir. She told him they were surrounded and the Israeli army had opened fire on their car.\n​​Everyone in the vehicle, except for Hind and Layan, were dead, she said. Samir called another uncle, Mohammed, who eventually reached the PRCS.\nA dispatcher, Omar al-Qam, first reached Layan around 2:30 p.m.\nThe girl screamed, and the call dropped. \"Hello,' Qam shouted. 'Hello?'\nWhile Qam spoke to Layan, 62 gunshots are audible over six seconds in two bursts of fire on a recording of the call, according to Earshot, a nonprofit that conducts investigations using audio evidence.\nSteven Beck, an acoustic analyst who consulted with the FBI for more than a decade, examined the recording at the request of The Post, and found the number of rounds per minute fired was faster than an automatic AK-patterned rifle, which Hamas fighters often use. The rate, he said, was more akin to weapons commonly issued to Israeli forces. Earshot also found the rate of fire to be faster than an AK-patterned rifle.\nThe call, which began around 2:30 p.m., ended in less than a minute.\nA satellite image captured by Planet Labs roughly an hour later, at 3:31 p.m., shows at least four Israeli armored vehicles around 300 meters up the road from the girls.\nHind Map\n3:31 pm: Israeli military vehicles pictured\nHind's family car stop point\n350 FEET\nN\n3:31 pm: Israeli military vehicles pictured\nHind's family car stop point\n350 FEET\nN\nWill Goodhind, an imagery analyst with Contested Ground — an open-access satellite research group focused on military, humanitarian and international affairs — who examined the satellite imagery at the request of The Post, said the armored vehicles at the intersection closest to Hind are 'tactically placed' and appear to provide a 'prominent, visible presence to deter (and respond to) enemy attacks,' amid ongoing ground operations.\nMore than a dozen other Israeli armored vehicles are visible within a quarter-mile of the Hamada family car, the image shows.\nThe vehicles match the approximate size and have turret-like structures similar to at least four Israeli tracked vehicles, according to Goodhind. Of those, only the Merkava tank has been seen in action in Gaza, according to Sonny Butterworth, senior analyst with the defense intelligence firm Janes. The similarly sized Namer armored personnel carrier and Puma combat engineering vehicle have also been seen in action in Gaza, but lack the turret-like structure.\nThe Merkava, the Namer and the Puma all have 7.62 caliber machine guns, Butterworth said. The guns can fire at a rate consistent with what Beck and Earshot concluded was heard in the audio of Layan's last call.\nAfter Qam's call with Layan ended, the PRCS operations room called back immediately and Hind answered. Layan was dead and tanks were moving toward the car, she told another dispatcher, Rana Faqih. Hind described the presence of tanks at least five more times throughout the call.\n(Palestine Red Crescent Society)\n5:40 p.m.\nThe Palestine Red Crescent routinely coordinates the passage of its ambulances with Israeli authorities, in the hope of securing safe access to areas where the situation on the ground is potentially dangerous.\nFathi Abu Warda — a liaison between the Palestinian Authority's health ministry in Ramallah and COGAT, an arm of the Israeli Defense Ministry that oversees the Palestinian territories — said that permission for an ambulance to proceed to Hind arrived in the form of a route map from COGAT. Abu Warda sent the map to the PRCS dispatch team on WhatsApp at 5:40 p.m., according to messages reviewed by The Post.\nThe map, reviewed by The Post, appears to have been made in Google Maps and has a clear blue line, instructing the ambulance drivers to follow an indirect route that avoided much of the evacuation area.\nIsmail Al-Ghoul, a correspondent with the Al Jazeera news agency, said he was sitting with the paramedics, Yousef Zeino and Ahmed al-Madhoun, at Al-Ahli hospital, when they received the map. The paramedics headed out quickly to the location where Hind was trapped. It was roughly two miles away — down Beirut street, then right, and onto Al Majdal Street.\n'The details were completely clear,' Ghoul said.\nThe paramedics had just turned onto Al Majdal Street, the lights of the ambulance flashing, when Zeino reported that a green laser was hovering just in front of them.\nThe dispatcher told the ambulance to keep moving, slowly. Seconds later, the line drops.\nThe ambulance was later found roughly 50 meters south of Hind's family car and about 350 meters south of where military vehicles had been captured in satellite imagery just over two hours earlier.\nIn a statement posted at 9:02 p.m. local time, the IDF said their forces had 'cut off Gaza City, with one force arriving from the north towards the south, while a second force arrived from the south to the north.' They traveled 'through the city center to Shifa hospital' the statement said.\nAl-Shifa, which Israel has repeatedly targeted, alleging that Hamas fighters are regrouping there, is roughly three-quarters of a mile from where the Hamada family car stopped.\nThe green laser — known as a dazzler — would normally suggest that the ambulance was identified but not necessarily targeted by a ground unit operating ahead of the armed vehicles, according to Avihai Stollar, a researcher with Breaking the Silence, an advocacy group composed of Israeli army veterans that oppose the occupation that compiled testimonies from former soldiers.\nThe IDF, in response to questions from The Post, did not clarify if the green dazzler belonged to its forces and what signal it may have been intended to send.\nSocial media posts from 2018 suggest that Hamas and other Palestinian resistance groups have also used green dazzlers to obscure Israeli soldiers' eyesight. Ashka Jhaveri, a researcher at the Institute for the Study of War, a group that closely monitors conflicts, said she had not observed the use of green dazzlers by either side in this conflict.\nby either side in this conflict.\n6 p.m.\nAs the call with the paramedics drops at 6 p.m., a bang is audible on the call with Hind.\nBut the call with the girl continued, suggesting that cellphone service was not cut.\nRed Crescent dispatchers had managed to patch Hind's mother, Wesam, into the call in the hope that it might calm the child.\nWhen the bang echoed out through the phone line, Wesam cried out: 'Hanood, are you okay?'\nA moment later, Hind replied.\n'Yes,' she said.\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nBy this point, everyone on the call with Hind — her family, the dispatchers — were praying they would not lose her too. She was falling silent for long periods. The team did what they could to keep her talking, but it was clear that the child's thoughts had begun to loop. She just kept saying, 'Come get me, quickly.'\nIf the phone ran out of battery, Faqih told her, she was to stay in the car, where they could still find her. 'If night comes and we don't come, close your eyes so that you don't see the tanks.'\nThey lost contact with her soon after 6 p.m., spokeswoman Nebal Farsakh recalled.\nNo one spoke much after that. The room felt muffled with shock. They tried to call Hind again and again, Farsakh said, but no one answered.\nTwelve days later\nThe ambulance had come to a stop where a dark spot resembling a scorch mark first appeared in satellite imagery taken at 10:21 a.m. on Jan. 30 — the morning after contact with the paramedics and Hind were lost.\nWhen the IDF withdrew from the area nearly two weeks later on Feb. 10, Palestinian residents, including Samir, Hind's uncle, and a civil defense crew found a haunting scene.\nThe door and pieces of the hood of the family car had been torn off. Samir described his brother's body as 'dangling' from the driver's seat. The stench of decomposing corpses clung to the vehicle. He struggled to look at the bodies of the five children sandwiched on the back seat. Hind sat to the right of Layan, who was behind the driver. A page from what looks like a coloring book was crumpled where the their feet would have rested. The bodies were so decomposed that it was not possible immediately see where the gunshots had hit them, Samir said. 'We were only able to deduce their identities,\" he recalled.\nHoles in the Hamada family car were probably made by a 7.62 caliber machine gun, a weapon fixed to the Merkava, Namer and Puma, said Andrew Galer, head of the land platform and weapons team at defense intelligence firm Janes, who examined photos and video of the aftermath.\nAndrew Galer, head of the land platform and weapons team at defense intelligence firm Janes, who examined photos and video of the aftermath.\nArmored vehicles, including some that roughly match the size of those seen in the Jan. 29 satellite imagery, were also present in the same location multiple times in the following 12 days.\nSatellite imagery of an intersection just shy of 1000 feet from Hind that was taken on Jan. 29, Feb. 7 and Feb. 8 shows armored vehicles.\nA fragment of a U.S.-made 120mm round, which can be fired by the Merkava, was visible in video and images after rescue crews searched the scenes.\nThe Post was not able to determine exactly where just north of the ambulance the fragment was originally found or if it was directly connected to the ambulance strike given the time elapsed and the ongoing fighting.\nBright yellow lot production codes on the munition identified it as a U.S. made high explosive antitank round produced in November of 1996. (Obtained by the Washington Post)\nThe ambulance was a burned out shell, video shows, and almost nothing remained of the paramedics's bodies. There was a hole approximately 300 millimeters in diameter adjacent to where the license plate would have been.\n'The damage to the rear does look like the exit of a projectile,' Chris Cobb-Smith, a security consultant and former artillery officer in the British army, wrote in a message, noting that it appeared to be 'targeted with a direct fire munition' and was 'approximately the size of a tank shell.'\nN.R. Jenzen-Jones, the director of Armament Research Services, added it appeared to exit 'the vehicle relatively level to the ground,' which suggests it was 'fired from ground level on a fairly flat trajectory, rather than an air-delivered or indirect-fire munition.'\nA round fired by a tank is just one possibility, Jenzen-Jones and multiple other experts cautioned, noting that there is little data on craft-produced Hamas munitions and few tests have been done to predict what would happen if other munitions were used against a thin-skinned vehicle. Common rocket launchers used by Hamas are able to fire different antitank rounds, including the standard PG-7, which could not create the observed damage, according to munitions experts.\n(Palestine Red Crescent Society)\nNone of the six munitions experts interviewed by The Post could say definitively what munition caused the damage or killed the paramedics based on the ambulance alone because of the time elapsed and the complexity of urban combat. They agreed, however, the damage to the ambulance was consistent with the potential use of a round fired from Israeli tanks that match the vehicles captured in satellite imagery in the area that day.\nThe seven bodies of the Hamada family were buried at al-Shifa Hospital. There was no medical report, Samir said.\n'All that mattered to us at that moment was to retrieve them and bury them in a decent way.'",

            "summary": "In the bright, optimistic days of early October, Spencer Carbery sat back in his chair and made a proclamation. The rookie head coach of the Washington Capitals was visiting The Washington Post for a preseason roundtable with reporters and editors. He was one week away from coaching his first regular season game, and when he spoke, he didn't couch his statement with any qualifiers or hypotheticals.\nWith a quiet, assured confidence, he didn't need any.\n'I still feel like we have a very competitive team,' Carbery said. 'I understand what's going on from our roster's age and where we need to go, building for the future and integrating young players, but I still, as the head coach, have a lot of belief in our group.\n'I think we can be threading the needle and also be very, very competitive and be a playoff team. That's what I believe. … Whatever you want to say about last year, I still think that we're capable of being a playoff team.'\nIn the preseason, every team believes that it is capable of making the playoffs. Every new-hire head coach believes that they're positioned to right the wrongs of the previous regime and turn over a new leaf. At the time, Carbery's statement rang more like the bravado, if not naiveté, of a young, first-year coach who had little idea how difficult the road ahead would be.\nAdvertisement\nBut six months and 10 days after Carbery said those words, his Capitals proved him right. With a win over the Philadelphia Flyers on Tuesday, Washington secured the second wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference and is back in the Stanley Cup playoffs.\nThe Capitals, who missed the playoffs last season, have the worst goal differential, minus-37, of any playoff team in the salary cap era. In nine of their last 10 games, and 42 of 82 overall, they scored two or fewer goals. Their power play, which spent so much of the season at the very bottom of the league, only rose to 17th — still in the bottom half.\nAnd they're in the playoffs.\n'I believed in this group the whole way through,' goaltender Charlie Lindgren, who emerged this season as the Capitals' No. 1 goalie and sometimes single-handedly kept them afloat, said Tuesday. 'Obviously, there were times where maybe it looked like it was maybe going to be a little bit of a stretch, but certainly there was no give-up at all in this group. It says a lot about the guys in the locker room. All the credit goes to them.'\nAdvertisement\nWashington also traded away winger Anthony Mantha, who scored 20 goals in 56 games, and depth defenseman Joel Edmundson ahead of the deadline. It could have been a moment when the Capitals decided to pack it in and focus on next year. Instead, it proved to be a turning point of their season.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'There's so many different moments where this team has shown its true character throughout this year of finding different ways to win,' Carbery said after Monday's shutout of the Boston Bruins. 'And, as well, when our backs were against the wall and our season was on the brink in multiple situations — post-deadline, we move some guys out. Easy for our group to say, ‘You know what? It's been a great run. We're not going for it this year, so we'll just ride off into the sunset.'\n'It wasn't even close to that. Our guys are like, ‘We're going to find a way.' '\nAdvertisement\nThat sentiment became something of a mantra for Washington as the season went along and it became clear that these Capitals were not going to be the run-and-gun, score-at-will version of years past. They had to win games the hard way — grinding out one-goal wins and battling for every inch of ice, on every shift, every night.\nThat was true of their first victory of the season, a 3-2 shootout win over the Calgary Flames on Oct. 16, and it was true of their last win of the regular season slate, which needed an empty-net game-winner from T.J. Oshie to seal the deal, and of so many of the 38 wins in between.\nBut as Washington beat the odds and won three games in four nights to close the regular season and secure a spot in the playoffs, their almost-defiant attitude harked back to Carbery's first mantra for his group: something to prove.\nAdvertisement\n'This is the first time in a long, long time where the narrative in the hockey world has a lot of doubt in this group,' Carbery said in October. 'If you read any article, not one is saying, ‘Watch out for the Washington Capitals. This is a playoff team.' '\nThe Capitals rallied around the idea of proving those doubters wrong, regardless of how long their odds of doing so seemed.\n'It's a situation when nobody thought we were gonna be in,' captain Alex Ovechkin, who scored his 31st goal of the season and 853rd of his career in Tuesday's victory, said as he reflected on what his team had accomplished. 'But we win. … We battled through lots of difficult moments, injuries, trades and we still believe. The most important thing is belief. We all believe in each other.'",

            "summary": "TYBEE ISLAND, Ga. — Thousands of Black college students expected this weekend for an annual spring bash at Georgia's largest public beach will be greeted by dozens of extra police officers and barricades closing off neighborhood streets. While the beach will remain open, officials are blocking access to nearby parking.\nTybee Island east of Savannah has grappled with the April beach party known as Orange Crush since students at Savannah State University, a historically Black school, started it more than 30 years ago. Residents regularly groused about loud music, trash littering the sand and revelers urinating in yards.\nThose complaints boiled over into fear and outrage a year ago when record crowds estimated at more than 100,000 people overwhelmed the 3-mile (4.8 kilometer) island. That left a small police force scrambling to handle a flood of emergency calls reporting gunfire, drug overdoses, traffic jams and fist fights.\nAdvertisement\nMayor Brian West, elected last fall by Tybee Island's 3,100 residents, said roadblocks and added police aren't just for limiting crowds. He hopes the crackdown will drive Orange Crush away for good.\n'This has to stop. We can't have this crowd anymore,' West said. 'My goal is to end it.'\nCritics say local officials are overreacting and appear to be singling out Black visitors to a Southern beach that only white people could use until 1963. They note Tybee Island attracts vast crowds for the Fourth of July and other summer weekends when visitors are largely white, as are 92% of the island's residents.\n'Our weekends are packed with people all season, but when Orange Crush comes they shut down the parking, bring extra police and act like they have to take charge,' said Julia Pearce, one of the island's few Black residents and leader of a group called the Tybee MLK Human Rights Organization. She added: 'They believe Black folks to be criminals.'\nAdvertisement\nDuring the week, workers placed metal barricades to block off parking meters and residential streets along the main road parallel to the beach. Two large parking lots near a popular pier are being closed. And Tybee Island's roughly two dozen police officers will be augmented by about 100 sheriff's deputies, Georgia state troopers and other officers.\nSecurity plans were influenced by tactics used last month to reduce crowds and violence at spring break in Miami Beach, which was observed by Tybee Island's police chief.\nOfficials insist they're acting to avoid a repeat of last year's Orange Crush party, which they say became a public safety crisis with crowds at least double their typical size.\n'To me, it has nothing to do with race,' said West, who believes city officials previously haven't taken a stronger stand against Orange Crush because they feared being called racist. 'We can't let that be a reason to let our citizens be unsafe and so we're not.'\nAdvertisement\nTybee Island police reported 26 total arrests during Orange Crush last year. Charges included one armed robbery with a firearm, four counts of fighting in public and five DUIs. Two officers reported being pelted with bottles, and two women told police they were beaten and robbed of a purse.\nOn a gridlocked highway about a mile off the island, someone fired a gun a into a car and injured one person. A white man was charged in the shooting, which officials blamed on road rage.\nOrange Crush's supporters and detractors alike say it's not college students causing the worst problems.\nJoshua Miller, a 22-year-old Savannah State University senior who plans to attend this weekend, said he wouldn't be surprised if the crackdown was at least partly motivated by race.\n'I don't know what they have in store,' Miller said. 'I'm not going down there with any ill intent. I'm just going out there to have fun.'\nAdvertisement\nSavannah Mayor Van Johnson was one of the Black students from Savannah State who helped launch Orange Crush in 1988. The university dropped involvement in the 1990s, and Johnson said that over time the celebration 'got off the rails.' But he also told reporters he's concerned about 'over-representation of police' at the beach party.\nAt Nickie's 1971 Bar & Grill near the beach, general manager Sean Ensign said many neighboring shops and eateries will close for Orange Crush though his will stay open, selling to-go food orders like last year. But with nearby parking spaces closed, Ensign said his profits might take a hit, 'possibly a few thousand dollars.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIt's not the first time Tybee Island has targeted the Black beach party. In 2017, the city council banned alcohol and amplified music on the beach only during Orange Crush weekend. A discrimination complaint to the U.S. Justice Department resulted in city officials signing a non-binding agreement to impose uniform rules for large events.\nAdvertisement\nWest says Orange Crush is different because it's promoted on social media by people who haven't obtained permits. A new state law lets local governments recoup public safety expenses from organizers of unpermitted events.\nIn February, Britain Wigfall was denied an permit for space on the island for food trucks during Orange Crush. The mayor said Wigfall has continued to promote events on the island.\nWigfall, 30, said he's promoting a concert this weekend in Savannah, but nothing on Tybee Island involving Orange Crush.",

This piece is excerpted from a series of talks he is giving at Georgetown University this week .\nMohsin Hamid's most recent novel is 'The Last White Man.' This piece is excerpted from a series of talks he is giving at Georgetown University this week. When it comes to our understanding of the world, we are all like the blind men in the story of the blind men and the elephant. We each know the elephant from our own small vantage point, and what we know is partial and prone to distortions. It is from speaking to one another, reading one another, that a more accurate picture appears. Unfortunately, too often, those we speak to, and also those we read, come from places very close to ours, whether physically or ideologically, and so the elephant we see together looks to us uncannily like something else: a wall or a weapon or a trophy, perhaps.\nI will here describe the elephant — the world — as I perceive it from my vantage point in Lahore, Pakistan, in the hope that this will be of some use to you, in the place where you are.\nAdvertisement\nThe first thing that strikes me about the world is that it is has become poisonous. We cannot breathe. From November until February, the blue sky is hidden behind a low ceiling of gray. This is not from clouds but from smoke. It is uncanny to take a flight in these months, to burst only seconds after takeoff into the blindingly bright light and see not a city but a gray blanket below. The cooler months used to be months of outdoor sports and running around with my cousins and shielding eyes with the blades of our hands from the sun. Now they are months when the land receives too little heat to push the smoke into the heavens, and so it settles all over the riverine plains, prevented from proceeding north by the mass of the Himalayas, choking us.\nMy children are not permitted to do outdoor sports in these months. Indoors, they sleep to the whirring sound of air purifiers, machines I had not imagined until recently. When we played in the winter as children, we would quench our thirst by working the shaft of the hand-pump in my grandparents' house. Now, our children do not go out to play. The hand-pumps are all dry. We have depleted the aquifer. A machine bore is required to obtain water from hundreds of meters down, and that water too has been contaminated. Our world has become poisonous: The fireflies are gone, the children cough like smokers, the water is full of heavy metals. The economic miracle we have been promised has arrived, and it is a miracle of despoliation.\nThe other thing that strikes me about the world is that it has become brutal. Perhaps people have always been slaughtered the way that people in Gaza are being slaughtered. My children watch, on their devices, Gazan children speak of dead parents and siblings and teachers and neighbors. My children come home from school and ask: 'What can we do? What can we do?' They post flags and images of solidarity on social media. They share songs and stories. They wave and get excited when they see a rickshaw or a stall with a message of support for the people of Palestine. My daughter is fasting this month, and we discuss the contrast between the voluntary exposure of a person to daily hunger and the experience of famine. We raise money for refugee relief and reconstructive surgeries and family exit fees.\n'What can we do? What can we do?' They post flags and images of solidarity on social media.

My daughter is fasting this month, and we discuss the contrast between the voluntary exposure of a person to daily hunger and the experience of famine. We raise money for refugee relief and reconstructive surgeries and family exit fees.\nPerhaps people have always been slaughtered like this. But have they always been slaughtered with such hypocrisy? Have those who protest for peace and equality and human rights ever been so vilified and subjected to threats — of a lost job, a lost chance at citizenship, a suspension from university — by such powerful actors in such powerful countries, countries that claim to stand for these very values? Perhaps they have: I was not alive when British colonial officers ordered the gunning down of peaceful protesters in Amritsar, or when American police officers attacked peaceful protesters in Selma. But the hypocrisy and silence of the powerful regarding the massacres in Gaza feels new to me. It feels new to my children, too. I watch them as they reject the moral trajectory of the world. I watch them as they reject even certain soft drinks and hamburgers, tainted by association.\nAdvertisement\nWhen I perceive the elephant, I perceive poison and brutality. I perceive love and kindness and beauty, too, but these things emerge like flowers from cracks in concrete. I take pleasure and sustenance from the flowers. But then I wonder, why did our world government lead us on this path to the laying down of so much concrete?\nA world government is often thought of as a fantasy, dystopian or utopian, depending on how it is imagined and by whom it is beheld, but regardless as something we situate in the future. The truth, however, is that it belongs in the recent past. For we have had a world government, the first of its kind, and that world government was the United States. From the fall of the Berlin Wall to the fall of Kabul, America played a role in governing the world that was unprecedented — unprecedented but also now ending. Ending because too many Americans do not want America to play that role and because too many non-Americans do not want America to play that role, and as that role ends, so does the world that role made possible.",

            "summary": "Jaslyne Ivey had every reason to be nervous as she stepped into the batter's box. It was, after all, her first time seeing live pitching on a baseball field. Everything about that afternoon had felt abnormal — she was even a bit surprised to see her name on Bowie's lineup card before the Bulldogs' season opener at Laurel.\nThe ball was smaller than what she was accustomed to, a white dot darting from strange angles. The bat weighed heavy on her shoulder. But, as a pitch arrived, instinct kicked in. Ivey sent a flare over the shortstop's head and strolled to first base as two runs scored. It was the first hit of her freshman season and her high school baseball career.\nIn the bottom half of the inning, a groundball found her at second base. With ample time to gather herself, she cleanly made the play, throwing to first for the out.\nAdvertisement\n'Word started to spread,' Bulldogs Coach Gorman Johnson III said. ' ‘They got a girl at Bowie, and she's legit.' '\nIvey, now a sophomore, spends plenty of time between the chalk lines of a baseball field, but her true home is the softball diamond, where her ambition is to play at the college level. College coaches aren't allowed to offer her visits or scholarships until August, but she sees them watching as she competes on the club circuit for Glory Softball's 16U national team.\nThis spring, she has helped Bowie's baseball team — which is gunning for its first region championship since 2016 — get off to a hot start as the starting second baseman. The Bulldogs are 9-2, one of the best records in Prince George's County.\nComing into high school, Ivey had a blueprint to follow: Her sister, Taylor, is a sophomore pitcher at Hampton after spending four years playing softball at Bowie. The softball scene in Prince George's County is mostly casual, dominated by the few players and teams that take a strong interest in the game. Ivey had a front-row seat for Taylor's high school career, becoming bored with the monotony of her sister's success.\nAdvertisement\nAs she approached her freshman year of high school, Ivey began to question whether her sister's path was right for her. She didn't think playing high school softball at Bowie would expose her to a level of competition worth her while.\nHer parents agreed. It was time to find a new challenge.\nIvey's decision came down to baseball or track, and she doesn't love running. When March 1 came along, she was at baseball tryouts, hoping to make a strong first impression.\n'I was very nervous going in,' Ivey said. 'Talking to the coaches, they pulled me aside. They said, ‘Hey, I saw your name, and it sounded like a girl's name.' I showed up with my visor, and they saw what I could do.'\nBowie infield coach Willie Hines said Ivey was the best defensive player at the tryout, regardless of position.\n'It was kind of mind-blowing and impressive at the same time,' he said. 'We instantly knew that she needed to be on the team.'\nAdvertisement\nIvey still sports a softball visor and a full-cage batting helmet, but she has the instincts and footwork of an experienced baseball player. She is smooth in the field, so much so that Bowie's coaching staff named her the team's top defensive player at the end of last season.\n'It was inspiring to me to see her come out to a sport that's not usually for women,' shortstop Taylor Brown said. 'When I saw her come out and have the courage to try out — and make the team — that inspired me to be better.'\nThere was still a transition period last spring as Ivey became accustomed to the intricacies of baseball. Used to crowding the plate, Ivey was hit by pitches more often than her teammates, and the trip to first base was 30 feet longer than she was used to. Also, a new position on a bigger field means taking different angles to the ball, and throwing a baseball required slightly different mechanics.\n'I personally think it's easier,' she said.\nHelping guide Ivey was Emma Craig, a catcher and former T-ball teammate who also joined the Bulldogs' baseball team last spring. Craig played softball at Bowie for two seasons but left the program once Taylor Ivey and another college-bound teammate graduated. Craig provides Ivey another girl to talk with and, when necessary, a ride to and from practice. If the rest of Ivey's teammates are a group of older brothers, Craig is her big sister.\nAdvertisement\n'We talk about everything,' Ivey said. 'I'm really glad that she's here. Just to have someone to talk to — I don't want to talk to a whole bunch of boys all the time.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBut Craig is a senior this year, off to play softball at Livingstone College next season. It's one of a few reasons Ivey has considered a transfer to a private school, where she would have an opportunity to play softball year-round like the rest of her Glory teammates. Johnson believes Ivey could excel further in the private ranks and is trying to help her attain a scholarship to lighten the load of a move.\n'I [don't think] we're holding her back,' Johnson said. 'But I think she would excel a whole lot more at one of those schools.'\nThat decision will be made later. For now, Ivey dons the Bowie baseball uniform with pride. She has embraced the challenges and joys her new sport presents.\n'I'm glad I did it. It's been really fun,' she said. 'Nobody expects to see a girl when they play, so I like showing that I can do it.'",

            "excerpt": "A House committee voted nearly unanimously for a bill that would provide more accountability and oversight on federal prisons with a long list of problems.",
            "summary": "The Federal Bureau of Prisons has long been an agency in crisis, with poorly managed facilities that are unsafe for inmates and employees alike.\nIn March, The Washington Post reported on three critical federal watchdog reports released that month alone and the BOP's inclusion last year on the Government Accountability Office's biennial 'High-Risk List' because it has such serious, ongoing problems.\nNow, finally, Congress is working to change the BOP's noxious reputation with last week's 41-1 approval of the Federal Prison Oversight Act, by the often partisan House Oversight and Accountability Committee.\nPerhaps by coincidence, the bureau this week announced the closing of one of the most disgraceful prisons, the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin, Calif., a women's facility that the Associated Press reported had gained the moniker 'rape club' among workers and prisoners. Even a former warden and chaplain there were convicted on sexual abuse charges.\nAdvertisement\nInstead of calling for new facilities or big staffing increases, the bill focuses on transparency and an 'inspection regime' bolstered by an empowered Justice Department inspector general and a new ombudsman position exclusively for the prison agency. With 'access to all Bureau facilities' at any time, without prior notice, as the bill provides, they could shine light on the system's dark and dangerous practices.\nRep. Lucy McBath's motivation to introduce the bill was personal, but not in the way you might expect.\n'My son, Jordan Davis, was killed at just 17 years old by a man with a gun who is now serving a life sentence in prison,' the Georgia Democrat said by email. 'Through my family's pain, I have found the strength to forgive my son's killer. I heard from advocates and leadership within the Department of Justice and Bureau of Prisons that additional reforms were needed to protect staff and incarcerated individuals in our prison system, so I introduced this bill in the House.'\nAdvertisement\nIn March, David C. Fathi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union National Prison Project, lambasted the BOP as 'a profoundly broken agency' in a Post interview. Now he is more optimistic, describing the bill in a phone interview as 'a major step forward for transparency. … Prison oversight is just essential. Prisons are closed institutions, and they house people who are unpopular and politically powerless. So, without some kind of oversight, that is a recipe for neglect and mistreatment and abuse.'\nUnder the bill, which must be approved by the full House and Senate before becoming law, the Justice Department's inspector general would conduct periodic prison inspections. The attorney general would be mandated to ensure the inspectors have 'access to any covered facility, including the incarcerated people, detainees, staff, bargaining unit representative organization, and any other information' needed.\nThe legislation says the assessments 'may include' incarceration conditions; staff adequacy and working conditions; availability of recidivism-reduction programs; solitary- and restrictive-confinement practices; prison medical and mental health services; and violence, sexual abuse and excessive-force allegations.\nAdvertisement\nAfter the inspections, a report on the findings would be available to Congress, employee organizations and the public. Prison officials would have 60 days to respond in writing to the report, which must include a 'corrective action plan.'\nA 'risk score' based on a variety of issues would be developed for each facility by the inspector general's office and sent to the House and Senate judiciary committees. Higher-risk prisons would be inspected more frequently.\nOne new element in prison accountability would be a dedicated prison ombudsman who takes complaints from inmates, employees or others 'regarding issues that may adversely affect the health, safety, welfare, or rights of incarcerated people or staff.' The ombudsman would decide the merits of each complaint and report the findings to the BOP.

            "excerpt": "'The Wide Wide Sea,' by Hampton Sides, recounts Cook's search for the Northwest Passage",
            "summary": "I'm grateful to the Santa Fe bookseller who put Hampton Sides's 'Blood and Thunder' into my hands some years ago. With Kit Carson's death-defying exploits at its center, the book revolutionized my concept of America's westward expansion. Sides's latest effort, 'The Wide Wide Sea,' is a gripping account of Captain James Cook's final voyage.\nCook is a controversial historical figure, especially in light of increasing consciousness about the evils of colonialism. Yet he continues to evoke curiosity and attention. As recently as last month, Popular Mechanics published an article about the rediscovery of his curated shell collection.\nSides does not skirt the rapacious appetites of the British and other European monarchies. The magic of this book, however, is in the details of the explorer's life at sea. Sides relies on Cook's writings as well those of other sailors on the voyage. Based on the selected bibliography he includes, Sides's research was voluminous.\nAdvertisement\nCook had made two world voyages by the time the book opens. He was a celebrity, having 'risen from virtually nothing.' At sea, he'd bucked the Royal Navy's tradition of violence and cruelty. He'd figured out how to avoid scurvy and brought home information of incomparable value, had mastered new nautical instruments and served as an expert scientist, anthropologist and navigator. His mapmaking skills were superlative.\nAfter only six months at home, he took off again, in search of the elusive Northwest Passage. His third expedition consisted of 180 people in two wooden ships, the Resolution and the Discovery. They left England in July 1776.\nIn addition to Cook's story, other narratives weave through the book. One particularly fascinating account is that of Mai, a native of Raiatea, a volcanic island 130 miles northwest of present-day Tahiti. When Mai was a boy, warriors from Bora Bora invaded Raiatea, murdered his father, seized his family's land and enslaved much of the population, forcing his family to take refuge in Tahiti. In 1767, a teenage Mai witnessed the English navy's firepower when Samuel Wallis, a British navigator arrived in the HMS Dolphin and fought the Tahitians. Vowing to avenge his people against Bora Bora, Mai concluded that English guns were the way to go. When Cook sailed in seven years later on his second Pacific voyage, Mai requested passage, becoming the first Polynesian to set foot on English soil.\nMai's story reads as metaphor for colonialism. He learned English and was wined and dined as a celebrity. Although horrified by London's grinding poverty, unthinkable in his homeland, he wore the local dress and adopted the manners of a foppish English gentleman. He met King George, who provided Mai and Cook with a large assortment of farm animals and domesticated birds, to cement the king's footprint around the globe. No surprise — the animals were hell to care for. Mai had been in search of heavy artillery from King George, but for the voyage was given only an 'arsenal of muskets [and] broadswords,' as well as gifts that would have been unimaginable to the Polynesians — cut-glass bows, laced hats, crockery and telescopes. If not the cache Mai hoped for, it does reflect the English royalty's strategy for winning friends.\nIt isn't possible in this short space to describe Sides's hair-raising accounts of the journey, an itinerary that led from England to present day South Africa, South America, Australia, New Zealand, Polynesia, Hawaii, north to Alaska and beyond, and back to Hawaii. Just repairing and re-provisioning the ship required herculean efforts. The physical threats included days-long ocean storms, fog so thick it wasn't possible to see from stern to bow and cold temperatures against which no garment could protect.\nAdvertisement\nBy the time Cook reached Polynesia in October 1777, the rat infestation was so great that 'the vermin had all but taken over the holds, gangways, and lower decks.' At Moorea, 12 miles from Tahiti, Cook created a 'swinging bridge' from ropes to lure the rats on land. A few made it to the beaches, introducing Polynesia to the European black rats which remain a 'scourge' today.\nCook understood that his men were vectors for infection. An ascetic, he occasionally stopped his men from going ashore to prevent the spread of venereal disease. At times he restrained his crew from violence; at other times, his temper was uncontrollable. After a series of petty thefts from the ship by Tongo natives, Cook ordered brutal floggings and had a villager's ears cut off. In punishment for one Moorea person stealing a goat, Cook had the village and its cropland torched, along with its canoes. Sides suggests that over the course of this final voyage, Cook may have been suffering declining mental faculties.\nBy August 1778, the two ships were in the Arctic Ocean sailing toward Siberia. Cook was careful, 'zagging outward if the pincers of ice began to close in on his vessels.' When he finally concluded there was no Northwest Passage, he decided to salvage his 'defeat,' by doing 'reconnaissance work in Hawai'i.' A man onboard wrote, 'Those who have been amongst ice, in the dread of being enclosed in it, and in so late a season, can be the best judge of the general joy this news gave.'\nAdvertisement\nPeople tend to know Cook was killed by native people in Hawaii. The events leading up to his death are gruesome and upsetting, including 'cannibalism' made more explicable in Sides's measured account.\nThis book captures a time when Europeans were finding unfathomable new worlds. Armed with extensive research and terrific writing, Sides recreates the newness of the experience, the vast differences in and among Indigenous cultures, and natural phenomena that were as terrifying as they were wondrous.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nMartha Anne Toll's prizewinning debut novel, 'Three Muses,' was published in 2022.

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Some Democrats are entertaining the prospect of coming to House Speaker Mike Johnson's rescue should Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., force a vote seeking his ouster, though it will likely depend on his ability to deliver an emergency aid package focused on Ukraine and Israel.\nDemocratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has suggested that Democrats would help Johnson if the speaker faced retribution from within his own party for holding votes on the $95.3 billion package. But he's also encouraging his colleagues to take a wait-and-see approach to apply maximum leverage.\n'Do not box yourself in with a public statement,' Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark, the No. 2-ranking House Democratic leader, told colleagues in a closed-door session Thursday, according to a person familiar with the private remarks.\nAdvertisement\nStill, Johnson's future been a much discussed topic on Capitol Hill — even more so after Republican leadership on Thursday floated the possibility of changing the House rules to make it easier for a speaker to withstand a challenge from members of their own party. With or without the rule change, Johnson may need Democratic support to remain as speaker if Greene or someone else forces a vote.\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., said if the aid package makes it over the finish line, 'I think a lot of people are not going to want to punish him for doing the right thing.'\nGreene has threatened to try to oust Johnson and warned that advancing funding for Ukraine would help build her case that GOP lawmakers should select a new speaker. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., tweeted this week that he told Johnson during a closed-door Republican conference meeting that he would be co-sponsoring Greene's motion. Massie suggested Johnson 'should pre-announce his resignation' and give Republicans time to select a successor.\nAdvertisement\nThe vast majority of Republicans are distancing themselves from Greene's effort, wary of repeating the chaos the House endured last fall when eight Republicans joined with Democrats in removing then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., from the post. It's likely that Johnson would not need a large number of Democratic lawmakers to help him remain in the speaker's office, but it would depend on how many Republicans voted to remove him.\nRep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., said that if Johnson would put the Senate-passed measure on the floor, 'I would do what I had to do to make sure he does not lose his job for that.' Johnson made the decision to take the Senate measure and break it into three separate bills. He's also added a fourth bill focused on national security priorities.\nBreaking up the package into parts gives lawmakers the ability to vote against military assistance to Ukraine or Israel without tanking the entire measure.\nAdvertisement\nJohnson said he has not asked a single Democrat to 'get involved in that at all' when asked about a possible motion to vacate.\n'I do not spend time walking around thinking about the motion to vacate,' Johnson said. 'I have a job to do here and I'm going to do the job, regardless of personal consequences.'\nRep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., said he would consider voting present during a speaker vote if Johnson allowed the Ukraine aid to be voted on.\n'Why in the world would I want to go along with Marjorie Taylor Greene if Mike Johnson just gave us a vote I've been advocating for for more than six months?' Boyle said. 'I think a number of Democrats would be in the same position — not necessarily a vote for him, but just make clear this is a Republican issue and we're not going to aid and abet Marjorie Taylor Greene to cause even more chaos.'\nAdvertisement\n'I hope he will have some sort of conversation with Hakeem, but either way, yes, I'm one of those who would save him if we can do Israel, Taiwan, Ukraine and some reasonable border security,' said Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas.\nOther Democrats said helping Johnson must come as part of a package deal. They said he shouldn't expect Democratic support just by putting the Senate-passed package up for a vote. He'll need to have coordinated with Jeffries as well.\n'We're just not going to go and bail out one of the most conservative Republican speakers in American history. But what Kevin McCarthy failed to do is even entertain a conversation to try to make a deal. Democrats were ready to deal. Kevin McCarthy refused to,' said Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass. 'If Speaker Johnson cares about doing the right thing as well as keeping his job, then he ought to make a deal with Democrats.'\nAdvertisement\nRep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., said there is a 'powerful instinct' among Democrats that it's not their job to rescue Johnson from the chaos in his party. But he's willing to help Johnson on the motion to vacate if he were to 'do the right thing' on the aid package and coordinate that with Jeffries.\n'I will defer to getting things done as opposed to tying myself up in partisan knots, but it's going to be Hakeem who decides how we act,' Himes said. 'We're not going to let the Republicans sort of chip off a number of us. This will be negotiated with our leadership.'\nRep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, said he's unlikely to help Johnson and is not sure how long the speaker would be around anyway if he has to rely on Democratic votes to continue on the job.\n'I've listened to what Mr. Jeffries said and I won't rule it out, but I'm inclined to vote as I normally would. I am very concerned about how long he's delayed Ukraine. We count the days. They count the lives lost,' Doggett said.\nAdvertisement\nAnd then there are scores of Democrats who are in the hard 'no' camp.\nRep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., for example, said there was no way he would vote to keep Johnson as speaker.\n'I think his worldview is very dangerous. I think there's no scenario where I'm going to reward someone like that, who allows this level of chaos to happen in the House.'\nAnd Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., also is a hard no on helping Johnson, calling it a well-intentioned idea that is fundamentally flawed.\n'Bad on guns, bad on gays, bad on abortion and bad on voting rights,' Connolly said. 'He litigated the overturning of the (2020) election. He didn't just vote the wrong way. He signed up for a lawsuit. That's who you want to save? Go home and explain that to Democrats.'\nMassie warned that if Democrats help Johnson stay on a speaker, 'they would doom him, they won't save him.'\n'It's not a stable situation if a Republican speaker is speaker only by virtue of Democrats fighting for him,' Massie said.\n___",

But the move only intensified infighting among House Republicans, who split sharply on the strategy to deliver assistance to foreign allies including Ukraine and Israel.\nIn social media posts and TV interviews afterward, House Republicans took aim at one another — in unusually sharp terms — over the events that led up to the vote.

Matt Gaetz (Fla.) and Bob Good (Va.) — who have broken with Johnson and voted against other legislation proposed by the GOP majority.\nAdvertisement\nGaetz and Good have also endorsed Gonzales's primary challenger, something Johnson has warned members against doing. Gonzales's CNN comments prompted a third hard-line GOP colleague, Rep. Eli Crane (Ariz.), to announce his support for Gonzales's opponent, Brandon Herrera, a gun enthusiast with a large YouTube following.\nMost House Republicans have grown weary of colleagues who consistently vote against legislation that must be addressed rather than work to seek compromise within the party.

In a nod to such demands, Johnson proposed voting on a border security bill Saturday that largely mirrors a tough conservative proposal House Republicans passed last year. But in protest of Johnson's foreign aid proposal, three hard-liners on the House Rules Committee — GOP Reps. Chip Roy (Tex.), Ralph Norman (S.C.) and Thomas Massie (Ky.) — prevented the bill from being considered under rules that would require only a simple majority for passage.\nOther Republicans urged Johnson to still put the bill up for a vote under rules that would require two-thirds of the House for passage. The measure fell short.\n'Those who voted to fund Ukraine's borders instead of America's KNEW for certainty that the separate (unattached to Ukraine) border security was going to die in the Senate, and are now dying for cover — so they're casting blame,' Roy said after the vote on X.

Gaetz visited San Antonio last month to hold a rally with Herrera where he bashed Gonzales and pushed for a more aggressive GOP conference.\nThere is no love lost with Gonzales.\nAdvertisement\n'Matt Gaetz, he paid minors to have sex with him at drug parties,' Gonzales claimed Sunday, referencing allegations against Gaetz that the Department of Justice investigated but declined to prosecute last year.\nbut declined to prosecute last year.\nThe House Ethics Committee is still investigating Gaetz, who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and said Sunday on X that Gonzales was 'laundering lies on CNN.'\nGonzales also targeted Good for his support of Herrera, apparently referencing a report by Jewish Insider that cited instances of Herrera posting videos 'replete with imagery, music and jokes about the Nazi regime and the Holocaust.'\n'Bob Good endorsed my opponent, a known neo-Nazi,' Gonzales said. 'These people used to walk around with white hoods at night; now they're walking around with white hoods in the daytime.'\nAfter Gonzales's CNN interview, Herrera objected to the congressman's characterization of him as a 'neo-Nazi,' writing on X: 'This is the death spiral ladies and gentlemen. He has to cry to his liberal friends about me, because Republicans won't listen anymore.'\nAdvertisement\nFor Johnson, the infighting looms over his fate as speaker.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) had promised to try to remove Johnson from the speakership if he moved Ukraine aid, but she held back in hopes that her colleagues hear from angry constituents before returning to Washington.\nMassie, who co-sponsored Greene's resolution to oust Johnson, said he hopes Johnson resigns and predicted that if he does not, someone could trigger a 'motion to vacate' even though much of the Republican conference does not want to devolve into chaos again.\nIn a tense Tuesday evening meeting with Johnson and several rank-and-file Republicans, Gaetz told the speaker that if he moved ahead with his foreign aid plan that GOP colleagues would seek to oust him. He also threatened others in the room, saying the far-right bloc would target them on social media and campaign against them.\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, some GOP critics of the hard-line faction have advocated for leadership to take harsher measures against the bloc.\nLast week during a meeting with the speaker and lawmakers of the conservative Main Street Caucus, who prioritize governing, conversations revolved around how to punish members based on what could improve House functions. Several members suggested removing the three hard-liners — Roy, Massie and Norman — who sit on the House Rules Committee.",

            "summary": "NEW DELHI — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government are increasingly wielding strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents and critics of the ruling Hindu-nationalist party.\nA decade into power, and on the cusp of securing five more years, the Modi government is reversing India's decadeslong commitment to multiparty democracy and secularism.\nThe ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has brought corruption charges against many officials from its main rival, the Congress Party, but few convictions. Dozens of politicians from other opposition parties are under investigation or in jail. And just last month, Modi's government froze the Congress party's bank accounts for what it said was non-payment of taxes.\nThe Modi administration says the country's investigating agencies are independent and that its democratic institutions are robust, pointing to high voter turnout in recent elections that have delivered Modi's party a clear mandate.\nAdvertisement\nYet civil liberties are under attack. Peaceful protests have been crushed with force. A once free and diverse press is threatened. Violence is on the rise against the Muslim minority. And the country's judiciary increasingly aligns with the executive branch.\nTo better understand how Modi is reshaping India and what is at stake in an election that begins April 19 and runs through June 1, the AP spoke with a lawyer, a journalist, and an opposition politician.\nHere are their stories:\nDEFENDING MODI'S CRITICS\nMihir Desai has fought for the civil liberties and human rights of India's most disadvantaged communities, such as the poor and Muslims, for nearly four decades.\nThe 65-year-old lawyer from India's financial capital Mumbai is now working on one of his – and the country's – most high-profile cases: defending a dozen political activists, journalists and lawyers jailed in 2018 on accusations of plotting to overthrow the Modi government. The accusations, he says, are baseless – just one of the government's all-too-frequent and audacious efforts to silence critics.\nAdvertisement\nOne of the defendants in the case, a Jesuit priest and longtime civil rights activist, died at age 84 after about nine months in custody. The other defendants remain in jail, charged under anti-terror laws that rarely result in convictions.\n'First authorities came up with a theory that they planned to kill Modi. Now they are being accused of being terrorist sympathizers,' he said.\nThe point of it all, Desai believes, is to send a message to any would-be critics.\nAccording to digital forensics experts at U.S.-based Arsenal Consulting, the Indian government hacked into the computers of some of the accused and planted files that were later used as evidence against them.\nTo Desai, this is proof that the Modi government has 'weaponized' the country's once-independent investigative agencies.\nHe sees threats to Indian democracy all around him. Last year, the government removed the country's chief justice as one of three people who appoint commissioners overseeing elections; Modi and the opposition leader in parliament are the others. Now, one of Modi's cabinet ministers has a vote in the process, giving the ruling party a 2-1 majority.\nAdvertisement\n'It's a death knell to free and fair elections,' Desai said.\nA POLITICIAN'S PLIGHT IN KASHMIR\nWaheed-Ur-Rehman Para, 35, was long seen as an ally in the Indian government's interests in Kashmir. He worked with young people in the majority-Muslim, semi-autonomous region and preached to them about the benefits of embracing India and its democratic institutions – versus seeking independence, or a merger with Pakistan.\nBeginning in 2018, though, Para was viewed with suspicion by the Modi government for alleged connections to anti-India separatists. Since then, he has been jailed twice: in 2019 on suspicion that he and other political opponents could stoke unrest; and in 2020 on charges of supporting militant groups -- charges he denies.\nThe accusations stunned Para, whose People's Democratic Party once ruled Kashmir in an alliance with Modi's party.\nAdvertisement\nBut he believes the motivation was clear: 'I was arrested to forcibly endorse the government's 2019 decision,' he said, referring to a clampdown on the resistance in Kashmir after the elimination of the region's semi-autonomous status.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nModi's administration argues the move was necessary to fully integrate the disputed region with India and foster economic development there.\nAfter his 2020 arrest, Para remained in jail for nearly two years, often in solitary confinement, and was subjected to 'abusive interrogations,'' according to U.N. experts.\n'My crime was that I wanted the integration of Kashmir, not through the barrel of the gun,' said Para, who is seeking to represent Kashmir's main city in the upcoming election.\nPara sees his own plight within the larger context of the Modi government's effort to silence perceived opponents, especially those with ties to Muslims, who make up 14% of India's population.\nAdvertisement\n'It is a huge ethical question … that the largest democracy in the world is not able to assimilate, or offer dignity to, the smallest pocket of its people,' he said.\nThe campaign to turn once-secular India into a Hindu republic may help Modi win elections in the short term, Para said, but something much bigger will be lost.\n'It risks the whole idea of this country's diversity,' he said.\nA JOURNALIST FIGHTS CHARGES\nIn October 2020, independent journalist Sidheeq Kappan was arrested while trying to report on a government clampdown in the northern Uttar Pradesh state ruled by Modi's party.\nFor days, authorities had been struggling to contain protests and outcry over a gruesome rape case. Those accused of the crime were four upper caste Hindu men, while the victim belonged to the Dalit community, the lowest rung of India's caste hierarchy.\nAdvertisement\nKappan, a 44-year-old Muslim, was detained and jailed before he even reached the crime site, accused of intending to incite violence. After two years in jail, his case reached India's top court in 2022. While he was quickly granted bail, the case against him is ongoing.\nKappan's case is not unique, and he says it highlights how India is becoming increasingly unsafe for journalists. Under intense pressure from the state, many Indian news organizations have become more pliant and supportive of government policies,\n'Those who have tried to be independent have come under relentless attack by the government,' he said.\nForeign journalists are banned from reporting in Kashmir, for example. Same goes for India's northeast Manipur state, which has been embroiled in ethnic violence for almost a year.\nTelevision news is increasingly dominated by stations touting the government's Hindu nationalist agenda, such as a new citizenship law that excludes Muslim migrants. Independent TV stations have been temporarily shut down, and newspapers that run articles critical of Modi's agenda find that any advertising from the government – an important source of revenue – quickly dries up.\nAdvertisement\nLast year, the India offices of the BBC were raided on tax irregularities just days after it aired a documentary critical of Modi.\nThe advocacy group Reporters Without Borders ranks India 161st on a worldwide list of countries' press freedoms.\nKappan said he has barely been able to report news since his arrest. The trial keeps him busy, requiring him to travel to a court hundreds of miles away every other week. The time and money required for his trial have made it difficult for him to support his wife and three children, Kappan said.\n'It is affecting their education, their mental health,' he said.\n___",

            "excerpt": "This week's new streaming entertainment releases include the Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell hit romantic comedy 'Anyone But You' hitting Netflix, two teen ghost detectives who appear in DC comic books…",
            "summary": "The Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell romantic comedy 'Anyone But You' hitting Netflix and an album by Brazil superstar Anitta are some of the new television, movies, music and games headed to a device near you.\nAlso among the streaming offerings worth your time as selected by The Associated Press' entertainment journalists: Everyone's favorite dancing demon doll 'M3GAN' comes back to Peacock, a beautiful woman battles hideous beasts in Sony's video game Stellar Blade, and a documentary detailing Bon Jovi's early days, rise to fame and breakups and breakdowns.\nNEW MOVIES TO STREAM\n— The Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell romantic comedy 'Anyone But You' is finally on Netflix starting Tuesday. The movie is about two young singles whose magical one-night stand ends in miscommunication and hurt feelings, and then find themselves both in a small family wedding party and staying in the same house. It's loosely based on Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing.' Reviews were mixed and the box office started out tame, but it became a slow burn sleeper hit in theaters, earning more than $218 million worldwide. If you've been holding out to see what the fuss was about, now is your low stakes chance (it's also not a bad plane option, which is where this film critic finally watched it). And afterwards, if you need a rom-com palate cleanser, 'You've Got Mail' is also currently on Netflix.\nAdvertisement\n— Another stealth box office hit, everyone's favorite dancing demon doll 'M3GAN' is coming back to Peacock starting Wednesday. Is it great cinema? Probably not, but everyone who watches it seems to have a fun time (in spite of themselves). Entertainment Weekly's Leah Greenblatt wrote in her review that, 'This is not the morose, carnage-soaked horror of dank basements and clammy night terrors; most of the movie happens in bright daylight, every maniacal head tilt, ungodly hip swivel, and murder-by-gardening-tool calibrated for screams that end not with a gasp but a giggle. M3GAN came to play, and possibly reboot her motherboard for a sequel. Are you not entertained?'\n— Finally, if you've exhausted all your 'Tortured Poets' analysis, you can pivot to watching a Joe Alwyn movie instead. He stars in Claire Denis' 2022 romantic thriller 'Stars at Noon,' which comes to Hulu on Sunday, April 28. Based on the 1986 Denis Johnson novel, Margaret Qualley plans an American journalist in Nicaragua during COVID-19 who starts an affair with a mysterious British guy, played by Alwyn.\nNEW MUSIC TO STREAM\n— Shot through the heart, and they're to blame: Forty years after a bunch of kids from New Jersey got together and formed a great American rock band, a documentary detailing their early days, rise to fame, and best of all — breakups and breakdowns — has arrived. The only Bon Jovi documentary series to feature all members past and present, 'Thank You, Goodnight: The Bon Jovi Story' premieres on Hulu Friday, April 26 in the U.S., Star+ in Latin America and Disney+ in all other territories. Binge all four-parts one after the other or dole them out slowly. However you do it, expect to have 'Livin' On A Prayer' stuck in your head for the next week.\nAdvertisement\n— Anitta, arguably Brazil's most recognizable global pop singer since Astrud Gilberto sang 'The Girl From Ipanema' nearly 60 years ago, is preparing to release a new album Friday, April 26. It's titled 'Funk Generation,' her first since the 2022's 'Versions of Me,' and its viral hits 'Envolver' and 'Girl From Rio' (with its interpolation of the Gilberto classic) made her an international star. She's long aimed to bring Brazilian sounds to the worldwide music market, and focusing on Brazilian funk is an extension of that desire. ''Funk Generation' is an album where I celebrate my roots. It's where I express the power of Rio's funk in every track its unique, danceable, and sensual beats,' she said in a statement. 'It's a rhythm born in the favelas, where I grew up, and it exudes resistance and art in every community.'\n— It is time to give Midwest MCs their flowers: Fresh off a tour opening for Migos rapper Offset, Detroit's Skilla Baby is preparing to drop a new project on Friday, April 26, 'The Coldest.' If his trap earworm 'Bae,' with its celebratory, ladies-first lyrics ('Bae, you know you're fine, don't you?' in the chorus) and the community-focused 'Plate' are a taste of what's to come, the release is going to be delicious.\nNEW SHOWS TO STREAM\n— 'The Big Door Prize,' a sweet, silly dramedy about the residents of a small town turned upside down by the arrival of a machine that reveals a person's true calling, returns for a second season on Apple TV+. Starring Chris O'Dowd as a local high school teacher, 'The Big Door Prize' is based on a book by M.O. Walsh and was one of The Associated Press' TV shows worth watching in 2023. Season two of 'The Big Door Prize' debuts Wednesday. Season one is also still available on the streamer.\nAdvertisement\n— Two teen ghost detectives who appear in DC comic books star in their own series called 'Dead Boy Detectives.' The story follows Edwin and Charles, two long-dead teens who spend their afterlife still on Earth and investigating paranormal cases. They're assisted by a living teen named Crystal Palace who is a clairvoyant. 'Dead Boy Detectives' also features Lukas Gage in an over-the-top, comedic role of the Cat King. 'The Summer I Turned Pretty' actor David Iacono plays a demon. The ghostly investigations begin Thursday on Netflix.\n— Idris Elba and Adam Pally reprise their 'Sonic the Hedgehog' characters for the new animated series 'Knuckles' on Paramount+. Elba plays Knuckles, an Echidna with super strength, who is adjusting after moving to Earth at the end of 'Sonic the Hedgehog 2.' Pally is Wade Whipple, a not-so-bright deputy sheriff. 'Knuckles' is part of Paramount's efforts to expand the popular 'Sonic' brand. Ben Schwartz and Tika Sumpter also reprise roles from the films. All six-episodes of 'Knuckles' stream Friday, April 26.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nNEW VIDEO GAMES TO PLAY\n— Sony's Stellar Blade takes place on an Earth that's been mostly abandoned after an invasion by hordes of mysterious monsters called the Naytiba. Enter Eve, a sword- and gun-wielding warrior who has returned to her home planet to help out the few people left, including a scavenger named Adam. The Biblical references pile up — for example, the last city standing is Xion — but the real influence is the popular hack-and-slash epic Bayonetta. If you've been craving another flamboyant adventure with a beautiful woman battling hideous beasts, Korean studio Shift Up hopes it's got you covered. Start swinging Friday, April 26, on PlayStation 5.\nAdvertisement\n— Electronic Arts' Tales of Kenzera: Zau is less campy and more down to earth. Its protagonist, Zau, aims to become a healer and, maybe, bring his father back from the Land of the Dead. The aspiring shaman has some nifty parkour skills as well as sun and moon masks, which allow him to, respectively, launch spears and manipulate time as he fights evil spirits. Tales of Kenzera is the debut title from Surgent Studios, which was founded by voice actor Abubakar Salim, and he says it was inspired by Bantu folklore as well as his own experience with grief. The journey begins Tuesday on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox X/S and PC.\n___",

            "excerpt": "Mark Houck's campaign to unseat Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick in Pennsylvania's GOP primary could offer hints about swing-district party sentiment in a heated presidential election year",
            "summary": "NEW HOPE, Pa. — Mark Houck makes a potent appeal to conservative Republicans in this corner of eastern Pennsylvania when he describes his arrest and subsequent acquittal on federal charges that he pushed a Planned Parenthood volunteer outside a Philadelphia abortion clinic.\nThe account has become a staple of Houck's first-time bid for the U.S. House in suburban Philadelphia, a central battleground of the 2024 election, from the presidency on down.\n'I'm telling you this because this is how I became a target of the federal government — the weaponization of the government,' he said at a meeting last week of the New Hope Solebury Republican Club.\nHouck's campaign to unseat fourth-term Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick in Tuesday's primary could offer hints about swing-district Republican sentiment in one of the most volatile White House races in years.\nAdvertisement\nWith few truly competitive House seats in play, the 1st Congressional District that Fitzpatrick represents is one of 16 districts nationwide that Democrat Joe Biden carried in the 2020 presidential election where voters also sent Republicans to Washington. By comparison, five seats won that year by Donald Trump, then the incumbent and now his party's presumptive 2024 nominee, are now held occupied by a Democrat.\nThe Republicans' House majority is so slim that Democrats need to flip just four seats in November to retake control. That makes the 'Biden 16' a significant group of competitive seats and they could go a long way in determining whether the next president has a friendly or hostile House next year.\nFifteen of those seats are in states that Biden won in 2020. The exception is Nebraska's 2nd District, represented by GOP Rep. Don Bacon. There are five seats in California, four in New York, two in Arizona and one apiece in New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia.\nAdvertisement\nSeveral of the 'Biden 16' are like Fitzgerald, winning year after year by tightrope-walking between challengers in primaries and general elections. Nine of them won a first term in in 2022, when Republicans took control of the House for the first time in four years.\nIn the fall, many will face the same Democrat they beat last time, sometimes narrowly.\nThe Fitzpatrick-Houck winner will face Democrat Ashley Ehasz, a former Army helicopter pilot who is uncontested in her primary. Fitzpatrick, a former FBI supervisory agent who beat Ehasz by 10 percentage points in 2022, is outraising Houck and Ehasz by millions of dollars, combined.\nBefore November, several others among the 'Biden 16' must beat back primary challenges from the conservative wing of the GOP.\nIn Nebraska, Bacon is facing perhaps his strongest primary test yet. If he wins, he will take on the same Democratic opponent, state Sen. Tony Vargas, whom he defeated two years ago by fewer than 3 percentage points.\nAdvertisement\nBacon has been a vocal supporter of sending more military aid to Ukraine, something opposed by his primary opponent, second-time congressional candidate Dan Frei.\nFrei, who contends the GOP base is fed up with Bacon, accuses the incumbent of flouting campaign promises by voting to increase spending and for bills that do nothing to stem the flow of immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.\nNearly all of the 16 races are considered toss-ups.\nRepublicans intend to hammer home a message about lax border security and high inflation under Biden. Democrats are warning that Republicans will pursue a national abortion ban as Democrats invoke an issue that has consistently worked in their favor at the ballot box since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022.\nAdvertisement\nNorth Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson, chair of the House Republicans' campaign arm, said the 'Biden 16' have formed strong identities in their districts and are emphasizing local issues.\nHudson said Biden's unpopularity and presidential turnout models are increasingly giving an edge to Republicans, with the GOP attracting more working-class voters who more likely to vote in presidential elections and help flip these districts to Trump.\n'The presidential turnout dynamics actually favor Republicans,' Hudson said in an interview. 'And then if you look, state by state, where our battlegrounds are, the presidential turnout is going to help us.'\nWashington Rep. Suzan DelBene, who leads the House Democrats' campaign arm, said Democrats will highlight what they say is the chaos at the highest levels of government when Republicans are charge of the House and Trump is in the White House. They will say Trump is a threat to democracy and Republicans are extremists and hypocrites who voted against major spending bills under Biden and then tried to take credit for the projects that landed in their districts.\nAdvertisement\nVoters 'want folks who are there to govern,' DelBene said in an interview. 'They're not looking for extremism. And so all we have to do is make sure that voters are aware of what they're doing. ... Holding them accountable for their actual votes, even though their rhetoric sometimes tries to be more moderate.'\nIn Pennsylvania, Houck's bid to unseat Fitzpatrick, who is backed by some labor unions and business groups, has a visceral feel that some Republicans say resonates with them.\nAt the Solebury Republicans' meeting on the grounds of a luxury hotel and wedding venue, Houck unwound the story of his arrest, describing federal agents with guns drawn as they descended on his Bucks County home in 2022.\nThey arrested him, in connection with the incident outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Philadelphia. Houck defended his actions, saying he acted to protect his 12-year-old son from abusive comments made by the clinic volunteer. The trial ended in an acquittal in 2023, and Houck, who runs a Catholic ministry group, said he began fielding requests to run for office.\nAdvertisement\nHouck's story struck a chord with Rose Cipriano, who came to hear him speak. Her husband picked up a Houck yard sign and Cipriano, who had previously supported Fitzpatrick, said Houck has changed her mind in the approaching primary.\n'I'm looking for fresh ideas, and I'm willing to take a chance and vote for him on Tuesday,' Cipriano said 'I've known his story since it happened, and I support him.'\nHouck's campaign echoes Trump's own defense against the criminal cases against him. It centers on the slogan 'Faith Family Freedom' while Houck talks about defunding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the federal departments of Agriculture, Education and Justice, calling them all unconstitutional.\nHouck has raised more campaign cash than any previous Fitzpatrick primary challenger. But he is well behind Fitzpatrick's fundraising and name recognition in a county where his brother previously held the congressional seat.\nAdvertisement\nFitzpatrick has the support of the county party and the backing of police and fire unions, whose large campaign signs endorsing him crop up every two years.\nBob Brooks, president of the Pennsylvania Professional Firefighters Association, said Fitzpatrick represents blue-collar workers like his union members.\n'And, if there was more blue-collar legislators, I think they would find more support from firefighters,' Brooks said in an interview. 'We support those who support us, and Brian has supported us on many levels.'\nRepublicans at the Solebury meeting encouraged Houck to stay involved in party politics.\nHouck said he will back Fitzpatrick in the general election if Fitzpatrick wins the primary but won't campaign for him, put off by what he said was Fitzpatrick failure to check on Houck's family after his arrest. Fitzpatrick didn't respond to interview requests.\nCipriano said she is disappointed in Fitzpatrick but said the stakes are too high for the party to be divided in November. She pledged to support Fitzpatrick should he win the primary.\n'I am behind the Republican Party 100%,' she said. 'So whoever's running, from the top down, gets my support.'\n___",

            "excerpt": "A closer look at Item No. 1 in the now-former editor's indictment of NPR's news coverage.",
            "summary": "Uri Berliner is offended.\nIn an April 9 essay in the Free Press, Berliner, who worked at NPR for 25 years, rapped his employer for allegedly running a newsroom fueled by progressive sensibilities that seep into a skewed on-air product. Stories on Trump-Russia, Hunter Biden and covid-19 have all suffered from acute NPRitis, he writes. And racial and identity considerations — as well as affinity groups — shape workplace culture.\nThe essay triggered a bona fide media drama that concluded on Wednesday with Berliner's resignation. On his way out, he delivered a parting shot at CEO Katherine Maher. 'I cannot work in a newsroom where I am disparaged by a new C.E.O. whose divisive views confirm the very problems at NPR I cite in my Free Press essay,' Berliner wrote on X.\nJust what had Maher done to deserve such a diss? She had published a statement pushing back against Berliner's essay: 'Questioning whether our people are serving our mission with integrity, based on little more than the recognition of their identity, is profoundly disrespectful, hurtful, and demeaning.' As NPR's own David Folkenflik reported, Berliner took exception to that commentary.\nAdvertisement\nWhich is to say, Berliner is now an expert in disparagement and umbrage. In his Free Press essay, he deplores his colleagues' 'advocacy' and alleges that it had 'veered toward efforts to damage or topple [Donald] Trump's presidency.'\nNow that is disparagement. Even in the rough-and-tumble world of journalism, slamming your colleagues for their published work — especially in another outlet — is a rare undertaking. As Berliner suggests in his essay, it was something of a last resort, considering that he had raised his concerns internally to little effect. He invited people to sample NPR's coverage and 'make their own judgment.'\nthat is disparagement. Even in the rough-and-tumble world of journalism, slamming your colleagues for their published work — especially in another outlet — is a rare undertaking. As Berliner suggests in his essay, it was something of a last resort, considering that he had raised his concerns internally to little effect. He invited people to sample NPR's coverage and 'make their own judgment.'\nInvitation accepted. Over the past several days, I have sifted through roughly three years' worth of NPR's coverage of Russiagate, the effort by federal investigators and the media to discover the truth about the Trump campaign's connections to Russia. Since NPR's alleged tilt on this story serves as Exhibit No. 1 in Berliner's onslaught — and since it's central to the claim that the network sought to topple Trump — I chose to limit my efforts to this portion of the essay.\nAdvertisement\nAnd what a portion it is! The NPR Russia-Trump coverage plume under fire from Berliner consists of thousands of articles, podcasts, segments and so on. Berliner links to one. His serious allegations, accordingly, are backed by scant evidence, if any at all. It's a lazy, summary approach to evaluating a large body of work — a feelings-based critique of the sort that passes for media reporting these days. Too often, essayists write their conclusory broadsides against this or that outlet, confident in the knowledge that their fellow ideological travelers will applaud no matter how threadbare the supporting material.\nFollow this author Erik Wemple 's opinions\nFollow this author\nErik Wemple\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nBerliner's opus was published by the Free Press, an outlet dedicated to covering stories 'ignored or misconstrued in the service of an ideological narrative' — and not by NPR, which requires infinitely greater substantiation for its media reporting, whether the crisis lies in its own newsroom or somewhere else.\nThe irony there: Berliner has edited many of the stories carrying the byline of Folkenflik, NPR's media correspondent. He knows better.\nAdvertisement\nHere's how Berliner supports his conclusions on NPR's Russia work: '[Rep. Adam] Schiff, who was the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, became NPR's guiding hand, its ever-present muse. By my count, NPR hosts interviewed Schiff 25 times about Trump and Russia. During many of those conversations, Schiff alluded to purported evidence of collusion. The Schiff talking points became the drumbeat of NPR news reports.'\nYes, Schiff is a recurring presence in the broadcasts. 'Like many broadcast news organizations, NPR interviewed Rep. Schiff often during the Trump administration, as he was a principal figure in the Russian interference investigation — a story we covered with caution and perspective,' says an NPR spokesperson in a statement. 'Rep. Schiff's perspective was only one element of our coverage of the Russian interference story, in no way did he commandeer the reporting of NPR.' According to the spokesperson, NPR did 900 interviews with congressional lawmakers between January 2017 and December 2019 — including Paul Ryan, Jim Jordan, Eric Swalwell and others.\nNumbers matter less than the content of those Schiff interviews, which tend toward procedural mishmash, recitation of previously reported revelations and the centrality of oversight. In this interview, Schiff says that if former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort cooperates with authorities, 'we could learn a lot more.' In this one, the congressman speaks to his committee's investigative imperatives: 'I think we need to use subpoenas, and we need to stand up and say, we're going to get the answers here.' In this one, Schiff is asked whether Trump gets 'especially agitated' when the topic turns to Russia. 'Well, absolutely,' he responds.\nAdvertisement\nIs this the prejudicial poison of which Berliner writes? We asked him to supply instances of in which Schiff's talking points suffused NPR's independent reporting. After several emails and a phone call, Berliner hasn't responded with supporting material.\nHad NPR wished to addle its lefty audience with suggestive reporting about Trump's alleged criminality regarding Russia, it had a tool at its disposal. The so-called Steele dossier, published in early January 2017 by BuzzFeed News, contained explosive allegations presented by a former British intelligence officer. Various news outlets and commentators bathed the dossier in credibility that it didn't deserve, as noted in an extensive thread by Drew Holden and a series in this space. Top offenders include McClatchy, which ran stories bolstering the dossier's claims that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen had traveled to Prague for collusive business; and dossier believer in chief Rachel Maddow of MSNBC, who cheered for the document throughout Russiagate.\nNPR's dossier work was by no means perfect. 'Fresh Air' host Terry Gross, for example, occasionally failed to properly smack down dossier boosters during interviews. Yet the outlet was careful to avoid McClatchy's 'scoops' on Cohen and otherwise to cordon off its descriptions of the dossier with police tape. 'NPR has never detailed the document because so much of it remains unproved,' reads a 2019 NPR story. The NPR spokesperson said in a statement: 'We were not able to find any examples of NPR corroborating unconfirmed elements of the Trump dossier.\"\nAdvertisement\nAs further evidence of his employer's errant ways, Berliner argues that after the Mueller report found 'no credible evidence of collusion, NPR's coverage was notably sparse. Russiagate quietly faded from our programming.' It's an immutable law of media physics, of course, that coverage peters out when a story comes to an end. Who, after all, is doing continuing coverage of Abscam these days?\nBut there's more flimsiness afoot here. Berliner's dismissal of Robert S. Mueller III's findings — technically misguided, because the special counsel's investigation didn't apply the 'concept of 'collusion'' in its work — leaves the impression that the media's pursuit of the various Russiagate strands was a fool's errand. In fact, journalists as well as official investigations documented a spreadsheet's worth of scandalous activity that didn't amount to an international conspiracy, in Mueller's view. Trump will have you believe that the absence of criminality signifies the absence of wrongdoing, a logical atrocity abetted by Berliner's essay.\ninvestigation didn't apply the 'concept of 'collusion'' in its work — leaves the impression that the media's pursuit of the various Russiagate strands was a fool's errand. In fact, journalists as well as official investigations documented a spreadsheet's worth of scandalous activity that didn't amount to an international conspiracy, in Mueller's view. Trump will have you believe that the absence of criminality signifies the absence of wrongdoing, a logical atrocity abetted by Berliner's essay.\nDitching the nitty-gritty, Berliner's claim of an NPR campaign to 'topple' Trump grinds against the measured claims in NPR's day-to-day coverage. Examples abound. In this segment, NPR correspondents struggle to wrap their heads around the just-released Mueller report. In this one, NPR's Mary Louise Kelly interviews a former CIA official who presciently shoots down liberal fever dreams related to Russia and Trump. In this piece, published months before the Mueller report, an NPR editor argues that the Russia case is 'weakening' and even attributes an 'important kernel of truth' to the famous tweet by Trump citing 'No Smocking Gun … No Collusion.' This piece highlights Trump's point of view regarding the Mueller investigation. And this one bears the headline, 'Trumps Exult Following Reports Of No Phone Contact Ahead Of 2016 Russia Meeting.'\nAdvertisement\nFollowing the Russia experience, writes Berliner, NPR compounded its mistakes by moving on with 'no mea culpas, no self-reflection.' By all means, self-reflect — it's a good step for any news organization after a big story. Presumably, Berliner would have supplied various URLs for such a review, but he didn't share any with me. After skulking around in the NPR search box, I'd nominate the Gross interviews on the dossier and other pieces that faced challenges or turned out to be inconsistent with other reporting.\nWith his tendentious claims, however, Berliner doesn't merely overstep the paltry evidence in his piece. He positions his now-former workplace as a hive of ideologues driven by political outcomes instead of the facts — basically a left-wing analogue to Fox News. That salvo appeared to diminish his appeal as a newsroom collaborator.",

            "summary": "The night Azim Khamisa learned his son was murdered in a botched robbery, he fell to the floor, cradling himself against a refrigerator.\n'The pain was so unbearable,' Khamisa, 75, recalled. 'I had this out-of-body experience.'\nHis son, Tariq Khamisa, was a college sophomore at San Diego State University and working as a pizza deliveryman in 1995, when four teenaged gang members tried to rob him. Tariq Khamisa fought back, refusing to give them the pizza box in his hands. As he drove off, one gang member, Tony Hicks, fatally shot him with a stolen handgun.\nHicks was 14 years old.\nJust hours after learning of his son's death, as Khamisa lay helpless on the floor, he had an epiphany.\nA message came from a higher power, he said.\n'There were victims at both ends of the gun,' Khamisa said he realized. 'Sometimes in deep trauma and tragedy, you have a spark of clarity.'\nAnd so Azim Khamisa did what most people wouldn't even attempt: He found a way to forgive — and later befriend — his child's murderer.\nKhamisa — who practices meditation and sufism, a mystical religious practice within Islam — felt that although Hicks committed a hideous act, he alone was not to blame for Tariq's death.\nAdvertisement\n'It wasn't a 14-year-old that was the enemy who killed my son, it was the societal forces that caused it,' Khamisa said. 'The real culprit is that we haven't addressed why young people fall through the cracks and get involved in gangs and drugs and alcohol, and we lose so many kids.'\nKhamisa made it his mission to change that.\nNine months after his son's death, Khamisa started the Tariq Khamisa Foundation to help create safer schools and communities — and prevent teens from turning to crime. It was a way to honor his son's legacy and give his short life more meaning.\n'I didn't want to go through life angry and in hatred and resentment. Because if you stay like that, who do you hurt? Yourself,' Khamisa said. 'Forgiveness can create peace. ...We need to move away from this punitive mindset and become restorative.'\nKhamisa described his son as 'an old soul in a young body with a great sense of humor,' and said he wanted to become a photographer. He was 20 years old and engaged to be married.\nAdvertisement\nSeven years following his death, Tariq's fiancée, Jennifer, took her own life.\n'She was never able to bounce back,' said Khamisa.\nKhamisa's plan to forgive Hicks was set in motion a few months after the shooting when he met Hicks's grandfather, Ples Felix, in the office of Hicks's defense lawyer. Khamisa asked Felix to help him carry out his mission through the Tariq Khamisa Foundation. Felix was on board.\nFor the past 28 years, the unlikely pair have spoken at hundreds of school assemblies and events, as well as in prisons. In various forums, they have recounted the tragic tale that bonded them.\n'I do believe that we all, at some point, have to learn to forgive,' Khamisa said. 'If we had enough people forgiving, that would shift society.'\nKhamisa also sought to connect with Hicks shortly after the murder to forgive him face-to-face.\nAdvertisement\nHicks, then an eighth-grader, became the youngest person in California to be tried as an adult and was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Initially, when Khamisa requested to meet him and express forgiveness, Hicks declined.\n'It was not something I was comfortable with, but it was something that I knew needed to be done at some point,' said Hicks, now 43. 'I didn't feel that I deserved to be forgiven for what I had done.'\nHicks struggled to process his emotions, he said. He felt numb.\n'Prison, a lot of times, isn't conducive to having these emotional epiphanies about your life,' he said.\nFive years after the shooting, Hicks felt ready to meet Khamisa. He sat across from him at California's Folsom State Prison, and they spoke for six hours.\n'That was one of the most difficult conversations that I've had to have with anybody,' said Hicks, adding that Khamisa asked him about the night he murdered his son — and the circumstances that led him to pull the trigger.\nAdvertisement\nHicks's mother gave birth to him when she was 14 years old. His father wasn't in his life.\n'I come from what would be considered a gang background,' said Hicks, who joined a gang in sixth grade. 'The majority of my family members were gang-involved.'\nHicks's mother sent him to live with his grandfather when he was 9, and 'sending me away made me feel like I was being abandoned,' he said.\nThe day that Hicks killed Tariq, he had run away from his grandfather's home in San Diego. His grandfather was strict, which was a tough transition from his mother's more hands-off approach to parenting.\n'What was going through my head was a lot of pain and anger,' Hicks said. 'I was focused on maintaining the last familial relationships that I felt like I had in my life; that was my friends at the time, and the guys I ran with.'\nWhen fellow gang members urged him to pull the trigger that night, 'I didn't give it any thought,' he said.\nAdvertisement\nAs Hicks spoke, Khamisa said he felt a connection to him.\n'I'm looking in his eyes, and he held my glance for what seemed like an uncomfortable time,' Khamisa said. 'I was able to climb through his eyes and touch his humanity.'\nAt the end of their discussion, Khamisa told Hicks he forgave him. He also encouraged him to take part in the Tariq Khamisa Foundation upon his release.\n'Forgiveness can be very freeing,' said Khamisa, explaining that when he left the prison that day, he felt markedly lighter.\nHicks said he felt lighter, too.\n'No adults in my life spoke about forgiveness in that way,' he said. 'Azim's ability to forgive me provided me with the space to begin to forgive myself and forgive those people in my life that hurt me.'\nHicks said his self-examination was slow and painful.\nWhile in prison, Hicks stayed in touch with Khamisa. And after a time, Khamisa's daughter also reached out to Hicks.\nIt took her 20 years of wrestling with the agony of losing her brother, but like her father, Tasreen Khamisa came to understand that Tariq wasn't the only victim in the shooting.\nSoon, Tasreen Khamisa, 51, started having weekly calls with Hicks while he was in prison. 'I felt a strong responsibility to make sure that Tony was also going to have the opportunity to heal and find his purpose,' she said.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAdvertisement\nHicks's grandfather and the Khamisas became his support system while he was incarcerated. They spent years lobbying for his release.\n'My attitude to the commissioner was: Tony has work to do, and that work is not behind bars,' said Azim Khamisa. 'The commissioner was very touched that the victim's father and sister advocated for the offender's release.'\nAfter 24 years in prison, Hicks was granted parole and released in 2019 at age 38.\n'That was an amazing outcome,' said Azim Khamisa.\nSince his release, Hicks — who has developed a stronger relationship with both his parents in recent years — has served on the board of the Tariq Khamisa Foundation, and he speaks at conferences and schools about his life story. He encourages students to avoid the path he took, and he reminds them that they can change the course of their lives.\nAdvertisement\nHicks is also a plumber, and he said he is rebuilding his life.\n'It's been a very slow process,' he said. 'I'm doing really well over the last five years.'\nMuch of that is because of the Khamisas, who he considers family.\n'Family isn't always blood,' Hicks said.\nThe Khamisas say Hicks has become an important member of their family.\n'I see him as a son,' said Azim Khamisa.\n'I feel like he's my soul brother,' said Tasreen Khamisa, the executive director of the Tariq Khamisa Foundation.\nOften, Azim Khamisa places a photo of Tariq across from him while he eats dinner. He lights a candle next to his son.\n'I talk to him, and he talks back,' Azim Khamisa said.\nTariq tells him he's proud of his decision to forgive, and that it has inspired others to do the same.",

            "summary": "Regarding the April 10 news article 'European court rules Switzerland climate inaction violated human rights':\nEvery year, 218 million people are affected by climate-related disasters, resulting in at least 70,000 deaths. Despite this, our preparations remain inadequate.\nClimate change not only causes natural disasters but also creates global health emergencies. Wildfires burn in California, and Canada faces a high risk. Other disasters around the world this year have already claimed hundreds of lives. Why are we still unprepared?\nThe World Health Organization director general authored a new official report, titled 'Climate Change and Health.' This report acknowledges climate change as a critical health issue and proposes a structured approach to address it. As young physicians and global health researchers, we urge governments to prioritize health in their climate policies, enhance data collection and monitoring, and standardize protocols for capacity building.\nAdvertisement\nThe pandemic exposed gaps in our emergency response capacity. We call upon the governments to strengthen health-care capacity, preparing the health-care systems to act as pillars of sustainability in the face of climate change. The time to prepare is now.\nShreenik Kundu and Ayla Gerk , Montreal\nShreenik Kundu and Ayla Gerk, Montreal\nThe writers are PhD students at McGill University with fellowship studies at the Program in Global Surgery and Social Change at Harvard Medical School.\nThe writers are PhD students at McGill University with fellowship studies at the Program in Global Surgery and Social Change at Harvard Medical School.\nAt the most fundamental level, the world's struggle to make progress combating climate change is a product of humankind's most tragic flaw: We are incapable of protecting ourselves from ourselves. In the same vein, we might be unable to exhibit the required understanding, cooperativeness and selflessness needed to overcome the effects of climate change.\nSince the discovery of climate change a half-century ago, the world's reaction has been appalling. The response from those in the best position to do something about it, such as world political leaders and the barons of industry, has ranged from inadequate to nonexistent. For far too long, it seems the prospect of the end of humanity has paled in significance when compared with the continuation of the status quo, with its profits and comforts. The urgency of the situation is finally taking hold, but is it happening too late? Precious time has been wasted.\nAdvertisement\nPerhaps the world's best hope for survival would be the use of cutting-edge science and technology to, for example, remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. The nature of the process would be analogous to the extraction of salt from the ocean, but immensely more complex. A major advantage of such a solution is that it would be less affected by the proclivities of human behavior. Even in an advanced country such as the United States, a significant number of people still believe the whole thing is a 'hoax,' and business as usual still reigns. It really does feel like, once again, we can't help ourselves — but this time, the consequences could be fatal for the entire human species.\nHarry Flickinger , Gaithersburg\nHarry Flickinger, Gaithersburg\nRegarding the April 10 article 'U.N. climate chief presses for faster action, says humans have 2 years left ‘to save the world'':\nAdvertisement\nWhile the thought of 'two years left' seems depressingly pessimistic to me as a college student, it's important that we don't lose faith and focus on solutions. Although this article is more concerned with carbon emissions on a global scale, it is crucial that we look inward at our own domestic responsibility in reducing our emissions. The United States has yet to pass legislation for large-scale emissions reductions, such as a carbon fee to encourage polluters to turn to more renewable energy and a dividend distributed to every citizen to cushion the result of the fee.\nWhile Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University, worries this two-year warning will be ignored, it is my hope that it can be a call to action. While issues of climate change seem overwhelming to many citizens, our nation is based on the power of the ballot to prioritize the greatest threats to our future. November is coming.\nCourtney Hand , Williamsburg, Va.\nCourtney Hand, Williamsburg, Va.\nWhat Donald Trump doesn't understand about Jewish voters\nRegarding Philip Bump's April 10 analysis, 'Browbeating Jewish voters hasn't yet worked for Trump':\nAdvertisement\nDonald Trump's statement that Jews who don't vote Republican don't love Israel is a waste of breath. I am a Jew, and I love Israel. It's Benjamin Netanyahu whom I don't like or trust. There is mounting evidence that the Israeli prime minister is holding on to power for the same reason Mr. Trump wants to return to power: to keep out of the courtroom. The last time I voted for a Republican was in November 1990. But if you're wondering, I'm not voting for any current Republican, and I still love Israel.\nRobert Bronstein , New York\nRobert Bronstein, New York\nDonald Trump might be surprised to learn that Jewish voters, even those of us who are strong supporters of Israel, have strong feelings about other priorities as well. We care about education, the economy, women's health care, gun safety, foreign affairs, the environment, crime and, yes, even immigration. We are very aware that if Mr. Trump wins and the Republicans take the House and Senate, we will likely lose any progress we have made on these issues.\nAdvertisement\nHow do we know this? Mr. Trump has developed a track record since his surprising win in 2016. His overriding concern, as he seeks the presidency for the third time, seems to be avoiding convictions in his many criminal cases and, if he wins, destroying his enemies. We have a long history of democracy and freedom in this country. When countries lose that, it never works well for the Jewish people. There's a track record for that, too.\nElliott Miller , Bala Cynwyd, Pa.\nElliott Miller, Bala Cynwyd, Pa.\nThe problem with an immediate cease-fire\nRegarding the April 9 op-ed by Jordanian King Abdullah II, French President Emmanuel Macron and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, 'Three nations, one message: A permanent Gaza cease-fire now':\nBefore Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel sought a two-state solution. Under the Oslo accords, Israel wanted a two-state solution. Former U.S. ambassador Dennis Ross recounted in his book 'The Missing Peace: The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace' the proposed solution in 2000 that would have given the Palestinian Authority 95 percent of what they wanted. Then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak agreed, but Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestinian Authority, walked away. The current leader of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, does not want to live in peace with Israel, and Hamas wants to destroy Israel.\nAdvertisement\nThe proposed cease-fire will not be permanent until both sides respect each other's right to exist. Israel is threatened with hostile neighbors and acts accordingly. Are the authors of this op-ed willing to commit troops and resources to ensure that Israel is secure? With a secure Israel, a rational prime minister could be elected to build a two-state solution. What commitments will the authors and the United Nations make to provide effective, peace-loving government(s) for the Palestinians?\nRobert Finkelstein , Reston, Va.\nRobert Finkelstein, Reston, Va.\nJordanian King Abdullah II, French President Emmanuel Macron and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi have observed that 'Protecting civilians is a fundamental legal obligation for all parties and 'the cornerstone' of international humanitarian law. Violating this obligation is absolutely prohibited.' With all due respect, this statement is both inaccurate and misleading.\nAdvertisement\nYes, the protection of 'noncombatants' is a fundamental principle of the Law of Armed Conflict. However, it is not the cornerstone. Historically, the LOAC has recognized that civilian deaths and the destruction of civilian property will often occur in the course of armed conflict. The principal purpose of the LOAC has thus been to mitigate, not eliminate, this loss of civilian life and property by regulating the means and methods by which conflict might be lawfully conducted. Accordingly, a commander must refrain from an attack in which the anticipated incidental civilian harm would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected to be gained.\nThus, while the protection of civilians is indeed a fundamental consideration in conducting a military operation, this factor does not take priority over mission accomplishment. A warfighter, in developing an operation plan, cannot do so on the basis that, legally, his primary concern must not be the military necessity of accomplishing his mission, but rather the protection of the enemy's civilian population. To contend that this is the case would be to turn the LOAC on its head.\nDavid E. Graham , Charlottesville\nDavid E. Graham, Charlottesville\nAdvertisement\nThe leaders of Egypt, France and Jordan all support an immediate cease-fire, which is counterintuitive to the universally supported right of Israel to defend itself. Hamas publicly claims its members will repeat the Oct. 7 attack until Israel no longer exists.\nThe call for releasing hostages is laudable. However, bear in mind that Hamas wishes to exchange the people they kidnapped for criminals and murderers held in Israel's prisons. Will released prisoners carry out another Oct. 7?",

Now, a lawyer and former rabbi is attempting to rebrand it as a 'safe space'\nLOS ANGELES\nSolomon Friedman is addressing a standing-room-only crowd in Hollywood, rooster-printed socks peeking out from his New Balance sneakers from his perch onstage.\n'I come from a big Jewish family. I've had some raucous Passover Seders … but what we have in common, and we as an industry have in common, is this fundamental belief that we have a right to exist,' he says.\nFriedman isn't referring to antisemitism, but pornography. After all, he's giving a keynote address at one of the biggest porn conferences in the world: the XBIZ show.\nThe audience visibly begins to relax, their heads nodding in agreement. Performer Melody Melons, clad in pink pants and a tight shoulder-baring black top, sits rapt.\nLast year, Friedman, 38, co-founded a private equity firm to purchase MindGeek, the parent company of Pornhub, one of the largest porn streaming and entertainment sites in the world. He attended XBIZ to introduce himself to a skeptical audience whose livelihoods were initially wrecked by the site's free content offerings. After his keynote, when asked if he planned to attend the convention's lingerie-themed Wonderland party, he replied no. 'Who wants to see this,' he told The Washington Post, pointing to himself, 'in silk pajamas?'\nFriedman, a lawyer who is also trained as a rabbi, is an unlikely face of Pornhub, which offers free, usually short, adult videos classified by content to 130 million daily visitors, according to the site. He speaks with the confidence and clarity of a college professor because he is one at the University of Ottawa. He certainly looks the part with his black-rimmed glasses, closely cropped beard and gray sport coat.\naccording to the site.

He certainly looks the part with his black-rimmed glasses, closely cropped beard and gray sport coat.\nAdvertisement\nPornhub is wildly popular, monopolistic and disruptive — as well as one of the internet's most reviled sites. It was one of the first adult 'tube sites,' like YouTube, where anybody could upload clips, resulting in a site rife with child porn, rape and sex trafficking. The company faces opposition from all corners: state legislators, international governments, anti-trafficking groups, credit card companies and the adult entertainment industry itself. The company was so disliked that its previous owner's house was burned down. Friedman said he has received death threats and that he and his three kids have been subjected to 'horrific antisemitism.'\nThe company faces opposition from all corners: state legislators, international governments, anti-trafficking groups, credit card companies and the adult entertainment industry itself. The company was so disliked that its previous owner's house was burned down. Friedman said he has received death threats and that he and his three kids have been subjected to 'horrific antisemitism.'\nAnd so Friedman wants to reform Pornhub, he said, with plans to compensate performers more fairly, keep nonconsensual material off the site, and vet studios and performers more closely. The company's recent press materials speak of 'core values of consent' and describe it as 'a safe space for verified content creators.' It also touts its 'supportive partnership' with a national social justice network for sex workers. Critics remain skeptical.\n'I don't think that there is any other … product where the gulf between private consumption and public criticism is so broad,' Friedman told The Post. 'The people that don't like guns, they don't secretly have big vaults full of guns.'\nPorn has been decried as a public health crisis, with age verification laws, which are supposed to prevent kids from accessing online porn, sweeping the nation. Eight states now require some form of official ID, such as a driver's license, or commercially available information such as mortgage data, to access online porn; five more have passed similar laws that will go into effect by Jan. 1, 2025; and at least 16 states have bills requiring ID pending. The Texas legislature even passed a law requiring porn websites to include a controversial warning that 'pornography is potentially biologically addictive' and 'proven to harm human brain development.'\nPornhub has fought back against these laws. The company was a co-plaintiff in a lawsuit against the state of Texas, arguing that the state's age-verification law was unconstitutional. In March, a judge ruled that the law could stand, but struck down the warning requirement. Now, the company blocks access to Pornhub in Texas, as they do in Virginia, Montana, North Carolina, Arkansas, Utah and Mississippi.\nOne of Pornhub's most outspoken opponents is the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE), formerly Morality in Media. In a Jan. 25 press release, NCOSE said despite new ownership, Pornhub 'is likely still infested with videos of rape, sex trafficking, child sexual abuse.' NCOSE is a co-plaintiff in two lawsuits against Pornhub's parent company (filed before Friedman bought MindGeek), alongside a woman who had videos of her being sexually abused as a child posted to the site. Another group, the religious anti-porn organization Exodus Cry, has created TraffickingHub, a website and campaign aimed at shutting down Pornhub, claiming the site profits from child abuse and sex trafficking.\nAdvertisement\nNot all critics of Pornhub are anti-porn. The #NotYourPorn group — founded when a woman's hacked iCloud videos ended up on Pornhub — got the site to remove numerous nonconsensual videos in 2019, but only after months of campaigning. The group's director, Elena Michael, thinks Pornhub can redeem itself by implementing new safety policies, but she wants the company to apologize publicly for harming victims. 'We have expressed regret,' Friedman said, pointing to a previous company statement.\nMichael, thinks Pornhub can redeem itself by implementing new safety policies, but she wants the company to apologize publicly for harming victims. 'We have expressed regret,' Friedman said, pointing to a previous company statement.\nPornhub also has few friends within the industry. Its original business model was ripping off copyrighted content, streaming it on its website free and raking in cash from advertising. People stopped paying for porn. Eventually, Pornhub gave performers and directors a way to monetize their content, but the damage was done.\n'It was an absolute disaster for the porn industry,' said sex worker Cherie DeVille, who spoke on the condition that The Post use only her stage name for safety reasons. 'Their entire business model, like Napster back in the day, was to steal. … The first time Pornhub came to AVN [another porn conference] people spat on them.'\nA few hours before his keynote, Friedman is standing by the water dispensers at the Kimpton Everly Hotel bar, far from the busty BongaCams girls bouncing pink and white balloons. He appears to be figuring out his place in all of this, though he smiles and laughs easily. Still, he's prepared to talk, occasionally resorting to sound bites and repeating phrases such as 'trust and safety' and 'constitutionally protected.'\nFor Friedman, porn isn't the problem. It's just that it peels away social niceties to reveal the human condition. 'Pornography is a mirror and reflects society back at itself,' he said. 'So when people complain about porn, it's like looking in the mirror, being unhappy [and saying], ‘I gotta smash that mirror.''\nFriedman, who was one of nine kids, grew up 'in a house with more computers than children,' he said. His dad was a computer programmer, and Friedman had a Unix terminal in his bedroom. Friedman followed a typical Orthodox Jewish path: he married young, had three kids and studied Torah. He moved to Israel to attend rabbinical school at age 18. After returning to Canada, he became ordained as a rabbi, then went to law school. Friedman clerked for the Supreme Court of Canada, then became a criminal defense lawyer in private practice, a job he held for 15 years.\nDominic Lamb, Friedman's friend and former law partner, said that when Friedman joined the firm Edelson and Associates in the early 2010s, he was 'a super bright young man' and a 'hustler' with 'a great business mind.' Friedman was particularly skilled at teaching and mentoring young lawyers, Lamb said. The two worked on a number of child pornography cases. 'It gives you a nuanced sense of how the legitimate world of pornography works … and where things go wrong,' Lamb said. In 2019, Friedman left to create a law firm with Fady Mansour.\nIronically, it was Nicholas Kristof's scathing December 2020 op-ed in the New York Times, which argued that exploitation and assault were endemic to Pornhub, that put the site on Friedman's radar. About three months after the article was published, Bruinen Investments, which was trying to acquire MindGeek, brought Friedman on board as a partner to assess the company's criminal and regulatory compliance. He'd read Kristof's article and said he was predisposed to think the company was a possible cesspool. 'In a million years, I never thought that I would have anything to do with an adult entertainment company,' Friedman said.\nthat exploitation and assault were endemic to Pornhub, that put the site on Friedman's radar.

He'd read Kristof's article and said he was predisposed to think the company was a possible cesspool. 'In a million years, I never thought that I would have anything to do with an adult entertainment company,' Friedman said.\nBut Pornhub was using 'probably the most sophisticated content fingerprinting tool' to find and eradicate child sexual abuse material, Friedman said. 'As a defense lawyer involved in cases with respect to online exploitation … [I learned] how difficult it is for … mainstream social media platforms to block unlawful content and how difficult it is for police to investigate and ultimately prosecute these offenses,' Friedman said.\nPornhub was using 'probably the most sophisticated content fingerprinting tool' to find and eradicate child sexual abuse material, Friedman said.

According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, in 2022, Facebook self-reported 21,165,208 instances of suspected CSAM in comparison to Pornhub's 1,996. These reports are required by law.\nAdvertisement\nThe initial acquisition failed. Then, last year, Friedman set up a private equity firm with Mansour, his law partner; political strategist Sarah Bain; investor Rocco Meliambro; and Derek Ogden, the former chief superintendent of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The group, which has members with ties to Canada's cannabis industry, was named Ethical Capital Partners (ECP) — an audacious moniker given the porn industry's reputation — and bought MindGeek for an undisclosed sum, renaming it Aylo. (According to Toronto's the Globe and Mail, Bruinen had been prepared to pay $475 million for a 'distressed' Pornhub in 2021.)\nwhich has members with ties to Canada's cannabis industry, was named Ethical Capital Partners (ECP) — an audacious moniker given the porn industry's reputation — and bought MindGeek for an undisclosed sum, renaming it Aylo. (According to Toronto's the Globe and Mail, Bruinen had been prepared to pay $475 million for a 'distressed' Pornhub in 2021.)\nLamb wasn't surprised by the move. Though the company was controversial, Lamb said, as a former criminal defense lawyer, Friedman was used to dealing 'with baggage.' He thinks Friedman's experience will allow him 'to bring a fresh set of eyes … so that those who are engaged in pornography as a business can make money and that nobody is going to get hurt.'\nLater on at a 'Meet Market' event, Friedman stood next to a palm tree and an open bar on the fifth-floor patio of the hotel, surrounded by buxom content creators in sky-high heels, goateed directors and gold-jewelry-clad business executives, all vying for his attention. He had become the star of the show, although he maintained he was there to listen.\nThe next day, Friedman gives up his seat to an older attendee and stands next to the exit sign to listen to Pornhub executive Sana Gaziani and the company's vice president of community and brand, Alex Kekesi, speak. They're updating a packed room on Pornhub's newest services — the TikTok-like video streamer Shorties and an OnlyFans competitor called UVIU — as well as increasingly stringent verification requirements for performers.\nPornhub doesn't want kids anywhere near porn for ethical reasons, Kekesi tells the crowd, her cherry red nails and studded clogs betraying her punk-rock past. And the company isn't 'against age verification in principle.' But the laws are 'ineffective and designed to kill our industry,' she insisted. Kids can use virtual private networks (VPNs) to get around restrictions. She prefers device-level verification, which Apple and Android phones offer, where parents can use built-in controls to block pornography.\nThe mood shifts when Gaziani projects a slide about the company's new performer verification requirements, which spark several complaints about onerous paperwork. Everyone in a scene must be verified, not just the performer who uploads the video. 'We want to make sure everybody's over 18 [and] the IDs … match the individuals in the videos,' Gaziani said. If the content doesn't have people's faces in it, 'sometimes we ask for a full-body scan,' she continued. 'We're doing it in the name of safety. We're not trying to make anyone's life more difficult.'\nA lack of verification is what got Pornhub into trouble before. Kristof's piece condemned the Wild West-like nature of Pornhub, which allowed anyone to upload videos. In response to the article and U.S. and Canadian government investigations, '8 million pieces of unverified content were removed,' Friedman said. And Pornhub started the verified upload program.\ncondemned the Wild West-like nature of Pornhub, which allowed anyone to upload videos. In response to the article and U.S. and Canadian government investigations, '8 million pieces of unverified content were removed,' Friedman said. And Pornhub started the verified upload program.\nAfter the conference, Friedman would conduct a walk-through of it over Zoom. 'We're now up to about 35,000 forbidden words [and] phrases in 32 languages,' he said of the program, which also checks IDs for authenticity, running them through a known fraud list, and requires facial scanning. Once a performer is verified, each video needs to be approved before it goes up. Titles that include banned words — say, 'underage' — are rejected. Once a title is approved, the video is run through multiple databases to check for nonconsensual imagery and CSAM. If there's a match, the company reports it to law enforcement.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'This is now the strictest set of guidelines that I have to comply with,' said Siri Dahl, who spoke on the condition that The Post use only her stage name for privacy reasons, and works for the Aylo-owned porn studio Brazzers as a content creator.\nwho spoke on the condition that The Post use only her stage name for privacy reasons, and works for the Aylo-owned porn studio Brazzers as a content creator.\nOne group Friedman works with is Crime Stoppers International (CSI). 'You go where the risk is, and if there's an organization that's looking to reduce harm to children online, then we're all for it,' said Shane Britten, CSI's director. 'They [Pornhub] go through a far more rigorous check than YouTube or Facebook.'\nWhat Friedman is most proud of is the Safeguard program. It provides digital fingerprints for each item on the site. When content is flagged for CSAM, nonconsensual videos or terms-of-service violations, Safeguard fingerprints it, prevents the video from being uploaded, and searches the 4.5 million videos on the website for copies.\nThe user side has been amped up as well. At the bottom of every page of Pornhub is a 'content removal request form.' If someone fills it out, the video gets taken down immediately.\nPornhub doesn't offer AI-generated adult videos, and while it does use AI for moderation and safety, every piece of content goes through human moderation as well, according to Friedman. Pornhub has 'always considered deep fakes to be nonconsensual content' and the company is 'at the forefront of combating them,' he said. The Taylor Swift deepfakes that 'spread like wildfire' on social media, he added, 'never would have passed even the most basic cursory review by a Pornhub moderator.'\nAdvertisement\nJust how significant are these reforms? Samantha Cole, a journalist who focuses on sex work and technology and is the author of 'How Sex Changed the Internet and How the Internet Changed Sex,' said that Pornhub is 'one of the very few online platforms that's actually made meaningful changes to the way it operates following criticism.' Though she believes it is now 'the safest tube site on the internet,' the company hasn't always been this way.\n'People working directly in the industry — including employees of Pornhub as well as performers themselves — urged the company to make meaningful moderation changes for years, to stop content theft as well as nonconsensual abuse imagery,' she said. 'Corporations almost always put profit over safety, and are usually reactive instead of proactive when it comes to moderation. Pornhub was forced to act following a serious blow to its business [Mastercard, Visa and Discover pulling services from the site] due to an intense anti-porn and ‘anti-trafficking' campaign.'\nOthers are harsher in their assessment. Becky Holt, a PhD candidate at Concordia University who is writing her dissertation on Pornhub's history and content moderation policies, said that the company's rebranding is nothing new. 'It feels very familiar to me in terms of language. … I've seen the company go through a pretty similar cycle,' she said. 'I remain skeptical, I guess, of what they mean when they say ‘ethical.''\n'They will make significant changes under the banner of ethics, if it's something that seriously impacts their profit,' Holt continued. This includes preventing kids from accessing the site, she added. 'There's a lot of evidence to suggest that they've always been extremely careful about content featuring minors … because this could shut down their business … but it's very, very hard to do the kind of proper level of nitpicking that you really need to do in order to find this type of content.'\nAylo, meanwhile, has another audience to convince: the dozens of state senators who think the company shouldn't exist. On March 14, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) tweeted: 'Pornhub has now disabled its website in Texas … good riddance.'\nMontana state Sen. Willis Curdy (D) told The Post that he didn't expect Pornhub to block access to his state after the age-verification bill he sponsored became law on Jan. 1, 2024. He said he sponsored the legislation because he believes access to porn websites has led to sexual assaults and suicides. Pop singer Billie Eilish's claim that 'watching porn destroyed my brain' also influenced his decision. His bill was modeled on Louisiana state Sen. Laurie Schlegel's (R) age-verification bill, the first in the nation, which went into effect Jan. 1, 2023.\n'I got bipartisan signatures on the bill. And it sailed through both the House and Senate,' Curdy said. 'This is not a party issue. It's a human health, a human psychology, issue.'\nThe rebrand does, however, appear to be working within the adult entertainment industry itself. When it was announced that Mastercard had resumed processing payments on the site, a cry of 'Hallelujah!' could be heard from the conference crowd.\n'I really liked the fact that they're willing to put a face to the name out there and talk to regulators or talk to government officials. I think that's absolutely critical. It opens the door ... to say, ‘Hey, this is a legitimate business,'' said Jimmy James, COO and VP of adult video company ATKingdom, adding that the new leadership is 'potentially removing the stigma' of the adult industry.\nThe conference 'went better than expected,' Friedman said on its final day. He was standing in the hotel restaurant holding a bag full of business cards. 'This is a tough industry … but being here re-energized me. You meet the real human beings,' he said.\nHe felt welcomed. And he was optimistic about his mission. Pornhub's executives 'share the very same values of the general public,' he insisted. 'We want to respect people's bodily autonomy. We want to protect young people. We cherish freedom of expression, individuality and sexuality. There's a reason why adult content is constitutionally protected in every single Western liberal democracy.'",

Glenn Youngkin and leading Virginia Democrats are heading into the unknown territory of a state budget do-over.\nweek, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and leading Virginia Democrats are heading into the unknown territory of a state budget do-over. Youngkin and the Democratic-controlled legislature struck an 11th-hour truce on Wednesday to avert a standoff that could have triggered a state government shutdown and tarnished Virginia's stellar bond rating. While most of the attention was on the budget they set aside that day, legislators also sent a host of bills back to Youngkin after stripping them of his amendments, which in some cases had rewritten, delayed or gutted the measures.\ndelayed or gutted the measures.\nNow Youngkin must decide whether to sign the bills in their original form, let them become law without his signature or veto them. That means certain Democratic priorities — including bills to promote safe gun storage by parents of school-age children, ensure access to contraception and end tax breaks for Confederate heritage groups — could remain on the table over the next month as Youngkin and legislators try to hammer out a deal on a two-year state spending plan.\nAdvertisement\nYoungkin has so far signaled willingness to negotiate on only one of those bills, one that would allow slot machine-style 'skill games' in convenience stores across the state, and had bipartisan support. He is widely expected to veto most of the rest, extending a record-smashing spree that had him nixing more bills in one year — 153 — than the 120 that the previous record-holder, Democrat Terry McAuliffe, issued in his four years as governor.\nand had bipartisan support. He is widely expected to veto most of the rest, extending a record-smashing spree that had him nixing more bills in one year — 153 — than the 120 that the previous record-holder, Democrat Terry McAuliffe, issued in his four years as governor.\nWhat's less clear is whether those anticipated vetoes could upset the fragile peace between Youngkin and Democratic leaders as they try to hammer out a budget deal in time for a May 13 special session. Continued haggling over skill games also could have an impact on budget talks.\nYoungkin and Democrats had been at each other's throats for the past month over the budget and other bills, lobbing harsh rhetoric on social media and in rival statewide tours. Youngkin kicked things off in March by skewering the bipartisan spending plan as a 'backward budget' and the rhetoric only cranked up from there, with House Speaker Don L. Scott Jr. (D-Portsmouth) lambasting 'Pretending Glenn' in a video released on the eve of Wednesday's reconvened session.\nlambasting 'Pretending Glenn' in a video released on the eve of Wednesday's reconvened session.\nAdvertisement\nYoungkin and legislators said they called a time out on the budget to cool partisan passions.\n'I think there's a real path for us to move forward and find common ground,' Youngkin said at a bill signing Thursday.\nSenate Majority Leader Scott A. Surovell (D-Fairfax) said he was ready to move forward with budget talks even as he expects Youngkin to kill many of the bills sent back to him.\n'If the governor holds true to form — unless he's found a new spirit of conciliation — there's probably going to be another couple dozen vetoes,' he said in an interview Thursday.\nStill, it's not hard to imagine tensions bubbling up when the veto pen comes out again to put the last nail in certain Democratic priorities.\nNot 24 hours before they called their time out, Scott sharply criticized Youngkin for amending bills to close tax loopholes for Confederate heritage groups. Youngkin's proposed changes would essentially kick the can down the road — requiring that the bills be voted on again next year and calling for a study.\nAdvertisement\n'The governor doesn't have the courage just to veto it,' Scott, the first African American to serve as Virginia House speaker, told a small gathering of reporters Tuesday afternoon. 'He waters it down to nothing. Dude, show who you are. Veto the bill. We're not giving you a break. We're going to reject those amendments and send it back and you can veto it and show us that you stand with the Confederacy.'\nIn the same gathering, Scott also lambasted Youngkin's rewrite of the skill games legislation as overly aggressive.\nScott flatly dismissed one particular amendment to the bill — prohibiting the games within a 35-mile radius of casinos and other gambling venues, which would exclude them from most of the state's population centers — as 'a dumb idea.'\nYoungkin's office declined to comment on Scott's remarks.\nAdvertisement\nThe governor said Thursday that he was willing to negotiate on the skill games bill — specifically noting the 'perimeter policies,' a reference to the 35-mile provision as well as a requirement that they be located more than 2,500 feet — little under a half mile — from any K-12 school, day-care center or house of worship.\nYoungkin did not rule out delving into other areas of the bill. Offering to negotiate any aspect of it is extraordinary at this point in the legislative calendar. Any changes would have to be written into the budget or handled in an entirely new bill, which could be introduced during the special session if rules are drawn to allow for its consideration.\nSkill games — which look and operate much like video-style slot machines but are said to involve an element of skill — were one of the hardest-fought issues of the session. Advocates called them a lifeline for mom-and-pop convenience stores while critics warned they would turn corner stores into mini casinos.\nAdvertisement\nThe General Assembly ultimately sent an industry-friendly measure to Youngkin, whose amendments amounted to a wholesale rewrite calling for stricter oversight, capping the number of machines at 20,000 statewide, giving localities the authority to ban the machines and imposing a 35 percent tax on game revenue. Lobbyists on opposing sides have said the wording on the tax was unclear and could amount to a 45 percent tax.\nSen. Aaron R. Rouse (D-Virginia Beach), who sponsored the skill games bill, said he does not see it as a bargaining chip in budget negotiations, but he senses an opportunity for some changes.\nThere are lots of unknowns as Youngkin and a handful of legislative leaders — from both parties and both chambers — prepare to hammer out differences in the amount of taxing and spending to include in the two-year state spending plan. The way out of their stalemate won't be entirely clear until early May, when the state's next revenue report clarifies how large of a budget surplus might be available to spend on priorities.\nAdvertisement\n'All of that is yet to be determined as we start our work. We'll take it into consideration,' House Appropriations Chairman Luke E. Torian (D-Prince William) said Friday.\nStaff for the House, Senate and governor will begin meeting next week and then the principals will get together after April 29, Torian said. That will give the elected officials 'a breather' and a chance to clear their schedules, he said.\nThat will give the elected officials 'a breather' and a chance to clear their schedules, he said.\nAmong the bills sent back to Youngkin for him to veto, sign or allow to become law without his signature:\nVirginia Beach charter change\nBoth the House and Senate rejected Youngkin's proposed amendment to a charter change for the city of Virginia Beach, with one of the measure's sponsors saying the governor is trying to interfere with the city's self-governance. The state's most populous city changed its method for electing city council members in 2022, switching from candidates running for citywide, at-large seats to a system of 10 districts and one at-large mayor. The new plan produced the most diverse city council in Virginia Beach's history.\nAdvertisement\nBut it requires a charter change to become permanent, and Youngkin's amendment would block the charter change unless the General Assembly approved it again next year. Supporters, including the NAACP, say the delay is unacceptable because the city faces council elections this fall. Del. Kelly K. Convirs-Fowler (D-Virginia Beach) on Wednesday questioned why Youngkin would intervene, noting that for the past 30 years, governors have always deferred to the wishes of a locality when it comes to charters.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'The governor is trying to override the will of the people,' Convirs-Fowler said. The charter change had passed the House of Delegates by a required two-thirds margin and was unanimously approved in the Senate.\nAccess to contraception\nThe House and Senate also rejected Youngkin's proposed amendments to two pairs of bills aimed at ensuring people have access to contraceptives. One pair of identical bills — HB609 and SB237 — would put a right to obtain and use contraception into Virginia law. Youngkin proposed changing the bill to simply express the sentiment of the legislature that people have access to contraception under federal law, which contraception advocates said would have no meaning if federal law changed. 'The governor basically gutted the entire bill and just made it into a [policy] statement,' said Sen. Ghazala F. Hashmi (D-Chesterfield), who sponsored the Senate measure. The House and Senate both simply 'passed by' the proposed amendment, leaving them to die without a vote.\nThe House and Senate both simply 'passed by' the proposed amendment, leaving them to die without a vote.\nAdvertisement\nThe other pair of identical bills — HB819 and SB238 — would require health insurance plans to provide coverage of contraceptives. Youngkin proposed changing those bills to carve out an exception for nongovernmental plan sponsors with a religious or ethical objection to contraception. Del. Candi Mundon King (D-Prince William), who sponsored the House version of that bill, objected that Youngkin's change would create 'a vague, broad exception to this bill that has the potential to actually leading to less people having access to contraceptives.' The House voted 15-84 to reject Youngkin's change. The Senate rejected Youngkin's change to its version of the bill on a party-line vote.\nSafe firearms storage",

            "summary": "PHILADELPHIA — The symbolic mix of soul food and Palestinian dishes had been eaten to conclude the Ramadan fast, and remarks from Palestinian Americans about the war in Gaza had just wrapped up at the Masjidullah community center when Suad Islam stepped to a microphone seeking some political advice.\n'This presidential election is very disappointing. Is there a candidate that you would suggest that we vote for? Because I don't know any Muslim that could vote for Biden,' said Islam, who is Black and a lifelong Philadelphia resident. 'Who should we vote for? I'm just very disappointed.'\nIslam, who has lived in Philadelphia since the 1970s, has voted in every election since she was 18, almost always for Democrats. She picked President Biden over former president Donald Trump in 2020, and even volunteered at a polling place. But she said she cannot fathom punching a ballot for Biden again, not with more than 33,000 dead in Gaza, many of them fellow Muslims.\nAdvertisement\n'The economy, the crime rate. I want to cry every time I go to the gas station,' Islam said in an interview, ticking off the things that are on her mind as she mulls voting in November. 'It's just a whole bunch of stuff that's going on. It's disappointing. But of course, this war is at the top of my list.'\nAs the Gaza war enters its seventh month, some Black Americans say Biden's handling of the conflict makes them question whether he deserves a second term, according to interviews with nearly two dozen voters, opinion leaders and activists working through a political and moral conundrum in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.\nFor some, the conflagration 6,000 miles away has already changed their vote, edging out domestic concerns such as the economy, inflation and crime. Others say the war in the Middle East, which has already cost thousands of lives and has a region on the brink of famine, mirrors other tragedies afflicting people of color — and that Biden's support for what they see as a moral disaster should have consequences at the ballot box.\nshould have consequences at the ballot box.\nAdvertisement\nStill others see the biggest threat as something else entirely: another Trump presidency.\nWhere these voters ultimately land could play an outsize role in who occupies the White House next year. Pennsylvania is one of a handful of battleground states that both Republicans and Democrats see as pivotal to winning the presidency. In 2020, Biden won the state by just over 80,000 votes, including a 4-to-1 margin in heavily Black Philadelphia. But there are signs that the coalition that elected him is fragmenting.\nIn a nod to the importance of the state and its largest, most diverse city, Biden has been to Philadelphia more than 20 times as president — more than anywhere else except his hometown of Wilmington. Biden is spending most of this week in Pennsylvania: two days in Scranton, where he was partially raised, a day in Pittsburgh and Thursday in Philadelphia.\nAdvertisement\nBut even while he visits their city, some Black Philadelphians are focused on how his policies are playing out half a world away.\n'I want the president to get it right because it's right. That's the first reason, but beyond that, there is a political ramification if he does not get it right,' said Rev. Mark Tyler, the senior pastor of Mother Bethel AME Church, who is planning to attend the Democratic National Convention this summer. He said he's lost count of the number of conversations he's had with parishioners about the Middle East conflict.\n'And to think that this (conflict) is not going to have an impact on Black voters in particular, who connect with this story in a way that maybe other Americans cannot — it would be a mistake to think that it won't be a problem going into November,' Tyler said.\nAdvertisement\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza after Hamas militants rampaged through the Israel-Gaza border fence and killed 1,200 people, many of them civilians, and took 250 others hostage. In response, Israel has commenced a military campaign that has devastated much of the enclave while severely restricting humanitarian aid.\nComplicating matters, last weekend Iran launched a salvo of rockets and drones into Israel in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian consulate in Syria. Most of the weapons were shot down by Israel and its allies, but the episode has raised fears of a broader conflict.\nSupporters of Israel reject the notion that its incursion into Gaza is racist or mirrors American racial dynamics. Rather, they say, the 150-year-old Arab-Israeli conflict is rooted in a territorial dispute between two groups with historical ties to the same land. The country's backers also note that Jews themselves have been victims through history, and giving them a safe haven is a central reason for Israel's existence.\nAdvertisement\nBut as the Gaza war has raged on, Biden and other Democrats have faced protesters at virtually all of their public events, over the Palestinian death toll. In Scranton on Tuesday, after Biden gave a campaign speech on tax policy, the president's motorcade was met by protesters chanting, 'Biden Biden, you can't hide. We charge you with genocide,' and 'Welcome home, Scranton Joe — make sure Gazans have a home also.' Demonstrators also shouted at Biden as he visited his childhood home.\nIn several states, Muslims and Arab Americans have organized movements urging members of their communities — as well as people of color, liberals and others dissatisfied with Biden's support of Israel — to choose 'uncommitted' in Democratic primaries, an effort that notched more than 100,000 votes in Michigan.\nFor seven months, organizers in Philadelphia have been stoking a similar movement in advance of Pennsylvania's April 23 Democratic primary. They contend that Israel's military onslaught resembles other racist oppression that called for a global moral response: Jim Crow in the American South, or apartheid in South Africa.\nAdvertisement\nThat sentiment has resulted in a growing link between Black and Arab American activists.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBlack Americans 'have been struggling through this for many, many years,' said Osama Al-Qasem, who directs the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. 'They understand what we're going through, and therefore they empathize and sympathize and support our struggle, as well. So the built-in relationship becomes a hub we leverage.'\nBiden has made racial justice a central tenet of his administration, and as his reelection campaign intensifies he has highlighted the strides Black Americans have made during his presidency. Putting Trump back in the White House, he and his surrogates argue, would stymie that progress.\nBiden has stressed that he needs Black voters to help put him in the White House again. but recent polls have shown declining support among the demographic, particularly in battleground states that will probably swing the election.\nSome 92 percent of Black voters picked Biden over Trump in 2020. A Wall Street Journal poll of swing states, however, found that 57 percent of Black men planned to vote for Biden in the 2024 election, while 30 percent said they were likely to vote for Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.\nAdvertisement\nSimilarly, 11 percent of Black women in the 2020 poll said they would 'definitely' or 'probably' vote for Trump, compared to 6 percent of Black women who voted for him in 2020.\nBiden's campaign announced in August that it was spending $25 million to reach key voters in battleground states, including what it called the largest and earliest investment in Black media for a reelection campaign in history. Those ads highlight Biden's efforts to close the racial wealth gap and note that he has presided over the lowest Black unemployment rate in history.\nIn addition Biden launched a pair of ads last month aimed at Black voters in battleground states, touting his administration's pandemic relief checks and its successful effort to cap the price of insulin at $35 a month.\n'At both the national and state level, this campaign is committed to engaging with Black voters earlier and more often than any other campaign to date,' Kellan White, a senior adviser in Pennsylvania for Biden-Harris 2024 and a Philadelphia native, said in a statement.\nBiden's defenders say critics have a dangerously myopic view of the conflict in the Middle East, and that efforts to turn Black voters away from Biden will play directly into the hands of Trump, who would be far worse for both Black Americans and Palestinians.\nAdvertisement\nBiden is handling the Gaza war as best he can, they add. 'You can't solve the problem of the Middle East as a purist or idealist,' said Marshall Mitchell, a pastor at Salem Baptist Church of Abington, a Black church in Montgomery County, Pa. 'They don't understand the power of quiet diplomacy. And they're going to force a hand, and then you won't be able to turn Pennsylvania back.'\nAt the mosque and community center where Islam voiced her electoral concerns, many who came to learn about the Palestinian cause acknowledged that it was just one of the issues that would affect Black voters' decisions.\nSalima Suswell, leader of the Black Muslim Leadership Council and one of the organizers of the cross-cultural event, said she feels a connection to the suffering of those in Gaza who share her faith. But she said she also understands that it may be difficult for people to sublimate their own self-interest to make a political point, even on such a searing issue.\n'Some folks feel that there are domestic issues that require priority, like gun violence in a city like Philadelphia, where Black Muslim children are being murdered,' Suswell said. 'So many people feel like we need a cease-fire right here in our city. And to some level, there is some frustration also with people who feel that Trump is a huge threat to our community.'\nSuswell was one of a handful of Muslim leaders invited to the White House this month to discuss the war in Gaza and other issues. She has also hosted events in her hometown aimed at helping Black Philadelphians understand the plight of Palestinians and what the community can do to influence U.S. policy.\nOthers are disenchanted with the notion that they must choose between two parties whose policies toward Israel may not be substantively different.\n'I think there's a recognition that neither the Democrats nor Republicans are really representing our interests. They're not representing Black interests. They're not representing the interests of poor and working-class folks,' said Melina Abdullah, who recently became the running mate of third-party presidential candidate Cornel West.\nIn 2015, she and other founding members of Black Lives Matter issued a statement of solidarity with Palestinians. 'We don't have to take a lesser-of-two-evils approach,' Abdullah said. 'Lesser of two evils is still evil.'\nIn contrast, Rahima Abdullah, 67, a lifelong Philadelphia resident, said the events of the past six months have not deterred her desire to vote for Biden. Voting 'uncommitted' or staying home 'is a vote for Trump,' she added.\n'I just feel like we've got to do it,' she said of voting for Biden. 'And then we've got to pray.'\nScott Clement and Yasmeen Abutaleb in Washington contributed to this report.\nScott Clement and Yasmeen Abutaleb in Washington contributed to this report.",

We'll be publishing accounts from these writers at key moments leading up to Election Day. Dave Barry: We Floridians are hopeful (for a meteor strike)\nGreetings from the Sunshine State! The mood down here, as we anticipate the 2024 presidential election, is one of hopefulness. Specifically, we're hoping that a large, previously undetected meteor will strike the planet before November. Granted, this would mean the end of human civilization, but at least we wouldn't have to go through with the election.\nHa ha! I'm kidding, of course. No, wait, I'm not. Floridians are wildly unexcited about this election. I know this because I have personally spoken to nearly six of the state's 23 million residents — in professional journalism, we call this 'assessing the public mood' — and in every single case, when the election came up, these residents assumed the facial expression of a person who has just opened the door to a port-a-potty on the last day of a midsummer chili festival.\nThis is not to say Floridians don't care about the issues. For example, we're deeply concerned about the border. I don't mean the border with Mexico; I mean the border with Georgia. That's how the New Yorkers are getting in. Tens of thousands of them move to Florida every year, lured by our abundant sunshine, our low taxes, our relaxed standards regarding the storage of highly classified government documents and our policy of permitting people to continue to legally drive long past the point where they have essentially the same neural reaction time as a zucchini.\nAdvertisement\nThe problem is, the New Yorkers are buying property down here, and they're very aggressive. If you go to a party and have too much to drink, you could very well wake up the next morning to discover you sold your house to a New Yorker. I myself have done this a half-dozen times, and it has to stop.\nAnother issue we have in Florida is bears on crack. I am not making this issue up. The Florida legislature recently passed a bill that would relax the penalties for killing bears, and one of the sponsors, Rep. Jason Shoaf (R), made the following statement (Google it if you don't believe me): 'We're talking about the ones that are on crack, and they break your door down, and they're standing in your living room growling and tearing your house apart. When you run into one of these crack bears, you should be able to shoot it, period.'\nPeriod!\nOf course, these are not the only issues we Floridians care about. We don't live in a bubble down here. We're well aware that the nation faces critical challenges, both at home and abroad, and as the presidential election approaches, we share the same concern felt by all Americans in these uncertain times, namely: What happens if some New Yorkers buy a house occupied by crack bears? In that scenario, my money would be 100 percent on the New Yorkers. But I think we can agree, as a nation, that it would be fun to find out.\nDave Barry is a novelist and a former humor columnist for the Miami Herald.\nDave Barry is a novelist and a former humor columnist for the Miami Herald.\nAngela Garbes: This election is as exciting as Washington's dreary weather\nIn much of Washington state, winter consists of approximately six months of interminable gray and drizzle. Survival means endurance — living in perpetual dampness and managing your expectations. When the sun makes its brief, brilliant appearance in March, you mustn't get your hopes up; it will be months before you can reliably count on sunshine and blue skies.\nIt seems a little basic to turn the weather of the Pacific Northwest into a metaphor for this year's presidential election, but if the cloud cover fits …\nAny buzz surrounding the state primaries, which were settled weeks ago, has mostly faded. Both President Biden and Donald Trump won handily. The prevailing sentiment of Washingtonians runs along the lines of 'Meh, what does it matter, they don't even campaign here.' Indeed, neither candidate visited Washington state ahead of its primary elections, and it's unlikely they will spend much time campaigning here for the general.\nThough Biden garnered 84 percent of the Democratic vote, 10 percent of party voters marked 'uncommitted delegates' as a way of officially registering their discontent with the president's financial and military support of the Israeli genocide of Palestinians. It was another tactic in the regular series of nonviolent protests in the past five months that have shut down Seattle's Space Needle; clogged Interstate 5, the highway that runs through Seattle's city center; disrupted city council meetings in Spokane; and seen high school and university students walk out of classrooms across the state.\nAdvertisement\nTrump won the Republican primary easily with 76 percent, though Nikki Haley — who dropped out of the race a week before the primary — still garnered nearly 20 percent of party votes. The familiar liberal-conservative divide found across the United States corresponds to urban-rural areas of Washington. In small towns across Washington, where properties are bigger, Trump flags and banners also tend to be large. But if you look closely, many are weathered and dirty, having endured four years of elements and hanging outside. They flap in the wind, passive, with the same sort of resignation found in voters.\nBiden will almost certainly win Washington in the general, but there's no sense of pride, excitement or energy around this fact. 'We've been reading for months how the election will come down to 10,000 votes in like six states,' a father at an elementary school pickup said. Washingtonians, like so many Americans, understand this as a rematch between two old men no one seems to particularly like. The election will come down to the same battleground states far from our corner of the country, and we'll sit back and watch. Summer will come and go, warming our skin and spirits. But by November, we'll have settled back into the familiar gloom.\nAngela Garbes is a nonfiction author based in Seattle.\nAngela Garbes is a nonfiction author based in Seattle.\nMelissa Fay Greene: Look to Atlanta's ever-changing suburbs\nAriel Baverman, an agent for Coldwell Banker Realty, sells homes north of Atlanta to a diverse array of clients in neighborhoods that once epitomized White flight. Her territory includes counties her Jewish parents once felt uncomfortable driving through. It includes long-ago 'sundown towns,' so named because Black people would find themselves in extreme peril if still in the vicinity after dark.\nReal estate promotions now describe these towns — with their boutiques, coffee shops, breweries and alfresco dining — as 'cute.' 'You know, they'll have the cute railroad tracks that go through downtown,' Baverman says. 'You can have brunch and walk around and shop. The bookstores host children's authors. There's live music.'\nBig houses with front porches and deep backyards are more affordable out here than their equivalents near most big cities. With nearly 328,000 transplants in 2022, Georgia ranks fifth-highest in the number of residents who lived in a different state the previous year. Thousands are unpacking in precincts that voted for Donald Trump in a landslide in 2016 and in 2020 delivered Georgia to Joe Biden. 'Republicans like breweries and walkable neighborhoods, too,' says Bernard Fraga, associate professor of political science at Emory University. 'But young people move more and highly educated young people move even more — they're the ones who have the money to move around — and those cohorts are, on average, more liberal. Outsiders still see these counties as conservative strongholds, like in the 1980s. As they turn purple, some observers mistakenly conclude: ‘Older white voters must be rejecting Trump and favoring Democrats again.' That's not the case.'\nAdvertisement\nThey're turning purple because older White voters are being swamped by newcomers. 'Georgia is purple at the federal level,' Fraga continues, 'and still very red at the state level, but people from East Coast and West Coast cities see Atlanta now as one of these cool destinations where they'll be okay. Atlanta is a beacon.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBaverman recently helped a Seattle couple buy a spacious house in Acworth, northwest of Atlanta. They worked remotely and couldn't afford Seattle. 'They literally told me that once all the other priorities checked out, they wanted a state where their votes would matter.\n'I drove around Lawrenceville with an Atlanta family looking for more space and less traffic,' she continues. '‘Don't Tread on Me' and ‘Let's Go Brandon!' signs and banners were everywhere that day. The couple found the perfect house, but the wife said, ‘I don't feel safe here.'' They ended up buying in a neighborhood where yards signs are not permitted, even though the surrounding area — Cherokee County — was super conservative. 'However those people were voting,' Baverman tells me, 'they kept it to themselves.'\nTogether, we look at BestNeighborhood.org, a site frequented by real estate agents. It offers detailed maps of political diversity, county by county, with the commentary: 'Southern states are considered quite Republican, but the map below shows that variation exists everywhere.'\nCherokee County was so red, it looked burgundy, with a sprinkling of tiny blue dots. 'Are those the Democrats?' I ask. 'Like, three Democrats live east of Holly Springs?'\nBaverman laughs. 'No,' she says, 'I think those are ponds.'\nMelissa Fay Greene is a nonfiction author based in Atlanta.\nMelissa Fay Greene is a nonfiction author based in Atlanta.\nJohn Grogan: My Pennsylvania community wasn't always like this\nThe banner was hard to miss. Three feet tall and some 15 feet long, it stretched across the garage of a modest house a few blocks from mine in our little town. The banner featured just two words: a giant obscenity, the action verb of choice for the profane, followed by the name of the president of this country of ours. ' Blank Biden.' In your face for all to see — the children on their school buses rumbling by; the young moms pushing strollers; the elderly who take this route to the bank or supermarket. And me, of course.\nBlank Biden.' In your face for all to see — the children on their school buses rumbling by; the young moms pushing strollers; the elderly who take this route to the bank or supermarket. And me, of course.\nI am a walker, and my loop takes me past this house. ' Blank Biden.' Really, neighbor? Is this what it has come to? A big 'F you' to not only the president of the United States but to every member of our community? I am not easily offended, but this offended me. And it made me angry and sad. And, quite honestly, made me want to shout back, 'Yeah, and blank you, too, buddy.'\nBlank Biden.' Really, neighbor? Is this what it has come to?

And, quite honestly, made me want to shout back, 'Yeah, and blank you, too, buddy.'\nMy community wasn't always like this.\nI live in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley, a bucolic patchwork of farm fields and forests anchored by the postindustrial steel cities of Allentown and Bethlehem. We locals like to brag that we live in the purplest region of one of the purplest states. The valley is home to a diverse blend of union workers and college students; hunters and gun enthusiasts; townies and tech workers; farmers and back-to-the-earth hippies. Our Pennsylvania Dutch roots run deep, but so do our vibrant Hispanic, Middle Eastern and African communities.\nAdvertisement\nI've lived here for a quarter of a century and always considered my adopted home to be a place of moderate, mild-mannered folks who all got along pretty well. Conversations tended to focus on family and our tomato harvests. Then came 2016 and the ascension of Donald Trump as divider in chief and normalizer of egregious behavior. I have watched dinner parties devolve into shouting matches, friendships end and neighbors stop talking. It's a new age of hostility and incivility. From my observation, most of the vitriol is coming from the die-hard defenders of Trump and is aimed at anyone who dares disagree. As yet another yard sign in my town put it: ' Blank your feelings.'\nBlank your feelings.'\nFor months, on my walks, I considered knocking on my neighbor's door and having a respectful conversation. 'Knock yourself out with your Trump signs,' I wanted to say, 'but could you please cool it with the angry obscenities? Could you show a little respect?' But, of course, like all the mild-mannered among us, I avoided what I knew would be an uncomfortable confrontation.\nAnd then one day, I walked by, and the weathered banner was gone. Could it be? Could my neighbor have finally realized there are more constructive ways to voice a political point? The answer, I regret to report, is no. Within days, a new banner was up in its place. This one proclaimed: 'Biden Sucks.' Which I will take as a small victory in the decency wars. At least these words I can repeat in a family newspaper.\nJohn Grogan is a nonfiction author and former columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer.\nJohn Grogan is a nonfiction author and former columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer.\nCharles Yu: In Orange County, the 2024 campaign goes on spring break\nSeven months out, the election is everywhere, but it comes to me largely through my phone. As the survivors of California's jungle primaries look toward November, the waves of emails and texts — bolded and capped and full of exclamation points — have subsided. For now.\nTraveling from Orange County to Los Angeles International Airport to D.C. not long ago, I did not see a single MAGA hat. No bumper stickers, either, for President Biden or Donald Trump. I did not overhear one conversation about the election in the security line, the boarding line, on the plane, in the hotel, in the hotel gym, in a restaurant. In the airport shuttle, the driver was listening to show tunes.\nFriends, wanting to stay friends, have learned the lessons of 2016 and 2020. We talk about it behind closed doors, with spouses and children. Or we just talk less about it because we already discussed it. And what good did it do? Did anything any of us said actually change anyone's mind? It's hard to continue a conversation when the starting point is: 'I just don't really like either of them.' Eight years ago, I was looking to argue. Four years ago, I was watching the news at home. This year, I'm staying mostly quiet. Because what do I know? About anything? Am I so sure I'm right?\nEveryone's shouting online and on television. As Irvine (and the rest of this formerly solid red county) continues its shift from purple to blue, the talk is of local races, not national, and the chatter is about Shohei Ohtani, or college admissions, or the rain.\nAt the National Archives, my family and I shuffled through security, climbed the stairs to the rotunda, waited in line to see the founding documents. It was the longest line we encountered. The atmosphere was electric. The crowd was comprised almost entirely of student groups and families. Museum staff directed us: You all are forming lines. Why?\nThere is no line. Just human nature. It's funny and true, but I can't figure out which way it cuts. Are we sheep? Or just self-organizing? Don't be shy, they tell us. Get in there, get a good look and move on so the next person can see.\nWhen it was our turn, we found ourselves being crowded out by an eager family. The dad kept pushing through, taking and retaking photos. For his personal collection? For posterity? His daughter recited portions of the text from memory. Others waited patiently while these folks got what they needed from this experience. And I was momentarily irritated by their lack of awareness until I realized: This is what exclamation points look like in real life. These people are just really excited about the Constitution.",

His dark hulk presides over a hilly rise looking down on the tin-roofed hay sheds and iron chutes where Mauney is hard at work. Mauney moves to a dissonant music of creaking gates, unceasing wind and snorting animal exhalations, punctuated by the laconic cussing of the cowboy himself as he pours feed into buckets. The bull watches as Mauney makes his way up the hill and steps into the pasture to fill a trough.

From under a black felt cowboy hat, hair blacker than coffee runs to the collar of his black shirt. The impression of severity is relieved by blue eyes the color of his jeans and a smile crease from the habit of grinning around a Marlboro. It's an arresting face, burnished by years of outdoor chores, smoke, roistering humor and pain soothed by shots of Jägermeister. It befits arguably the greatest rodeo bull rider who ever lived, and certainly the hardest-bodied, a man who never conceded to any power.

Sandys/The Washington Post)\nMauney, 37, was the first man to get legit rich at bull riding. 'The Dragonslayer,' they called him, as he set the record for career prize money with more than $7.4 million and tied for most event victories on the Professional Bull Riders circuit with 32. But his real legacy, what made him the most popular draw in fringed chaps, was that he always chose the fiercest bull to ride, costing himself who knows how much more in money and titles.\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nA bull rider doesn't earn a score unless he can stay on for eight seconds. And if he gets bucked off, he doesn't get paid at all. Most bull riders in championship rounds choose the bull discerningly, with business in mind. Not Mauney. He would tie his hand into the baddest bull as though he was lashing himself to a mast in a hurricane and just refuse to let go. 'I'd rather get dragged to death than starve to death any day,' he would say. From 2007 to 2018, Mauney rode every ranked world championship-caliber bull there was.\nThe consensus greatest bull of all time is named Bushwacker. A mahogany-colored beast, he could kick his hind legs so dynamically that his hoofs reached 10 or 12 feet in the air. Newsweek magazine dubbed him 'the Michael Jordan of bulls.' For five years, Bushwacker was all but unrideable. He owned the longest streak of consecutive buck-offs in PBR history, with 42, until one summer night in Tulsa in 2013 when Mauney caught a ride on him that friend and PBR publicist Andrew Giangola likened to 'bodysurfing a tornado.' Mauney scored 95.25 points out of a possible 100. Bushwacker would not be ridden again, by anyone.\nJ.B. Mauney ends Bushwacker's streak of 42 consecutive buck-offs during the championship round of the Tulsa Built Ford Tough series PBR. (PBR)\nArctic Assassin was no Bushwacker. But by last September, Mauney was not his younger self, either. He had so much metal in him from being torn up by bulls that if you gave him a full body X-ray, his bones would look like silverware. There were a screw with 13 anchors in his left shoulder, a plate and screws in his left hand, and a plate in his pelvis. He had broken his jaw on both sides, fractured an eye socket, taken five staples in his head above his left ear.\nArctic Assassin came out of the chute and wrenched right, then left. Mauney was okay for the first couple of bucks. But then he sat down hard and lurched sharply forward. The bull's rising hips caught him and propelled him into the air. Mauney's boots and spurs went up over his hat. He was halfway into a somersault when he slammed to the ground.\nMauney landed in the sand of the arena floor and flopped over on his belly. He tried to raise his head, and pain ran through his neck as though he had been stabbed with a hot knife. Somehow, he got half upright. He began walking insensibly on his knees across the arena in the dirt. It was an old instinct, drilled into him as a boy by a mentor named Jerome Davis, the 1995 Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association world champion bull rider.\n'Unless you got a broke leg or you're knocked out,' Davis told a young Mauney, 'you better get up and walk out.'\nDavis spoke those things from a wheelchair, having been paralyzed from the chest down by a bull in 1998.\nGet up and walk out, Mauney told himself. He rose and staggered. Watching from the fence, three of his best friends and top riders realized he was hurt way beyond the ordinary. One of them, Shane Proctor, leaped down and got an arm around him and guided him to safety behind the chute gate. 'You all right?' Proctor asked.\n'I just broke my neck,' Mauney said.\nMauney's fateful fall from Arctic Assassin seemed unlikely. (August Frank/Lewiston Tribune)\nMauney limped away, clutching an arm stiffly to his side to keep his head from lolling, and headed straight toward the paramedic station.\nAnother rider asked Mauney's friend Stetson Wright, 'You really think he broke his neck?'\n'I don't know, but something's wrong because I ain't never seen him walk straight to any paramedics,' Wright said.\nMauney was infamous for resisting hospitals.\nAt the paramedic station, a medic said to him, 'What's going on?'\n'I just broke my f---ing neck,' Mauney said.\n'Well, we should probably get a collar on you,' the medic said.\n'That'd probably be a good idea,' Mauney said.\nMauney sat down at a picnic table. As he waited for the ambulance, he casually lit a cigarette. 'I figured where I was headed, I couldn't smoke,' he says.\nThe break was bad. It required the insertion of a rod, a plate and screws in his neck. He also had lost a disk. The next day, a doctor talked to him about the risk of resuming bull riding.\nIf he landed on his head again, Mauney was told, he more than likely would break his neck a second time, either above or below the reinforcing rod and plate. Snap the neck below, and he would be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Snap it above, and he would be dead.\nThe doctors kept using the word 'if.' Mauney knew better. 'There was no ‘if' about it,' he says.\nMauney looked the doctor in the eye and said, 'It's about a 100 percent chance I'll land on my head.'\nOn Sept. 12, Mauney announced his retirement. He would never ride a bull again.\nLoading...\nLoading...\nAbout two weeks later, he was at home in Stephenville convalescing in a neck brace, with little to do but think. He picked up the phone and called his good friend Matt Scharping. A top stock contractor who breeds champion bucking bulls out of Minnesota, Scharping was the co-owner of Arctic Assassin.\nMauney asked him, 'Hey, what are you going to do with the black bull?'\n'I'm going to retire him,' Scharping said.\n'Well, I want him,' Mauney said.\nThere was an incredulous pause on the line.\n'For what ?' Scharping asked.\nwhat?' Scharping asked.\nRetired professional bull rider Mauney on his ranch Feb. 7 in Stephenville, Tex. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\nFOR WHAT? THERE'S A QUESTION. For what reason does anyone mess with, much less provoke, a 1,700-pound bos taurus , a creature that is all chest, haunches and horns and that exerts a ground force reaction of 12 times its body weight when it stomps you with its back legs? That in its prime has such a fighting instinct that if you merely float a piece of paper into a pasture, it will try to gore it?\nFOR WHAT? THERE'S A QUESTION. For what reason does anyone mess with, much less provoke, a 1,700-pound bos taurus, a creature that is all chest, haunches and horns and that exerts a ground force reaction of 12 times its body weight when it stomps you with its back legs? That in its prime has such a fighting instinct that if you merely float a piece of paper into a pasture, it will try to gore it?\nEvery other activity at a rodeo has some passing relationship to ranching skills. Breaking wild horses and roping steers are necessary for managing rough stock. But bull riding is just a dare. It has no other reason for being.\nTo animal rights activists, it's a barbaric relic of the Visigoths. PETA claims 'countless animals have paid with their lives to satisfy humans' desire to play cowboy.' PBR counters that a 2020 study showed there were just two bull injuries in more than 5,000 'outs,' meaning the times its bulls left the chute, and that the animals receive first-rate nutrition and sports medicine. It's a legitimate question whether animals should be used for entertainment. But it's also an ugly truth that the career option for a bull is the meatpacking industry. Most cattle have an average life span of just 18 months before slaughter, the same as for chickens.\nChampion bucking bulls, however, tend to live for 10 to 15 years and retire to pastures, valuable as sires. Bushwacker's sperm goes for $5,000 a vial.\nStill, life is cruel for all range animals, given that the American range no longer exists.\nSince he retired from professional bull riding, Mauney has turned his ranch into a practice site for bull riders and young bulls. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\n'He goes to work and gets outside, and he feels so much better,' Sam said of her husband. 'He feels better if he's moving around.' (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\nMauney herds bulls into pens as young riders pull on their gear. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\nIf rodeos are part nostalgia, they also reflect a modern anxiety. The enthusiasts of the sport — five PBR events on CBS in 2023 commanded more than 1 million viewers — see a desperately needed antidote to creeping cultural neurasthenia. In Mauney particularly, they saw a last American vestige of stoicism, self-reliance and 'cowboying up,' so much so that he still commands more than 1 million followers on Instagram and retains all of his sponsors, from Wrangler to Monster Energy to the American Hat Company. As Mauney sat atop a bull that twisted and stamped, all kinds of things swirled around him. Fear. Character. Power. And make no mistake, ethic.\nMan's fascination with the epic form of a bull — and his attempt to bestride it — is older than any American rodeo. In an exquisite Minoan fresco at the Knossos palace in Crete dated to 1450 BC, a man is depicted vaulting off the flank of a bull. The most striking thing about the fresco is the profound mismatch between the slight human figure and the mass of charging, rearing bull. The contest is not about strength — and never could be.\n'You're not going to overpower them,' Mauney says. 'It's a dance partner. They make a move, you got to follow.\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nBull riders are not in charge. And that is a part of the draw — that feeling that they have hooked into an intense and massive primal force and are in something like cooperation with it. They put the lie to the notion of human sovereignty over nature.\nIn every other dangerous form of competition, 'You're still the one with your foot on the accelerator or the brake,' says former champion Ty Murray, now a commentator. 'Even if we're talking about mountain climbing, you're still the one that's deciding what level things are going to. But in bull riding, the bull is the one with the accelerator.'\nThere have been attempts to scientifically measure the forces that a rider experiences on an erratically bucking bull. One study using NASA-provided accelerometers showed that a bull weighing 1,700 or more pounds rearing explosively can exert a pull of 26 G-forces on a man. For context, an IndyCar wreck at 200 mph creates about 50 Gs. That's just acceleration. Now mix in violence. The hind hoofs of a large bull generate a force of 106.3 kilonewtons. An Olympic boxer delivering a straight punch, just 3.4.\nMauney is not a big man. He is 5-foot-10 and a blade-thin 140 pounds. On a 1,700-pound bull, 'He's outmatched on a scale that you just can't imagine,' says Tandy Freeman, who has treated bull riders for more than 30 years as part of PBR's sports medicine program. Most of the injuries Freeman sees are head injuries. According to a paper titled 'Rodeo Trauma: Outcome Data from 10 years of Injuries,' rodeo athletes suffer serious head injuries at a rate 15 per 1,000 rides, far outstripping any other sport. They're 10 times more likely to suffer major injury than football players.\nMauney always has felt most comfortable working outside. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\nWhat really makes bulls buck is genetics: They are bred to it. They're animals of prey, programmed by evolution and DNA to rear, shake, stamp and horn-hook the things that land on their backs, and breeders enhance their athleticism through bloodlines. Bushwacker's owner, Julio Moreno, once observed that the first time he threw a flake of hay into the pen, the bull tried to kick it.\nIn world-class bull riding, the bull is regarded as every bit as much of an athlete as the rider — to the point that the bull's performance counts for half of a cowboy's score. PBR even names bulls as world champions along with riders. Bucking bulls in their prime are worth at least $10,000, and if they come from proven sire lines, their value skyrockets to $500,000 or more.\nThe people who climb on these creatures are, of course, addicts. They have a dependency that requires regular doses of centrifugal and vertical speed as well as sluices of dopamine and epinephrine and a sense of conquering the well-nigh unconquerable. When a bull reared and stamped, Mauney could feel all those G-forces and kilo-newtons in his fingertips .\nfingertips.\n'I would rope and make a good run and, yeah, I felt good about it. But it wasn't the same,' Mauney says. 'I made a good bull ride, and I was 10 foot tall and bulletproof.'\nMauney's fearless approach made him a fan favorite. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\nThe sensation leaves a man wanting more — craving it, even, to a degree that trumps any pain. Jerome Davis craved it. He had been rocked to sleep on horseback as a baby at his parents' ranch in Archdale, N.C., but no other motion did for him what a bull's did. When he was taken to rodeos as a boy, he couldn't take his eyes off the bulls. 'I was just glued,' he says. 'I would just sit in my seat and wouldn't talk, just stared. … After you get into it, you just get eat up with it. It just takes you over to where you become infected with it.'\nIn 1992, Davis was one of 20 men who met in a hotel room in Scottsdale, Ariz., and founded the Professional Bull Riders circuit with $1,000 stakes each, breaking away from the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association to start a tour of elite stand-alone bull events.\nBy 1998, Davis was making $500,000 per year, ranked No. 1 and leading the PBR standings when he got on a bull in Fort Worth named Knock 'Em Out John. The bull lived up to his name. He whipsawed forward, then rocked back and hit Davis's forehead. Knocked cold, Davis was thrown off like a heavy sack and came down on the side of his neck. The fall crushed two vertebrae.\nLater at the hospital, his fiancée, Tiffany, a horsewoman whose family staged rodeos, was at Davis's side when a doctor told him he would never walk again. He was 25.\n'The first thing Jerome said was, ‘I can't ride bulls again?' ' Tiffany remembers. 'He didn't even think about the not walking part. That's how much they love it.'\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nWithin a year, Davis got back in a horse saddle, with the help of Velcro, a back brace and a gentle animal. He and Tiffany began raising bucking bulls and hosting rodeo events on weekends. Just being around the pens, gates and chutes gave Jerome back some of the 'bull mojo,' as he called it.\nThe Davises threw a lot of junior rodeos, with prizes for the local kids that ranged from belt buckles to Bibles. One day, a guy named Tim Mauney, a longtime acquaintance from the Carolina rodeo world, showed up with his black-haired 6-year-old in tow and entered him in a junior calf-riding event. That's when the Davises met James Burton Mauney.\n'That's the first time I remember him, sticking in my head,' Tiffany says, 'because I thought, ‘Ohhhh, rascal's got some grit to him.' '\nSince retiring from professional bull riding, Mauney spends his time running his ranch and caring for the young bulls he's breeding and training.

'My grandpa would raise hell at me because I'd be riding his beef cows and stuff,' Mauney says.\nThe Mauneys came from Alsace-Lorraine settlers who established a large farm in Iredell County in the 1820s. At one time it was pure cow country, with more than 300 cattle ranches and dairies, scores of rich brown cows lolling in the grass. But by the 1930s, large textile mills came in and the farms dwindled. Most of the people Mauney grew up with worked as laborers, ranching just a sidelight. His grandfather did 27 years in the Templon Spinning Mill. His father, Tim, worked night shifts in a lumber mill, while his mother, Lynne, worked for the local school system. But they still found time to keep cows, and every weekend they went off to a rodeo.\nTim Mauney was an amateur steer wrestler and such an enthusiast that he would volunteer at local shows. When a rodeo was short of riders to fill out the program, Tim would make two or three extra runs. 'He'd put on a different cowboy hat so the crowd wouldn't know it was the same guy,' remembers Tiffany Davis, whose father staged some of the shows.\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nMost of the rodeos offered 'mutton busting' events for the smallest children; 5- and 6-year-olds were placed on the back of sheep and rode until they fell off. But J.B. Mauney wanted no part of that. 'Boy, he felt it was stupid,' recalls Michael Laws, a family friend who was J.B.'s first bull instructor. 'He wasn't riding no sheep. He was going to ride bulls.'\nBy age 9, J.B. was riding the family steers and winning youth events in the Junior Southern Rodeo Association. He was just 13 when he got on his first small bull. His father and Laws used white medical tape to mark an X on the bull's shoulders; Laws told him don't take your eyes off it. Don't look down; don't look at your dad. It taught him focus.\nBull riding wasn't about 'manhandling' an animal, explained Laws, who made stained glass for a living during the week and rodeoed on weekends. 'That's not how you ride bulls. You have to ride them with grace, finesse — just flow with them.'\nTo do that, the boy had to develop a gymnast's core strength. Laws took a two-by-four and shaved it edgewise down to about an inch and a half wide. He mounted the plank in the air like a tightrope and told J.B. to get on it and practice walking on that edge, with one hand up in the air, as if he was on a bull.\nTo improve his core strength and balance for bull riding, Mauney used to stand on a ball while rewatching old rides. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\nMauney got to where he was so strong that he could tiptoe on the plank edge in his cowboy boots. 'Imagine a bull rider taking ballet,' Laws said. 'I seen him get on a board fence, which wasn't but three-quarters of an inch wide, and walk halfway around the arena. … That's balance.'\nMauney was long in the legs but featherweight light, weighing just 120 pounds as a freshman in high school, thin and bendable as a willow switch. But it was a serious mistake to take him for weak. On his first day aboard the high school bus, he got teased by a senior, who pinched his ear and called him skinny. Mauney leaped out of his seat and punched the guy in the mouth. 'Broke my hand,' he recalled.\nMauney preferred outdoor work to anything. He would cut his agriculture classes to work at a cattle sale barn, herding and loading bulls, only to get caught when the class took a field trip there.\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nHe spent weekends and most of his summers over at the Davis ranch, along with a gang of other aspiring young cowboys. J.B. would help set up the arena for rodeos and pick up trash. He ended up staying there for long stretches, crashed on the living room sofa or in an old bunk room.\nBeing around Jerome and his wheelchair 'made you open your eyes pretty good,' Mauney says. 'You realize a lot earlier than most guys that if you're going to do it, you better mean it, because one day it's here and next it's gone.'\nJerome didn't talk much about his accident. He just taught J.B. with the way he went about his rehab and built his life back. He would say: 'Don't cry on my shoulder. You'll rust my spurs.'\nMost important of all, Jerome taught that when you got hurt, 'No reason to complain; you picked it,' J.B. says.\nAfter a life being thrown from bulls, Mauney feels the toll every day. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\nBy 15, Mauney was the closest thing to a prodigy in rodeo. He won the Southern Rodeo Association junior all-around title in 2002 and the adult title just two years later. He turned pro on his 18th birthday Jan. 9, 2005, and won the very first event he entered for a $10,000 prize.\nThen he got stomped — bad. At a rodeo in Raleigh, N.C., a bull came down on his midsection with two hoofs. Mauney knew his ribs were broken, but he figured all a doctor did was tape you up. He wrapped himself in an elastic bandage and drove home. The next morning, his side was badly distended, as if a football had been shoved under the skin. He took himself to an emergency room. 'That's your liver,' a doctor told him. He was rushed into surgery, and afterward the surgeon said she didn't understand why he hadn't keeled over dead. He was ordered not to ride for eight months — if he got gored by a bull while his organs were healing, it could kill him.\nTo make money as he recovered, he went to work at a local ball-bearing plant, sweltering through shifts covered in grease. He quit after four months and went back to riding. At his first competition, someone asked who cleared him to ride again.\n'Dr. Mauney,' he shot back.\nYoung bull riders prepare to ride on Mauney's ranch. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\nBY 2006, MAUNEY WAS ON HIS WAY to becoming the fastest bull rider to collect $1 million. At 20, he was making $400,000 a year and thought he would never be broke again. It wasn't just the winning; it was his devil-may-care attitude that attracted fans. With a cigarette perpetually dangling from his lip, he radiated uncompromisingness. When a chewing tobacco company offered him a $250,000 endorsement deal, he turned it down because it said he couldn't smoke. When the company redid the language to say he couldn't smoke at public appearances, he said, 'Okay, for 250, I can hide it.'\nBY 2006, MAUNEY WAS ON HIS WAY to becoming the fastest bull rider to collect $1 million.

When someone asked him why he didn't get a house, he said, 'So if the neighbors piss me off, I can move.'\nIn 2007, he went to Las Vegas for an annual event, and as he walked into the lobby of a hotel, he noticed a woman with waist-long hair so ash blond it looked almost white, amber eyes and a laugh that radiated across the room. He stalked over and said, 'What are you doing tomorrow night?' She answered, 'Having dinner with my family.' He said, 'Can I come?'\n'I'd rather get dragged to death than starve to death any day,' he would say in his riding days. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\nHer name was Samantha Lyne, and she turned out to be the daughter of one of the greatest all-around rodeo athletes ever, Phil Lyne, who was being inducted to the PBR's Ring of Honor that weekend. Phil Lyne had dominated the early 1970s before he retired to a ranch in Cotulla, Tex. A superbly athletic rider and roper who was the subject of the 1973 Academy Award-winning documentary 'The Great American Cowboy,' Lyne had been featured in a famous Chevrolet trucks ad which boasted, 'A great way to get to work.'\nSam's parents tolerated Mauney at dinner, but they were appalled when she went down to North Carolina to stay in his camper. They had sent her off to TCU for a degree and wanted her to go into business, but she kept going back to the horses and cowboys.\nThis cowboy and cowgirl were a little too wild to hang together for long. Sam was chasing her own career as a decorated barrel racer — she would qualify for the national finals in 2014 — while Mauney was approaching his height as a competitor, and a carouser. While other cowboys lifted weights and trained in gyms, he bragged that the only time he had been on a treadmill was for a bet — which he won. He drank four cups of black coffee in the morning, his nutrition consisted of Corn Pops and Uncrustables, and he stayed up till closing time drinking beers and Jägermeister.\n'The most exercise he got was lifting a can,' Laws laughs.\nMauney rode with no regrets, except for the money he lost or threw away or people filched from him. 'I could've took care of business a little bit, not been at the bar all night,' he says. 'But you live and learn.'\nIt was part of his heedlessness. He rode with a looseness others envied, the fringe on his chaps flying around. In 2012, he broke his left (riding) hand and simply switched to his right — and still managed to place among the top five in the world. His epic conquering of Bushwacker in 2013 propelled him to his first world championship and a $1 million bonus.\nMauney's ride of Bushwacker remains the stuff of legend among rodeo fans. (Andy Watson/PBR/Bull Stock Media)\nIt wasn't as jaunty as he made it look, of course. Between the big rides, there were terrible wrecks. A bull named Jawbreaker horned him in the chest and collapsed his lung. There were personal wrecks, too. A brief encounter left him with a baby daughter, Bella, an adored black-haired child who looked just like him. A marriage to a young woman he met through rodeo colleagues collapsed after just two years. He became estranged from his family in a business dispute that left him feeling more used than loved.\nThe injuries began to mount. Mauney's problem wasn't so much what happened on the bull; it was that he was terrible at getting off. When it came time to dismount, he just couldn't seem to release his hand and land neatly. 'Everything I've got, since the age of 14, I made all of it tying that thing in there to where it wouldn't come out,' he says, showing his gnarled hand. He cracked both shoulder blades and his tailbone. He lost the ACLs in both knees and had a perpetually untreated ulnar collateral ligament tear in his elbow. And the pinkie on left hand was permanently curled from his poor dismounts.\n'I was not worth a s--- at it,' he says. 'I'd land up underneath them, my hand would hang in my rope and jerk me under them, and I'd get stomped. Well, my entire life I practiced how to stay on them, not jump off them. … I tied my hand in there to mean for it to be there.'\nmean for it to be there.'\nNevertheless, he still chose the 'rankest' bulls whenever he could. Most famously, in 2015 Mauney already had clinched his second title when he called for a bull named Bruiser at the PBR World Finals in Las Vegas. He was a two-toned creature who would be named world champion bull for three consecutive years. Bruiser lashed him around so violently, the bull's tail was flapping against his hat. He stayed on for a score of 92.75.\nIn 2015, Mauney rode Bruiser at the PBR World Finals in Las Vegas. (PBR)\nBy then, Mauney was back with Sam, her family had fully come around to him, and what no one knew about that championship was that each morning in their hotel room, she had to help him out of bed. 'I was, like, lifting him,' she says. Both had matured, and along with the original attraction they had something deeper: understanding. She was ranch-reared, capable in brittle situations and had a no-quit attitude as he did. 'We're a lot alike,' she says. That's why she also understood that beneath Mauney's exterior lurked sensitivity.\n'I just knew he was not the person that he wants people to think he is: tough guy,' she says. 'Which he is , right? But he's really kind.'\nis, right? But he's really kind.'\nShe knew how to deal with the fact that J.B. wouldn't go to the doctor unless it was an emergency. Once, he developed abscesses in some shattered teeth from a broken jaw after taking a hoof to the face. Instead of going to a dentist, he shot himself up with cattle antibiotics. The only problem was the cow needle was as big as something you would knit with. When he jabbed himself with it, he shuddered in pain for a full two minutes, his bare backside hanging out, before he could squeeze the plunger and pull his pants up.\nSam would employ vet medicine on him, with salves and therapeutics for his joints such as an equine laser. 'She doctored me like a horse,' he says.\nThe habit of choosing the baddest bull certainly cost him another title. Mauney mounted Bushwacker 13 times, almost twice as much as any other rider, and was bumped off 12 of those. In 2016, he had a clear shot at another championship gold buckle, but he chose Air Time, 1,650 pounds of dappled heavyweight. Ten riders had tried Air Time, and all of them were thrown. So was Mauney, who lasted about three seconds before Air Time threw him into the metal fence, subluxing his bad shoulder and tanking his chances.\nThere was something 'honorable' in the way Mauney always chose the hardest ride, Murray observes, even though he didn't need to.\n'He's always going to be remembered as a guy that slayed every dragon there is at some point,' Murray says. 'Even the guys who did it that way at times, they didn't do it that way all the time. J.B. basically did it that way all the time.'\nall the time.'\nJ.B. and Sam were married Jan. 3, 2017, and she moved into a log cabin in North Carolina with him and his collection of junk food. 'He eats like a 5-year-old,' she says. All of their friends thought they were a perfect match. According to the Davises, Sam is the only person J.B. toes the line for. 'They're tit for tat,' Jerome says. Tiffany says, 'Samantha's woman enough to call him out.'\nThey eventually found their way to Stephenville, where they bought some acreage a few miles outside of town. It had nothing on it but a single-wide trailer with a tin roof. They decided to live there while they looked for a house and ended up staying in it for two years.\nAs they put away their things in the single-wide, J.B. told her, 'I knew I'd white trash you up.'\nHis father says he doesn't care, but Jagger certainly appears destined for the cowboy life.

Sandys/The Washington Post)\nJagger and Samantha pet a calf on the family's ranch. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\nOnly two things disturbed their happiness: J.B.'s increasing string of injuries and Sam's difficulty getting pregnant. At the July 2017 Calgary Stampede, J.B. got his hand caught in the rope as he tried to dismount after scoring over 90 points on a bull named Cowabunga. The bull stepped on his shoulder at the armpit, just about ripping his arm off. It was the worst injury he had ever suffered: Three rotator cuff tendons were torn off the humerus, and the ball of the shoulder was fractured. A screw and 13 anchors reattached his shoulder, and he turned the mandated six-month recovery period into four months.\nMeanwhile, Sam was told that because of a medical condition in her youth, she had only a 1 percent chance of getting pregnant. The couple considered in vitro fertilization treatment and visited a clinic. They listened to a lecture on the difficult decisions they would have to make, such as whether to choose the sex of a child and what they would do with unused embryos. On the ride home afterward, both were quiet. Then Mauney burst out: 'Sam, I'm not real religious, but I'll be damned if I want to choose. I just don't feel right about that.' Sam said: 'I know. I don't feel right, either.'\n'Well, look,' he said. 'How about we just go along for a while and see what happens?'\nA few months later, they were sitting out front of their camper as usual with a circle of their friends, opening beers. Sam said, 'I don't really feel like drinking.' Mauney whipped his head around. Sam could usually drink his friends under the table. She said, 'I just feel funny; I'm going to lay down.' He followed her to the back of the camper and said, 'You're pregnant.' And when the test came back, she was.\n'Don't ever tell me I can't do something,' he said, grinning.\nJagger Mauney plays with the calves his father recently purchased for his 5-year-old son.

After that, the collision between Mauney and Arctic Assassin became increasingly inevitable.\nJust a few weeks after his son's birth, Mauney rode a bull named Big Black to tie the record for PBR event victories. But when it was over, he had to ask for a hand up from the sand, unable to stand.\nThat year, he rode through a fractured tibia, a torn medial collateral ligament, a torn rotator cuff, a rib separation and fracture, a sprained wrist, a sprained ankle and a groin strain.\n'He doesn't bitch about anything. He never complains,' Samantha says. 'But I mean, I could see it all over his face.'\nMauney talks with other competitors during the American Rodeo in Arlington, Tex., in March. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\nSam managed to watch outwardly impassive from ringside, with the little boy in her lap. She was more nervous than she appeared. 'Lots of times,' she admits. 'Especially if I got a bad feeling, and then it was like, you can't say you have this weird bad feeling, right? Because if something happens, then you feel like it's your fault.'\nShe had one of those feelings in August 2021 in Kennewick, Wash. He got a hoof in the head and was out for five minutes. When she arrived backstage, he was still unconscious with blood coming out of his mouth and medics were yelling at him, 'J.B.! J.B.!' trying to make him come to.\nAt the end of 2021, he was tied for first place after the opening round of the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas. The next bull was named Johnny Thunder. Mauney's head collided with a horn, rendering him unconscious while he was still atop the bull. He sagged off sideways and was dragged like a sack of potatoes as the bull kicked him repeatedly. His hand came free at last. Somehow, the motionless heap started crawling. He left the arena under his own power. 'Things got a little western,' he joked afterward.\nAt some point in those years, an interviewer who saw where it was all headed asked him how he wanted to be remembered. Mauney answered: 'That's pretty easy. That's real easy. … I don't really give a s--- what anybody thinks about me, whether I'm the greatest or not. … All I want to be remembered as is, that son of a bitch put it all out there every single time he nodded his head.'\nreal easy. … I don't really give a s--- what anybody thinks about me, whether I'm the greatest or not. … All I want to be remembered as is, that son of a bitch put it all out there every single time he nodded his head.'\nIt's fair to say Mauney proved his point. And once a bull rider has proved everything to himself, that's where the most danger comes in. Ty Murray explains, 'The only thing that's left out there is for you to get hurt.'\nJagger touches his dad's scar after they ate lunch at a local country store. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\nOn the day Mauney and Arctic Assassin met in Lewiston, Idaho, Samantha wasn't there to see it. They had driven the camper to Ellensburg, Wash., which was their next stop up the road, so Jagger could settle for a few days and Sam could go to a barrel race. 'Just stay,' J.B. told her. He would ride to Lewiston in a truck with a couple of other riders and then double back to join them.\nThe cell reception in her camper was so bad she couldn't stream his ride. 'And it was a good thing it wasn't on, to be honest,' she says. Instead, she got a call later that night from Shane Proctor's wife, Haley. 'J.B's okay. He got up and walked out, but he said he broke his neck,' she reported. Sam spent the night packing up the trailer and then drove it over a mountainous route to the hospital.\nIt was a three-day trip from Lewiston back to Stephenville, and when they got home, he spent exactly two days in bed. The hospital had given him all sorts of do's and don'ts, such as, 'Don't lift anything heavier than a gallon of milk.' But Mauney got up and started putting his clothes on.\n'What are you doing?' Sam said,\n'I'm going to the barns,' he said.\nPretty soon, he was working the gears in a tractor in his neck brace, shoving dirt around.\nMauney feeds bulls on his ranch in Stephensonville, Tex. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\nAbout two weeks after he got home, Mauney picked up the phone and made the call to Matt Scharping, to tell him he wanted to buy Arctic Assassin.\nWhen Scharping asked, 'What do you want him for?' Mauney might've replied that he wanted to make a belt out of him. Instead, what he said was this:\n'I want to say I was the last guy who ever rode him.'\nOne afternoon, Mauney was working around the barns when one of his friends said to him, 'I just hate that you didn't get to end on your own terms.'\n'It was always going to end this way,' Mauney said. 'I wasn't ever going to be able to tell myself I couldn't do it.'\nMauney chats on the phone with longtime friend and Arctic Assassin's previous owner Matt Scharping. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\nTHERE WAS the 'for what.' J.B. Mauney chose to live with the bull that ended his career because Arctic Assassin delivered the message that he was never going to tell himself: It was time to quit.\nTHERE WAS the 'for what.' J.B. Mauney chose to live with the bull that ended his career because Arctic Assassin delivered the message that he was never going to tell himself: It was time to quit.\n'That was the best thing that could've happened,' Mauney says. 'I'm still upright.'\nIt had been a little more than 16 weeks since the catastrophic injury. Mauney no longer wears a neck brace, and his curling black hair hides any sign of scarring on his neck. When he wakes in the morning he is achingly stiff, but he's found that over the course of a day, working with the animals in open air eases it. 'He goes to work and gets outside, and he feels so much better,' Sam observes. 'He feels better if he's moving around.' As a result, he has pivoted to training the next great bull riders, as Jerome Davis once trained him. In February, Mauney announced he will serve as head coach of the Oklahoma Wildcatters, part of the PBR's team competition.\nMauney now trains young bull riders on his ranch in Stephenville. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\nYoung bull riders practice at Mauney's ranch. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\nMauney flips over the fence as a bull runs loose in the arena on his ranch. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\nMauney's ranch has become a practice site for bull riders — newly minted 23-year-old PRCA champion Ky Hamilton is there almost weekly. On horseback, Mauney herds bulls into the pens while young riders pull on their gear. Jagger arrives with Sam from preschool to watch. He has miniature versions of his own riding gear: chaps, boots and a glove.\nJagger swirls through the legs of the men, imitating their every move. Someone hands him a bull rope. Jagger stomps in a circle, imitating a stamping, twisting bull. Then he falls to the ground and clutches his throat.\n'Daddy, my neck is broke!' he cries.\nThere is silence.\n'Daddy, my neck is broke! My neck is broke!'\nMauney is up on a welded metal fence, bent over the chute, dealing with a bull.\n'Well, quit talking then,' he says mildly without looking around.\nJagger seizes a roll of adhesive tape, which the cowboys use for their ankles and wrists, and bandages his neck. After a while, he tries to rip it off his tender skin. An expression of shock crosses his face, and he begins to wail. Sam picks him up, and J.B. stops what he's doing and climbs down from the fence. She hands him over, and the boy buries his face in his father's shoulder.\nPain is the price of living rampant. Jagger will figure that out, just as his parents did. They won't spare their child this education. 'He can play the piano for all I give a s---, as long as he does it 110 percent,' Mauney says, and you can tell he means it.\nMauney and Jagger are kindred spirits. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\nLate in the day, after the cowboys have left, it is evening feeding time. Mauney heads to the upper pasture to tend to the black bull on the horizon, the inevitability he always knew he one day would have to surrender to, given all the things he jumped off of and ran into, the things hazarded rather than held back. Arctic Assassin was loaded on a trailer and delivered to Stephenville in late January. Mauney gave him his own broad, quiet paddock on the hillside, well away from the bucking ring, which Arctic Assassin will never see. As Mauney likes to say, 'He retired me, so now he gets to retire.'\nAs Mauney steps into his pasture, the black bull wanders over and noses him. The bull bends his head, conciliatory, as Mauney gently strokes his back with a peculiar half-smile on his face. What happened between the two of them, after all, was only life.\n'Of all the mean son of guns I got on in my career, and this dog-gentle one is the one that ended it,' he says.\nAs the cowboy strokes the tough hide, he's at peace with his fortunes, while out across the American savanna, more riders await their bulls.\nAmerican savanna, more riders await their bulls.\nMauney said of Arctic Assassin, 'I want to say I was the last guy who ever rode him.' He got his wish. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)",
