It cited credible reports of 'unlawful killings' by both Hamas and the Israeli government.\nAdvertisement\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said the Oct. 7 attacks, which killed more than 1,200 people, and the subsequent death of civilians during Israel's military response in Gaza 'have also raised deeply troubling human rights concerns.'\nBut Blinken stopped short of announcing a decision the Israeli government has suggested could be imminent to suspend U.S. security aid to elements of the Israeli military because of alleged human rights abuses. While the Biden administration has declined to say whether it plans to bar aid to any unit under the Leahy Laws, Israeli officials have issued preemptive protests in recent days to such a move.\nDefense Minister Yoav Gallant, a member of Israel's special war cabinet, over the weekend cautioned the administration against targeting the Netzah Yehuda battalion, which he said was playing an important role in Israel's battle against Hamas and Lebanese militia group Hezbollah. In 2022, the IDF disciplined several officials over the death of an elderly Palestinian-American man in the unit's custody.\nAdvertisement\nBlinken said the United States would continue to make assessments about foreign nations' records on human rights, and potentially authorize consequences for countries that fall short, regardless of their status as an enemy or partner of the United States. Washington has long been Israel's chief ally and military backer.\n'As we're looking at human rights and conditioning [assistance], human rights around the world, we apply the same standard to everyone,' he told reporters. 'That doesn't change whether the country in question is an adversary or competitor, a friend or an ally.'\nSuch a designation, if it occurs, would likely heighten friction between President Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a moment of intense tension over Israel's conduct of its war in Gaza and its failure to ensure civilians trapped there have sufficient food and medicine.\nover Israel's conduct of its war in Gaza and its failure to ensure civilians trapped there have sufficient food and medicine.\nThe report referenced the death of more than 21,000 people in the Gaza Strip through the end of 2023. Robert Gilchrist, an official in the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor declined to specify how the department determined those figures and whether they were based primarily on numbers from health authorities in Gaza, which Israeli officials have long said are controlled by Hamas and provide exaggerated reporting.\nAdvertisement\nBlinken said the State Department was continuing to assess allegations from human rights groups that Israeli forces have violated international law in Gaza but said Israel had shown it would hold its own people and institutions accountable.\n'This is what separates democracies from other countries \u2014 the ability, the willingness, the determination to look at themselves,' he said.\nThe report said that Israeli authorities had taken 'some steps to identify and punish officials accused of committing human rights abuses' in the West Bank, where U.S. officials have long criticized the establishment of Israeli settlements and settler violence against Palestinians. The administration last week announced new penalties linked to individuals accused of stoking violence there.\nBut it said that Israeli authorities operating in Gaza had taken 'no publicly visible steps to identify and punish officials' implicated in alleged violations there.\nAdvertisement\nBecause the report covers 2023, it did not address the aftermath of a high-profile incident in which Israel's military targeted an international aid convoy in April, killing seven people. An initial Israeli investigation into that incident found the IDF violated its own regulations. At least two officers were dismissed and other officials were reprimanded.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Michael Birnbaum,Missy Ryan","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2FOMUUVQZ57EVG5WK6SGQZQ5UA_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.3710995,"_id":"d25ca8a5fac8b11a82d40356b011fede"},{"title":"As Israel-Iran clash cools, Gaza's crisis remains","author":"Ishaan Tharoor","published_date":"2024-04-22 04:00:19","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/22/israel-gaza-iran-crisis-war","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"By the weekend, the immediate threat of escalation seems to have been lifted between Iran and Israel.

The attack was mostly neutralized by Israel and its allies, but such a brazen assault meant the Israeli war cabinet felt compelled to retaliate.\nTheir response seemed to come in the early hours Friday, delayed after numerous Western officials and diplomats counseled Israeli restraint. Reports pointed to suspected limited Israeli strikes near a prominent nuclear facility in the central Iranian province of Isfahan. The attack appeared to be calibrated as a warning to Iran of Israel's reach and knowledge of the theocratic regime's sensitive assets and military sites.\nIsraeli strikes near a prominent nuclear facility in the central Iranian province of Isfahan.

'We have a highly capable air force, and the United States is on our side.'\nIranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian downplayed the incident in an NBC News interview, saying it 'was not a strike' and 'they were more like toys that our children play with \u2014 not drones.' He also bought into Israel's plausible deniability, stressing that it was not clear there was 'a connection' between the strike and Israel, and suggested Iran would not have 'any new reactions' if there's no further Israeli action.\nAn Israeli official said Israel attacked Iran on April 19 in retaliation for Iran launching a barrage of missiles and drones at Israel.

He added: 'It's not yet possible to say with certainty that the danger is behind us, but there is room for cautious optimism.'\nBut there's less reason for optimism when it comes to Gaza, the besieged territory in Israel's crosshairs that's the site of one of the world's most staggering humanitarian catastrophes. The Palestinian death toll over more than six months of war between Israel and militant group Hamas climbed above 34,000 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children.\nEarlier this month, USAID Administrator Samantha Power said it was 'credible' to assess that famine was already underway in areas of Gaza, especially the territory's north. Israel and Washington have said humanitarian aid flows have improved in recent days, while the Biden administration is plowing ahead in its efforts to set up a pier on Gaza's coast where U.N. agencies and other organizations can bring in food supplies via the sea. But humanitarian groups have said little has changed on the ground, and a sprawling hunger crisis endures.\nIsrael and Washington have said humanitarian aid flows have improved in recent days, while the Biden administration is plowing ahead in its efforts to set up a pier on Gaza's coast where U.N. agencies and other organizations can bring in food supplies via the sea.

Relief and Works Agency was in need of critical reforms to ensure it remains neutral, but that Israel had not shown evidence to support its claims that large numbers of staffers were tied to militant groups.","summary":"JERUSALEM \u2014 Israel has not provided evidence that significant numbers of workers with the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees are tied to militant groups, but urged the agency to implement more robust vetting of staff members to ensure neutrality and work to reestablish trust with donors, a highly anticipated report said Monday.\nBased on an examination of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency's screening procedures, code of ethics, management structure, staff training and other practices, the independent review group concluded that the agency has 'established and updated a significant number of policies, mechanisms and procedures' to uphold neutrality in recent years but is in need of critical reforms.\n'In the absence of a political solution between Israel and the Palestinians, UNRWA remains pivotal in providing lifesaving humanitarian aid and essential social services, particularly in health and education, to Palestinian refugees in Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank,' the report said.\nAdvertisement\nThe U.N. General Assembly established UNRWA in 1949 to help Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the creation of the state of Israel. More than seven decades later, UNRWA continues to administer government-like services for more than 5 million people across Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.\nThe findings released Monday will largely come as a relief to the embattled agency, which was pitched into an existential crisis in January after Israel alleged that a dozen of its 13,000 employees in Gaza participated in the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks, and that the agency was widely infiltrated by Hamas and other militant groups.\nSixteen major donors, including the United States, suspended funding worth about $450 million, nearly half of UNRWA's budget for the year. UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini immediately fired the staff members in question \u2014 a sign, he said, of how seriously the agency took the allegations. But Israel \u2014 long opposed to an agency that it sees as perpetuating the Palestinian refugee issue and stoking antisemitism \u2014 called for UNRWA to be disbanded.\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said in February, without providing evidence, that Israel had intelligence indicating that an additional 30 UNRWA workers participated in the Oct. 7 assault and that 12 percent of UNRWA's workers in the Gaza Strip were affiliated with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller Islamist group in the Gaza Strip.\nAdvertisement\nUnited Nations Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres commissioned the independent review group that month 'to assess whether the Agency is doing everything within its power to ensure neutrality and to respond to allegations of serious breaches when they are made.'\nThe body, led by former French foreign minister Catherine Colonna and a trio of Scandinavian research institutions, did not examine the accusations that some UNRWA employees took part in the Oct. 7 attacks; those claims are being probed separately by investigators from the U.N. Office of Internal Oversight Services, which is expected to release its own report later this year.\nIn some ways, this was the higher-stakes investigation: Several major donors, including Germany and the United Kingdom, have said the restoration of their funding to the agency rests on assessments of its neutrality.\nAdvertisement\nThe group spoke with more than 200 people, including senior UNRWA leaders across the region and officials from donor states, host countries, Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Egypt, during its nine-week review.\nIts final report outlined a variety of measures, including staff training and investigation procedures, that the agency has taken to maintain neutrality and discipline employees who violate humanitarian principles. It also said UNRWA has mechanisms in place to prevent its facilities from being misused for political or military purposes, though it called for more regular inspections.\nOn staff vetting, the report said UNRWA shares staff lists annually with host countries and with Israel for East Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank. The United States also receives the lists upon request. These states are then responsible for raising any red flags \u2014 but Israel had not done so since 2011, the report said.\nAdvertisement\nThe Israeli foreign ministry informed the group that it had received staff lists without Palestinian identification numbers before March 2024.\n'On the basis of the March 2024 list, which contained Palestinian ID numbers, Israel made public claims that a significant number of UNRWA employees are members of terrorist organizations,' the report said. 'However, Israel has yet to provide supporting evidence of this.'\nUNRWA currently screens all affiliates biannually against the U.N. sanctions list. But the sanctions roster is 'limited to a small number of individuals, and UNRWA lacks the support of intelligence services to undertake efficient and comprehensive vetting.'\nUNRWA has already agreed to provide donors with lists of its employees, including ID card information, every quarter. The report called on host countries and Israel to screen staff and share evidence of any concerning findings.\nAdvertisement\nThe group also examined Israeli allegations that UNRWA-run schools rely on educational materials that deny Israel's right to exist and glorify violence resistance. Colonna's team said UNRWA has taken steps to purge politicized material from Palestinian Authority textbooks, noting that a review last year found a 'small fraction' of textbook pages contain objectionable content.\n'Even if marginal, these issues constitute a grave violation of neutrality,' the report said, urging UNRWA to audit the content of learning materials with Israeli and other authorities.\nAcross the board, lack of funding significantly hampers efforts to uphold the organization's neutrality, the group found.\nUNRWA is unique in the United Nations ecosystem since it provides basic services to a specific population and draws most of its 32,000 employees from the pool of Palestinian refugees it serves. Staff are 'living the occupation,' which creates both valuable expertise and challenges to ensuring neutrality, Adam Bouloukos, UNRWA's West Bank director, said in an interview last month.\nAdvertisement\n'Neutrality breaches by UNRWA personnel often take the form of social media posts, particularly following incidents of violence affecting colleagues or relatives,' the report said, recommending that the agency do more to create space for workers to discuss traumatic events.\nStill, agency policy \u2014 as outlined by the review group \u2014 requires employees to show neutrality at all times or risk disciplinary measures. UNRWA vehemently rejects accusations it is widely infiltrated by Hamas or is complicit in militant activity. It says Israel has still not provided detailed evidence to back up its allegations.\nThe U.S. intelligence community could not verify the Israeli claims about Oct. 7 with a high degree of confidence, officials told The Post in February.\nA Washington Post analysis found that the face and vehicle of a man who was captured in CCTV footage from Kibbutz Beeri on Oct. 7 dragging the limp body of an Israeli man into a car appeared to match that of Faisal Ali Musalam Naami, 45, an UNRWA social worker identified by Israel as a participant in the attacks. Otherwise, The Post has been unable to independently verify the Israeli allegations.\nAdvertisement\nUNRWA, meanwhile, said this month that Palestinian UNRWA staff in Gaza detained by the IDF had been subjected to mistreatment in Israeli custody and were 'pressured during interrogations to make forced confessions against the Agency.'\n'The IDF acts in accordance with Israeli and international law in order to protect the rights of the detainees held in the detention and questioning facilities,' the IDF said in a statement to The Post.\nOn top of funding challenges, the agency says Israel has restricted its access to northern Gaza and has repeatedly hit its UNRWA facilities in Gaza. Lazzarini told the Security Council last week that 178 UNRWA workers have been killed since the start of the war, and called for an investigation. West Bank staff have faced increased harassment by Israeli soldiers and settlers. In East Jerusalem, Israeli politicians are seeking to evict UNRWA from its headquarters.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's postwar plan for Gaza, unveiled in February, envisions the dismantling of UNRWA.\nAdvertisement\n'UNRWA is Hamas and Hamas is UNRWA,' Gilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, told the U.N.

'The time has come to defund UNRWA.'\nDespite the hard-line rhetoric, some officials in Jerusalem quietly acknowledge that doing away with the agency in the near future could undermine Israeli interests, since UNRWA provides aid and services in the West Bank and Gaza that Israel is loath to take on.\nGaza is in the throes of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis, with more than 2 million people at risk of famine, according to the world's top body for assessing food insecurity.\nUNRWA is 'the backbone of the humanitarian operation' in Gaza, Lazzarini told the Security Council last week, making a desperate pitch for member states to support an agency 'under enormous strain.'\nMost major donors have restored funding since January. But U.S. contributions \u2014 which at $422 million in 2023 dwarfed those of the next largest donors \u2014 are on hold until March 2025, after Republicans in Congress tacked a year-long funding ban onto a government spending package last month.\nEven so, the Biden administration has continued to publicly acknowledge UNRWA's importance to the region: U.S. deputy ambassador to the United Nations Robert Wood told the Security Council on Wednesday that it plays an 'indispensable role' in Gaza.\nGuterres accepted the recommendations and agreed with Lazzarini that UNRWA will 'establish an action plan' to implement them, spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric said in a statement Monday.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Claire Parker","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PREWNQOXW2AX4QNI3GMYGYTZ24_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":7.1145086,"_id":"d07516c59bfb2042f42adfd9e6c394fb"},{"title":"What is Israel's \u2018Netzah Yehuda' battalion, and why could it face U.S. aid cuts?","author":"Adela Suliman","published_date":"2024-04-22 17:37:39","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/22/leahy-law-israel-sanctions-what-to-know","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to cut military aid to Israel's \u2018Netzah Yehuda' battalion, over human rights allegations.

Summer Lee's criticism of Israel's response to the Oct. 7 attacks initially set her apart. But the Israel-Gaza war has shifted U.S. public opinion.","summary":"PITTSBURGH \u2014 Rep. Summer Lee, a freshman Democrat who faces a primary challenge Tuesday from an opponent who has characterized her as extreme on foreign policy, was one of the first members of Congress to criticize Israel's military response to the Oct. 7 attacks in which Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages.\nLee, a member of the 'Squad' of lefty Democrats, called for a cease-fire a little over a week after the attack and suggested Israel was guilty of 'blatant human rights violations.'\nThat reaction initially set Lee apart from many in her party. But as Israel has continued its retaliatory assault on Hamas-run Gaza, U.S. public opinion has shifted. Approval of Israel's military actions among Democrats nationwide dropped from 36 percent in November to 18 percent in March, according to a recent Gallup poll.\nAdvertisement\nSome in this community, which is home to the Tree of Life synagogue, the site of the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history, have come around to their congresswoman's position.\nLee made 'some missteps with the Jewish community' in the early days after Oct. 7, making statements that some people here viewed as sympathetic only to Palestinians, Annie Weidman said as she shopped for Passover groceries this weekend.\nIn the months that followed, Lee 'calmed down her rhetoric,' said Weidman, 63. 'And I do understand her position of being very much for the Palestinian people because it's really, really awful, and I totally get it.'\n'Everybody has sort of moved to her position rather than the other way around,' Weidman, who voted early for Lee, added later.\nSince October, some 34,000 Palestinians, including 13,000 children, have been killed in Gaza, according to local health authorities. And although the House of Representatives approved a new tranche of aid for Israel on Saturday over the objections of 58 members, including Lee, top Democratic leaders, including President Biden and Sen. Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), have sharpened their criticism of the Israeli government in recent weeks.\nAdvertisement\n'What we're seeing slowly but surely is not voters catching up to the Squad \u2014 it is other Democratic politicians catching up to where voters have been for months,' said Usamah Andrabi, the communications director for Justice Democrats, which works to elect liberals to Congress and has supported Lee's reelection campaign.\nBoth Lee and her opponent, Edgewood Borough council member Bhavini Patel, dispute the idea that Tuesday's election is primarily about the war. But voters here volunteer their thoughts on the topic without prompting. In Squirrel Hill, home to Patel's campaign office, lawn signs bearing her name appear frequently next to ones reading 'we stand with Israel.'\nPatel has continued to criticize Lee's position on the conflict.\n'She's clearly picked a side in this situation and completely disregards her entire district,' Patel said in an interview Saturday. 'I think it's important that any call for a cease-fire should acknowledge that hostages are still being held,' she added.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Lee first ran for this seat two years ago, pro-Israel outside groups, including Democratic Majority for Israel and a PAC associated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) spent heavily in an attempt to defeat her, holding her to a 1,000-vote victory in the primary.\nBut neither the AIPAC-affiliated group nor Democratic Majority for Israel have intervened in this year's primary, according to the most recent federal campaign finance filing data. Asked about the race, an AIPAC representative said the group is 'already involved in several races, and we will be engaged in additional campaigns where we can have the greatest impact.' A representative for DMFI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nInstead, the Moderate PAC, a group backed by Republican megadonor Jeffrey Yass, has intervened in the race, airing television ads attacking Lee for 'opposing Biden' as images of pro-abortion-rights protests and the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection played on-screen.\nAdvertisement\nPatel has denounced Yass and said that she considers herself 'a principled progressive Democrat,' but Lee and her allies have worked to make the billionaire's involvement in the race a liability for Patel. At a Sunday rally with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), supporters of Lee waved black-and-yellow signs reading 'Move, Yass! Get out of the way' and 'Stop Republican billionaires.'\nOcasio-Cortez characterized the Moderate PAC's involvement as 'an attempt to purchase and buy the seat back.' Attendees booed as she mentioned Yass and AIPAC. She stressed the importance of showing the world and 'the people in that big White House' that Lee 'is not alone,' and reminded voters that Tuesday's primary is the first of several challenges to members of the Squad, including Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri.\nVoters here frequently bring up their faith when describing their vote, and religious leaders have expressed strong opinions about the candidates. Last fall, 40 Pittsburgh rabbis and cantors wrote an open letter denouncing Lee for being one of only nine Democrats to vote against a resolution avowing support for Israel and condemning Hamas. In a follow-up letter in March, many of the same rabbis and cantors accused her of using 'divisive language, which, at times, we have perceived as openly antisemitic.'\nAdvertisement\nIn Squirrel Hill, home to a politically active and sizable Jewish community, the 14th Ward Independent Democratic Club, a local group that's not formally affiliated with the party, endorsed Patel this year after backing Lee two years ago.\n'Some people are not interested in combating antisemitism, and they're not interested in hearing and talking with and representing the Jewish community in the same way they necessarily are other communities,' said Jeremy Kazzaz, a member of the club's board and the president of the Beacon Coalition, a recently launched organization that aims to provide 'voter education on issues of concern to the Jewish American community' and that has endorsed Patel.\nBut the city's religious communities are far from united behind either candidate.\n'This has been a very, very painful couple of years for the Pittsburgh Jewish community,' said Jared Magnani, 55. He is supporting Lee, noting he was 'proud of her for the rapidity of her response calling for a cease-fire' because 'just because we're American Jews, it doesn't mean that Israel merits an exemption from allegations of significant human rights abuses and crimes against humanity.'\nWeidman's husband, Larry, 71, said he seriously considered supporting Patel before deciding to vote for Lee. 'But it was never because of comments that Summer Lee made right after Oct. 7,' he said. 'Some of the comments that she made, they're not so out of the mainstream now.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Dylan Wells","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C2QJFDQVXG6NF4LT2JZLKQITY4_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.9543786,"_id":"9278fcfd5a202c4b4d2d4fa47aa90b54"},{"title":"Israeli military intelligence chief resigns over failure to prevent Oct. 7 attack","author":"Associated Press","published_date":"2024-04-22 07:20:54","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/22/israel-hamas-war-news-04-22-2024/db031fd4-0078-11ef-8eac-39c6dcb59eb5_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The Israeli military say the head of its intelligence corps has resigned over Hamas' Oct. 7 attack","summary":"TEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 The Israeli military said Monday the head of its intelligence corps has resigned over the failures surrounding Hamas' unprecedented Oct. 7 attack, which broke through Israel's vaunted defenses.\nAharon Haliva, the head of Israel's military intelligence, becomes the first senior Israeli figure to step down Hamas' attack, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, with roughly 250 more taken captive, and sparked the six-monthlong war against Hama sin Gaza.\nHaliva said shortly after the attack in October that he shouldered the blame for not preventing the assault.\nThe Israeli military said in a statement that the military chief of staff accepted Haliva's request to resign and thanked him for his service.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Associated Press","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GM3JZDQAPII67DVMHHDNZNM6WU.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.9530406,"_id":"52f9e7ee978a0bb581039f8e0799cd1a"},{"title":"Why Israel had a limited strike on Iran","author":"David Ignatius","published_date":"2024-04-19 23:10:08","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/19/israel-iran-retaliate-diplomacy","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"One rule for containing a crisis is to keep your mouth shut. But I'll tell you what appears to have happened between Israel and Iran.","summary":"One rule for containing a crisis is to keep your mouth shut, and the United States, Israel and Iran were all doing a pretty good job at that Friday after Israeli strikes near the Iranian city of Isfahan. Maybe the silence was the real message \u2014 a desire on all sides to prevent escalation by word or deed.\nOver the past week, we've seen what looks to me like a considered decision by Israel to subtly reshape its strategy for deterring Iran and Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah. Israeli deterrence is usually about massive use of offensive military force \u2014 a roundhouse punch that seeks to compel compliance through coercion.\nBut this time was different. When Iran launched a missile and drone barrage last weekend in retaliation for Israel's April 1 strike on Iranian military leaders in Damascus, Syria, Israel used its Iron Dome defense system and help from allies to absorb the blow. The reported destruction of 99 percent of Iran's incoming munitions was an astonishing display of missile defense. Some Israelis wanted to respond immediately with a big counter-barrage. But under pressure from President Biden, they waited.\nAdvertisement\nWhen the Israeli response came early Friday, it was muted. Iranian and Israeli reports suggest that the Israeli air force attacked a site near some of Iran's largest nuclear facilities. Those facilities weren't damaged, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. But Israel sent the message that it can penetrate Iranian air defenses and hit strategic targets when it chooses.\nIsrael wanted the last word in this exchange, and it seems to have succeeded. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday, after talks with officials in Tehran, that 'Iran does not want an escalation.' Iranian public statements scoffed at the limited action, but Israel showed it can strike when it wants \u2014 in this case a jab, but next time, maybe not. In this sense, Israel maintained what strategists call 'escalation dominance.' It landed the first blow and the last one.\nand the last one.\nHow to explain Israel's actions over the past week? What accounts for its restraint, in a situation where hawks in the Israeli government were screaming for all-out assault?\nAdvertisement\nHere's my take: Israel is behaving like the leader of a regional coalition against Iran. In its measured response, it appeared to be weighing the interests of its allies in this coalition \u2014 Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan \u2014 which all provided quiet help in last weekend's shoot-down. It's playing the long game, in other words.\nFollow this author David Ignatius 's opinions\nFollow this author\nDavid Ignatius\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nThis would amount to a paradigm shift for Israel. Rather than seeing itself as the embattled Jewish state fighting alone for its survival against a phalanx of Arab and Muslim enemies, Israel knows that it has allies. Top of the list, as always, is the United States. But America is joined by Arab states that oppose Iran and its proxies as much as the Israelis do.\nThat's the new shape of the Middle East. But for now, at least, this ripening friendship between Israel and its former adversaries in the region must remain unspoken.\nAdvertisement\nIsrael over the past week has gained another precious asset. After absorbing Iran's missile assault so deftly, it's seen at once as a victim of attack and a master of high-tech defense. That's a welcome reversal, after six months of grueling combat against Hamas in Gaza that severely tarnished Israel's international reputation. After Iran's cascade of missiles and the limited response from Jerusalem, Israel now appears to have support of the Group of Seven advanced industrial nations.\nIsraeli hard-liners will say that a weak Biden administration has pressured Israel to pull its punches. In the brutal combat of the Middle East, it's kill or be killed, these critics will argue. This hard-bitten Israeli conception of deterrence can seem compelling. But I've been watching Israel's go-it-alone approach to security for nearly 45 years, and I would say that its results have been mixed, at best.\nWe're looking at something new, after 'the guns of April.' Maybe the worst is yet to come, if Iran decides to 'sneak out' toward acquiring nuclear weapons, Hezbollah attacks from the north or Israel opts for devastating preventive war against Hezbollah in Lebanon. But good or bad, this is a new chapter in the story.\nAdvertisement\nBringing a rapid end to the Gaza war is essential now. We're at an inflection point, where it's in the overwhelming interest of Israel, the Palestinians and the entire Middle East to conclude this conflict. As veteran diplomat Dennis Ross recently observed, Israel is accomplishing the effective demilitarization of Hamas, with 19 of its 24 battalions gone. The de facto military alliance of Saudi Arabia and other Arab states with Israel is an open secret. We're moving, at last, toward 'the day after.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David Ignatius","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/K3QDXK75N55ED3NAT64P6B3UAU_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.9433103,"_id":"f12a286d394b5b5b923cbe5bf14af014"},{"title":"Review of UN agency helping Palestinian refugees found Israel did not express concern about staff","author":"Edith M.

The review was carried out after Israel alleged that a dozen employees of the agency known as UNRWA had participated in Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks.\nIn a wide-ranging 48-page report released Monday, the independent panel said UNRWA has 'robust' procedures to uphold the U.N. principle of neutrality, but it cited serious gaps in implementation, including staff publicly expressing political views, textbooks with 'problematic content' and staff unions disrupting operations.\nFrom 2017 to 2022, the report said the annual number of allegations of neutrality being breached at UNRWA ranged from 7 to 55. But between January 2022 and February 2024 U.N. investigators received 151 allegations, most related to social media posts 'made public by external sources,' it said.\nAdvertisement\nIn a key section on the neutrality of staff, the panel, which was led by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna, said UNRWA shares lists of staff with host countries for its 32,000 staff, including about 13,000 in Gaza. But it said Israeli officials never expressed concern and informed panel members it did not consider the list 'a screening or vetting process' but rather a procedure to register diplomats.\nThe Israeli Foreign Ministry informed the panel that until March 2024 the staff lists did not include Palestinian identification numbers, the report said.\nApparently based on those numbers, 'Israel made public claims that a significant number of UNRWA employees are members of terrorist organizations,' the panel said. 'However, Israel has yet to provide supporting evidence of this.'\nAdvertisement\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres ordered the U.N. internal watchdog, the Office of Internal Oversight Services, to carry out a separate investigation into the Israeli allegations that 12 UNRWA staffers participated in the Oct. 7 attacks.

It later emerged that the cyberattack was the work of U.S. and Israeli experts and that, even after software security companies discovered the virus, the joint operation targeting Iranian nuclear infrastructure proceeded under the secret orders of President Barack Obama, who was eager to slow Iran's apparent progress toward building an atomic bomb without launching a traditional military attack, The Post reported at the time.\nIran's highly sensitive Natanz nuclear facility has been hit over the years. In 2020, for instance, a massive explosion and fire caused significant damage. Iranian officials suggested that the United States or Israeli operatives were to blame, though neither country acknowledged involvement.

This week, I look at President Biden's delicate diplomacy with Israel, pick the distinguished person of the week and share a fascinating book \u2014 on grammar, no less!\nWhat caught my eye\nPresident Biden has declared himself to be a Zionist \u2014 the first president, I believe, to express his support in this way for a permanent homeland for the Jewish people. His unwavering backing at the beginning of the Israel-Gaza war endeared him to the Israeli people. But, as a true friend of Israel, Biden knows that the Israel-U.S. relationship largely depends on democratic, shared values. Accordingly, he became increasingly critical as civilian casualties mounted and Israel failed to deliver sufficient humanitarian relief and protection for aid workers.\nAdvertisement\nIsrael cannot endure as a pariah on the world stage. Its long-term interests require it to prevent mass starvation in Gaza and minimize further civilian casualties. In the aftermath of the World Central Kitchen deaths, Biden's implicit threat to withdraw support if Israel did not adjust its conduct paid dividends. Israel increased aid delivery and instituted deconfliction procedures.\nThese steps, in the long run, benefit Israel . Middle East veteran negotiator Dennis A. Ross explained on X: 'Israel must be serious about permitting humanitarian assistance and ensuring the security of delivery. This is not just morally right; it is in Israel's strategic interest to gain the time needed to dismantle Hamas militarily.'\nIsrael. Middle East veteran negotiator Dennis A. Ross explained on X: 'Israel must be serious about permitting humanitarian assistance and ensuring the security of delivery. This is not just morally right; it is in Israel's strategic interest to gain the time needed to dismantle Hamas militarily.'\nWhen Iran launched hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel in an unprecedented onslaught, Biden maintained his solid support for Israel. The United States (plus Jordan and Saudi Arabia, in a head-snapping display of Israel's support within the Sunni Arab states) provided military and intelligence assistance. Biden then followed up with a show of unwavering support from the Group of Seven.\nAdvertisement\nBut once again, Biden's job as commander in chief and steward of the Israel-U.S. relationship does not include unconditionally cheerleading for the Israeli prime minister infamous for pursuing rash measures to satisfy his extremist coalition partners. Biden, therefore, mixed praise for Israel's defensive success with a reminder of the dangers of a regional war. The Times of Israel reported that Biden 'made clear publicly and privately in his call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he does not want to see a regional conflict.' White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Biden was 'certainly not looking for a war with Iran' and that he himself was 'confident that Prime Minister Netanyahu is aware of the president's concerns.'\nContrary to some right-wing commentators' complaints, Biden has not asked Israel to do nothing . He is urging Israel to select a response that does not set off a larger conflagration. The difference between knocking down Tehran's power grid for a day and pummeling the city with missiles, for example, may be the difference between Israel gaining points with the international community and Israel starting a regional war.\nnothing.

[The] question now is how to turn that into a strategic opportunity [without] courting regional war. No Israeli government can accept Iran's strike as new normal.'\nAdvertisement\nJust as Biden's warning seems to have prevented a civilian tragedy in Rafah, his latest admonition to calibrate Israel's response appears to be working. 'Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked the Israel Defense Forces to provide a target list, according to an official familiar with high-level discussions, who said Israel is mulling retaliation that would \u2018send a message' but not cause casualties,' The Post reported.\nShortsighted defenders of Israel bristle at any sign that Biden is urging Netanyahu to show restraint. That's foolish and contrary to the interests of the Israeli people who are demanding that Netanyahu prioritize the hostages' release. Vicious anti-Israel critics who mouth Hamas's chants (e.g., 'From the river to the sea!') and glorify violence want Biden to abandon our historical ally. Biden will take neither approach. Rather, his delicate intervention helps Israel maximize its own security without alienating critical Western allies.\nLess informed critics accuse Biden of inconsistency. They have it backward. He remains a true friend of Israel, the sort of friend who cautions against rash action that would boomerang; who demands that Israel look beyond the moment to its long-term survival; and who, in his bones, understands the Israeli people want both democracy and security.\nAdvertisement\nBoth countries should be grateful that a seasoned president is in the Oval Office.\nDistinguished person of the week\nDavid Hume Kennerly, President Gerald Ford's photographer, resigned from the foundation that bears his former boss's name. After the board repeatedly refused to give Liz Cheney its award for distinguished public service, Kennerly wrote:\nA key reason Liz's nomination was turned down was your agita about what might happen if the former president is reelected. Some of you raised the specter of being attacked by the Internal Revenue Service and losing the foundation's tax-exempt status as retribution for selecting Liz for the award. The historical irony was completely lost on you. Gerald Ford became president, in part, because Richard Nixon had ordered the development of an enemies list and demanded his underlings use the IRS against those listed. That's exactly what the executive committee fears will happen if there's a second coming of Donald Trump.\nHis caustic response to the board's appalling cowardice: 'I mistakenly thought we were better than that.' For good measure, he quoted the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ('In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends').\nKennerly's refusal to condone the actions of a board 'cowed by a demagogue creating and promulgating the greatest crisis our country has faced since the Civil War' stands in sharp contrast to the sniveling servitude of New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, widely ridiculed for refusing to pronounce Trump unfit. As ABC News's George Stephanopoulos put it in wrapping up Sununu's disastrous interview:\n\"Me and 51 percent of America,\" Sununu says, which mendaciously overstates America's support for Trump https://t.co/xkENXws85N\n\u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) April 14, 2024\nCheney and Kennerly refuse to condone the moral collapse of Republicans such as Sununu and the board of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation. If we had more of the former and fewer of the latter, the country would not be facing the prospect of a second Trump term \u2014 one far more dangerous than the first.\nSomething different\nTrust me: A book about grammar can be fun. Anne Curzan's 'Says Who? A Kinder, Funner Usage Guide for Everyone Who Cares About Words' certainly qualifies. The thin volume should appeal to writers, editors and readers \u2014 all of whom (she talks a lot about whom/who) have grown up with certain rules that parents and teachers have drilled into their heads. However (she discusses that word as well), what if those rules are not rules at all?\nAdvertisement\nThe University of Michigan linguistics professor explores how grammar (and spelling) developed, who creates grammar rules and, most important, how grammar changes over time. In her tour through the English language, Curzan suggest two ways of looking at grammar.\n'Grammandos' police grammar (especially other people's) but may misunderstand the grammar rule they are wielding. They wind up denying themselves and listeners/readers the vibrancy and variety of available word choices. 'Wordies' \u2014 whom she likens to birdwatchers \u2014 explore which rules may be akin to suggestions and which grammar choices one can select from. (Did you notice what I did? Sometimes you can end a sentence with a preposition.) Wordies do not lack standards; rather, their curiosity about words allows them to creatively deploy (splitting infinitives has a long and storied pedigree) them.\ncan end a sentence with a preposition.) Wordies do not lack standards; rather, their curiosity about words allows them to creatively deploy (splitting infinitives has a long and storied pedigree) them.\nCertainly, the book will delight word nerds. While her analysis might give you flashbacks, positive or otherwise, to that persnickety English teacher in high school, Curzan manages to sprinkle her guide with plenty of jokes. Along the way, she also makes the case (pun intended) that fights about language often amount to fights about power, race, inclusion and gender.\nI have taken to heart one of her favorite quotes from an article on scientific writing: 'Complexity of thought need not lead to impenetrability of expression.' Put differently, the purpose of writing is to communicate with clarity, precision and, occasionally, wit. Curzan does all three.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jennifer Rubin","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OLVEAP342JITIC52JWBAHEJPFY.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.9136014,"_id":"81392a041f97ef7c2b3df866ee144a20"},{"title":"Israel says it will retaliate against Iran, despite the risks","author":"Julia Frankel","published_date":"2024-04-16 20:13:43","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/16/israel-iran-retaliation-explainer/d2cf6a92-fc2d-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Israel is vowing to retaliate against Iran even though such a mission carries many risks","summary":"JERUSALEM \u2014 Israel is vowing to retaliate against Iran, risking further expanding the shadow war between the two foes into a direct conflict after an Iranian attack over the weekend sent hundreds of drones and missiles toward Israel.\nIsraeli officials have not said how or when they might strike. But as countries around the world urge Israel to show restraint and the threat of a multi-front war mounts, it's clear that a direct Israeli attack on Iranian soil would lead to major fallout.\nIran says it carried out the strike to avenge an Israeli airstrike that killed two Iranian generals in Syria on April 1. It has pledged a much tougher response to any Israeli counterattack attack on its soil.\nWith Israel focused on its war against Hamas in Gaza, and already battling Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon every day, the U.S. has urged Israel to show restraint.\nAdvertisement\nU.S. officials say President Joe Biden has told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the U.S. will not participate in any offensive action against Iran, and the president made 'very clear' to Netanyahu 'that we do have to think carefully and strategically' about the risks of escalation.\nIsrael's war cabinet has spent the last two days debating their next move. Here are some considerations key to their decision.\nINCREASING ISRAELI ISOLATION\nIsrael's successful air defense Saturday night \u2014 conducted in tandem with the U.S., Britain, France and Jordan \u2014 bought the country a brief moment of international support and sympathy after months of mounting international isolation over the Gaza war. The six-month offensive has killed nearly 34,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and unleashed a humanitarian catastrophe.\nAdvertisement\nA coalition of international partners helped Israel defend itself effectively. Israel's military says 99% of the weapons were intercepted, with few reaching Israeli airspace. The attack caused only minor damage and wounded one person: a 7-year-old girl.\nThis coalition worked under the leadership of the U.S. Central Command, which oversees American forces in the region. It works closely with Israel and moderate Arab countries to form a unified front against Iran.\nJordan, a country whose population is predominantly pro-Palestinian, joined the effort, despite being at odds with Israel over the war in Gaza, calling its participation self-defense.\nIt also appears likely that help may have come from regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia, which does not have official relations with Israel. A map released by Israel shows many of the Iranian missiles flying through Saudi airspace.\nAdvertisement\nIsrael has been careful not to identify its Arab partners, but an Israeli air force official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the mission, said Israeli warplanes needed to fly 'east of Israel' to shoot down missiles.\nYoel Guzansky, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv think tank, said Israel would be risking this goodwill if it acts alone.\n'Israel can take advantage of this and buy itself a lot of credit right now, if it does not launch a massive retaliatory attack,' he said. 'But if it does attack, a lot of credit is lost.'\nThe tacit support of Arab states does not mean they would assist Israel in a counterattack on Iran. Any air or missile response other than ballistic missiles \u2014 which would arc over neighboring countries' airspace rather than through it \u2014 would require overflights of surrounding countries, which technically would require Israel obtain permission from those Arab neighbors, said Daniel Byman, a senior fellow with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nAdvertisement\n'With Saudi Arabia and Jordan, there's kind of a route and access questions,' in terms of whether they would grant Israel overflight clearance.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'From Iran's point of view, that would be seen as a hostile act,' Byman said. 'And even though these countries don't like Iran, they're not terribly eager to be seen on the side of Israel doing that.'\nFEARS OF A MULTI-FRONT WAR\nA major retaliatory strike on Iranian soil risks sparking a full-scale regional war, so any response must be carefully calculated.\nA direct strike on Iranian soil would almost certainly result in a brutal counterattack and risk prompting Hezbollah to launch further attacks. The Iranian-backed Lebanese group has a far more powerful arsenal than Hamas, but has so far shown hesitancy about engaging in an all-out war.\nSome 60,000 citizens in northern Israel already have been forced to evacuate their homes due to ongoing exchanges with Hezbollah. Heavier fighting would likely force them to spend even more time away from home.\nAdvertisement\nA direct conflict would also further stretch Israel's military, remove its focus from Gaza and hamper Israel's war-wearied economy.\nAny major attack on Iranian soil could also undermine shaky U.S. support for the war.\nTwo U.S. officials said Israel has not yet told the U.S. how it intends to respond. But the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe diplomatic discussions, said Israel has signaled that whatever it does will be designed to prevent a worsening of the already tense regional security situation. That could point to a more limited action, such as a strike on Iranian proxies across the region or a cyber attack on Iran.\nTamar Hermann, a polling expert at the Israel Democracy Institute, says most Israelis are in favor of some sort of military response as long as it is coordinated with regional allies, including the United States.\nAdvertisement\n'If it is done with no consultation and no agreement with allies \u2026 support will be much smaller,' Hermann said.\nMILITARY CAPACITY\nIsrael's army is vastly superior to others in the region. It possesses a range of high-tech weaponry, including F35 fighter planes that can launch long-range munitions. Experts say it has the ability to directly strike Iran or its proxies in the region.\nFabian Hinz, a weapons expert and research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Iranian air force is 'not even remotely comparable.' He said the force is composed of a collection of planes from the 1980s and 90s, with some dating back to the reign of the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi who ruled the country until 1979.\nThe extent of the Islamic republic's air defense system is less known, he said. Many of Iran's missile sites and nuclear installations are deep underground, making them difficult to hit, Hindz added. Israel might also need the agreement of Gulf Arab countries to use their airspace \u2014 something that is not guaranteed.\n'I don't think it's going to be a full-scale Israeli attack against many targets all over Iran,' said Raz Zimmt, another senior researcher at Israel's INSS. 'It will probably be limited against one or two, perhaps inside Iran.'\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jack Jeffery,Julia Frankel","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZWPIQPH4FUI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.891154,"_id":"d25e1ef5baadd6d01aacec434d174e8f"},{"title":"Ukraine notes contrast as U.S. coalition protected Israel from strikes","author":"Siobh\u00e1n O'Grady","published_date":"2024-04-15 18:07:22","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/15/ukraine-israel-contrast-defense-iran","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Ukraine has been attacked by Russian missiles and Iranian-made drones for more than two years but the U.S. and other countries do not intervene directly as they did to help Israel.","summary":"KYIV \u2014 When Iran unleashed hundreds of deadly missiles and drones at Israel this weekend, Israelis relied on a crucial tool that Ukraine still does not have: instant, direct assistance from the United States and other partners with military assets in the region.\nFor more than two years, Ukraine has faced Russian missile and drone attacks, often including Iranian-made Shahed drones like the ones Tehran used on Saturday. As a shield, Ukraine relies on a hodgepodge of air defense systems provided by Western partners, including three U.S.-designed Patriot batteries manned by Ukrainian troops. This month, the biggest power station serving Kyiv was destroyed. Civilian casualties are common.\nBy contrast, as the weapons launched from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen advanced toward their targets in Israel this weekend, U.S. forces prepared to react with fighter jets, a Patriot battery in Iraq and U.S. destroyer ships. Britain, France and Jordan also stepped up to assist. Together with Israel's Iron Dome air defense system, they knocked down 99 percent of the some 300 missiles and drones \u2014 averting major damage.\nAdvertisement\nThe discrepancy in response was not lost on observers in Ukraine.\nLast week alone, Russia launched nearly 130 Shahed drones, 80 missiles and 700 guided aerial bombs at Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address on Sunday. Ukraine relied on its own troops and its dwindling supplies of ammunition. But the immediate international response to Iran's attack on Israel proved that modern air defense can save lives and that such defense is possible, Zelensky said.\n'The whole world saw that Israel was not alone in this defense \u2014 the threat in the sky was also being eliminated by its allies,' Zelensky said. 'And when Ukraine says that its allies should not turn a blind eye to Russian missiles and drones, it means action is needed \u2014 a bold one.'\n'It is not rhetoric that protects the sky, it is not opinions that curb the production of missiles and drones for terror,' he added.\nAdvertisement\nBut with a $60 billion aid package stalled in Congress, Ukraine is urgently running out of ammunition and other supplies needed to keep up its own defense against airstrikes.\nLike Zelensky, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba referred to the direct help that partners provided to Israel. 'Even if you cannot act the way you act in Israel, give us what we need and we will do the rest of the job,' Kuleba said.\nFearful that direct conflict with Russia could escalate into nuclear war, the United States and other NATO countries repeatedly have dismissed the idea of direct troop involvement in Ukraine. When French President Emmanuel Macron recently said that sending soldiers should not be ruled out, other Western leaders quickly denounced the suggestion as dangerous.\nUkrainian officials say they need 26 Patriot systems, which each cost more than $1 billion, to cover the entire country.\nAdvertisement\nKuleba has recently ramped up his pressure on Ukraine's supporters to try to secure them. So far, only Germany has agreed, announcing on Saturday that it will send one Patriot to Ukraine.\nSome Ukrainians expressed hope that the largely thwarted attack on Israel would spur action on Capitol Hill, where the aid for Ukraine could be tied to further support for Israel.\nAnd Ukrainian officials were not the only ones drawing comparisons to the Middle East.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nPolish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, posting on X, formerly Twitter, commended Israel for repelling the attack. 'Now it would be useful to strengthen Israel's antimissile defense and equip Ukraine with similar systems,' Sikorski wrote. 'The easiest way is to unlock the aid package for Ukraine and Israel.'\nIn a new report on Monday, the Institute for the Study of War noted that Israel's successful defense against Iran's attack 'underscores the vulnerabilities that Ukrainian geography and the continued degradation of Ukraine's air defense umbrella pose for Ukrainian efforts to defend against regular Russian missile and drone strikes.'\nAdvertisement\nUkraine's geographic proximity to Russia also poses a challenge, with missiles and drones often traveling only short distances to reach their targets, giving Ukraine just minutes to react. By comparison, Israel and its partners had several hours to prepare for the weekend strikes, the ISW report said.\nIn Ukraine, others described the disadvantage more bluntly.\nCelebrated Ukrainian novelist Oksana Zabuzhko wrote on Facebook that Israel faced an opponent 'before whom the West does not fall on its back in a position of canine humility.' In Jordan, she noted, Israel also had a neighbor who assisted in stopping the strikes.\n'We don't have any of that,' she wrote. (In February 2022, Belarus, Ukraine's neighbor, allowed Russian troops to cross its territory.)\nUkrainian lawmaker Andrii Osadchuk wrote on Facebook that 'if suddenly the air force of NATO countries want to shoot down Iranian drones in the sky of Israel more effectively, they can train for free in Ukraine.'\nAdvertisement\nOthers said the multinational defense of Israel showed Ukraine to be isolated.\n'What conclusion should Ukraine draw? We can only count on ourselves,' Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksiy Goncharenko wrote on Telegram. Iran said the attack on Israel was in self-defense, he wrote. 'Have we heard this before?' he wrote, referencing Russia's excuses for invading Ukraine.\nRussia also responded to Iran's strikes, by calling for restraint.\n'The situation in the Middle East has become as heated as it may get and the conflict risks escalating to a regionwide confrontation,' Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, said a Security Council meeting on Monday. 'The spiral of confrontation and bloodshed must stop.'\nSpeaking of the Iranian strikes on Sunday morning, Nebenzya reminded the audience about the strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, which preceded Iran's attack on Israel. Nebenzya criticized certain members of the Security Council for their reluctance to clearly condemn the Israeli airstrike in the Syrian capital.\nAdvertisement\n'The parade of hypocrisy and double standards that is unfolding in the Security Council today is so gross,' he said, referring to the West's readiness to criticize Iran but not Israel.\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, said that the successful defense of Israel showed the need for a 'mandatory hard power response' to such attacks.\n''Answer or die!' \u2014 should be the unequivocal rule against those who seek to destroy global stability,' Podolyak posted on X.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Siobh\u00e1n O'Grady,Kostiantyn Khudov","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/URIGYI4UZH6VXFKTW2FDRAWT6U.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.8816743,"_id":"b5dd160881b5d735a6dbfb4911c4a606"},{"title":"Iran attack complicates Biden's push to change the course of Gaza war","author":"Yasmeen Abutaleb","published_date":"2024-04-15 23:03:27","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/15/biden-israel-iran-gaza","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"On Gaza, Biden is warning Israel to change its approach. On Iran, he is promising unconditional support.","summary":"Iran's recent attack on Israel has complicated President Biden's efforts to change Israel's course in Gaza and introduced a new, unpredictable element into his push to prevent the Israel-Gaza war from escalating into a broader conflict.\nJust days ago, Biden told Israel the U.S. would rethink its Gaza policy if Israel did not immediately address the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in the enclave, which is on the brink of famine due to an Israeli siege \u2014 a warning that many analysts took as a sign that the president would consider imposing conditions on military aid to the Jewish state.\nBut following Iran's attack on Sunday, Biden said America's commitment to Israel's defense is 'ironclad' in its conflict with Tehran, and he renewed his push for Congress to approve more military aid to Israel.\nAdvertisement\nWhile those two messages can coexist, they leave Biden telling Israel to change its course when it comes to one front of its conflict with its neighbors, while pledging unwavering support on another front.\n'The president publicly threatened to condition military assistance so we were about to get much tougher with the Israelis, then the attack by Iran comes along and everything gets swept to the side,' said Frank Lowenstein, a former State Department official who helped lead Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in 2014. 'Now we're back into lockstep on their big security issues.'\nLowenstein added: 'What's the impact on all the priorities we had before, including the cease-fire, humanitarian assistance and settler violence, going forward?'\nU.S. officials are urging Israel, in public and in private, to show restraint in response to the barrage of more than 300 drones and missiles that Iran sent toward Israeli territory overnight on Saturday. Officials have said 99 percent of the projectiles were intercepted and that the damage to Israel was minimal.\nAdvertisement\nBut Israeli officials said the unprecedented aerial attack could not go unanswered. They were deliberating Monday how best to respond without unduly angering their allies, whose support for Israel in the face of the Iranian assault is in sharp contrast to their criticism of the country's conduct of its scorched-earth military campaign in Gaza.\nOn Monday, the White House sought to cast Tehran's inability to cause significant damage or casualties as a resounding Israeli victory, seemingly in part to signal to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he does not need to respond. Washington has also emphasized that it will not participate in whatever military response Israel is planning.\nBiden noted to Netanyahu 'that this was an extraordinary success \u2026 and that that success alone \u2026 speaks volumes about Israel's standing in the region,' White House spokesman John Kirby said on Monday. 'The president urged the prime minister to think about what that success says all by itself to the rest of the region.'\nAdvertisement\nKirby argued that the Iranian attack strengthened Israel's strategic position and weakened Iran's, since it suggests Tehran has little ability to harm Israel. The White House appeared to be trying to reduce Israel's sense of vulnerability and isolation since Oct. 7, when Hamas militants rampaged easily through its defenses on the Gaza border and killed 1,200 people, many of them civilians, and took 253 hostage, according to Israeli authorities.\nIsrael's retaliatory assault in Gaza has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and prompted fierce international condemnation because of the high civilian death toll and Israel's refusal to allow a significant amount of aid to get into Gaza.\n'Much of the world is standing with Israel today,' Kirby said on Monday, adding, 'Unlike Iran, which is increasingly isolated on the world stage, Israel has friends.'\nAdvertisement\nThe Iranian action last weekend came in response to an Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria two weeks ago that killed two senior commanders. Iran said over the weekend that no additional military action was currently planned beyond the barrage of missiles and drones, but that any further Israeli action would be met with 'at least a tenfold response.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nSince the Oct. 7 attacks, Israel has sought to address an array of nearby threats with military force, arguing that it must reestablish deterrence in the region. Its adversaries include not only Hamas in Gaza, but also Hezbollah on Israel's northern border with Lebanon, where there has been an exchange of rocket fire for several months that has resulted in deaths in Lebanon. Tens of thousands of Israeli citizens have yet to return to their homes in the north because of the continued fighting.\nNow, American officials are increasingly concerned that Israel is looking to confront Iran directly, moving beyond the long-standing 'shadow war' between the two countries that has involved proxies and relatively limited strikes. Such a development would risk drawing in the United States, they fear, which is one reason they urged Israel so strongly on Monday not to escalate the conflict.\nAdvertisement\nDespite this, Israeli leaders are signaling that they believe they must respond to a barrage of weaponry fired directly at their soil.\n'One of the advantages of Israel not attacking is they can create a diplomatic effort to isolate Iran and it reduces public pressure on them on Gaza,' said Ron Halber, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington. 'The Israelis know this. The fact that they are willing to strain relations with the Biden administration over counterattacking ... shows the psychological impact of October 7th on Israel's psyche.'\nBiden officials' unease about the coming weeks is exacerbated by their concern over the mind-set of Netanyahu, who U.S. officials increasingly believe is prioritizing his own political survival above all else, potentially leading him to prolong the fighting on multiple fronts. Netanyahu is deeply unpopular among Israeli voters who blame him for the security failures that led to the Oct. 7 attacks and he faces multiple corruption charges, but it is harder for opponents to topple him in the midst of ongoing hostilities.\nAdvertisement\nMany U.S. officials worry that Netanyahu is far more focused on placating far-right members of his coalition \u2014 who favor resettling Gaza, arming Israeli settlers in the West Bank and fighting Iran directly \u2014 than on heeding Biden's pleas to de-escalate and provide more aid and protection to Palestinians. Netanyahu's repeated rejection of Biden's demands since Oct. 7 come despite the unwavering military and diplomatic support the United States has provided.\n'There's an awful lot of this Israeli government that wants a conflict with Iran, that sees this as their chance to perhaps get rid of the Iranian nuclear program or to get the United States involved,' said Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who worked on Middle East issues in the Clinton administration.\nNetanyahu 'is preoccupied with his political survival,' Riedel added. 'He knows if there is a cease-fire, an end to this conflict, the Israeli people are going to demand accountability and he's going to be out of office very quickly. Then he faces his corruption trials.'\nAdvertisement\nThe risk of escalation between Iran and Israel is also overshadowing the combustibility of the occupied West Bank. Israeli settlers in recent days went on a rampage against Palestinians there after the death of an Israeli teenager. A Palestinian was killed and dozens of others injured as settlers burned homes and cars.\nWhile the White House has sought to pressure Netanyahu to rein in Israeli settler violence \u2014 and has sanctioned a handful of settlers accused of violently attacking Palestinians \u2014 the conflict on the West Bank may be another issue that is harder for the administration to address as it works to head off further escalation in the broader Middle East.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Yasmeen Abutaleb","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JVTEH6ZWU2JGNO4KAUJTRDTXJA.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.8710566,"_id":"60b6429c1fea9b6a8fd4b2e7cba815bd"},{"title":"Israel weighs strike on Iran to \u2018send a message' while preserving alliance","author":"Steve Hendrix","published_date":"2024-04-15 15:01:44","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/15/israel-strike-iran-response-international-alliance","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The multilateral effort to repel Saturday's Iranian strike could be an opportunity for Israel to return to the international fold after frictions over its war in Gaza.","summary":"JERUSALEM \u2014 Israel's war cabinet deliberated Monday how to respond to Iran's unprecedented aerial assault without rankling international allies and squandering an opportunity to build a strategic international alliance against Tehran.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked the Israel Defense Forces to provide target options, according to an official familiar with high-level discussions, who said Israel is looking at options that would 'send a message' but not cause casualties.\nThose options include a potential strike on a facility in Tehran or a cyberattack, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks.\n'Everybody agrees that Israel must respond,' the official said. 'How to respond, when to respond, is the question.'\nThe United States, United Nations and Israel's European and regional allies have all called for restraint following the Iranian barrage of more than 300 drones and missiles overnight Saturday.\nThe five-hour onslaught \u2014 which was a response to a deadly Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria this month \u2014 caused limited damage after being repelled by an international alliance including the United States, France and Britain, with assistance from countries in the Middle East.\nAdvertisement\nThat presents Israel with a model for coordination against Iran alongside what analysts describe as an unprecedented strategic opportunity for Israel to return to the international fold \u2014 and repair its regional alliances \u2014 after frictions over its war against Hamas. But it is still an opportunity that they said Israel could waste if it miscalculates its response and puts a short-term show of strength ahead of longer-term goals.\n'This is an opportunity to create a new American-led regional security alignment against Iran if we can take advantage of it,' said Chuck Freilich, former deputy head of Israel's National Security Council and a senior fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. 'Who would ever have thought that we would be part of a coalition that included the U.K. and France and Jordan and maybe other Arab countries?'\nThe success of Israel's air defenses and the allied response in repelling the attack, which caused only minor damage in Israel and one serious injury, means that Israel can act from a position of confidence rather than one of panic, he added.\nAdvertisement\nEuropean leaders on Monday morning reiterated their concerns about the potential for the regional security situation to spiral. 'The right thing to do is not to escalate,' British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said in a BBC television interview. 'We are urging them as friends to think with head as well as heart, to be smart as well as tough, and to recognize that Iran suffered this defeat, because the attack was a failure.'\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron expressed similar sentiments: 'We are all worried about a possible escalation,' Macron told French radio.\nU.S. officials have also emphasized to Israel that they won't participate in any Israeli response amid fears that it could lead to a wider regional war. Israeli officials said they were mindful of the concerns.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'Our allies do not want us to go for an over-the-top response and we want to work with our allies, especially after the success we enjoyed with them,' the Israeli official said. 'We don't have to have cause casualties but it's important that we do respond, because it sends a message to all those who want to harm us.'\nAdvertisement\nA strike will do little to help Israel in its battle against Tehran's proxies in the region and concerns over its nuclear program, said Yair Golan, former deputy IDF chief of staff.\n'On different levels of intensity, Israel has been fighting Iran for years,' he said. 'It will not stop tomorrow or the next day. And it will not stop if Israel reacts right now.'\nIsrael should focus on its long-term goals by leveraging the energy behind an emerging new alliance against Iran, he said. 'We cannot be confused here. Iran has escalated the war,' he explained. 'But Israel needs to act smartly in order to strengthen the regional and global front against them.'\nThe Hamas-led assault on Oct. 7, which killed 1,200 in the communities around Gaza, shattered the sense of security for citizens of Israel. Among the Israeli public, the success in repelling Saturday's attack restored some national confidence and lessened a sense of international isolation.\nAdvertisement\n'I think we did avoid something terrible Saturday night,' said Yosef Levy, a student buying groceries in Jerusalem on Saturday. Around him, the walls of the shop were plastered with posters showing the faces of Israelis still held captive in Gaza, some faded, some recently replaced. 'It was like the world remembered that we are the ones under attack for a minute. I hope it changes something, I hope it ends the war. But I don't think anything can change until our hostages are back with their families.'\nThe Israeli public has been polarized on how Israel should proceed in its war, with some prioritizing the return of the hostages through a deal with Hamas, and others prioritizing a push to all-out victory.\n'We're being pulled in multiple directions,' said Leigh Sapir, a 39-year-old attorney from Tel Aviv, after she dropped her toddler off at preschool on Monday, the first day that schools were open since the Saturday night attack. 'On the one hand I encourage the government to respond and stand their ground, and on the other, I think the focus needs to be on a hostage deal at this point.'\nBut there has been little progress on a deal, with Hamas over the weekend rejecting the latest offer from Israel for at least a temporary pause in its offensive in exchange for the release of hostages.\nAdvertisement\nIt remains unclear how, if at all, the attack may affect operations in Gaza. Israel's military called up two brigades of reserves for 'operational missions in the Gaza Strip' on Sunday evening, stoking speculation that a Rafah assault could be sped up in the wake of the attack. Freilich said that the force did not appear of the 'magnitude' needed for any Rafah operation, adding that it was more likely intended to refresh troops along Gaza's dividing line than be the start of a buildup.\nGolan also said that he didn't see an Israeli intention to enter Rafah right now.

That prompted Iran's retaliatory barrage last weekend of more than 300 missiles and drones that the U.S., Israel and regional and international partners helped bat down without significant damage in Israel. And then came Friday's apparent Israeli strike.\nAdvertisement\nAs all sides took stock, regional security experts predicted that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right government and the country's allies would emerge encouraged by the Israeli military's superior performance. In response to international appeals, however, both Israel and Iran had appeared to be holding back their full military force throughout the more than two weeks of hostilities, aiming to send messages rather than escalate to a full-scale war.\nCrucially, experts also cautioned that Iran had not brought into the main battle its greatest military advantage over Israel \u2014 Hezbollah and other Iran-allied armed groups in the region. Hezbollah in particular is capable of straining Israel's ability to defend itself, especially in any multifront conflict.\nOverall, 'the big-picture lesson to take away is that unless Iran does absolutely everything at its disposal all at once, it is just the David, and not the Goliath, in this equation,' said Charles Lister, a senior fellow and longtime regional researcher at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.\nAdvertisement\nAside from those Iranian proxy forces, 'the Israelis have every single advantage on every single military level,' Lister said.\nIn Friday's attack, Iranian state television said the country's air defense batteries fired in several provinces following reports of drones. Iranian army commander Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi said crews targeted several flying objects.\nLister said it appeared to have been a single mission by a small number of Israeli aircraft. After crossing Syrian airspace, it appears they fired only two or three Blue Sparrow air-to-surface missiles into Iran, most likely from a standoff position in the airspace of Iran's neighbor Iraq, he said.\nIran said its air defenses fired at a major air base near Isfahan. Isfahan also is home to sites associated with Iran's nuclear program, including its underground Natanz enrichment site, which has been repeatedly targeted by suspected Israeli sabotage attacks.\nAdvertisement\nIsrael has not taken responsibility for either the April 1 or Friday strikes.\nThe Jewish Institute for National Security of America, a Washington-based center that promotes Israeli-U.S. security ties, quickly pointed out that Friday's small strike underscored that Israel could do much more damage 'should it decide to launch a larger strike against Iran's nuclear facilities.'\nIran's barrage last weekend, by contrast, appears to have used up most of its 150 long-range ballistic missiles capable of reaching Israel, more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) away, said retired Gen. Frank McKenzie, former commander of the U.S. military's Central Command.\nEspecially given the distance involved and how easy it is for the U.S. and others to track missile deployments by overhead space sensors and regional radar, 'it is hard for Iran to generate a bolt from the blue against Israel,' McKenzie said.\nAdvertisement\nIsraelis, for their part, have 'shown that Israel can now hit Iran from its soil with missiles, maybe even drones,' said Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran program at the Middle East Institute.\nIran's performance Friday, meanwhile, may have raised doubts about its ability to defend against such an attack, Vatanka said. Iran is about 80 times the size of Israel and thus has much more territory to defend, he noted.\nPlus, Israel demonstrated that it can rally support from powerful regional and international countries, both Arab and Western, to defend against Iran.\nThe U.S. led in helping Israel knock down Iran's missile and drone attack on April 13. Jordan and Gulf countries are believed to have lent varying degrees of assistance, including in sharing information about incoming strikes.\nThe two weeks of hostilities also provided the biggest showcase yet of the growing ability of Israel to work with Arab nations, its previous enemies, under the framework of U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East.\nAdvertisement\nThe U.S. under the Trump administration moved responsibility for its military coordination with Israel into Central Command, which already hosted U.S. military coordination with Arab countries. The Biden administration has worked to deepen the relationship.\nBut while the exchange of Israeli-Iran strikes revealed more about Iran's military abilities, Lebanon-based Hezbollah and other Iranian-allied armed groups in Iraq and Syria largely appeared to stay on the sidelines.\nHezbollah is one of the most powerful militaries in the region, with tens of thousands of experienced fighters and a massive weapons arsenal.\nAfter an intense war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 that killed more than a thousand Lebanese civilians and dozens of Israeli civilians, both sides have held back from escalating to another full-scale conflict. But Israeli and Hezbollah militaries still routinely fire across each other's borders during the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\nAdvertisement\nHezbollah 'is Iran's only remaining potential advantage in this whole broader equation,' Lister said.\nSix months of fighting in Gaza have 'completely stretched' Israel's military, he said. 'If Hezbollah went all out and launched the vast majority of its rocket and missile arsenal at Israel, all at once, the Israelis would seriously struggle to deal with that.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ellen Knickmeyer","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DYZGPWH62AI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.8381734,"_id":"1b8dc4ff9b5a28ab59801044b92ed928"},{"title":"MAGA using Israel against Ukraine is hurting both countries","author":"Josh Rogin","published_date":"2024-04-16 22:51:22","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/16/maga-israel-ukraine-aid","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Far-right GOP lawmakers are trying to thwart the House speaker's compromise on aid to the two countries.","summary":"As hundreds of Iranian missiles and drones rained down on Israel this weekend, some far-right lawmakers saw an opportunity to use the attack to accomplish a separate goal: further delay U.S. aid to Ukraine \u2014 hurting both Israel and Ukraine in the process.\nOn Monday evening, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) finally announced his plan to address the need for emergency supplemental funding for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific.

Splitting the bills into separate votes allows anti-Ukraine Republicans to vote against that funding and progressive Democrats to vote against the Israel funding \u2014 but both measures could still pass. That compromise, however, didn't satisfy far-right members of Johnson's caucus, who moved closer Tuesday to forcing a vote to remove him as speaker. He likely needs Democratic support to pass the legislation and to save his job.\nAdvertisement\nGOP congressional sources tell me that before Iran's attack on Israel, Johnson was leaning toward the entire aid package with one vote, which would be much simpler. But beginning on Saturday afternoon, Johnson and his staff started receiving calls and texts from far-right anti-Ukraine lawmakers urging him to pass the Israel aid alone and delay the Ukraine aid yet again.\nFollow this author Josh Rogin 's opinions\nFollow this author\nJosh Rogin\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\n'It had nothing to do with protecting Israel, these guys were just happy to have a new excuse to oppose Ukraine aid and they jumped on it,' a senior GOP congressional aide told me.\nOn Sunday, these MAGA lawmakers went public with their push to shelve Ukraine aid. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who opposes any aid to Ukraine, posted on X, 'It's antisemitic to make Israeli aid contingent on funding Ukrainian Nazis.' Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) posted on X, 'If we send billions to Ukraine because of this Iranian attack, the terrorists win.'\nAdvertisement\nThere's a lot wrong with these statements. Passing the bills together doesn't amount to 'conditioning' the Israel aid \u2014 and it wouldn't be 'antisemitic' if it did. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish, not a Nazi. And Gaetz seems not to realize that the Iranians are also helping Russia attack Ukraine.\n'The MAGA faction of Congress fundamentally misunderstands or does not want to understand the national security implications of how these conflicts are connected,' Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.) told me. 'They need to wake up and look at the full picture.'\nThis is not the first time far-right GOP lawmakers have tried to use Israel as an excuse to delay passing aid to Ukraine. In November, Johnson himself pushed through an Israel-only funding bill that ignored Ukraine, but the Senate didn't take it up. He tried again in February to pass aid for Israel only, but failed. Interestingly, Greene voted no on the aid for Israel both times. That didn't stop her from invoking Israel's security to argue for a delay in Ukraine aid again this week.\nAdvertisement\nGreene and Gaetz are now also out of step with former president Donald Trump, who came out in favor of more Ukraine aid (although he wants it issued as loans) during Johnson's visit to Mar-a-Lago last week. Trump wants Congress to pass Ukraine aid because he sees it as in his personal interest, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told me. If Trump returns to office and tries to push a Russia-Ukraine peace deal, he needs Ukraine to be in a strong position militarily.\n'President Trump understands if Ukraine makes a deal from a position of weakness, that will just invite another invasion and entice China,' Graham said.\nJohnson's current effort shows that he is still trying to placate his far-right base but is also genuinely trying to get Israel and Ukraine funding done. Democrats are right to support this effort, and the Senate should pass Johnson's aid package quickly, if it gets that far. His plan includes additional items the White House should be willing to accept, including a bill that would seek to compel TikTok to separate from its Chinese parent ByteDance and a bill to authorize the administration to seize frozen Russian assets. If it fails, the MAGA drive to fully separate Israel aid and kill Ukraine aid will resurface and pick up more steam.\nAdvertisement","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"science","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Josh Rogin","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ECPLNTG4Q3PYQRM35FIIFVENAM.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.82947,"_id":"9753aaee78455a761689d7d76874b0ab"},{"title":"Iran's supreme leader tacitly acknowledges Tehran hit little in its massive attack on Israel","author":"Jon Gambrell","published_date":"2024-04-21 12:57:22","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/21/iran-israel-khamenei-mideast/b19b6e0c-ffde-11ee-8eac-39c6dcb59eb5_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Iran's supreme leader has dismissed any discussion of whether Tehran's unprecedented drone-and-missile attack on Israel hit anything there","summary":"JERUSALEM \u2014 Iran's supreme leader on Sunday dismissed any discussion of whether Tehran's unprecedented drone-and-missile attack on Israel hit anything there, a tacit acknowledgment that despite launching a massive assault, few projectiles actually made through to their targets.\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei's comments before senior military leaders didn't not touch on the apparent Israeli retaliatory strike Friday on the central city of Isfahan, even though air defenses opened fire and Iran grounded commercial flights across much of the country.\nAnalysts believe both Iran and Israel, regional archrivals locked in a shadow war for years, are trying to dial back tensions following a series of escalatory attacks between them as Israel's war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip rages on and inflames the wider region.\nAdvertisement\nKhamenei, 85, made the comments in a meeting attended by the top ranks of Iran's regular military, police and paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, a powerful force within its Shiite theocracy.\n'Debates by the other party about how many missiles were fired, how many of them hit the target and how many didn't, these are of secondary importance,' Khamenei said in remarks aired by state television.\n'The main issue is the emergence of the Iranian nation and Iranian military's will in an important international arena.

For Israel, the Iranian response demands its own reprisal. Gen.

Lawmakers have denounced Iran's actions, which came in response to a suspected Israeli strike weeks earlier on an Iranian consular building in Syria that killed two Iranian generals.\n'The world is on fire, and history will judge us for our action,' said Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, during a news conference Tuesday.\nThe swift, bipartisan condemnation of Iran has put on sharp display the durability of American support for Israel, even amid growing partisan division over how the country is handling its more than six-month war with Hamas.\nAdvertisement\nThe House passed nearly a dozen bills by Wednesday that would, among other things, issue a slate of new sanctions and other financial restrictions against Iran and its leaders. Other legislation looks to prevent current Iranian officials sanctioned from evading those penalties and urge the European Union to 'expeditiously' designate Iran's Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization as the U.S. has already done.\nOn the other side of the Capitol, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday advanced five bills, including ones that targeted Iran for its human rights record and would require sanctions on ports and refineries that receive and process Iranian oil.\n'Iran's direct attack on Israel this week underscores the need to further cut off the Iranian regime's key revenue streams,' Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire said in a statement. 'I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this bill \u2014 which has already passed the House \u2014 so that we can send it to President Biden's desk immediately.'\nAdvertisement\nA number of the bills had passed the House weeks before Hamas' deadly attack on Israel in October but have been stalled in the Senate committee. An Israeli offensive in Gaza has since caused widespread devastation and killed over 33,000 people, according to local health officials. Israel's conduct of the war has revealed the depth of unease among U.S. lawmakers as concerns over the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza have caused even some of President Joe Biden's closest allies to threaten conditioning future aid to Israel.\nCongressional Democrats have been reluctant to challenge Biden's handling of the ongoing conflict and related regional tensions that have taken shape, mindful that criticism could further weaken Biden in his reelection campaign against former President Donald Trump.\nBut the attack on Saturday has proven to consolidate public support for the Biden administration's quick response as it ordered U.S. forces to help Israel down 'nearly all' the 300 drones and missiles that were headed its way.\nAdvertisement\nIt also comes as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., released legislation Wednesday that would provide $95 billion in aid collectively to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan. The aid package had been held up for months over Republican opposition to continuing wartime funding for Ukraine as it battles Russia. Iran's attack on Israel added urgency to Johnson's plans to bring the issue to the floor for a vote.\nWhile the measures targeting Iran have received overwhelming support \u2014 with the series of House bills mostly passing with at least 300 votes \u2014 there has been a quiet but growing dissent among progressive Democratic lawmakers in both chambers, who warn that legislative efforts could risk further escalation in the Middle East.\n'Following last weekend's unprecedented response by Iran to Israel's attack on its consulate, the Republican Majority is explicitly leveraging a series of bills to further escalate tensions in the Middle East,' Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said in a statement Tuesday. 'This is a blatant attempt to distract from their own incompetence.'\nAdvertisement\nThe strike on Saturday marked the first time Iran has launched a direct military assault on Israel despite decades of enmity dating back to the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution.

An Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military matters, said the strike was intended mostly to signal to Iran that Israel has the ability to hit targets inside the country.\nAdvertisement\nThe White House declined to comment on the strike Friday. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he would not discuss whether Washington was warned about the strike, but he sought to distance the U.S. from Israel's action, saying that 'the United States has not been involved in any offensive operations.'\nThe developments came as a welcome change after six months in which it often seemed to White House officials that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took every opportunity to publicly rebuff any demand Biden made. Netanyahu's defiance came despite unwavering U.S. military and diplomatic support for Israel's military campaign in Gaza, which has isolated the country on the world stage.\nOn Sunday, the day after Iran's retaliatory barrage of missiles and drones, White House officials were deeply worried about how Netanyahu might respond, according to a person familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. But as the week unfolded and Biden officials had a better sense of the planned Israeli response, they became increasingly optimistic that the U.S. had been able to mitigate the escalatory risks, a senior official said.\nAdvertisement\nStill, deep disagreements remain between the U.S. and Israel that have yet to be resolved. Most immediately, American and Israeli officials are preparing to hold another high-level meeting about an impending Israeli operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where some 1.5 million Palestinians are sheltering after fleeing there under Israeli orders.\nU.S. officials have made it clear that they oppose a major military operation in Rafah without a 'credible' plan to protect the Palestinian civilians there \u2014 a task that some officials and experts have said is all but impossible. Israeli officials have said they still plan to go into the city to dismantle the remaining Hamas battalions there.\nEven as Biden and his top aides say U.S. support for Israel is 'ironclad' in the face of the Iranian threat, they remain firmly opposed to a Rafah operation that does not protect civilians, two people familiar with the discussions said.\nAdvertisement\nAnd even if a wider conflict does not immediately erupt, Middle East experts and analysts cautioned that the decades-long shadow war between Iran and Israel has now crossed an unprecedented threshold. The two countries have shown that they are willing to strike inside each other's territories, however carefully \u2014 a move both long avoided for fear of sparking a war that could become catastrophic.\n'We have not seen the conventional regional war that everyone fears, but at a moment's notice, anything could go wrong,' said Brian Katulis, vice president of policy at the Middle East Institute. 'It's not a sustainable situation when you look at the whole theater.'\nWhile Israel and Iran have been in a 'shadow conflict' for decades, Katulis said, their hostility has now become 'an open, low-grade direct military confrontation, and with that comes all sorts of risks.'\nAdvertisement\nBiden and his top aides expended significant energy this week to show Netanyahu that Iran would suffer nonmilitary consequences for its attack so Israel did not need to strike back, according to a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\nThose efforts included organizing the Group of 7 nations to issue a statement condemning Iran, as well as the U.S. imposing sanctions on Tehran. U.S. officials hoped that would persuade Israel that Iran was even more diplomatically isolated.\nBiden and his aides also tried to reassure Israelis that their ability \u2014 along with that of the United States and other partners \u2014 to strike down the vast majority of Iran's drones and missiles had reestablished deterrence, signaling to its neighbors that an attack on Israel would probably be fruitless. Several U.S. officials noted that Israeli leaders have feared looking weak since Oct. 7, when Hamas militants rampaged through the Israel-Gaza border fence and killed 1,200 people, many of them civilians, and took about 250 others hostage.\nAdvertisement\nIsrael responded with a punishing military campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, the majority of whom are women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel's siege of the enclave has created a humanitarian catastrophe as the health system has collapsed and more than 2 million Palestinians face famine.\nBut the war has spread beyond Gaza, and U.S. officials have long feared that it would escalate into a major regional conflagration that would further destabilize the Middle East. Israel is also fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon on its northern border, where rocket fire has killed and injured people on both sides of the border. Tens of thousands of Israelis have yet to return to their homes in the north because of the fighting.\nThe escalation with Iran has especially raised fears of how Hezbollah might react if tensions continue to rise. Hezbollah is Tehran's primary proxy group in the region and it has military capabilities far beyond those of Hamas.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Yasmeen Abutaleb","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E6LFWSYFXJHBEILKE4VKQGUWZA_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.6926494,"_id":"48c9f1ed3a135bf8e895abe6207c4bf1"},{"title":"House Speaker Mike Johnson leaves uncertain his plan to advance aid for Israel and Ukraine","author":"Stephen Groves","published_date":"2024-04-15 20:54:56","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/15/israel-ukraine-house-speaker/6a7ef2e6-fb6a-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"House Speaker Mike Johnson is leaving uncertain his plan for advancing wartime aid for Ukraine","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson left uncertain his plan for advancing aid for Israel and Ukraine on Monday, keeping the future of the funding in doubt as lawmakers returned to Washington for a crucial week of foreign policy work.\nIran's missile and drone strike against Israel over the weekend put renewed pressure on House Republicans to act on a national security package that would send military support to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. But after mulling for two months how to advance such a package through the political divides in the House, Johnson has revealed little of his strategy, including whether he will try to push the funding for Israel separately or keep it packaged with the aid for the other U.S. allies.\nAs the House has struggled to act, conflicts around the globe have escalated. Israel's military chief said Monday that Israel will respond to Iran's weekend missile strike. And Ukraine's military head over the weekend warned that the battlefield situation in the country's east has 'significantly worsened in recent days,' as warming weather has allowed Russian forces to launch a fresh offensive.\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden, hosting Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala at the White House, called on the House to take up the funding package immediately. 'They have to do it now,' he said.\nSenior Republicans were also growing impatient after Johnson had offered them assurances that he would bring Ukraine aid to the floor. Many have expected him to make that move before the House takes a recess next week. But with no plan set, time was running short for Johnson, who is learning the job of speaker as he goes.\nThe speaker planned to huddle with his fellow House Republicans on Monday evening. But the meeting will be filled with lawmakers strongly opposed on Ukraine: Republican defense hawks, including the top lawmakers on national security committees, who want Johnson to finally take up the national security supplemental package as a bundle, are pitted against populist conservatives who are fiercely opposed to continued support for Kyiv's fight at all.\nAdvertisement\nAhead of the meeting on Monday, Johnson revealed little on his decision after saying over the weekend that he would bring Israel aid to the floor this week. Johnson has expressed support for aiding Ukraine, but ignored questions from reporters on Monday about whether he would bundle funding for the two nations together. The House was also preparing this week to take up a series of bills aimed at sanctioning Iran.\n'The House must rush to Israel's aid as quickly as humanly possible, and the only way to do that is passing the Senate's supplemental ASAP,' said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\nMeanwhile, the White House would 'oppose' a standalone bill that only addresses aid for Israel, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Monday. Democratic leaders are pressuring Johnson to take up a Senate-passed bill that would provide a total of $95 billion for the U.S. allies, as well as humanitarian support for civilians in Gaza and Ukraine.\nAdvertisement\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries pledged in a letter to lawmakers to do 'everything in our legislative power to confront aggression' around the globe, and he cast the situation as similar to the lead-up to World War II.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'The gravely serious events of this past weekend in the Middle East and Eastern Europe underscore the need for Congress to act immediately,' Jeffries said. 'We must take up the bipartisan and comprehensive national security bill passed by the Senate forthwith. This is a Churchill or Chamberlain moment.'\nDuring a private meeting last week, two senior Democrats, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker emerita, and Rep. Steny Hoyer, the former No. 2 leader, encouraged their Democratic colleagues to sign on to a discharge petition that could force the House to vote on the Senate aid package.\nAdvertisement\nPelosi and Hoyer told the Democratic lawmakers that even if they oppose the bill, they could still sign the discharge petition to at least push the package to the floor -- and then vote against it later. The leaders' message was confirmed by two people familiar with the private meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it.\nSo far, 195 lawmakers have signed on to the discharge petition, about a dozen shy of the majority needed to force action on the floor. Many of the progressive Democrats holding out from signing the petition are against U.S. aid to Israel due to the Netanyahu government's assault on Gaza that has killed thousands of civilians.\nOn the right, the House Freedom Caucus said Monday that it opposed 'using the emergency situation in Israel as a bogus justification to ram through Ukraine aid with no offset and no security for our own wide-open borders.'\nAdvertisement\nThe political divides on foreign aid have so far flummoxed Johnson, who rose from the lower ranks of House leadership to become speaker after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was abruptly ousted late last year.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Stephen Groves,Lisa Mascaro","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NF6AXLX3NII65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.6684494,"_id":"5940991f15b41dc63a986f33d3f55ad6"},{"title":"British envoy says Israel is 'making a decision to act' as Iran vows to respond to any incursion","author":"Julia Frankel","published_date":"2024-04-17 09:37:12","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/17/israel-iran-tensions-hamas-war-news/116e17b0-fc9e-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"British Foreign Secretary David Cameron says Israel 'is making a decision to act' in response to Iran's missile and drone attack over the weekend","summary":"JERUSALEM \u2014 British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Wednesday that Israel 'is making a decision to act' in response to Iran's missile and drone attack over the weekend, while Iran warned that even the 'tiniest' invasion of its territory would bring a 'massive and harsh' response.\nIsrael has vowed to respond to Iran's unprecedented attack without saying when or how, leaving the region bracing for further escalation after months of unrest linked to the ongoing war in Gaza. Israel's closest allies, including the United States and the United Kingdom \u2014 which helped it repel the Iranian attack \u2014 are trying to limit any further escalation.\nIran's President Ebrahim Raisi meanwhile warned Israel against any retaliation as he addressed an annual army parade, which had been relocated to a barracks from its usual route and was not carried live on state TV \u2014 possibly because of fears that it could be targeted.\nAdvertisement\nIn remarks carried by Iran's official IRNA news agency, Raisi said Saturday's attack was a limited one, and that if Iran had wanted to carry out a bigger attack, 'nothing would remain from the Zionist regime.'\nBoth Cameron and Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock were in Israel on separate visits to meet with top officials on Wednesday. The two European countries, which are among Israel's closest allies, have urged restraint.\nCameron said 'it's clear the Israelis are making a decision to act' against Iran, but he hopes it will do so 'in a way that is smart as well as tough and also does as little as possible to escalate this conflict.' He spoke after meeting with Israel's largely ceremonial President Isaac Herzog.\nCameron said the main aim of his visit was to refocus attention on the ongoing war in Gaza and the need for a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas.\nAdvertisement\nBaerbock meanwhile called on all sides to prevent the conflict from spreading.\n'I will assure our Israeli partners of Germany's full solidarity,' she said Tuesday. 'And we will discuss how a further escalation with more and more violence can be prevented. Because what matters now is to put a stop to Iran without encouraging further escalation.'\nBoth ministers said they would push for further international sanctions on Iran.\nIran launched hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel over the weekend in response to an apparent Israeli strike on Iran's embassy compound in Syria on April 1 that killed 12 people, including two Iranian generals.\nIsrael, with help from the United States, the United Kingdom, neighboring Jordan and other nations, says it successfully intercepted nearly all the missiles and drones. A seven-year-old girl was wounded in the attack, which did not cause any deaths or major damage.\nAdvertisement\nIsrael and Iran have waged a shadow war for decades, but the strike over the weekend was the first direct Iranian military attack on Israel.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nRegional tensions have soared since the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel launched by Hamas and Islamic Jihad, Palestinian armed groups supported by Iran. The attack killed some 1,200 Israelis, and the militants took around 250 hostages. Israel responded with one of the deadliest and most destructive military onslaughts in recent history, killing nearly 34,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials.\nIsrael has withdrawn much of its forces from Gaza after major offensives that left its two biggest cities \u2014 Gaza City and Khan Younis, in ruins. But Israeli officials say the war is not over and that they plan to send ground forces into the southernmost Gaza city of Rafah, where more than half the territory's population of 2.3 million people have sought refuge from fighting elsewhere.\nAdvertisement\nHamas is still holding around 130 hostages, a quarter of whom are believed to be dead, and international efforts to broker a cease-fire and hostage release have made little progress.\nLebanon's Hezbollah militant group, another close Iran ally, has traded fire with Israel along the border on a near-daily basis since the war began, in a low-intensity conflict that risks igniting all-out war. Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria have also launched attacks, and the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have targeted international shipping in the Red Sea, portraying it as a blockade of Israel.\nPresident Joe Biden's administration on Tuesday announced new sanctions on Iran and has worked to coordinate a global rebuke of the attack while urging all sides to de-escalate. U.S. officials said earlier this week that Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Washington would not participate in any offensive action against Iran.\nAdvertisement\nIsrael appears unlikely to attack Iran directly without U.S. support, but it could resort to more covert methods such as targeting other senior Iranian commanders or Iran-backed groups in other countries, or launching a cyber attack.\nIt's unclear how Iran might respond given the heightened tensions.

Israel responded with an offensive in Gaza that has caused widespread devastation and killed over 33,800 people, according to local health officials.\nWorld leaders have urged Israel not to retaliate after Iran launched a revenge mission that pushed the Middle East closer to a regionwide war.

That may be why Iranian officials up to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have been trying to dismiss discussing what the attack actually did on Iranian soil.\nAnalysts believe both Iran and Israel, regional archrivals locked in a shadow war for years, now are trying to dial back tensions following a series of escalatory attacks between them as the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip still rages and inflames the wider region. But a strike on the most advanced air defense system Iran possesses and uses to protect its nuclear sites sends a message, experts say.\nAdvertisement\n'This strike shows Israel has the ability to penetrate Iran's air defense systems,' said Nicole Grajewski, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment's nuclear policy program who wrote a forthcoming book on Russia and Iran. 'The precision of it was quite remarkable.'\nThe satellite images by Planet Labs PBC taken Monday morning near Isfahan's dual-use airport and air base, some 320 kilometers (200 miles) south of Tehran, showed an area nearby that served as a deployment point for the air defense system. Burn marks sit around what analysts including Chris Biggers, a consultant former government imagery analyst, previously had identified as a 'flap-lid' radar system used for the S-300.\nLess-detailed satellite images taken after Friday showed similar burn marks around the area, though it wasn't clear what was at the site. Biggers said other components of the missile system appeared to have been removed from the site before the attack \u2014 even though they provide defensive cover for Iran's underground Natanz nuclear enrichment facility.\nAdvertisement\n'That's a powerful statement, given the system, the location, and how they use it,' Biggers wrote.\nOn Friday, air defenses opened fire and Iran grounded commercial flights across much of the country. Officials in the aftermath sought to downplay the attack, trying to describe it as just a series of small drones flying through the sky.\n'What happened ... was not a strike,' Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian claimed in an interview with NBC News. 'They were more like toys that our children play with \u2013 not drones.'\nIn the attack's aftermath, however, Iraqis found what appeared to be remnants of surface-to-air missiles south of Baghdad. That, coupled with a suspected Israeli strike on a radar station in Syria the same day, suggests Israeli fighter jets flew over Syria into Iraq, then fired so-called 'standoff missiles' into Iran for the Isfahan attack. Small, shorter-range drones may have been launched as well \u2014 Israel has been able to launch sabotage attacks and other missions inside of Iran.\nAdvertisement\nStill, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani repeated Tehran's denial Monday.\n'Relevant authorities have announced that this harassment attack has caused no damage whatsoever and Iran's defensive system have carried out their duties,' Kanaani told journalists at a briefing. 'Therefore in our opinion this issue is not worthy of addressing.'\nThe S-300 and their years-delayed delivery to Iran show the challenge Tehran faces in getting any foreign-made advance weapon systems into the country. Russia and Iran initially struck a $800 million deal in 2007, but Moscow suspended their delivery three years later because of strong objections from the United States and Israel.\nAfter Iran reached its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, Russia unfroze the deal and is believed to have given Iran four sets of an export variant of the S-300.\nAdvertisement\nThe relationship between Iran and Russia has deepened in recent years. Moscow relies heavily on Iran's bomb-carrying Shahed drones to target sites across Ukraine as part of its war on the country. Those same drones featured in the Islamic Republic's attack on Israel.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nTehran meanwhile has made repeated comments over recent years about trying to obtain Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets from Russia to improve its decades-old fighter fleet. In September, a Russian-made YAK-130 combat trainer aircraft entered service in Iran. That model can be used to train pilots for the Su-35.\nRussia now has the S-400, but the S-300 which has a range of up to 200 kilometers (125 miles) and the capability to track down and strike multiple targets simultaneously, remains one of the most-potent air defense weapons in the world. The batteries can be used to shoot down missiles as well as aircraft.\nIran likely needs Russian assistance to repair the damaged radar \u2014 and will seek newer weapons as well as time goes on, Grajewski said.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jon Gambrell","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4DCNGVAA2II67DVMHHDNZNM6WU.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.6525674,"_id":"114310727379fe3e51ba7f18976814b1"},{"title":"Israeli soccer facing Palestinian calls for action by FIFA at annual congress","author":"Graham Dunbar","published_date":"2024-04-18 10:04:59","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/soccer/2024/04/18/fifa-congress-israel-palestinians/1d3c532c-fd6b-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Calls for action against Israel in international soccer because of the conflict with Hamas will be stepped up by Palestinian officials at the annual FIFA congress next month","summary":"GENEVA \u2014 Calls for action against Israel in international soccer because of the conflict with Hamas will be stepped up by Palestinian officials at the annual FIFA congress next month.\nThe Palestine Football Association proposal to 211 member federations in Thailand calls for 'appropriate sanctions, with immediate effect, against Israeli teams,' according to FIFA documents released late Wednesday, one month before the May 17 meeting.\nThe motion notes 'international law violations committed by the Israeli occupation in Palestine, particularly in Gaza' and cites FIFA statutory commitments on human rights and against discrimination.\n'All the football infrastructure in Gaza has been either destroyed, or seriously damaged, including the historic stadium of Al-Yarmuk,' the Palestine FA wrote, claiming support for the congress motion from the federations of Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Syria and Yemen.\nAdvertisement\nThe latest call to punish Israel soccer will not be supported by FIFA and is unlikely to make progress because Israel can expect global backing including from the 55-member European soccer body UEFA it joined 30 years ago.

It consists of just five men \u2014 most of whom are bitter rivals.","summary":"JERUSALEM \u2014 As Israel mulled a response to Iran's massive drone and missile attack, the decision to strike with a carefully calibrated limited strike early Friday was made by just five men.\nThey are the sole members of Israel fractious 'war cabinet,' a pop-up body of rival politicians charged with steering the country through its worst security crisis in half a century.\nThe tiny group, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, wields supreme authority over the most consequential war matters: military operations in Gaza, hostage talks with Hamas and whether to open a second front against Hezbollah in Lebanon.\nNow, the quintet that meets without cellphones in 'the Pit,' an ultra-secure section of the military's headquarters in Tel Aviv, has apparently decided that a limited response is the best next step in the conflict with Iran, a burgeoning nuclear power committed to Israel's destruction. The two countries have fought a shadow war for years.\nAdvertisement\n'The five people in that room were faced with a decision that could be one of the three or four most crucial decisions since Israel's founding in 1948,' said Nadav Shtrauchler, an Israeli political analyst.\nAnd they did it with no love lost for each other. It is, by all accounts, a group riven by political animosities, rancor that was beginning to fracture the body before Iran's attack last weekend served to paper the divisions over, at least for now.\nWhen the latest crisis eases, tensions are likely to flare again, numerous Israeli observers said.\n'They all hate each other, that's for sure,' said an Israeli official familiar with the cabinet's internal dynamics.\nThe core of the war cabinet, hastily formed in the chaos following Hamas's Oct. 7 attacks, includes Netanyahu and two other leaders he sees as future political threats.\nAdvertisement\nThe first is opposition leader Benny Gantz, a former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces who ran against Netanyahu in five recent elections and has now soared past the prime minister in polling.\nThe second is Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, a rival from within Netanyahu's own Likud party, who last year publicly warned that the government's attempts to remake the judiciary were splitting the military and harming its readiness.\nNetanyahu fired Gallant in a dramatic, televised address, but was forced to back down in the face of massive street protests.\n'In politics, everything is personal,' said Shtrauchler, who ran Netanyahu's successful electoral campaign in 2019.\n'These are not his best buddies; these are his rivals,' he said. 'So far, that hasn't kept them from coming to good decisions.'\nThe group of three is rounded out by two nonvoting 'observers,' including Ron Dermer, Israel's former ambassador in Washington and one of Netanyahu's closest advisers, and Gadi Eisenkot, another former IDF chief of staff who hails from Gantz's center-right National Unity Party.\nAdvertisement\nThe unlikely cohort formed five days after Hamas fighters launched a surprise attack inside Israel, killing around 1,200 people and dragging 253 more back to Gaza as hostages. In less polarized times, the government's existing security cabinet \u2014 an institution recognized by Israeli law \u2014 would have managed the war in Gaza that Israel launched within hours.\n\u2014 would have managed the war in Gaza that Israel launched within hours.\nBut Hamas struck when the country's trust in government and sense of unity had already been shattered by the stormy judicial reform controversy. Anger flared at Netanyahu, Israel's longest serving leader, for presiding over the stunning security failures of Oct. 7.\nSenior leaders scrambled to regain public confidence, forging a power-sharing agreement with Eisenkot and Gantz. What emerged was a war cabinet with powers to direct military operations. The new authority sidelined the security cabinet, which had a reputation as an unwieldy, leak-prone committee of more than a dozen members, including the most extreme ministers of Netanyahu's far-right coalition.\nAdvertisement\nMilitary officials privately say they don't like taking classified information before the security cabinet because it often appears in the media within hours. For the war cabinet, the generals and military analysts who file in to brief its members are required to surrender their phones.\n'We don't see many leaks from the war cabinet,' the Israeli official said. 'When we do, it is usually intentional.'\nBut from the beginning, Israeli media tracked the debates taking place in the Pit, or in the secure conference room at the prime minister's Jerusalem office, where the war cabinet also meets.\nThe reports suggest Gallant pushed unsuccessfully in the first weeks of the war to launch an offensive against Hezbollah, which was sending fighters to the Israeli border. Gantz and Eisenkot also frequently argued to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, as the war there destroyed infrastructure and took a devastating toll on Palestinian residents.\nAdvertisement\nNetanyahu often delays committing to any particular course of action, the reports said.\nBut the divisions became more apparent over time. Gantz, Eizenkot and Gallant failed to appear with Netanyahu at some post-cabinet meeting media briefings.\nIn February, Israeli media obtained a letter from Eisenkot to his fellow members, criticizing the body's inability to make strategic decisions. Eisenkot, whose son was killed fighting in Gaza last year, cited stalled efforts to negotiate the release of hostages and to plan for a civilian alternative to Hamas rule after the war, among other shortcomings.\nIn early March, Gantz flew to Washington for unsanctioned talks with administration officials, infuriating Netanyahu's allies who accused him of trying to 'drive a wedge' between Israelis. Earlier this month, Gantz, who has surpassed Netanyahu in the polls, called for Israel to hold elections in September.\nThe frictions were probably inevitable as the intensity of the fighting in Gaza began to ease, at least temporarily, and more political issues rose to the fore, according to Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute. Those include controversies over drafting more ultra-Orthodox Israelis and the role of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority in Gaza's future, he said.\nin Gaza's future, he said.\nAdvertisement\nThe war cabinet 'worked well in the beginning, but then general political issues began to degrade it,' Plesner said.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThen came more than 300 drones and missiles from the east.\nIran said it attacked Israel in retaliation for an Israeli strike on its embassy compound in the Syrian capital, Damascus, earlier this month. The Iranian operation, while unprecedented, caused little damage in Israel, but it rattled an already uneasy nation and persuaded Israeli leaders of the need for a response.\n'The discussions now around the attack from Iran are masking, for a period, that general trend of the war cabinet losing its original role,' Plesner said.\nAs the operation unfolded Sunday, media reports portrayed Gantz as the more hawkish member, pressing for an immediate counterattack. But following a late-night call during which President Biden urged Netanyahu to show restraint, the war cabinet agreed to delay any decision.\nAdvertisement\nAs Biden and other allies lobbied Israel not to take actions that could lead to a regional war, Netanyahu and the war cabinet went unusually silent. They had requested a range of target options from the military and debated actions that would deter Iran without sparking further escalations, the Israeli official said.\nAs the world waited, some critics have blasted the ad hoc nature of the war cabinet \u2014 which, unlike the security cabinet, is not endorsed by Israeli law \u2014 as the wrong forum for such a momentous decision.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Steve Hendrix","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WMN5GCH6KCP2QH6LJKIPX2FNKQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.608344,"_id":"feecac2a56b0ada2e7750d304d6d8d1e"},{"title":"After Iran's attack on Israel, now fears over escalation at Lebanese border","author":"Sarah Dadouch","published_date":"2024-04-18 17:40:57","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/18/hezbollah-israel-lebanon-iran-war","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Iran's unprecedented direct attack on Israel could upset the delicate balance on the northern border where Iranian-backed Hezbollah has spent the Gaza war skirmishing with Israeli forces.","summary":"BEIRUT \u2014 The Iranian strike on Israel over the weekend has refocused attention on the border with Lebanon where Iran's ally, Hezbollah, has long been fighting a muted war that could be the target of an Israeli retaliation.\nThe Israel Defense Forces and Hezbollah, both a military force and Lebanon's strongest political party, have been regularly skirmishing since Hamas's Oct. 7 blitz into Israel.

There are really only two possible scenarios: Either the Islamic republic's aim was not to inflict major damage on Israeli targets, or its aim was but it was incapable of doing so.\nEither way, what the drone and missile attacks should clarify is that Iran doesn't have the means to mount a significant conventional response to Israeli might. And Tehran is painfully aware of this.\nNo one can deny that the image of hundreds of projectiles launched into the air was an impressive and terrifying sight. The fact that apparently not a single one hit a target of any strategic value, however, is telling. Despite its stated intention of destroying Israel, this was the first military offensive Tehran ever launched against the Jewish state, and it was thwarted with apparent ease. Many reports indicate a high level of information-sharing by Iran itself ahead of the attack, giving the United States, Israel and other allies ample opportunity to prepare for the onslaught. This would suggest that the Iranians did not want to maximize damage to Israeli assets and provoke a larger conflict.\nAdvertisement\nThe clear message seems to be that the regime, its bluster notwithstanding, is weak. Iran's economy is in tatters, and the government has no credible remedies for people's woes. Protests against the clerical system have grown in recent years.\nFollow this author Jason Rezaian 's opinions\nFollow this author\nJason Rezaian\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nLess obvious is the regime's fear of a conflict that bleeds into Iranian territory. A direct, protracted war with Israel is not something Iran is equipped to fight. For context, Iran, a country of nearly 90 million people, spent roughly $7 billion on its military in 2022. Israel, with a population of about 9 million, spent more than $23 billion. As Iran's currency spirals downward in value (reaching an all-time low after the weekend attack), it's difficult to envision how the country could ever catch up to Israel's military capabilities.\nJust as critical, though, is the fact that since its devastating eight-year war with Iraq ended in 1988, the Islamic republic has been able to keep the country mostly safe from external military strikes. It's one of the few arguments the regime can make to the people about its success. Yet suddenly \u2014 and ironically, if it wanted to avoid provocation \u2014 that promise of continued internal security feels very flimsy.\nAdvertisement\nSo why conduct the strikes in the first place?\nThis was not a simple act of unprovoked aggression. Don't forget that the air assault was a response to an Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria that killed a top commander and several officers of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. In recent months, and in fact over several years, Israel has assassinated numerous Iranian military officials and nuclear scientists and generally wreaked havoc on Iranian assets without suffering significant consequences.\nIran's leaders, shaken by the killing of top military brass, felt they had to respond with a show of strength. Not doing so would signal impotence to Israel and Iran's Arab adversaries, as well as a restive domestic population that is increasingly eager to see the end of the theocratic regime.\nAdvertisement\nWhether it was designed to cause damage or not, the result was a spectacular failure.\nMake no mistake, this doesn't mean Iran is no longer a threat; but the threats it poses are not the ones we usually presume them to be. Democratic countries should be prepared for the kind of personalized terror Iran has exercised against the many people it has deemed threats to the system's power since its inception. Iranian dissidents, human rights activists, former regime officials, diplomats and journalists \u2014 including me \u2014 have all been targets of the Islamic republic's malice.\nAbductions and assassinations, which are unpredictable and cheap compared with military operations, seem far likelier in the days and weeks ahead than Iran wanting to engage in a kinetic war that would result in heavy domestic casualties.\nAdvertisement\nThe Biden administration recognizes that a retaliation by Israel, which would be orders of magnitude stronger than anything Tehran can muster \u2014 but would very likely result in Iran unleashing these asymmetrical tactics \u2014 is not in U.S. interests. This is why President Biden has wisely declared that the United States would not participate in any Israeli offensive actions against Iran.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jason Rezaian,Global Opinions Writer","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QJXTJS3VNPWSBCWLMZNXAKCNVU_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.585746,"_id":"ad7092d1a84d133b598d8aecb86be679"},{"title":"Iranians both nervous and relieved after narrow Israeli strike","author":"Susannah George","published_date":"2024-04-19 19:07:03","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/19/iran-israel-isfahan-strike","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"In Isfahan, near where the strike took place, the streets were quieter than normal Friday, residents said.","summary":"An uneasy calm settled over Iran on Friday as residents took stock of Israel's pre-dawn strike in the central province of Isfahan.\nThe attack, which was narrow in scope, appeared aimed at de-escalating tensions, analysts and officials said, after a massive Iranian missile and drone attack against Israel last week.\nBut Iranians in Isfahan, which hosts sensitive military and nuclear facilities, said the strike was a reminder of how close the country has come to an all-out war, after years in which Israel and Iran fought mainly in the shadows.\n'This year, the talk of war feels much more real,' said a 33-year-old engineer and resident of the city of Isfahan, the provincial capital, near where the strikes took place. He spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisal by Iranian security forces, saying he heard explosions early Friday.\nAdvertisement\n'Some people are worried that the situation will get worse in the future and bombings will happen like during the war' between Iran and Iraq in the 1980s, he said, adding that the incident 'has become the only topic of people's conversations, whether on the phone or face-to-face.'\nIranian officials and state media downplayed the attack, dismissing the strike as insignificant and saying the explosions reported in Isfahan, more than 200 miles south of Tehran, were from Iran's air defenses intercepting drones. Israel has made no official public comment on the strike, and the primary target remained unclear.\nThe narrative on Friday was in sharp contrast to the fiery warnings Iran made earlier this month after an Israeli strike on an Iranian consular building in Damascus killed senior members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp (IRGC). That attack prompted Iran to strike back at Israel last weekend, when it launched hundreds of drones and missiles, most of which were shot down either by Israel or the United States.\nAdvertisement\n'No damage has been reported in the incident,' Iran's state-run IRNA news agency reported Friday.\nThe muted response reflects a desire by Tehran 'to quickly pretend that nothing happened,' said Alex Vatanka, the director of the Iran program at the Middle East Institute.\nIn Isfahan, a city famed for its ornate Islamic architecture, residents said life continued normally on Friday but that the streets were quieter than usual. The city is the third-largest in Iran with nearly 2 million residents and the spacious Meidan Emam square that was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n'Today the city seems normal and quiet,' said Maryam, a 50-year-old retired factory worker. She also spoke on the condition that she only be identified by her first name because of fears for her safety. Iran regularly cracks down on dissidents or others who speak openly about the country's political and security situation.\nAdvertisement\nIsfahan feels 'suspiciously calm,' said Ashraf, a tailor. 'Way calmer than normal.'\nHe said one of his sons heard explosions in the middle of the night, but the sound 'was very weak and far away, so he just went back to sleep.'\nIran is eager to keep the public focus on its attack on Israel, which its government is framing as a success, Vatanka and other analysts said.\nLater Friday, just hours after the strike, the commander of Iran's ground forces addressed a crowd of supporters in Tehran, but didn't specifically mention the attack in Isfahan.\nInstead, Brig. Gen. Kioumars Heydari referred to the Iranian operation against Israel last week, according to excerpts of his speech broadcast on state TV.\nIran succeeded in 'shattering' Israel's 'fake grandeur,' he said.\nIsrael and Iran have entered 'a new equilibrium, not so different from the old one,' said Arash Azizi, a senior lecturer in political science and history at Clemson University. 'The immediate threat of escalation has been lifted.'\nAhead of the strike, Iranian officials warned against an attack on the country's nuclear facilities. Such an attack would cause Iran to 'revise' its nuclear doctrine, a senior IRGC commander said Thursday, according to the semiofficial Tasnim news agency.\nAdvertisement\nIran maintains that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and denies seeking atomic weapons.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'If (Israel) wants to take action against our nuclear facilities, we will respond by attacking its nuclear sites using advanced weaponry,' said Ahmad Haghtalab, the IRGC commander in charge of nuclear security.\nNow, after days of bracing for an Israeli response, some Iranians felt relief at the news of a limited attack.\nThey began circulating dark humor jokes online, mocking state media's coverage of the strike. The only Iranian casualties were the result of laughter, one user posted on Instagram. Another suggested that if there was significant damage from the attack, that the government would just deny that Isfahan even exists.\nFor others who have grown frustrated with Iran's clerical rulers, a war would be welcome, they said, as long as it meant the government would fall.\nAdvertisement\n'From the perspective of an Iranian woman, I have so many other concerns in my life that, and maybe this will seem odd to you, a strike from Israel doesn't freak me out as much,' said a 40-year-old resident from Tehran.\n'Being killed by the morality police is a much more real threat than being hit by a strike from Israel,' she said, referring to the special patrol unit that, often violently, enforces Iran's strict Islamic dress codes.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"world","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Nilo Tabrizy,Susannah George","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FE47JVGUNTJSK46KMHK2XLHEGE.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.5544963,"_id":"8a128e464be61c2bda80ac27b9167e82"},{"title":"Gaza aid flotilla plans to challenge Israeli blockade, organizers say","author":"Kareem Fahim","published_date":"2024-04-21 07:00:11","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/21/gaza-aid-flotilla-turkey-israel","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"A maritime convoy with more than 5,000 tons of aid for Gaza is preparing to set sail from Turkey in the coming days.","summary":"ISTANBUL \u2014 A flotilla of ships bound for the Gaza Strip is preparing to sail from Turkey in the coming days, organizers say, on a mission aimed at breaching Israel's naval blockade and highlighting the lack of aid reaching Palestinians in the besieged enclave.\nThe organizers, gathered under the banner of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, have participated in similar missions for years, an effort that gained worldwide attention in 2010 after an Israeli raid on a flotilla that included a Turkish ship, the Mavi Marmara, killed 10 people and sparked a diplomatic crisis between Turkey and Israel.\nBut the flotilla's well-traveled route \u2014 the Mediterranean \u2014 has gained new relevance during the current conflict as governments and relief organizations alike turn to sea deliveries to circumvent what aid groups say is Israel's persistent obstruction of deliveries to Gaza over land.\nAdvertisement\nThe latest flotilla mission, which will include a cargo ship carrying more than 5,000 tons of aid, comes as global attention on Gaza's worsening humanitarian crisis has waned, shifting to the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Apparent Turkish sensitivities over whether to allow the ships to depart has caused organizers to hedge on when exactly the voyage, which was scheduled to begin Sunday, would get underway.\nA group of human rights organizations are preparing to send ships stocked with aid to Gaza despite the enclave blockaded by Israel. (Video: Joe Snell/The Washington Post)\nThe regional dynamics were 'challenging,' Ann Wright, one of the flotilla organizers, said in a phone interview from Istanbul last week, where activists planning to join the maritime convoy were gathering. The mission was also at the 'mercy of the port authorities' in Turkey, said Wright, a retired U.S. diplomat and former Army colonel who resigned her State Department position in opposition to the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.\n'The ships are ready,' she said.\nAdvertisement\nAt a news conference Friday aboard one of the ships, Huwaida Arraf, a Palestinian American human rights attorney who has joined previous flotillas to Gaza, said 'our governments have thus far done nothing but we call on them to start now, to uphold their own obligations under international law, to demand that Israel allow the flotilla safe passage to Gaza.'\n'We expect that Turkey will not be bought off and we will indeed sail,' she said. 'Anything less than this is collaborating with the illegal siege on Gaza, and we don't think that is what the Turkish government will do.'\nThe Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request to comment on the flotilla's mission. Israeli channel N12 reported Saturday that 'security preparations' had begun, including for taking over the flotilla. One of the groups participating in the voyage \u2014 a Turkish Islamic charity organization, IHH \u2014 is designated as a terrorist group by Israel. The group has denied links to terrorism.\nIsrael has argued for years that the naval blockade is justified to prevent weapons from reaching Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza \u2014 a policy that Arraf said was part of Israel's 'hermetic closure' of the territory that amounted to collective punishment of its population, and a war crime.\nA report by a U.N. panel on the May 2010 Israeli raid called the naval blockade a 'legitimate security measure,' but said that Israel's boarding of the vessels 'with such substantial force at a great distance from the blockade zone' was 'excessive and unreasonable.'\nAdvertisement\nSince October, Israel's hindrance of aid deliveries by land, as well its attacks on relief organizations, have helped fuel a humanitarian crisis that has caused northern Gaza to slide into famine, according to aid officials and human rights groups.\nThe killing of seven World Central Kitchen workers by Israeli forces on April 1 highlighted the dangerous environment in which relief agencies operate. In the aftermath, the Biden administration warned Israel to swiftly address civilian suffering in Gaza or risk future U.S. support.\n'This is a completely man-made and preventable situation,' Andrea de Domenico, the head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the occupied Palestinian territory, said during a press briefing last week. 'I think there has been a lot of effort from our side and the Israeli side to some extent to increase the volume of aid that is going to the north,' he said, while adding that significant obstacles remained.\nAdvertisement\nIn a six-day period this month, '41 percent of our requests for operations in the north have been denied,' he said. For Gaza's residents, 'every day is literally a struggle to survive.'\nIn March, President Biden announced a plan to establish a maritime aid corridor to Gaza, shortly after the United States joined other countries in dropping relief supplies by air on the enclave. Humanitarian officials said that while any additional deliveries were welcome, they were no substitute for aid delivered by trucks.\nWright said the flotilla would include a cargo ship carrying food packages, water, ambulances and medical supplies including anesthesia. 'We are trying to stop the starvation,' she said. 'It's not nearly enough. It will make a dent,' she said.\nFlotilla participants were conducting nonviolence training last week, in advance of the scheduled departure, she said. 'We hope that we can get into Gaza,' Wright said. But they were preparing for the myriad ways they could be turned back.\nMany of the governments in the region had participated in stymieing previous Gaza missions, including Greece, which stopped boats from departing in 2011. The United States had warned its citizens not to participate in the missions, and offered 'very little assistance' when American activists on the flotillas were detained and then deported by Israel, she said.\nIf the current mission got underway, they were possibly facing an 'armada,' she said, with U.S. warships stationed in the waters off Israel.\nAdvertisement\nMustafa Ozbek, the media coordinator for IHH, said the organizers had notified the Turkish government, the United Nations and other international institutions about the mission.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nDylan Saba, a 31-year old writer and attorney who was planning to travel with the flotilla, said he was joining in part because 'there is an obligation for citizens of the world to act, where governments have failed, and to act in the spirit of international law.'\nAs a Palestinian, whose father was born in Gaza, there was a 'lot of symbolic value in being able to accompany this aid that we are attempting to deliver, not just to my distant family members who are living there, but all of the Palestinians of Gaza,' he said.\n'I feel very confident that this is the right thing for me to do,' he said.

Another group of protesters are sitting-in in a common space at one of the company's New York City offices, according to Zelda Montes, one of the workers participating in the protest. Police were already on their way to the Sunnyvale office around 10:45 a.m. in California, a spokesperson for the protesters said.\nSome workers and outside activists have opposed the contract, known as Nimbus, since it was signed in 2021. But protests have ramped up over the past seven months as Israel continues to bomb the Gaza Strip, following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on the country. Workers have circulated internal emails, protested outside company offices and staged a 'die-in' outside one of Google's buildings in San Francisco in December, blocking traffic on a busy downtown street.\nAdvertisement\nThe protests come a day after pro-Palestinian activists blocked highways, bridges and the entrances to airports across the United States in a coordinated series of demonstrations against Israel's invasion of Gaza and U.S. military support for the country.\nIn early March, Google fired a worker who stood up and protested during a speech being made by Google's top executive in Israel at a conference in New York. Montes, who works as a software engineer at Google-owned YouTube, acknowledged that they may be fired too.\n'We often have the privilege of looking the other way and not to have to think about the impact of our work on the world,' Montes said.

All are testing the proposition he made to voters during his 2020 campaign that a Biden White House would bring a measure of calm and renewed respect for the United States on the world stage.\nForeign policy matters are not typically the top issue for American voters. This November is expected to be no different, with the economy and border security carrying greater resonance.\nBut public polling suggests that overseas concerns could have more relevance with voters than in any U.S. election since 2006, when voter dissatisfaction over the Iraq War was a major factor in the Republican Party losing 30 House and six Senate seats.\n'We see this issue rising in saliency, and at the same time we're seeing voter appraisals of President Biden's handling of foreign affairs being quite negative,' said Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. 'That combination is not a great one for Biden.'\nAdvertisement\nBiden has staked enormous political capital on his response to the Israel-Hamas war as well as his administration's backing of Ukraine as it fends off a Russian invasion.\nThe apparent de-escalation of tensions between Israel and Iran also comes as Congress moves closer to approving $95 billion in wartime aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, a measure that Biden has pushed for as Ukrainian forces run desperately short on arms.\nAfter months of delay in the face of the threat of ouster by his party's right flank, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pushed the package forward and final House passage was expected this weekend. That prospect \u2014 and a surge of weaponry to the front lines \u2014 is giving the White House renewed hope that Ukraine can right the ship after months of setbacks in the war.\nBiden also has made bolstering relations in the Indo-Pacific a central focus of his foreign policy agenda, looking to win allies and build ties as China becomes a more formidable economic and military competitor.\nAdvertisement\nBut Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have an argument to make that Biden's policies have contributed to U.S. dealing with myriad global quandaries, said Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at the Washington think tank Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.\nRepublicans have criticized Biden's unsuccessful efforts earlier in his term to revive a nuclear deal with Iran brokered by the Obama administration and abandoned by Trump, saying that would embolden Tehran. The agreement had provided Iran with billions in sanctions relief in exchange for the country agreeing to roll back its nuclear program.\nGOP critics have sought to connect Russia's invasion of Ukraine to Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan and they blame the Obama administration for not offering a strong enough response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's 2014 seizure of Crimea.\nAdvertisement\n'You can make an intellectual case, a policy case of how we got from Point A to B to C to D and ended up in a world on fire,' said Goldberg, a national security official in the Trump administration. 'People may not care about how we got here, but they do care that we are here.'\nPolling suggests Americans' concerns about foreign policy issues are growing, and there are mixed signs of whether Biden's pitch as a steady foreign policy hand is resonating with voters.\nAbout 4 in 10 U.S. adults named foreign policy topics in an open-ended question that asked people to share up to five issues for the government to work on in 2024, according to The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll published in January. That's about twice as many as mentioned the topic in an AP- NORC poll conducted in the previous year.\nAdvertisement\nFurther, about 47% of Americans said they believe Biden has hurt relations with other countries, according to an AP-NORC poll published this month. Similarly, 47% said the same about Trump.\nBiden was flying high in the first six months of his presidency, with the American electorate largely approving of his performance and giving him high marks for his handling of the economy and the coronavirus pandemic. But the president saw his approval ratings tank in the aftermath of the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in August 2021 and they never fully recovered.\nNow, Biden finds himself dealing with uncertainty of two wars. Both could shadow him right up to Election Day.\nWith the Israel-Hamas war, Republicans pillory him as being not being adequately supportive of Israel, and the left wing of his party harshly criticize the president, who has shown displeasure with Netanyahu's prosecution of the war, for not doing more to force the Israelis to safeguard Palestinian lives.\nAdvertisement\nAfter Israel's carefully calibrated strikes on Iran, Middle East tensions have entered a 'gray area' that all parties must navigate carefully, said Aaron David Miller, an adviser on Middle East issues in Republican and Democratic administrations.\n'Does what has occurred over the last 10 days strengthen each sides' risk-readiness or has it made them drop back from the brink and revert into risk aversion?' Miller said. 'Israel and Iran got away with striking each other's territory without a major escalation. What conclusions do they draw from that? Is the conclusion that we might be able to do this again? Or is it we really dodged a bullet here and we have to be exceedingly careful.'\nIsrael and Hamas appear far away from an agreement on a temporary cease-fire that would facilitate the release of remaining hostages in Hamas-controlled Gaza and help get aid into the territory. It's an agreement that Biden sees as essential to finding an endgame to the war.\nAdvertisement\nCIA Director William Burns expressed disappointment this past week that Hamas has not yet accepted a proposal that Egyptian and Qatari negotiators had presented this month. He blamed the group for 'standing in the way of innocent civilians in Gaza getting humanitarian relief that they so desperately need.'\nAt the same time, the Biden administration has tried to demonstrate it is holding Israel accountable, imposing new penalties Friday on two entities accused of fundraising for extremist Israel settlers that were already under sanctions, as well as the founder of an organization whose members regularly assault Palestinians.\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan and other administration officials met on Thursday with Israel's minister for strategic affairs, Ron Dermer, and national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi. U.S. officials, according to the White House, reiterated Biden's concerns about Israel's plans to carry out an operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where some 1.5 million Palestinians have taken shelter.\nRoss Baker, professor emeritus of political science at Rutgers University, said Biden may have temporarily benefited from Israeli-Iranian tensions driving attention away from the deprivation in Gaza.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Aamer Madhani","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/44Y2JLX7C4I65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.5061255,"_id":"2406be669a5e0a3650c28071c898708d"},{"title":"They criticized Israel.

An organization dedicated to publicly rebuking critics of Israel had posted on X a clip of Marzouca declaring that 'radical solidarity with Palestine means \u2026 not apologizing for Hamas.'\nThe 20-second clip, from an Instagram live stream, rapidly garnered more than 1 million views. Soon, the group, StopAntisemitism, was calling Marzouca a 'Hamas terrorist supporter' and tagging their employer, the branding firm Terakeet of Syracuse, N.Y. Hundreds of people commented on X, LinkedIn and email, including one who asked: 'Do you really have antisemites like this working for you, @Terakeet?'\nWithin a day, Marzouca was fired \u2014 a development Terakeet announced as a reply to StopAntisemitism's Twitter thread, 15 hours after the original post.\nAdvertisement\n'Thank you for your swift action,' StopAntisemitism wrote.\nTerakeet did not respond to a request for comment.\nMarzouca, 32, is one of nearly three dozen people who have been fired or suspended from their jobs after being featured by StopAntisemitism, according to the group's X feed, part of a wave of digital activism related to the Israel-Gaza war.

Since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7 and Israel responded by attacking Gaza, groups have poured resources into identifying people with opposing political beliefs, sometimes deploying aggressive publicity campaigns that have resulted in profound real-world consequences.\nWithin weeks of Oct. 7, 'doxing trucks' prowled the campuses of Harvard, Columbia and Princeton, displaying the names and photos of students and professors who had signed statements declaring solidarity with Palestinians. In January, a Rutgers Law School student sued the university, alleging that he had faced discriminatory disciplinary action after sharing what he deemed 'pro-Hamas' messages from his classmates with school administrators.\nIn January, a Rutgers Law School student sued the university, alleging that he had faced discriminatory disciplinary action after sharing what he deemed 'pro-Hamas' messages from his classmates with school administrators.\nAdvertisement\nSix months into the war, the strategy has spread well beyond academia \u2014 and become especially potent among pro-Israel groups determined to call out any statement they believe to be antisemitic.\nAmong a bevy of small social media accounts, StopAntisemitism has become one of the most prominent \u2014 and widely followed. Though some groups are dedicated to surfacing anti-Palestinian speech, none has StopAntisemitism's reach or impact. Founded in 2018 as a 'response to increasing antisemitic violence,' StopAntisemitism has dialed up its activity on X since the war, and often provides its more than 300,000 followers with personal social media profiles and employer details for people it identifies as antisemitic.\n'By publicly exposing antisemites, StopAntisemitism has created an environment where those who propagate hatred against the Jewish people are met with real-world consequences including but not limited to job loss and school expulsions,' StopAntisemitism's website reads.\nAdvertisement\n'StopAntisemitism gets results,' Liora Rez, the group's executive director, boasted in a LinkedIn post in November.\n'This is just a small sampling of the bigots StopAntisemitism has gotten fired or suspended in the past week,' she wrote next to photos of people featured by the account. 'Sick of the legacy orgs doing nothing with your donations? DM me!'\nRez did not respond to a request for comment.\nActivists have long used the internet to publicize comments they find offensive, and such pressure campaigns have been central to movements like #MeToo and Black Lives Matter. But the complex politics and brutal violence of the Israel-Gaza war have created a particularly divisive moment. A slew of figures have faced consequences for making statements about Israelis, the Israeli state and the war, including a New York Times Magazine writer, law students entering the job market and Palestinian Israelis, who have been jailed in Israel for being perceived as sympathetic to Hamas.\nAdvertisement\nMarzouca, who lives in Los Angeles and uses they/them pronouns, said StopAntisemitism's X post triggered a stream of threats. People emailed Marzouca saying they deserved to be sent to Gaza to die and criticizing their appearance, with one person calling them a 'disgusting, manipulative rat.'\nIn response to questions from The Washington Post about the group's online activity, Marc Greendorfer, founder of the Zachor Legal Institute, a legal think tank representing StopAntisemitism, described the group's activity as 'reposting.' It '[repeats] verbatim, the public statements of people making antisemitic statements and provides opinion on those statements,' he wrote in a letter.\nSome prominent Jewish advocates argue that groups like StopAntisemitism play an important role in cracking down on religious discrimination. 'If an individual is going to publish or say hateful things \u2014 against any person or group \u2014 they should be held to account for them,' Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, told The Post in a statement. He added that the ADL directly confronts such individuals, 'calling for consequences if they do not apologize or attempt to change their ways.'\nAdvertisement\nOthers view this type of sleuthing as a damaging form of online vigilantism. Joan Donovan, an expert in digital activism and an assistant professor at Boston University, argued that the group's efforts are a form of doxing \u2014 the practice of posting personal information online to encourage harassment \u2014 which in turn chills debate.\n'When the mob is the judge, jury and executioner, we all end up suffering,' Donovan added.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe high-stakes war has found especially fertile ground on social media, where some Palestinian rights activists say they are disproportionately named, shamed and punished.\n'The intent here is not just to punish but also to have a chilling effect,' said Lara Friedman, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, a think tank. 'It's to send a message to people that \u2026 if you dare speak out of line when it comes to questions related to Israel, you can and may face dramatic consequences \u2014 life-changing consequences.'\n\u2018StopAntisemitism gets results'\nThe bloody Israel-Gaza war has intensified the long-standing debate over when and whether critiques of Israel are antisemitic. Since the Zionist movement began in the late 1800s, with European Jews seeking a nation-state, it has drawn heavy criticism \u2014 and birthed common false conspiracy theories about Jewish power. But as critics of Israel, including many Jewish people, have denounced the state for its treatment of Palestinians, some supporters have countered with a broad argument that any criticism of Israel or Zionism is inherently anti-Jewish.\nAdvertisement\n'There are a lot of reasonable differences,' said Lila Corwin Berman, a professor of Jewish history at Temple University. '[But] a lot of organizations [are] taking a pretty blunt-tool approach that any articulation of anti-Zionism is antisemitism.'\nGreendorfer, of the Zachor Legal Institute, said StopAntisemitism uses the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism, which includes denying Israel's right to exist.\nStopAntisemitism has flagged people for a variety of statements the organization considers antisemitic, including a college instructor who called Israelis 'pigs' and a high school basketball coach who wore a shirt with a watermelon, a symbol of solidarity with the Palestinian cause, to a game. (Both apologized, and the college instructor is 'no longer with' their workplace, according to a StopAntisemitism post.)\nThe organization is ratcheting up its sleuthing abilities. As of early February, StopAntisemitism has been seeking a senior open-source intelligence researcher who has existing partnerships with law enforcement and is adept at monitoring social media and the dark web for antisemitic posts, according to StopAntisemitism's website. (The role pays between $85,000 to $100,000, the job posting said.)\nThe Adam and Gila Milstein Family Foundation lists StopAntisemitism as a 'supported organization' on its website. The philanthropy is tied to Adam Milstein, a wealthy real estate investor who is the co-founder of the Israeli American Council, a prominent Jewish advocacy group.\nco-founder of the Israeli American Council, a prominent Jewish advocacy group.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to 2022 tax filings, the Merona Leadership Foundation, where Milstein's wife, Gila, serves as president, paid a $125,633 salary to Rez, StopAntisemitism's executive director, and provides the organization about $270,000 to cover its expenses.\nGreendorfer said The Post's characterization of StopAntisemitism's funding is a 'misinterpretation' but declined to elaborate further. Nathan Miller, a representative for the Adam and Gila Milstein Family Foundation, declined to comment. The Merona Leadership Foundation declined to comment.\nDonovan, of Boston University, said online efforts to punish enemies originate with activist accounts, such as those that identify unethical police officers. But as a flurry of right- and left-wing accounts used the tactic to publicize and shame people without public power, the strategy became diffuse, wielded to demonize everyone from supporters of transgender rights to Jan. 6 insurrectionists.\nAdvertisement\nThese accounts have become so widespread that it is difficult for social media companies to regulate them, Donovan said. When the billionaire Elon Musk took over Twitter, now named X, the platform's attempts to rein in posts triggering harassment dropped significantly, she added. Representatives from X did not respond to a request for comment.\nGreendorfer says that because StopAntisemitism doesn't post 'private information,' its methods don't amount to doxing.\nPosting identifying information about nonpublic figures can be harmful, according to Nina Jankowicz, an expert on disinformation and online abuse.\n'When we're thinking about \u2026 using social media to blow the whistle or to hold powerful people to account, that's very different than [doing it] because you disagree with them or because they've expressed an opinion that you find repugnant,' she said.\nCeline Khalife, a 25-year-old therapist, says StopAntisemitism shut down her career just as it was getting started. A video posted by StopAntisemitism shows the Palestinian American tearing down a poster of Israeli hostages. She said Israel kidnapped its own citizens, a false conspiracy theory.\nKhalife, who fled Lebanon after Israel bombed Beirut in 2006, told The Post that she was flustered and misspoke in the video. She said she removed the poster because it contained the phrase 'Hamas terrorists' \u2014 propaganda, she argues, meant to minimize the Palestinian struggle.\nStopAntisemitism linked to Khalife's therapy clinic bio and posted her Psychology Today profile, warning that 'patients must be made aware of her intrinsic bias and hateful act.'\nDozens messaged her workplace insisting she be fired immediately; other notes poured into her cellphone and personal email. 'What's going on with your nutjob therapist, Celine Khalife?' one message viewed by The Post said.\nFour days after the video surfaced, the clinic fired Khalife, according to an internal message viewed by The Post. On Facebook, the company announced it was aware of the 'viral incident' and said it does 'not condone violence or intolerance in any form, nor do we condone misinformation.' (Khalife's former employer, the Grace Therapy and Wellness Center, did not respond to a request for comment.)\n(Khalife's former employer, the Grace Therapy and Wellness Center, did not respond to a request for comment.)\nKhalife said it was 'crippling' to deal with the harassment, job loss and damage to her professional reputation.

Its veto killed the measure, proposed by Algeria on behalf of Arab nations. Twelve of the 15 council members voted in favor while two, Britain and Switzerland, abstained.\nU.S. officials had said that voting for statehood now would undermine prospects for a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians, which it said must be negotiated between the two parties.\n'President Biden has been clear that a sustainable peace in the region can only be achieved through a two-state solution' with mutual agreement, U.S. representative Robert Wood told the council after the vote. 'There is no other path that guarantees Israel's security and future as a democratic Jewish state. There is no other path that guarantees Palestinians can live in peace and with dignity in a state of their own.'\nAdvertisement\n'We also have long been clear that a premature actions here in New York, even with the best intentions, will not achieve statehood for the Palestinian people,' Wood said.\nThe vast majority of the council disagreed, with some saying the United States, and its unwavering support for Israel, bears responsibility for the ongoing agony of the Palestinian people. 'Today's use of the veto by the U.S. delegation is a hopeless attempt to stop the inevitable course of history,' Russian Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya said.\nThe results of the vote, with Washington 'practically in complete isolation, speak for themselves,' he said. The United States 'fully shared responsibility with its Israeli allies for the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians.'\nMost others expressed disagreement with the U.S. analysis that Palestinian statehood would undermine, rather than promote, regional peace and stability, and argued that negotiations between two such unequal parties, with one occupying the territory of the other, could never achieve a fair solution.\nAdvertisement\nOver decades of council meetings, the council 'has been largely sympathetic to the Palestinian cause,' Guyana's Ambassador Carolyn Rodrigues-Birkett said. But 'this sympathy has not generated enough political will to achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the Palestinian question.' Instead, she said, there have been 'many band-aid measures to address the symptoms' without addressing 'the root cause of the problem \u2014 the lengthy delay in the creation of an independent state of Palestine.'\nThe outcome of the vote was a foregone conclusion, since the Biden administration said in advance that it would veto the resolution. Passage required both nine votes out of 15, and no veto by a permanent member \u2014 including Britain, France, Russia and China as well as the United States. The administration had lobbied members to vote no or abstain, allowing it to avoid a veto.\nNon-permanent members of the council represent regional blocs of countries and rotate every two years. Those voting in favor of the resolution were: Slovenia, Sierra Leone, South Korea, Mozambique, Malta, Japan, Guyana, Ecuador and Algeria, in addition to Russia, China and France.\nAdvertisement\nBut even its closest council allies did not join the U.S. veto. Britain explained its abstention by saying that the route to a new future for Palestine 'is not entirely our gift' to give, 'but our recognition of a Palestinian state should be part of it.'\n'We believe that such recognition of Palestinian statehood should not come at the start of a new process,' British Ambassador Barbara Woodward said. 'But it doesn't have to be at the very end of the process ... We must start with fixing the immediate crisis in Gaza' even as the international community works 'together to support the new Palestinian government as it takes much-needed steps on reform and resumes governance in Gaza as well as the West Bank.'\nAlgeria, which sponsored the resolution, said, 'We will not abandon this course and we will not rest until the objective is achieved.'\nAdvertisement\nThe vote came after a passionate, day-long debate that included not only council members, but also non-voting U.N. members who signed up to have a say. Several sent their foreign ministers.\nMany argued that a yes vote would send a message, even if it didn't immediately result in peace.\nZiad Abu Amr, special representative of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and others repeatedly noted that the same 1947 U.N. resolution that ultimately brought statehood for Israel also called for the creation of a Palestinian state. Adopting the resolution, he said, would grant Palestinians the hope for a decent life that 'has dissipated over past years because of the intransigence of the Israeli government.'\n'How could granting the state of Palestine full membership of the United Nations ... damage the prospects of peace between Palestinians and Israelis' or international peace? Abu Amr asked. 'To those who say that recognizing a Palestinian state must happen through negotiations and not through a U.N. resolution, we wonder again, how was the state of Israel established.'\nAdvertisement\nIn an angry response, Israel's U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan called the idea that 'a Palestine Nazi state' met the criteria for membership 'a joke.' If it passed the resolution, he said, the Security Council should be known as a 'terror council.'\nRecalling the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel that sparked the current war in Gaza, Erdan said that 'the child-murdering Hamas rapists are watching this meeting and they are smiling. There is no bigger prize for terror than today's meeting.'\nIf the resolution had been approved by the council, the issue would then have gone to the U.N. General Assembly, where two-thirds of the 193 member countries would have to agree. As many as 140 U.N. members already recognize Palestine as a state \u2014 Spain announced its decision to become the latest during the Thursday debate.

While that's been true for months, tensions have been particularly acute this week: The conflict itself escalated with Israel striking targets in Iran late Thursday, while protests against Israel's military action in Gaza led to a tumultuous scene at New York's Columbia University.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nIt's worth stepping back from the extreme manifestations of the debate and, instead, considering how Americans broadly view the conflict. Recent polling offers insights: Americans are more likely to say they sympathize with the Israeli people than they are to say the same of the Palestinian people, but they've also grown more skeptical of the Israeli military effort. Most Americans say humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza should be maintained or increased; a third say that military aid to Israel should be decreased.\nGallup asked Americans their view of the Israeli action in November and last month. Half of respondents said they supported the action five months ago; now fewer than 4 in 10 do. That support is heavily concentrated among Republicans, two-thirds of whom approve of the military action. Even among Republicans, though, that support has fallen since November.\nMeanwhile, polling from YouGov in November and this month shows that support for a cease-fire has increased, albeit subtly. About two-thirds of Americans say they support a cease-fire at least somewhat, and just under half of them strongly support one. More than three-quarters of Democrats say they support a cease-fire at least somewhat; so do a majority of Republicans.\nThe recent YouGov poll, conducted for the Economist, also asked whether military aid to Israel and humanitarian aid to Palestinians should be increased or decreased. A plurality of respondents said humanitarian aid should be increased; a plurality also said that military aid should be decreased. There's a wide partisan split here, too, with Republicans diverging from both Democrats and independents in their views.\nA CBS News poll conducted by YouGov and published over the weekend considered the question of how the United States should react if Iran struck Israel \u2014 which it subsequently did. The poll showed plurality support for standing by Israel without taking direct military action, the position adopted by the Biden administration. Here again Republicans were more aggressive, with a third supporting direct U.S. action against Iran. Only a quarter of respondents overall took that position.\nThat CBS poll also posed several questions meant to gauge support for possible actions by the U.S. government. Three options had the support of at least 6 in 10 respondents: sending humanitarian aid to Israelis and Palestinians and fostering a diplomatic resolution. Only among Republicans was there more support for providing weapons to Israel than providing humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza.\nYouGov polling has also tracked where American sympathies lie in the conflict. Both in October polling, conducted soon after the brutal attack by Hamas that triggered Israel's military action, and this month, more respondents said they sympathized with Israelis than Palestinians. Since October, though, those sympathies have shifted toward the Palestinians, most significantly among Democrats. Republicans overwhelmingly side with the Israeli people.\nWhen respondents were asked to indicate their level of sympathy for each side, Israelis again engendered more sympathy overall. Democrats were more likely to say they sympathized strongly or at least somewhat with the Palestinian people than they were to say the same of the Israeli people, though three-quarters offered at least some sympathy for the Israeli people. Among Republicans, about half offered at least some sympathy for the Palestinian people.\nThe partisan divides apparent above are inextricable from what's unfolding in response to the war. This week, the president of Columbia University appeared before a House Republican-led committee on Capitol Hill focused on antisemitism at the school. When the school subsequently called in police to dislodge pro-Palestinian protesters conducting a sit-in on campus, the political right praised the move.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Philip Bump,National Columnist","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MZCA2VD7UBR52ZDF3ZU7DBPLPQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.4209914,"_id":"0114014e8245c3ca6e0f4bc3c440759c"},{"title":"It's make or break time for Israel, Ukraine aid \u2026 and Johnson","author":"Leigh Ann Caldwell","published_date":"2024-04-15 10:18:01","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/15/its-make-or-break-time-israel-ukraine-aid-johnson","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"In today's edition \u2026 Trump's first criminal trial kicks off today \u2026 Ukraine's attacks on Russian oil refineries deepen tensions with U.S.","summary":"Good morning, Early Birds.

A previous Israel-only aid bill failed in February because it didn't garner two-thirds support in the House. (The House passed an Israel funding bill last year, but it was a non-starter in the Senate because it included unrelated funding cuts to the IRS.)\n'The best way to help Israel rebuild its antimissile and anti-drone capacity is by passing that [Senate-approved] supplemental immediately,' Schumer said at a news conference in New York yesterday.

'We'll put something together and send it to the Senate,' Johnson said on Fox's 'Sunday Morning Futures.'\nBut any package would have to have buy-in from Schumer, McConnell and the White House.

Despite this, our preparations remain inadequate.\nClimate change not only causes natural disasters but also creates global health emergencies. Wildfires burn in California, and Canada faces a high risk. Other disasters around the world this year have already claimed hundreds of lives. Why are we still unprepared?\nThe World Health Organization director general authored a new official report, titled 'Climate Change and Health.' This report acknowledges climate change as a critical health issue and proposes a structured approach to address it. As young physicians and global health researchers, we urge governments to prioritize health in their climate policies, enhance data collection and monitoring, and standardize protocols for capacity building.\nAdvertisement\nThe pandemic exposed gaps in our emergency response capacity. We call upon the governments to strengthen health-care capacity, preparing the health-care systems to act as pillars of sustainability in the face of climate change.

In the same vein, we might be unable to exhibit the required understanding, cooperativeness and selflessness needed to overcome the effects of climate change.\nSince the discovery of climate change a half-century ago, the world's reaction has been appalling. The response from those in the best position to do something about it, such as world political leaders and the barons of industry, has ranged from inadequate to nonexistent. For far too long, it seems the prospect of the end of humanity has paled in significance when compared with the continuation of the status quo, with its profits and comforts. The urgency of the situation is finally taking hold, but is it happening too late? Precious time has been wasted.\nAdvertisement\nPerhaps the world's best hope for survival would be the use of cutting-edge science and technology to, for example, remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. The nature of the process would be analogous to the extraction of salt from the ocean, but immensely more complex. A major advantage of such a solution is that it would be less affected by the proclivities of human behavior. Even in an advanced country such as the United States, a significant number of people still believe the whole thing is a 'hoax,' and business as usual still reigns. It really does feel like, once again, we can't help ourselves \u2014 but this time, the consequences could be fatal for the entire human species.\nHarry Flickinger , Gaithersburg\nHarry Flickinger, Gaithersburg\nRegarding the April 10 article 'U.N. climate chief presses for faster action, says humans have 2 years left \u2018to save the world'':\nAdvertisement\nWhile the thought of 'two years left' seems depressingly pessimistic to me as a college student, it's important that we don't lose faith and focus on solutions. Although this article is more concerned with carbon emissions on a global scale, it is crucial that we look inward at our own domestic responsibility in reducing our emissions. The United States has yet to pass legislation for large-scale emissions reductions, such as a carbon fee to encourage polluters to turn to more renewable energy and a dividend distributed to every citizen to cushion the result of the fee.\nWhile Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University, worries this two-year warning will be ignored, it is my hope that it can be a call to action. While issues of climate change seem overwhelming to many citizens, our nation is based on the power of the ballot to prioritize the greatest threats to our future. November is coming.\nCourtney Hand , Williamsburg, Va.\nCourtney Hand, Williamsburg, Va.\nWhat Donald Trump doesn't understand about Jewish voters\nRegarding Philip Bump's April 10 analysis, 'Browbeating Jewish voters hasn't yet worked for Trump':\nAdvertisement\nDonald Trump's statement that Jews who don't vote Republican don't love Israel is a waste of breath. I am a Jew, and I love Israel. It's Benjamin Netanyahu whom I don't like or trust. There is mounting evidence that the Israeli prime minister is holding on to power for the same reason Mr. Trump wants to return to power: to keep out of the courtroom. The last time I voted for a Republican was in November 1990. But if you're wondering, I'm not voting for any current Republican, and I still love Israel.\nRobert Bronstein , New York\nRobert Bronstein, New York\nDonald Trump might be surprised to learn that Jewish voters, even those of us who are strong supporters of Israel, have strong feelings about other priorities as well. We care about education, the economy, women's health care, gun safety, foreign affairs, the environment, crime and, yes, even immigration. We are very aware that if Mr. Trump wins and the Republicans take the House and Senate, we will likely lose any progress we have made on these issues.\nAdvertisement\nHow do we know this? Mr. Trump has developed a track record since his surprising win in 2016. His overriding concern, as he seeks the presidency for the third time, seems to be avoiding convictions in his many criminal cases and, if he wins, destroying his enemies. We have a long history of democracy and freedom in this country. When countries lose that, it never works well for the Jewish people. There's a track record for that, too.\nElliott Miller , Bala Cynwyd, Pa.\nElliott Miller, Bala Cynwyd, Pa.\nThe problem with an immediate cease-fire\nRegarding the April 9 op-ed by Jordanian King Abdullah II, French President Emmanuel Macron and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, 'Three nations, one message: A permanent Gaza cease-fire now':\nBefore Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel sought a two-state solution. Under the Oslo accords, Israel wanted a two-state solution. Former U.S. ambassador Dennis Ross recounted in his book 'The Missing Peace: The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace' the proposed solution in 2000 that would have given the Palestinian Authority 95 percent of what they wanted. Then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak agreed, but Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestinian Authority, walked away. The current leader of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, does not want to live in peace with Israel, and Hamas wants to destroy Israel.\nAdvertisement\nThe proposed cease-fire will not be permanent until both sides respect each other's right to exist. Israel is threatened with hostile neighbors and acts accordingly. Are the authors of this op-ed willing to commit troops and resources to ensure that Israel is secure? With a secure Israel, a rational prime minister could be elected to build a two-state solution. What commitments will the authors and the United Nations make to provide effective, peace-loving government(s) for the Palestinians?\nRobert Finkelstein , Reston, Va.\nRobert Finkelstein, Reston, Va.\nJordanian King Abdullah II, French President Emmanuel Macron and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi have observed that 'Protecting civilians is a fundamental legal obligation for all parties and 'the cornerstone' of international humanitarian law. Violating this obligation is absolutely prohibited.' With all due respect, this statement is both inaccurate and misleading.\nAdvertisement\nYes, the protection of 'noncombatants' is a fundamental principle of the Law of Armed Conflict. However, it is not the cornerstone. Historically, the LOAC has recognized that civilian deaths and the destruction of civilian property will often occur in the course of armed conflict. The principal purpose of the LOAC has thus been to mitigate, not eliminate, this loss of civilian life and property by regulating the means and methods by which conflict might be lawfully conducted. Accordingly, a commander must refrain from an attack in which the anticipated incidental civilian harm would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected to be gained.\nThus, while the protection of civilians is indeed a fundamental consideration in conducting a military operation, this factor does not take priority over mission accomplishment. A warfighter, in developing an operation plan, cannot do so on the basis that, legally, his primary concern must not be the military necessity of accomplishing his mission, but rather the protection of the enemy's civilian population. To contend that this is the case would be to turn the LOAC on its head.\nDavid E. Graham , Charlottesville\nDavid E. Graham, Charlottesville\nAdvertisement\nThe leaders of Egypt, France and Jordan all support an immediate cease-fire, which is counterintuitive to the universally supported right of Israel to defend itself. Hamas publicly claims its members will repeat the Oct. 7 attack until Israel no longer exists.\nThe call for releasing hostages is laudable. However, bear in mind that Hamas wishes to exchange the people they kidnapped for criminals and murderers held in Israel's prisons. Will released prisoners carry out another Oct. 7?","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/746PTWHV2MI65BVW5LI4V2ILFE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.377795,"_id":"84ba4ce69c7f5d5aa8e497ad7554f79b"},{"title":"U.S. sanctions target Iran's drone production after attack on Israel","author":"Jeff Stein","published_date":"2024-04-18 13:47:06","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/04/18/iran-treasury-drone-sanctions","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Treasury announces new sanctions on Tehran but seeks to contain broader conflict.","summary":"The Treasury Department on Thursday officially announced new sanctions on Iran in retaliation for its attack against Israel, as the Biden administration seeks an economic rather than military response to Tehran.\nTreasury Secretary Janet L.

The challenge this year, a wartime Passover, will be how to celebrate it together.\nAt every Passover Seder, we ask, 'Why is this night different from all other nights?' This year, we must also confront the question, 'Why is this Seder different from all other Seders?' and the inescapable reality that among our multitude there are different and clashing answers about Israel and Gaza.\nAt Thanksgiving, my family sidestepped our divisions by declaring the table an Israel-free zone. But that won't work for Passover. The exodus of the Jews from Egypt and their arrival in Israel is the story. The concluding words of the Seder make the point, ' L'shanah haba'ah b'Yerushalayim. Next year in Jerusalem.'\nis the story. The concluding words of the Seder make the point, 'L'shanah haba'ah b'Yerushalayim. Next year in Jerusalem.'\nAdvertisement\nBut that leaves the matter of what to do about this year. Even as we give thanks for the liberation of the Jews from Egypt, we must keep in mind that 1,200 were slaughtered on Oct. 7 and that others, who knows how many are still alive, are being held hostage in Gaza. There are too many Seder tables with empty chairs. Giving thanks for liberation has to make way for mourning those who are gone forever and for keeping top of mind those who may still be brought back.\nThere is a frankly uncomfortable part of the Passover Haggadah. 'For not only one enemy has risen up to destroy us,' this passage reads, 'but in every generation do enemies rise up against us, seeking to destroy us.' In ordinary years, at least for me, this has carried with it an anachronistic air of Jewish paranoia. This year, not so much.\nAmerican Jews have to grapple with two simultaneous truths. In Israel, Hamas is seeking to destroy us. And yes, destroy us as Jews, not simply Israel. Just read their charter. The continued existence of Israel as a Jewish state feels more tenuous than at any time in my life.\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, in the United States, there is the parallel fact of rising antisemitism. Jewish Americans of my generation once thought our parents were alarmist and out of touch with modernity when they emphasized this passage. But were they? The Anti-Defamation League reports a 140 percent increase in antisemitic incidents in 2023, the highest level on record and more than the previous three years combined.\nFollow this author Ruth Marcus 's opinions\nFollow this author\nRuth Marcus\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nAgain, this is linked to anti-Israel sentiment but ventures beyond opposition to Zionism to antisemitism pure and simple \u2014 'Kill the Jews' graffiti and Jewish students being spat on. Much as we would prefer to believe otherwise, it is now happening here.\nStill, and here we get to the clashing answers part, this year we must also acknowledge: There are too many dead civilians in Gaza, too many dead or injured children, too many Gazans suffering from homelessness and hunger. To be true to our ethical compass as Jews, we are also called upon to keep in mind their suffering \u2014 and to temper our celebration accordingly.\nAdvertisement\nIsrael was brutally invaded on Oct. 7; it had the right and the duty to defend itself. Had Hamas not attacked, none of these terrible consequences would have ensued. Had Hamas not embedded itself within, and underneath, the civilian population, many of these deaths would not have occurred; Hamas is the only combatant in the history of urban warfare whose strategy is to maximize the deaths of its own people.\nBut to say that does not go far enough to recognize Israel's responsibility, in particular for its failure to facilitate the delivery of food and other humanitarian aid to the civilian population. I understand how difficult it is for Israelis to support providing this help while the hostages suffer, especially because of the real risk of supplies being diverted to Hamas. And yet, this resistance feels fundamentally un-Jewish.\nThe Haggadah, as it happens, suggests a better way. It opens with the words, 'Let all who are hungry, come and eat; all who are needy, come and celebrate the Passover with us.' All, not only Jews.\nAdvertisement\nGod, we are told, visited 10 plagues on the Egyptians, from turning waters of the Nile into blood to the slaying of the firstborn. At the Seder, we dip a finger into the second cup of wine to symbolically spill a drop of blood as we recite each one to reflect that our happiness cannot be complete. The Egyptians, also God's children, suffered as well when the pharaoh hardened his heart. Hamas, perhaps, exists in every generation.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ruth Marcus,Associate Editor","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/W57UFVWJZ2VF2GJMVBHFSPAWVA_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.3679724,"_id":"8bf81ef310586a699fc2b40bc5ae42de"},{"title":"UN appeals for $2.8 billion to help 3 million Palestinians in desperate need of food and other aid","author":"Edith M.

As an example, he questioned what the military objective was in shooting an MRI scanner that examines parts of the body and can detect cancers.\nAdvertisement\nHe said his team has been dealing with 'a scene of terror' at the hospital, with U.N. and Palestinian colleagues helping people try to recognize family members from shoes or clothes on 'the remnants of corpses.'\nIsrael promised to open more border crossings into Gaza and increase the flow of aid into Gaza after its drone strikes killed seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen who were delivering food into the territory on April 1.\nThe killings were condemned by Israel's closest allies and heightened criticism of Israel's conduct in the 6-month-old war with Hamas, sparked by the extremist group's surprise attack in southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people and led some 250 others to be taken hostage. The Israeli offensive in Gaza aimed at destroying Hamas has caused widespread devastation and killed over 33,800 people, according to local health officials.\nAdvertisement\nDe Domenico said there are signs of Israel's 'good intention' to get more humanitarian assistance into Gaza, citing the opening of a crossing to the north, which faces the most serious threat of famine, and the opening of bakeries there.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBut the U.N. keeps pushing Israel to do more, he said.\nDe Domenico pointed to Israeli denials and delays on U.N. requests for aid convoys to enter Gaza.\nHe said 41% of U.N. requests that required going through Israeli checkpoints were denied during the week from April 6-12, and last week a convoy from the U.N. children's agency UNICEF and the U.N. World Food Program was caught in crossfire in an area that was supposed to be safe.\nDe Domenico said convoys often spend hours at checkpoints and are only cleared in the afternoon, too late to make deliveries and return safely in daylight hours. He said the Israelis know this is how the U.N. operates, and delays allow them to say 'we're not blindly denying you' while controlling what happens.\nAdvertisement\n'We continue to engage with them and our objective is really to solve the issue and deliver aid,' he said.\nAccording to the international community's authority on determining the severity of hunger crises, famine is imminent in northern Gaza where 70% of people are experiencing catastrophic hunger. And its recent report warned that escalating the war could push half of Gaza's 2.3 million people to the brink of starvation.\nDe Domenico said the U.N. appeal was scaled back from $4 billion because of difficulties in getting aid into Gaza \u2014 and most importantly getting it to the people who need it most.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Edith M.

But can the U.S. be relied on beyond this?","summary":"In a world full of instability and threats \u2014 autocracy, terrorism, cross-border aggression \u2014 the question confronting endangered countries is: Can we count on the United States? Should we? From Ukraine to Taiwan to Israel, governments have been asking. Indeed, the uncertainty extends well beyond those directly embattled countries to other traditional U.S. allies such as Japan, South Korea and Europe.\nThe reasons for this uncertainty are many, but all trace to one main source: a sense that the United States' own post-World War II bipartisan foreign policy consensus is fraying around the edges. That challenge was both exposed and accelerated by the rise of Donald Trump and a selfish, simplistic, 'America First' ideology in the Republican Party. Parallel to that, the progressive wing of the Democratic Party increasingly questions the U.S.-Israel relationship, as well as long-standing commitments to other Middle East partners such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\nFor now, U.S. allies can breathe easier, thanks in large part to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and his willingness \u2014 albeit much too belated \u2014 to resist far-right forces in his own party at the risk of his position. With his support and skillful management of the legislative process, large majorities of the House got an opportunity to work their will, which was to support $95 billion in aid to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and others in the Indo-Pacific. (Crucially, the package includes not only $17 billion to help Israel defeat Hamas and hold off Iran and its proxies, but also $9 billion in humanitarian aid, much of it destined to help Palestinian civilians.) President Biden can soon sign the legislation.\nAdvertisement\nThe Ukraine measure is by far the most important of the three, since the country faces the most immediate threat. It is low on ammunition and under relentless Russian military pressure that might lead to major losses or even defeat. The $60.8 billion worth of assistance will provide Ukraine with much-needed artillery shells and air-defense assets, without which it might not be able to withstand President Vladimir Putin's bid to subjugate a neighbor, likely followed by similar aggression against others.\nA core U.S. interest \u2014 Europe's security \u2014 is at risk. Though it's unconscionable that 112 of the 214 GOP representatives voting were 'nays' on the Ukraine aid (all 210 Democrats who voted were 'ayes'), the House's top Democrat, Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), was right to acknowledge that 'traditional conservatives, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, have risen to the occasion.' Mr. Jeffries, too, rose to the occasion by allowing Democrats to vote for a procedural rule that advanced the measures. He intimated that Democrats would help Mr. Johnson if he faced a far-right revolt over Ukraine. This deft hint at what would have been a remarkable bipartisan rescue of a GOP speaker seems to have helped ultimately defuse Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's (R-Ga.) threats to unseat Mr. Johnson.\nThis is a historic moment. A de facto bipartisan coalition government has maintained U.S. global credibility. Yet it feels more like an inflection point than a conclusion. The world, and the United States, are changing. It is changing so fast, in fact, that part of what happened over the weekend was a vote to force eventual Chinese divestment of TikTok or an outright ban. This cellphone app, which 150 million Americans, generally young people, use for information and entertainment, barely existed a decade ago. Now U.S. politicians from both parties regard it as a possible means for the People's Republic to exercise malign influence over U.S. public opinion.\nAdvertisement\nMore conflict over foreign policy priorities, both between and within the two parties, seems inevitable. Mr. Trump has suffered a setback but still controls the GOP. Progressive Democrats are far from done pressing their case against unconditional aid to Israel; 37 of them voted against helping Israel this time, in rare agreement with 21 right-wing Republicans, albeit for different reasons.\nFollow this author Editorial Board 's opinions\nFollow this author\nEditorial Board\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nU.S. alliances endure, but the stage is set for a recalibration of their terms.

Israel's military chief said Monday that his country will respond to the attack, while world leaders caution against retaliation, trying to avoid a spiral of violence.\nAdvertisement\nAs the IMF and its fellow lending agency, the World Bank, hold their spring meetings this week, high on the agenda are the fast-rising tensions between Iran and Israel and what escalation could spell for the global economy.\nIsrael and Iran have been on a collision course throughout Israel's six-month war against Hamas militants in Gaza. The war erupted after two militant groups backed by Iran led an attack on Oct. 7 that killed 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 250 others. An Israeli offensive in Gaza has caused widespread devastation and killed over 33,000 people, according to local health officials.\n'We've targeted over 500 individuals and entities connected to terrorism and terrorist financing by the Iranian regime and its proxies since the start of the Administration,' Yellen said, citing sanctions against Iran's drone and missile programs, militant groups Hamas, the Houthis, Hezbollah, and other Iraqi militia groups.\nAdvertisement\n'Treasury will not hesitate to work with our allies to use our sanctions authority to continue disrupting the Iranian regime's malign and destabilizing activity,' she said.

Yellen added that she will meet with Group of Seven finance leaders Wednesday to continue discussions on the topic and will look at 'a series of possibilities, ranging from actually seizing the assets to using them as collateral.'\nAdvertisement\nAnother major issue for this year's meetings on the U.S. side, Yellen said, will be ongoing conversations about Chinese industrial policy that poses a threat to U.S. jobs and the global economy. She traveled to Guangzhou and Beijing earlier this month, to hold 'difficult conversations' with counterparts over what she describes as China's overcapacity in its wave of low-priced Chinese green tech exports that could overwhelm factories in the U.S. and make it impossible to compete.\nYellen said she plans to meet later this week with her Chinese counterparts for a fourth meeting of the U.S.-China Economic and Financial Working Groups, 'to share information, identify potential areas of cooperation, and, when we disagree, frankly communicate concerns.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Fatima Hussein","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OT3OKXX4AQI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.2671456,"_id":"85db3b61712eb75f571403718be32ca4"},{"title":"Seeking answers to D.C.'s truancy problem","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-22 21:28:16","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/22/dc-truancy-parents-children-health-care-ukraine-politics","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Plus, Post readers on children's health, urban planning, Ukraine aid and political parties.","summary":"Regarding Colbert I. King's April 6 op-ed, 'D.C. has a truancy problem. Solutions must include the home.':\nMr. King has done D.C. a service on this vexing and chronic issue once again. He very correctly points out the shortcomings of the D.C. government's policies in this problem area. Clearly, the deputy mayor for education and the schools need to play a crucial role in dealing with this. But, as Mr. King points out, unless and until the parents are required (and helped) to meet their responsibilities, major improvements are unlikely to happen. Two issues remain unaddressed, however: First, does the deputy mayor have the will and capacity to take the needed actions? And second, to what degree are poverty and, say, single-mother households behind the problem, and if so what problem-solving options do we have?\nRichard Moore , Washington\nRichard Moore, Washington\nFocusing on children's health\nThe April 11 news article 'Ohio GOP governor sells public health by focusing on kids' has an important undertone. Investing in children's health is our most powerful lever to create a healthier society and stronger economy. Gov. Mike DeWine (R) says, 'It's hard to sell stuff on the basis of public health.' I know the feeling. As a pediatric surgeon and CEO of a children's health system, I fight the uphill battle of selling public health every day.\nAdvertisement\nI believe Mr. DeWine has got it right. In this country, we mistakenly equate health with medical care. Medical care is an important but relatively small part of health. The governor's health agenda is built around children, as it should be. It includes safety, good nutrition, freedom from violence, early education and more. All these factors are major determinants of health, and all can be markedly affected by small investments during childhood.\nBeyond improving our population's health, this agenda's economic benefits are enough to appeal to both sides of the aisle. Studies show that spending a dollar now to set a child up for lifelong health yields shockingly high returns to taxpayers and the broader economy for years, decades and even generations to come. Mr. DeWine is correct in saying, 'Everyone wants to see kids do better.' I couldn't agree more. It is time to prioritize public health by investing in our children.\nR.

We saw this vividly during the pandemic beginning in 2020, when urban dwellers relied on green spaces as a rare source of beautiful and socially distanced outdoor respite.\nClimate change gives us the clear imperative \u2014 and opportunity \u2014 to prioritize nature in the urban planning of U.S. cities. What does this look like? A study from the Global Center for Clean Air Research finds that the unique infrastructure of botanical gardens has a measurable cooling effect on city air temperatures. This emphasizes the importance of plants, including trees, in greening our cities. By restoring and conserving a diverse array of plant life, especially in dense urban environments, we create much more livable cities for people, wildlife and future generations.\nAdvertisement\nNo less valuable are the communities that green spaces cultivate. Urban farms and community gardens are a powerful way to plant social connections, while also spreading nature within cities.\nWe urge all city leaders and urban planners to support well-managed urban conservation projects and green spaces. As the percentage of Americans living in cities rises sharply, doing so has the potential to be transformational.\nJennifer Bernstein , New York\nJennifer Bernstein, New York\nThe writer is president and CEO of the New York Botanical Garden.\nThe writer is president and CEO of the New York Botanical Garden.\nNot all experiences are the same\nRegarding Ariel Dorfman's April 11 Thursday Opinion commentary, 'Ecuador takes a page from Pinochet with embassy assault':\nBefore we condemn Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa to purgatory for violating Mexico's sovereignty by storming its embassy in Quito to arrest former vice president Jorge Glas, let's look at what Mr. Dorfman did not say in his piece. Mr. Dorfman compares this action with his own experience of escaping a certain death at the hands of oppressive military dictator Augusto Pinochet by finding refuge in the Argentine Embassy in Santiago, Chile, in 1973.\nAdvertisement\nBut Mr. Dorfman was truly vulnerable, and his refugee status saved his life. Mr. Glas, on the other hand, was convicted twice for corruption, receiving prison sentences of six and eight years. In one case, he was convicted of taking millions of dollars from a Brazilian construction company and, in the other, he was found guilty for his role in a scheme that collected bribes for public procurement.\nTo further question whether Mr. Glas was even worthy of asylum, he was released from prison early in a controversial ruling by Judge Emerson Curipallo. Judge Curipallo is now in custody pending an investigation into his alleged role in a bribery scheme involving favorable rulings for a drug lord and others.\nMr. Dorfman cites the importance of respecting the 20th-century refugee protections that are included in a series of agreements and laws. Are these protections designed for convicted criminals? If so, where then does the search for asylum by bad people end?\nAdvertisement\nMaybe it's time to revisit these agreements and laws to ensure that those most vulnerable are protected in their time of need while not giving protection to convicted criminals such as Mr. Glas.\nCurtis Schaeffer , Falls Church\nCurtis Schaeffer, Falls Church\nThe need for Ukraine aid\nRegarding the April 15 news article 'Iran attacks add urgency to stalled aid efforts for Israel':\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nWithout reservation, I support Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. I agree entirely that Israel is of central political and historical importance to the United States. This said, I take issue with Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) when he states that 'Israel's a much closer ally, is a much more core American national security interest' than Ukraine.\nMr. Vance is dead wrong. When Israel is attacked, we must surely support it with the weapons and materiel needed to secure their self-defense. To my knowledge, however, we are not bound by treaty to place troops in Israel, nor to make war directly against another nation on Israel's behalf. The same cannot be said of Europe.\nAdvertisement\nRussia has made clear that it aspires eventually to reconquer those European countries once comprising the Soviet empire. Ukraine stands in the way of that aspiration. Some countries of the old U.S.S.R. are now our NATO allies, whom we are formally required to defend in the event of attack. Should Ukraine fall, and history be a guide, Russia would gain borders with its former vassal states and then could pick its spots to begin snatching territory from NATO's easternmost members. In this case, more U.S. troops would have to be deployed to Europe at incalculable risk to us and the entire world.\nIn a real sense, the United States is already fighting its war with Russia. Ukrainian citizens, however, are doing the fighting for us; their lives and their blood, not ours, are lost. What do we gain for the money and equipment supplied to NATO or to Ukraine? We gain the privilege of watching a war fought on European ground, at massive cost to its people and not so much to ours \u2014 in my view, a pretty good bargain.\nMr. Vance and his some of his Republican colleagues in Congress seem to be advocating for Russia, in effect making arguments for the Russian cause. My response: It is neither fair nor accurate to compare the gravity and enormity of our obligation to NATO (or Ukraine) with our close ties to Israel or, please, to connect any of this with our problems at the border with Mexico.\nAdvertisement\nBill Coe , Washington\nBill Coe, Washington\nThree parties aren't a crowd\nIn the April 9 Prompt 2024 newsletter, 'Why is it so hard to find a winning third-party candidate?,' Alexi McCammond and her colleagues made several meritorious points. However, it is important to note that third-party and independent candidates must contend with various built-in roadblocks from state sore-loser and disaffiliation laws to debate rules controlled by the two-party duopoly and designed to stifle competition.\nAdditionally, in the case of No Labels' recent attempt to recruit a 'unity ticket,' potential candidates were fearful of playing the role of spoiler and tipping the election to Donald Trump. Enactment by each state of a unified, nonpartisan/open primary system in conjunction with ranked-choice voting (RCV) as practiced in Alaska would render moot that major criticism of the No Labels ballot access effort. RCV shuts down the spoiler argument by eliminating the candidate with the least number of votes round by round until a majority of votes is obtained by one candidate. Such a reform offers a long-term solution to reduce polarization in our politics, and serves fairness as opposed to disenfranchisement by allowing independent/unaffiliated voters to participate in state-funded primaries. No Labels and other like-minded groups can work together to advocate such reforms and need not win an election to win the day.\nKenneth F. Cerullo , Mahwah, N.J.\nKenneth F.

It noted that Passover was coming at a difficult time for Jews still processing the Oct. 7 attacks, when Hamas militants killed 1,200 in Israel and took numerous hostages.\nAdvertisement\nEarlier Sunday, the White House issued a separate statement directly in response to anti-Israel protests at Columbia, which are continuing this week as students occupy the university grounds in tented encampments.\n'While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly Antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous,' said the statement from Andrew Bates, deputy White House press secretary.\nMonday is the beginning of Passover, a celebration of Jews' liberation from slavery in Egypt.\nThe protest at Columbia University came the same week as many other demonstrations across the country that were meant to highlight Israel's war in Gaza.

It was his first acknowledgment that a panel within the department had reviewed serious charges against multiple Israeli units that receive U.S. aid.\n'I made determinations. You can expect to see them in the days ahead,' Blinken said.\nBlinken's remarks came in response to a report by the investigative news outlet ProPublica that the panel known as the Israel Leahy Vetting Forum had recommended to Blinken months ago that certain Israeli units be banned from receiving U.S. aid because of gross human rights violations. The incidents took place in the West Bank and mostly occurred before Israel's war with Hamas, the outlet reported.\nAdvertisement\nThe Leahy Laws refer to the landmark legislation by then-Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) that prohibit providing military assistance to individuals or security force units that commit gross violations of human rights with impunity. They have resulted in hundreds of foreign police and military units being blocked from receiving U.S. aid \u2014 in countries including Colombia, Mexico and Cambodia.\nCurrent and former U.S. officials have also told The Washington Post that several Israeli units including border police and special forces have come under scrutiny in the package awaiting Blinken's decision.\nThe State Department has declined to specify which alleged violations were under review, but a number of controversial incidents have been compiled by watchdogs inside and outside the U.S. government.\nIn one of the cases, an army unit is accused of bounding and gagging a Palestinian American citizen at a construction site, after detaining him at a late-night roadblock in the village of Jiljiliya.\nat a construction site, after detaining him at a late-night roadblock in the village of Jiljiliya.\nAdvertisement\nOmar Assad, 78, was found unresponsive in the early hours of Jan. 12, 2022. A medical exam released by the Palestinian Ministry of Justice described his cause of death as 'stress-induced sudden cardiac arrest due to external violence.'\nHe had been tightly bound and blindfolded, found with abrasions on his wrists and bleeding on the insides of his eyelids, the medical exam said. According to details of an Israel Defense Forces probe leaked to Israeli media, soldiers and officers at the scene told investigators they had gagged Assad and forcibly marched him to the construction site because they didn't want his shouting to alert others to the presence of the checkpoint.\nThey denied that he showed any signs of distress and said he was alive when they left him.\nIn another incident, an Israeli interrogator is alleged to have physically and sexually assaulted a 15-year old Palestinian boy, after he was detained by Israeli border police forces from his East Jerusalem home on Jan. 13, 2021. The boy was accused of throwing stones and molotov cocktails. Documentation by Defense for Children International - Palestine, a monitoring group, said that the abuse described in his testimony amounted to torture.\nAdvertisement\nAmong the most significant units to face scrutiny is the Yamam, the elite unit of Israel's border police that focuses on counterterrorism operations, including raids in civilian areas. A Washington Post investigation last year found that the unit had opened fire in a crowded street in the West Bank city of Jenin in March 2023, killing a 14-year-old boy and two militants, neither of whom were visibly armed. One of the men was shot multiple times after he was incapacitated \u2014 an apparent extrajudicial execution that experts said could violate Israeli law.\n'Agents from the Israeli YAMAM unit acted as judge, jury and executioner when they shot and killed two Palestinian men in broad daylight in Jenin on March 16, 2023, a textbook example of an extrajudicial killing by Israeli forces who are used to operating with impunity,' said Adam Shapiro, director of advocacy at Democracy for the Arab World Now, in July. The organization filed a submission on the case to the State Department, arguing that the case fit the criteria to trigger Leahy Law vetting and sanction. 'If the State Department does not apply the Leahy Law in this case, the law may as well not exist,' Shapiro said.\nRights groups say that the abuse of Palestinians in custody is commonplace, and that tactics used during urban raids frequently contravene international humanitarian law. Israel's police and army insist that they operate within the law.\nAdvertisement\nWhen asked about the cases on Friday, Blinken said the Leahy legislation was a 'very important law.'\n'It's one that we apply across the board. And when we're doing these investigations, these inquiries, it's something that takes time. That has to be done very carefully, both in collecting the facts and analyzing them,' he said.

But as the Israelis study lists of potential targets, they are looking for ways to deliver this hard-nosed message without escalating the crisis.\n'The story is not over,' said a senior Israeli source. 'Iran took this massive action to create new rules' by bombarding Israel directly as payback for its April 1 strike on Iranian operatives in Damascus, Syria. 'If we do nothing, it will strengthen this line of thinking in Iran,' the senior Israeli said, stressing: 'We do not seek to escalate this. We want to contain it.

Officials had hoped that neutering Iran's missile attack would be a sufficient show of strength and that a period of de-escalation in the broader Gaza conflict might follow. 'Slow things down, think through things,' President Biden advised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after the defeat of Iran's attack.\nBut like other American appeals to de-escalate, this one appears to have been rejected by Israeli leaders. They see their adversaries as having crossed previous 'red lines' in their willingness to slaughter Israelis \u2014 in Hamas's Oct. 7 terrorist attack and then in Iran's weekend bombardment, which U.S. and Israeli officials believe was intended to cause significant damage and loss of life.\nAdvertisement\nIsraeli officials also reject Iran's pretext for the attack \u2014 that in striking Quds Force commanders in Damascus, it hit a diplomatic facility that was, in effect, part of Iran's sovereign territory. Israelis contend that the facility they struck, though it might have had an Iranian flag outside, hadn't officially been designated a diplomatic compound.\nIranian arguments about the sanctity of diplomatic facilities are also unconvincing from a regime that condoned, and celebrates to this day, the 1979 seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran \u2014 and has allowed more recent attacks on British and other diplomatic facilities there.\nAs Israeli officials weigh their response to Iran's missile attack, they are confronting the perennial dilemma of deterrence: How can a country demonstrate its willingness to use force \u2014 and dominate the cycle of escalation \u2014 without creating precisely the crisis it seeks to avert? Israel's tough-minded approach to this question has deterred some conflicts, but it has arguably created some others.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David Ignatius","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3NKTWFCMXTWG3ELLKMVL6FESIQ.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.206696,"_id":"f2c09c70422428044987886b219dfa71"},{"title":"Protests, heightened terror threat mean tight security at Eurovision Song Contest in Sweden","author":"Jan M.

The casualties were initially transferred to the Kuwaiti Hospital in Rafah, and later the bodies of the six children, two women and a man were taken to Rafah's Abu Yousef al-Najjar hospital, where the area's main morgue is located, the hospital's records showed.\nAt al-Najjar, relatives sobbed and hugged the bodies of the children, wrapped in white shrouds, as others tried to comfort them.\nAdvertisement\nThe fatalities included Abdel-Fattah Sobhi Radwan, his wife Najlaa Ahmed Aweidah and their three children, his brother-in-law Ahmed Barhoum said. Barhoum also lost his wife, Rawan Radwan, and their 5-year-old daughter Alaa.\n'This is a world devoid of all human values and morals,' Barhoum told The Associated Press Saturday morning, crying as he cradled and gently rocked the shroud-wrapped body of Alaa in his arms. 'They bombed a house full of displaced people, women and children. The only martyrs were women and children.'\nNo victims were registered from a second overnight strike in the city. Later Saturday, an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza hit a house in the urban refugee camp of Bureji, killing at least one man and injuring two others, according to authorities at the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the city of Deir al-Balah, where an Associated Press journalist saw the casualties.\nAdvertisement\nRafah, which lies on the border with Egypt, currently hosts more than half of Gaza's total population of about 2.3 million people, the vast majority of whom have been displaced by fighting elsewhere.\nDespite calls for restraint from the international community, including Israel's staunchest ally, the United States, the Israeli government has insisted for months that it intends to push a ground offensive into the city, where it says many of the remaining Hamas militants are holed up.\nSuch a ground operation has not materialized so far, but the Israeli military has repeatedly carried out airstrikes in and around the city.\nThe war was sparked by an unprecedented raid into southern Israel by Hamas and other militant groups on Oct. 7 that left about 1,200 people dead, the vast majority of them civilians, and saw about 250 people kidnapped and taken into Gaza. Israel says about 130 hostages remain in Gaza, although more than 30 have been confirmed to now be dead, either killed on Oct. 7 or having died in captivity.\nAdvertisement\nThe Gaza Health Ministry said Saturday the bodies of 37 people killed by Israeli strikes were brought to hospitals in Gaza over the past 24 hours. Hospitals also received 68 wounded, it said. The latest figures bring the overall Palestinian death toll from the Israel-Hamas war to at least 34,049, and the number of wounded to 76,901, the ministry said. Although the Hamas-run health authorities do not differentiate between combatants and civilians in their count, they say at least two thirds have been children and women.\nThe war has sent regional tensions spiraling, leading to a dramatic eruption of violence between Israel and its archenemy Iran that threatened to escalate into a full-blown war.\nOn Friday, both Iran and Israel played down an apparent Israeli airstrike near a major air base and nuclear site in central Iran, indicating the two sides were pulling back from what could have become an all-out conflict. Over the past several weeks, an alleged Israeli strike killed two Iranian generals at an Iranian consulate in Syria and was followed by an unprecedented Iranian missile barrage on Israel.\nAdvertisement\nIsrael has also faced off with the Hezbollah militant group, an Iranian proxy operating from Lebanon, with the two sides there frequently trading rocket and drone attacks across the Lebanese-Israeli border. Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels have also joined the fray, launching strikes against merchant ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in what they say is a campaign of solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza.\nTension has also been high in the occupied West Bank. An Israeli army raid in the Nur Shams urban refugee camp that killed at least four people on Friday \u2014 three militants and a 15-year-old boy \u2014 continued into Saturday.\nThe Israeli army said its forces had killed 10 militants in the refugee camp and the surrounding areas while the military and the Border Police had arrested eight Palestinian suspects. Nine of its officers and soldiers were wounded, it said.\nAdvertisement\nAn Associated Press journalist at the camp said sounds of intermittent gunfire and explosions were still ringing out Saturday afternoon. The Palestinian Red Crescent said they were trying to reach a number of casualties in the camp but were being prevented by the Israeli army, which instructed their emergency teams to leave the area.\nThe raid appears to be one of the largest that has taken place at the refugee camp since the Israel-Hamas war broke out on Oct. 7.\nAt least 469 Palestinians from east Jerusalem and the West Bank have been killed by Israeli fire since October, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nPalestinian health authorities said one of those killed Friday was a 15-year-old boy shot dead by Israeli fire. The Islamic Jihad militant group confirmed the deaths of three members, including one who it said was a local military commander.

Residents in Tulkarem went on a general strike Saturday to protest the attack.\nThe Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, has a limited foothold in many of the territory's northern towns and cities, including Tulkarem and Jenin.

Iran's attacking Israel isn't a great example.","summary":"Donald Trump has spent a good part of his public life crafting an alternate reality. Just two days after Trump took office in 2017, adviser Kellyanne Conway set the tone by citing how Trump's White House had 'alternative facts' about the inauguration crowd size \u2014 claims that were provable falsehoods. Trump went on to put forth more than 30,000 additional falsehoods during his presidency.\nToday, Trump and his allies are increasingly pitching a different type of alternate reality: one in which Americans never booted him from office in 2020, and the major ills of this country and the world magically disappear \u2014 from inflation to the war in Ukraine to the war in Gaza.\nBut they're starting to overreach.\n'It would not have happened if we were in office,' Trump said this weekend of Iran attacking Israel with an unprecedented aerial assault. 'You know that, they know that, everybody knows that.'\nAdvertisement\n'This attack on Israel would have never happened under a Trump presidency,' Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) reiterated.\n'These attacks on Israel would've never happened under President @realDonaldTrump,' added Republican Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake.\n'This would have NEVER happened under Trump,' Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-Tex.), who like the other two has been mentioned as a possible Trump running mate, said. 'Tell me I'm wrong.'\nThe upside of this strategy is evident, because you quite literally can't prove Hunt wrong. It's unfalsifiable. And Americans seem inclined to buy into the concept at least somewhat, judging by how their reviews of Trump's presidency today are better than they ever were in real time. They trust Trump more than President Biden on foreign policy and national security, as well as inflation.\nAdvertisement\nBut rather than merely parroting the unfalsifiable claim, it's worth putting it in context. And trying to apply the talking point to Iran undercuts the claim.\nIt's true that we did not see a war in Gaza during Trump's presidency. But we did see tensions between Israel and Iran threaten to boil over, repeatedly. And not only that. We saw Iran emboldened not just to attack Israel, but actual Americans.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nOn Jan. 3, 2020, Trump ordered the successful killing of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, whom the U.S. government said was planning attacks on Americans.\nDays later, Iran hit back by striking a U.S. military base in Iraq. One contractor suffered a serious eye injury, and 110 troops suffered traumatic brain injuries while sheltering in place.\nThe provocation involved in directly attacking Israel last week is notable. But the attack's actual toll \u2014 99 percent of projectiles were intercepted, according to the Israel Defense Forces, and just one serious injury has been identified \u2014 pales beside the 2020 attack.\nAdvertisement\nThat 2020 attack, it bears noting, was also directly on U.S. personnel, rather than on a U.S. ally. Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said Iran gave him a heads-up in advance that Americans were the targets. (Trump last year appeared to claim that Iran had also given him a heads-up that it would deliberately miss the base, but Washington Post Fact Checker Glenn Kessler called that 'ludicrous,' while noting that most of the missiles in fact hit the base.)\nThe Iranian attack on American personnel was also unprecedented \u2014 the first time in decades of U.S.-Iran tensions that Iran had directly targeted an American position in the Middle East.\nThe comparison between the two events aside, it doesn't exactly suggest Iran was cowed by the strength of Trump's presidency. Even if you regard Iran's retaliation to Soleimani's killing as limited \u2014 Trump would later suggest as much to justify his own lack of retaliation \u2014 the U.S. government concluded that Soleimani had been preparing to attack us on Trump's watch.\nAdvertisement\nThat this all happened in Trump's final full year in office \u2014 after he'd had more than enough time to make the country's foreign policy his own \u2014 is also noteworthy. There were real fears that the events of January 2020 would lead to not just Iranian involvement in a Middle East war but war between Iran and the United States.\nThat didn't happen. But at least one Trump aide who was around in the months leading up to the early 2020 clash with Iran says Trump's talking point is nonsense.\n'I just think Trump is delusional on this point,' former Trump national security adviser John Bolton said Sunday on CNN. 'It's a point that nobody can refute or confirm one way or the other. He doesn't have any idea what to do in the Middle East in this situation.'\nFor now, it appears to be a talking point that Americans regard with skepticism \u2014 at least when it comes to the other war Trump claims he'd have staved off, the one in Ukraine. In a Washington Post-Schar School poll last month, Americans said 51 percent to 34 percent that Russian President Vladimir Putin would have invaded Ukraine even if Trump were still president. Basically only Trump supporters said they believed Putin wouldn't have (and about 1 in 5 said Putin still would have).","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Aaron Blake,Staff Writer","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6XZFAFRZTEI6XKWZRFMSE4UAYQ.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.167622,"_id":"53fb7fb48667f14c4a384634f21815f9"},{"title":"Israeli leaders criticize expected US sanctions against military unit that could further strain ties","author":"Josef Federman","published_date":"2024-04-21 17:43:19","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/21/israel-us-army-palestinians-west-bank-gaza/a4055c26-0006-11ef-8eac-39c6dcb59eb5_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Israeli leaders are harshly criticizing an expected decision by the U.S. to impose sanctions on a unit of ultra-Orthodox soldiers in the Israeli military","summary":"JERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli leaders on Sunday harshly criticized an expected decision by the U.S. to impose sanctions on a unit of ultra-Orthodox soldiers in the Israeli military.\nThe decision, expected as soon as Monday, would mark the first time the U.S. has ever imposed sanctions on a unit inside the Israeli military and further strains relations between the two allies, which have grown increasingly tense during Israel's war in Gaza.\nWhile U.S. officials declined to identify the sanctioned unit, Israeli leaders and local media identified it as Netzah Yehuda \u2014 an infantry battalion founded roughly a quarter of a century ago to incorporate ultra-Orthodox men into the military. Many religious men receive exemptions from what is supposed to be compulsory service.\nIsraeli leaders condemned the decision as unfair, especially at a time when Israel is at war, and vowed to oppose it.\nAdvertisement\n'If anyone thinks they can impose sanctions on a unit in the IDF, I will fight it with all my might,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.\nNetzah Yehuda, or Judea Forever, has historically been based in the occupied West Bank and some of its members have been linked to abuses against Palestinians. It makes up just a small part of Israel's military presence in the territory.\nThe unit came under heavy American criticism in 2022 after an elderly Palestinian-American man was found dead shortly after he was detained at a West Bank checkpoint.\nA Palestinian autopsy said Omar Assad, 78, had underlying health conditions, but had suffered a heart attack caused by 'external violence.'\nIt said doctors found bruises on his head, redness on his wrists from being bound and bleeding in his eyelids from being tightly blindfolded. A military investigation said that Israeli soldiers assumed that Assad was asleep when they cut off the cables binding his hands. They didn't offer medical help when they saw that he was unresponsive and left the scene without checking to see if he was alive.\nAdvertisement\nAssad had lived in the U.S. for four decades. After an outcry from the U.S. government, the Israeli military said the incident 'was a grave and unfortunate event, resulting from moral failure and poor decision-making on the part of the soldiers.' It said one officer was reprimanded and two other officers reassigned to non-commanding roles, over the incident.\nBut the army decided against criminal prosecution, saying military investigators could not directly link their actions to the death of the U.S. citizen.\nHuman rights groups long have argued that Israel rarely holds soldiers accountable for the deaths of Palestinians.\nInvestigators said soldiers were forced to restrain Assad because of his 'aggressive resistance.' Assad's family has expressed skepticism that the behavior of an ailing 78-year-old could justify such harsh treatment.\nAdvertisement\nAmid the uproar with the U.S., Israel moved Netzah Yehuda out of the West Bank in late 2022 and reassigned it to northern Israel. The battalion was moved to the southern border with Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack triggered the ongoing war.\nIn a statement Sunday, the army said its Netzah Yehuda soldiers 'are currently participating in the war effort in the Gaza Strip.'\n'The battalion is professionally and bravely conducting operations in accordance to the IDF Code of Ethics and with full commitment to international law,' it said. It said that if the unit is sanctioned, 'its consequences will be reviewed.'\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that he had made a decision on reviews of allegations that several Israeli military units had violated conditions for receiving U.S. assistance outlined in the so-called Leahy Law and that they would soon be made public.\nAdvertisement\nTwo U.S. officials familiar with the situation said the U.S. announcement could come as soon as Monday.\nThe officials said about five Israeli units were investigated and all but one had been found to have taken action to remedy the violations. The Leahy Law, named for former Sen. Patrick Leahy, bars U.S. aid from going to foreign military units that have committed human rights abuses.\nA reservist in the Netzah Yehuda unit, Sgt. Maj. Nadav Nissim Miranda, said the Assad death was 'an unfortunate incident' but also an aberration. He told Channel 12 TV that targeting the battalion would hurt efforts to encourage religious men to enlist.\nBut Yesh Din, an Israeli legal advocacy group, said the case was not isolated. It said one out of every five soldiers convicted of harming Palestinians or their property since 2010 comes from Netzah Yehuda, making it the unit with the highest conviction rate for such cases.\nAdvertisement\nThe U.S. review was launched before the Hamas war and not connected to recent Israeli actions inside Gaza or the West Bank \u2014 which has experienced a dramatic spike in deadly violence since the Gaza war erupted. The U.S. has also recently imposed sanctions against violent settlers.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nGadi Shamni, a retired general who once served as the military's commander over the West Bank, said a main problem with the unit is that it was traditionally assigned exclusively to the West Bank. Violence between troops and Palestinians and settlers and Palestinians has surged there in recent years. In contrast, he said other units regularly rotate in and out of the volatile area.\nHe said the exposure to nonstop friction and violence had caused a level of 'tiredness' among the troops. Nonetheless, he said it was a stereotype to punish the entire unit and it would have been better to target specific individuals or commanders.\nAdvertisement\nBut Ori Givati, the director of advocacy at Breaking the Silence, an Israeli group of former combat soldiers critical of Israel's occupation, said the problems run much deeper than any particular unit.\nHe said abuses of power by soldiers toward Palestinians are systematic and the lack of repercussions for wrongdoings are fueling incidents like the death of Assad.\nIsraeli hard-liners blasted the expected U.S. decision. Israel's ultranationalist national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, said the U.S. crossed a 'red line,' and Tally Gotliv, a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, accused the U.S. of antisemitism.\nBut even the head of the opposition, former Prime Minister Yair Lapid, rejected the move.\nHe said the sanctions are 'a mistake and we must act to cancel them.' He noted that 'the source of the problem is not at the military level but at the political level.'\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Josef Federman","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TNY3J5QAAYI67DVMHHDNZNM6WU.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.1563005,"_id":"64c82fedaf0a5dea58c7f4a07285a0e7"},{"title":"Pentagon leaders press Congress for Ukraine funding, saying battlefield situation is dire","author":"Lolita C.

CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. 'I'll just tell you that Ukraine right now is facing some dire battlefield conditions.'\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin, seated alongside Brown, told lawmakers that time matters.\n'We're already seeing things on the battlefield begin to shift a bit in Russia's favor. We are seeing them make incremental gains. We're seeing the Ukrainians be challenged in terms of holding the line,' he said.\nAdvertisement\nTheir grim assessments came as House Republicans wrangle over the $95 billion foreign aid bill that the Senate passed in February. That legislation provides funding for Ukraine, Israel and other allies, as well as humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza and Ukraine and replenishment cash for the U.S. military to replace weapons sent to Ukraine.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson was forging ahead Wednesday toward votes later this week on the funding, even as he risks losing his leadership post in the bitterly divided Republican caucus.\nMembers of the House panel lamented the gridlock that has stalled the foreign aid, but several said they are hopeful the legislation will begin to move.\nRep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., noted the 'chilling' comments by Gen. Christopher Cavoli, the top U.S. military commander for Europe last week. He told the committee that Ukraine will be outgunned 10 to one by Russia within a matter of weeks if Congress doesn't approve the funding.\nAdvertisement\n'Without the United States assistance, Ukraine will literally run out of ammunition and more civilians in Ukraine will be murdered by Russia,' McCollum said.\nBrown told lawmakers that Israel also critically needs support in the bill, including air defense interceptors and munitions to defend itself following Iran's attack over the weekend. Iran launched about 300 missiles and drones toward Israel on Saturday, but the vast majority were shot down by Israeli defenses or U.S. and other allies. The attack came less than two weeks after a suspected Israeli strike in Syria killed two Iranian generals in an Iranian consular building.\nThe funding issue dominated the hearing, including its impact on the U.S. military and defense companies scattered across 30 states. The Pentagon's comptroller, Michael McCord, said the Defense Department has already spent about $2 billion for military operations in Europe and the Middle East to ensure troops and allies there are secure.\nAdvertisement\nSome of that includes the movement of Navy ships to help protect Israel over the weekend and the extended deployment of ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to safeguard commercial and military vessels being targeted by Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen.\nWithout the supplemental funding, McCord said the $2 billion would have to be absorbed by the base budget and shifted from other spending on things like facilities and equipment maintenance.\n'So there is an impact on our forces and our readiness as well if we cannot get the supplemental approved,' he said.\nAustin also repeated a selling point that defense leaders have been making to lawmakers over the past several months: The funding bill will directly help the American defense industry that is building Abrams tanks, ammunition and other weapons and equipment.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Lolita C.

It 'is something that would flow from the result of those negotiations.'\nAnything that gets in the way 'makes it more difficult to have those negotiations' and doesn't help move toward a two-state solution where Israel and Palestine live side by side in peace, which 'we all want,' Wood told reporters.\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas first delivered the Palestinian Authority's application for U.N. membership to then-Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in 2011. That initial bid failed because the Palestinians didn't get the required minimum support of nine of the Security Council's 15 members.\nEven if they did, the U.S. promised to veto any council resolution endorsing Palestinian membership \u2014 and it will do so again Thursday if the Algerian-drafted resolution recommending membership gets at least nine 'yes' votes.\nAdvertisement\nUnder the U.N. Charter, the Security Council must recommend membership to the 193-member General Assembly, where there are no vetoes, for a final vote.\nAfter the Palestinians' initial bid for full U.N. membership was rejected, they went to the General Assembly and by more than a two-thirds majority succeeded in having their status raised from a U.N. observer to a non-member observer state in November 2012. That opened the door for the Palestinian territories to join U.N. and other international organizations, including the International Criminal Court.\nThe Palestinians revived their bid for U.N. membership in early April, backed by 140 countries that have recognized Palestine as an independent state.\nZiad Abu Amr, special representative of the Palestinian president, said adopting the resolution will grant the Palestinian people hope 'for a decent life within an independent state.'\nAdvertisement\nHe said such 'hope has dissipated over the past years because of the intransigence of the Israeli government that has rejected this solution publicly and blatantly, especially following the destructive war against the Gaza Strip.'\nHe stressed to the Security Council that it won't be an alternative 'for serious negotiations that are time-bound to implement the two-state solution' and U.N. resolutions, and to resolve pending issues between Palestinians and Israelis.\nAmr asked the U.S. and other countries opposed to its U.N. membership how that could damage prospects for peace or harm international peace and security when they already recognize Israel and approved its U.N. membership.\n'To grant the state of Palestine full membership will be an important pillar to achieve peace in our region, because the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and its different dimensions now goes beyond the borders of Palestine and Israel and impacts other regions in the Middle East and around the world,' the Palestinian envoy said.\nAdvertisement\nIsraeli-Palestinian negotiations have been stalled for years, and Israel's right-wing government is dominated by hard-liners who oppose Palestinian statehood.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIsraeli U.N.

But there are also a few differences with the Senate bill designed to win over some House conservatives.\nHere's a look at what is in the bills that Johnson hopes to pass by this weekend.\nUKRAINE\nThe aid to support Ukraine totals about $61 billion. Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee said that more than a third of that amount would be dedicated to replenishing weapons and ammunition systems for the U.S. military.\nThe overall amount of money provided to Ukraine for the purchase of weapons from the U.S. is roughly the same in the House and Senate bills \u2014 $13.8 billion.\nAdvertisement\nThe main difference between the two packages is that the House bill provides more than $9 billion in economic assistance to Ukraine in the form of 'forgivable loans.' The Senate bill included no such provision seeking repayment.\nThe president would be authorized to set the terms of the loan to Ukraine and also be given the power to cancel it. Congress could override the cancellation but would have to generate enough votes to override a veto, a high bar considering how the two chambers are so evenly divided.\nJohnson, as he seeks GOP support for the package, noted that former President Donald Trump has endorsed a 'loan concept.'\nHe also noted that the House package includes a requirement for the Biden administration to provide a plan and a strategy to Congress for what it seeks to achieve in Ukraine. The plan would be required within 45 days of the bill being signed into law. House Republicans frequently complain that they have yet to see a strategy from Biden for winning the war.\nAdvertisement\nThe bill said the report from the administration must be a multiyear plan that spells out 'specific and achievable objectives.' It also asked for an estimate of the resources required to achieve the U.S. objectives and a description of the national security implications if the objectives are not met.\nISRAEL\nAid in the legislation to support Israel and provide humanitarian relief to citizens of Gaza comes to more than $26 billion. The amount of money dedicated to replenishing Israel's missile defense systems totals about $4 billion in the House and Senate bills. An additional $2.4 billion for current U.S. military operations in the regions is also the same in both bills.\nSome conservatives have been critical of the aid for Gaza. At the end of the day, though, Johnson risked losing critical Democratic support for the package if Republicans had excluded it. The humanitarian assistance comes to more than $9 billion for Gaza, where millions of Palestinians face starvation, lack of clean water and disease outbreaks.\nINDO-PACIFIC","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Kevin Freking","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GBTLSCX5BUI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":6.1139374,"_id":"1b9333b74ddc07b53a951be55c99960b"},{"title":"EU leaders wanted to talk competitiveness.

And if Israel retaliates, Raisi pledged 'they will be dealt with fiercely and severely.'\nYet after analyzing the munitions used in Saturday's assault and the success of regional defense systems, researchers say it's unclear how Iran could inflict greater damage on Israel through conventional military means.\n'Iran basically threw everything it had that could reach Israel's territory,' said John Krzyzaniak, a researcher who studies Iran's missile programs at the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control. Like other analysts interviewed for this story, he has spent the past several days studying launch videos, imagery of debris and interception information to identify the Iranian munitions.\nAdvertisement\nHis conclusion is that Tehran 'used some of every system they have.' And experts said it made sense that the Sejjil-1 and Shahab-3 missiles were excluded from the attack.\nShahab-3 'wasn't used because it's so old,' said Fabian Hinz, an Iran analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Berlin. 'The Sejjil is a bit of a mysterious missile,' he continued, adding that Iran has 'used it very very little during maneuvers.'\nOther analysts noted the Sejjil was expensive to produce and may no longer be in production.\nThe quantity of munitions used also provides new insights into Iran's capabilities. The deployment of over 100 ballistic missiles in a single wave suggests that previous estimates that Iran has about 3,000 ballistic missiles stockpiled are likely accurate, and could even be on the low end.\nAdvertisement\n'If this is just round one of an unknown number of rounds to come, you wouldn't fire a significant fraction of what you have just in the first round,' said Krzyzaniak.\nThe firing of over 100 ballistic missiles in the space of a few minutes suggests Iran has at least 100 launchers, he added, a new data point for researchers.\n'This shows that Iran has really faced no limitation in domestically producing missiles and launchers,' he said.\nIran's ballistic missile arsenal, the largest of any country in the Middle East, is almost entirely homegrown. In recent years Iran has demonstrated the ability to upgrade some systems, improving their range and precision.\nThe spokesman for Iran's armed forces, Abolfazl Shekarchi, said the munitions used in the strikes against Israel only represented 'a fraction of' the country's military's might, according to a statement published on state-run media.\nAdvertisement\nThe evolution of Iran's\nmissile program\nScud\n1980s\nIn the mid-1980s, Tehran acquired Scud missiles from Libya, Syria and North Korea and also began adapting the technology for their own missile variants.

Israel's military said 99 percent of the missiles and drones launched by Iran were intercepted or failed to launch.\n'We saw that accuracy and precision are a work in progress,' said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who has written extensively about Iran's missile program. 'These weapons alone won't win a war for Iran.'\nAdvertisement\nIranian drones made up the first wave of the attack. Cheap, effective and easy to produce, Iranian drones have been used in attacks across the Middle East for years. Iran has also supplied drones to Russia for its war in Ukraine, where they have been deadly.\nDuring the attack on Israel, the slow-moving drones were likely deployed to occupy air defenses and allow more advanced munitions to get through. All the drones were shot down before entering Israeli airspace, the IDF said.\nAli Hamie, a Lebanese military analyst, said Iran had likely gleaned important lessons about Israel's aerial defenses. Commentators on Iranian state television have made similar points.\n'It could be a testing attack,' Hamie said, 'and the Iranians got what they want. Making it past the air defenses is not only a symbolic victory, but real victory.'\nAdvertisement\nOne of the few missiles to make it through the interceptors hit an Israeli air base in the Negev desert.

But ultimately the kind of approach demonstrated in Saturday's attack 'is not really sustainable over a long-term conflict.'\nEven if Iran changed the tempo of attacks and adjusted the munitions used 'they would still have to launch quite a lot of stuff for just a few [munitions] to get through,' he said.\nAdvertisement\nSome Iranian officials have suggested they have held back their most dangerous weapons.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'We are prepared to use weapons we have never used before. We have plans for every scenario,' said Abolfazl Amoui, a parliamentary national security spokesman, in an interview with Lebanese broadcaster Mayadeen.\nBut analysts say it's unlikely that any one type of munition could be a game changer. Rather, it's more likely Iran would use the same kinds of munitions in a future attack, but in a different way: giving less warning, or launching the barrage in concert with allied militant groups in the region.

Officials in Kyiv watched Saturday as a barrage of Iranian missiles and drones targeting Israel were intercepted both by the Jewish state's sophisticated missile defense system and the combined efforts of a coalition of Western and Arab partners. U.S. batteries on the ground in the region, warplanes and naval destroyers whirred into action to thwart an assault on a non-NATO ally, ensuring that Iran's strike caused minimal damage.

Britain, France and Jordan stepped in to help too.\nAnd then the Ukrainians considered their own predicament, locked in more than two years of a full-blown war with their larger, invading neighbor. Away from the front lines, Russia has launched wave upon wave of relentless, indiscriminate drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, hitting shopping areas, power plants and residential blocks.\nAdvertisement\n'The whole world saw that Israel was not alone in this defense \u2014 the threat in the sky was also being eliminated by its allies,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said after the weekend's events. 'And when Ukraine says that its allies should not turn a blind eye to Russian missiles and drones, it means action is needed \u2014 a bold one.'\nZelensky had further reason for frustration Wednesday after Russian cruise missiles hit the downtown area of the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv. The strike \u2014 one of the deadliest single attacks carried out in recent months by Russia \u2014 killed at least 17 people and injured more than 60 others. 'This would not have happened if Ukraine had received enough air defense equipment and if the world's determination to counter Russian terror was also sufficient,' Zelensky wrote on Telegram. 'There needs to be sufficient commitment from partners and sufficient support to reflect it.'\nIn the aftermath of the attack on Chernihiv, which is close to the Russian border, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba lamented that his country lacked what was so readily provided for Israel. 'These innocent people would not have been killed or injured if Ukraine had sufficient air defense capabilities,' Kuleba wrote on social media. 'Three days ago in the Middle East, we saw what reliable protection of human lives from missiles looks like.'\nA Russian missile attack killed more than a dozen people in Chernihiv, Ukraine, on April 17, according to local officials. (Video: Reuters)\nWith a vital tranche of U.S. aid still stalled in Congress, Kyiv is desperate for help. Its artillery units face acute shortages of shells. Its exhausted battalions grapple with a lack of fresh recruits. And its political leaders issue pleas to the West for more fighter jets and missile defense systems to cope with Russia's aerial onslaughts.\nWith a vital tranche of U.S. aid still stalled in Congress, Kyiv is desperate for help.

And its political leaders issue pleas to the West for more fighter jets and missile defense systems to cope with Russia's aerial onslaughts.\nAdvertisement\nUkraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, is among the places bearing the brunt of these attacks. Some 30 miles from the border with Russia and once almost captured by Russian forces, Kharkiv has endured a spike in Russian bombardments since the end of last year. 'The city has been on the receiving end of more ballistic missiles than at any time since the start of the war. Drone assaults have become more frequent: they fly faster and higher, and have a carbon wing-coating that makes shooting them down harder,' noted the Economist.\nRussia has also been able to dispatch warplanes to drop payloads of Soviet-era glide bombs over the city. Ukrainians understandably want help to counter such attacks, which have this year in the region killed dozens of civilians and targeted civilian infrastructure, including power plants. 'We need that support to prevent Kharkiv being a second Aleppo,' Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov told Britain's Guardian newspaper, likening his city's ordeal to what befell the Syrian metropolis a decade ago.\nThe odds are not in Ukraine's favor. A report published Monday by the Institute for the Study of War noted that Israel's successful defense against Iran's attack 'underscores the vulnerabilities that Ukrainian geography and the continued degradation of Ukraine's air defense umbrella pose for Ukrainian efforts to defend against regular Russian missile and drone strikes.'\nAdvertisement\nThen there's the uncertainty about what may come from the West. In Washington, efforts by U.S. lawmakers to push through a spending bill on Ukraine gained traction Wednesday. In Europe, senior German officials announced an initiative to rush air defense equipment to Kyiv's forces. 'We and our partners around the world must now be just as resolute in our defense against Russian terror from the air,' German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said ahead of the Group of 7 ministerial meeting on the Italian island of Capri. 'Stronger air defenses are a matter of life and death for thousands of people in Ukraine and the best protection for our own security.'\nThen there's the uncertainty about what may come from the West.

'That would be a danger of escalation.'\nOther European diplomats feel Ukraine's outrage more keenly. 'During Iran's attack against Israel, some Western countries contributed to protecting Israeli skies as an important act of solidarity,' Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told Politico. 'Kyiv keeps requesting the same type of protection from the same group of countries for more than two years now. I am sure that Ukraine will raise an argument that if one non-NATO country has been provided with air defense when attacked by a hostile adversary, why should Ukraine be treated differently?

We cannot allow Vladimir Putin to roll through another country and take it,' he said about the Russian president's invasion of Ukraine. 'These are very serious matters with global implications.'\nAdvertisement\nAfter months of delay, the House worked slowly but deliberately once Johnson made up his mind this week to plough ahead. President Joe Biden sent a swift endorsement of the speaker's plan and, in a rare moment, Donald Trump, the Republican presumed presidential nominee who opposes most overseas aid for Ukraine, has not derailed the speaker's work.\n'The world is watching what the Congress does,' the White House said in a statement. 'Passing this legislation would send a powerful message about the strength of American leadership at a pivotal moment.'\nIn an extremely rare step, the members of the House Rules Committee joined forces late Thursday in a near midnight vote, the four Democrats giving their support on a procedural step, to push past the Republican majority's three hardline holdouts to send the package to the House floor for debate on a 9-3 vote. It was a moment unseen in recent House memory.\nAdvertisement\nJohnson will need to rely on Democrats again Friday to clear the next procedural vote and turn back amendments Republicans have offered that could kill the package. One from hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene would reduce spending for Ukraine to zero.\nGreene has filed the 'motion to vacate' the speaker from office, and has drawn at least one other Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky as a co-sponsor. It could launch a bid to evict Johnson from the speaker's office, should she call it up for a vote, much the way Republicans booted Kevin McCarthy from the position last fall.\nWith one of the most narrow House majorities in modern times, Johnson can only afford to lose a single vote or two from his Republican ranks to pass any bill. That dynamic has thrust him into the arms of Democrats as he searches for votes to pass the package.\nAdvertisement\nWithout his Republican majority fully behind him, Johnson cannot shape the package as the ultra-conservatives demand lest he lose Democratic backing. It has forced him to leave behind tough security measures to clamp down on migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border and other priorities.\nAt best, Johnson has been able to carve up a Senate-passed version of the bill into separate parts, as is the preference among House Republicans, and the final votes will be on distinct measures \u2014 for Ukraine, Israel and Indo-Pacific allies.\nThe package would also include a fourth provision that includes many Republican priorities that Democrats endorse, or at least are willing to accept. Those include proposals that allow the U.S. to seize frozen Russian central bank assets to rebuild Ukraine; impose sanctions on Iran, Russia, China and criminal organizations that traffic fentanyl, and potentially ban the video app TikTok if its China-based owner doesn't sell its stake within a year.\nAdvertisement\nPassing each bill, in votes expected Saturday, will require Johnson to form complicated bipartisan coalitions on each, with Democrats for example ensuring Ukraine aid is approved, but some left-leaning progressives refusing to back military aid for Israel over the destruction of Gaza.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Lisa Mascaro,Stephen Groves,Kevin Freking","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EZISKPX6LEI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.7808604,"_id":"39582bf6fef670ac0154996a1c7ab279"},{"title":"Biden's handling of Gaza shakes his support in the Black community","author":"Cleve R.

Others see Trump as a far bigger threat.","summary":"PHILADELPHIA \u2014 The symbolic mix of soul food and Palestinian dishes had been eaten to conclude the Ramadan fast, and remarks from Palestinian Americans about the war in Gaza had just wrapped up at the Masjidullah community center when Suad Islam stepped to a microphone seeking some political advice.\n'This presidential election is very disappointing. Is there a candidate that you would suggest that we vote for? Because I don't know any Muslim that could vote for Biden,' said Islam, who is Black and a lifelong Philadelphia resident. 'Who should we vote for? I'm just very disappointed.'\nIslam, who has lived in Philadelphia since the 1970s, has voted in every election since she was 18, almost always for Democrats. She picked President Biden over former president Donald Trump in 2020, and even volunteered at a polling place. But she said she cannot fathom punching a ballot for Biden again, not with more than 33,000 dead in Gaza, many of them fellow Muslims.\nAdvertisement\n'The economy, the crime rate. I want to cry every time I go to the gas station,' Islam said in an interview, ticking off the things that are on her mind as she mulls voting in November. 'It's just a whole bunch of stuff that's going on. It's disappointing. But of course, this war is at the top of my list.'\nAs the Gaza war enters its seventh month, some Black Americans say Biden's handling of the conflict makes them question whether he deserves a second term, according to interviews with nearly two dozen voters, opinion leaders and activists working through a political and moral conundrum in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.\nFor some, the conflagration 6,000 miles away has already changed their vote, edging out domestic concerns such as the economy, inflation and crime. Others say the war in the Middle East, which has already cost thousands of lives and has a region on the brink of famine, mirrors other tragedies afflicting people of color \u2014 and that Biden's support for what they see as a moral disaster should have consequences at the ballot box.\nshould have consequences at the ballot box.\nAdvertisement\nStill others see the biggest threat as something else entirely: another Trump presidency.\nWhere these voters ultimately land could play an outsize role in who occupies the White House next year. Pennsylvania is one of a handful of battleground states that both Republicans and Democrats see as pivotal to winning the presidency. In 2020, Biden won the state by just over 80,000 votes, including a 4-to-1 margin in heavily Black Philadelphia. But there are signs that the coalition that elected him is fragmenting.\nIn a nod to the importance of the state and its largest, most diverse city, Biden has been to Philadelphia more than 20 times as president \u2014 more than anywhere else except his hometown of Wilmington. Biden is spending most of this week in Pennsylvania: two days in Scranton, where he was partially raised, a day in Pittsburgh and Thursday in Philadelphia.\nAdvertisement\nBut even while he visits their city, some Black Philadelphians are focused on how his policies are playing out half a world away.\n'I want the president to get it right because it's right. That's the first reason, but beyond that, there is a political ramification if he does not get it right,' said Rev. Mark Tyler, the senior pastor of Mother Bethel AME Church, who is planning to attend the Democratic National Convention this summer. He said he's lost count of the number of conversations he's had with parishioners about the Middle East conflict.\n'And to think that this (conflict) is not going to have an impact on Black voters in particular, who connect with this story in a way that maybe other Americans cannot \u2014 it would be a mistake to think that it won't be a problem going into November,' Tyler said.\nAdvertisement\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza after Hamas militants rampaged through the Israel-Gaza border fence and killed 1,200 people, many of them civilians, and took 250 others hostage. In response, Israel has commenced a military campaign that has devastated much of the enclave while severely restricting humanitarian aid.\nComplicating matters, last weekend Iran launched a salvo of rockets and drones into Israel in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian consulate in Syria. Most of the weapons were shot down by Israel and its allies, but the episode has raised fears of a broader conflict.\nSupporters of Israel reject the notion that its incursion into Gaza is racist or mirrors American racial dynamics. Rather, they say, the 150-year-old Arab-Israeli conflict is rooted in a territorial dispute between two groups with historical ties to the same land. The country's backers also note that Jews themselves have been victims through history, and giving them a safe haven is a central reason for Israel's existence.\nAdvertisement\nBut as the Gaza war has raged on, Biden and other Democrats have faced protesters at virtually all of their public events, over the Palestinian death toll. In Scranton on Tuesday, after Biden gave a campaign speech on tax policy, the president's motorcade was met by protesters chanting, 'Biden Biden, you can't hide. We charge you with genocide,' and 'Welcome home, Scranton Joe \u2014 make sure Gazans have a home also.' Demonstrators also shouted at Biden as he visited his childhood home.\nIn several states, Muslims and Arab Americans have organized movements urging members of their communities \u2014 as well as people of color, liberals and others dissatisfied with Biden's support of Israel \u2014 to choose 'uncommitted' in Democratic primaries, an effort that notched more than 100,000 votes in Michigan.\nFor seven months, organizers in Philadelphia have been stoking a similar movement in advance of Pennsylvania's April 23 Democratic primary. They contend that Israel's military onslaught resembles other racist oppression that called for a global moral response: Jim Crow in the American South, or apartheid in South Africa.\nAdvertisement\nThat sentiment has resulted in a growing link between Black and Arab American activists.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBlack Americans 'have been struggling through this for many, many years,' said Osama Al-Qasem, who directs the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. 'They understand what we're going through, and therefore they empathize and sympathize and support our struggle, as well. So the built-in relationship becomes a hub we leverage.'\nBiden has made racial justice a central tenet of his administration, and as his reelection campaign intensifies he has highlighted the strides Black Americans have made during his presidency. Putting Trump back in the White House, he and his surrogates argue, would stymie that progress.\nBiden has stressed that he needs Black voters to help put him in the White House again. but recent polls have shown declining support among the demographic, particularly in battleground states that will probably swing the election.\nSome 92 percent of Black voters picked Biden over Trump in 2020. A Wall Street Journal poll of swing states, however, found that 57 percent of Black men planned to vote for Biden in the 2024 election, while 30 percent said they were likely to vote for Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.\nAdvertisement\nSimilarly, 11 percent of Black women in the 2020 poll said they would 'definitely' or 'probably' vote for Trump, compared to 6 percent of Black women who voted for him in 2020.\nBiden's campaign announced in August that it was spending $25 million to reach key voters in battleground states, including what it called the largest and earliest investment in Black media for a reelection campaign in history. Those ads highlight Biden's efforts to close the racial wealth gap and note that he has presided over the lowest Black unemployment rate in history.\nIn addition Biden launched a pair of ads last month aimed at Black voters in battleground states, touting his administration's pandemic relief checks and its successful effort to cap the price of insulin at $35 a month.\n'At both the national and state level, this campaign is committed to engaging with Black voters earlier and more often than any other campaign to date,' Kellan White, a senior adviser in Pennsylvania for Biden-Harris 2024 and a Philadelphia native, said in a statement.\nBiden's defenders say critics have a dangerously myopic view of the conflict in the Middle East, and that efforts to turn Black voters away from Biden will play directly into the hands of Trump, who would be far worse for both Black Americans and Palestinians.\nAdvertisement\nBiden is handling the Gaza war as best he can, they add. 'You can't solve the problem of the Middle East as a purist or idealist,' said Marshall Mitchell, a pastor at Salem Baptist Church of Abington, a Black church in Montgomery County, Pa. 'They don't understand the power of quiet diplomacy. And they're going to force a hand, and then you won't be able to turn Pennsylvania back.'\nAt the mosque and community center where Islam voiced her electoral concerns, many who came to learn about the Palestinian cause acknowledged that it was just one of the issues that would affect Black voters' decisions.\nSalima Suswell, leader of the Black Muslim Leadership Council and one of the organizers of the cross-cultural event, said she feels a connection to the suffering of those in Gaza who share her faith. But she said she also understands that it may be difficult for people to sublimate their own self-interest to make a political point, even on such a searing issue.\n'Some folks feel that there are domestic issues that require priority, like gun violence in a city like Philadelphia, where Black Muslim children are being murdered,' Suswell said. 'So many people feel like we need a cease-fire right here in our city. And to some level, there is some frustration also with people who feel that Trump is a huge threat to our community.'\nSuswell was one of a handful of Muslim leaders invited to the White House this month to discuss the war in Gaza and other issues. She has also hosted events in her hometown aimed at helping Black Philadelphians understand the plight of Palestinians and what the community can do to influence U.S. policy.\nOthers are disenchanted with the notion that they must choose between two parties whose policies toward Israel may not be substantively different.\n'I think there's a recognition that neither the Democrats nor Republicans are really representing our interests. They're not representing Black interests. They're not representing the interests of poor and working-class folks,' said Melina Abdullah, who recently became the running mate of third-party presidential candidate Cornel West.\nIn 2015, she and other founding members of Black Lives Matter issued a statement of solidarity with Palestinians. 'We don't have to take a lesser-of-two-evils approach,' Abdullah said. 'Lesser of two evils is still evil.'\nIn contrast, Rahima Abdullah, 67, a lifelong Philadelphia resident, said the events of the past six months have not deterred her desire to vote for Biden. Voting 'uncommitted' or staying home 'is a vote for Trump,' she added.\n'I just feel like we've got to do it,' she said of voting for Biden. 'And then we've got to pray.'\nScott Clement and Yasmeen Abutaleb in Washington contributed to this report.\nScott Clement and Yasmeen Abutaleb in Washington contributed to this report.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Cleve R.

Our brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers are still in captivity and we need to release them,' Gat said.\nOn Monday, Jews around the world will begin celebrating the weeklong Passover holiday, recounting the biblical story of their exodus from Egypt after hundreds of years of slavery. But for many Israelis, it's hard to fathom a celebration of freedom when friends and family are not free.\nAdvertisement\nThe Hamas attack killed some 1,200 people, while about 250 others were taken hostage. About half were released in a weeklong cease-fire in November, while the rest remain in Gaza, more than 30 of them believed to be dead.\nFor many Jews, Passover is a time to reunite with family and recount the exodus from Egypt at a meal known as the Seder. Observant Jews avoid grains, known as chametz, a reminder of the unleavened bread the Israelites ate when they fled Egypt quickly with no time for dough to rise.\nBut this year many families are torn about how \u2014 or even if \u2014 to celebrate.\nWhen Hamas attacked Kibbutz Be'eri, Gat, his wife, 3-year-old daughter, parents and sister hid for hours in their rocket-proof safe room. But fighters entered the house and killed or abducted everyone inside, except for his father who hid in the bathroom. His mother was dragged into the street and shot.\nAdvertisement\nGat, his arms and legs bound, was shoved into a car with his wife and daughter. During a brief stop, they managed to flee. Knowing he could run faster, Roman-Gat handed him their daughter. Gat escaped with her, hiding in a ditch for nearly nine hours. His wife was recaptured and held in Gaza for 54 days.\nPassover this year will be more profound as freedom has taken on a new meaning, Roman-Gat told The Associated Press.\n'To feel wind upon your face with your eyes closed. To shower. To go to the toilet without permission, and with the total privacy and privilege to take as long as I please with no one urging me, waiting for me at the other side to make sure I'm still theirs,' she said in a text message.\nStill, Passover will be overshadowed by deep sorrow and worry for her sister-in-law and the other hostages, she said. The family will mark the holiday with a low-key dinner in a restaurant, without celebration.\nAdvertisement\nAs hard as it is in times of pain, Jews have always sought to observe holidays during persecution, such as in concentration camps during the Holocaust, said Rabbi Martin Lockshin, professor emeritus at Canada's York University, who lives in Jerusalem.\n'They couldn't celebrate freedom but they could celebrate the hope of freedom,' he said.\nThe crisis affects more than the hostage families. The war, in which 260 soldiers have been killed, casts a shadow over a normally joyous holiday. The government has also scaled back festivities for Independence Day in May in light of the mood and fearing public protests.\nLikewise, the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, capped by the three-day Eid al-Fitr feast, was a sad, low-key affair for Palestinians. Over 80% of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced by the fighting, and Hamas health officials say nearly 34,000 people have been killed in the Israeli offensive.\nAdvertisement\nThe scenes of suffering, devastation and hunger in Gaza have received little attention in Israel, where much of the public and national media remain heavily focused on the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack and ongoing war.\nAfter several months of fits and starts, negotiations on a deal to release the remaining hostages appears at a standstill \u2014 making it unlikely they will be home for Passover.\nThe hostages' pain has reverberated around the world, with some in the Jewish diaspora asking rabbis for prayers specifically for the hostages and Israel to be said at this year's Seder. Others have created a new Haggadah, the book read during the Seder, to reflect the current reality.\nNoam Zion, the author of the new Haggadah, has donated 6,000 copies to families impacted by the war.\n'The Seder is supposed to help us to relive past slavery and liberation from Egypt and to learn its lessons, but in 2024 it must also ask contemporary questions about the confusing and traumatic present and most important, generate hope for the future,' said Zion, emeritus member of the faculty of Jewish studies at the Hartman Institute in Jerusalem.\nAdvertisement\nThe revised Haggadah includes excerpts from hostage families urging people not to hate despite their pain. It offers a guide for navigating the mixed feelings during the holiday, while posing existential questions about the Jews and the state of Israel.\nSome families say it's too painful to celebrate at all.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe girlfriend of Nirit Lavie Alon's son was abducted from the Nova music festival. Two months later the family was informed by Israel's military that Inbar Haiman, a 27-year-old graffiti artist, was dead, her body still in Gaza.\n'It's impossible to celebrate a freedom holiday,' said Alon. Instead of being with family this year, she's going to spend a few days in the desert. There will be no closure until all of the hostages are back, including the remains of those who were killed, she said.\nAdvertisement\nAhead of Passover, some families are still holding out hope their relatives will be freed in time.\nShlomi Berger's 19-year-old daughter, Agam, was abducted two days after the start of her army service along the border with Gaza.\nVideos of her bloodied face emerged shortly after the Hamas attack, one showing an armed man pushing her into a truck, another showing her inside the vehicle with other hostages. The only proof of life he's had since was a call from a released hostage, wishing him happy birthday from Agam, who she'd been with in the tunnels, he said.\nStill, he refuses to give up hope.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Sam Mednick","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DCQIWCX5HQI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.627981,"_id":"f410d4881a3e8c0be3a74eb5c02030c3"},{"title":"House on the brink of approving Ukraine and Israel aid after months of struggle","author":"Stephen Groves","published_date":"2024-04-20 04:50:56","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/20/ukraine-aid-israel-tiktok-congress/92c08b92-fed1-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The House is preparing to vote on approval of $95 billion in foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 The House is preparing in a rare Saturday session to approve $95 billion in foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies, Democrats and Republicans joining together behind the legislation after a grueling months-long fight over renewed American support for repelling Russia's invasion into Ukraine.\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson \u2014 putting his job on the line \u2014 relied on Democratic support this week to set up a series of votes on three aid bills, as well as a fourth that contains several other foreign policy proposals. If the votes are successful, the package will go to the Senate, where passage in the coming days is nearly assured. President Joe Biden has promised to sign it immediately.\nPassage through the House would clear away the biggest hurdle to Biden's funding request, first made in October as Ukraine's military supplies began to run low. The GOP-controlled House, skeptical of U.S. support for Ukraine, struggled for months over what to do, first demanding that any assistance be tied to policy changes at the U.S. southern border \u2014 only to immediately reject a bipartisan Senate offer along those very lines.\nAdvertisement\nReaching an endgame has been an excruciating lift for Johnson that has tested both his resolve and his support among Republicans, with a small but growing number now openly urging his removal from the speaker's office. Yet congressional leaders cast the votes as a turning point in history \u2014 an urgent sacrifice as U.S. allies are beleaguered by wars and threats from continental Europe to the Middle East to Asia.\n'The only thing that has kept terrorists and tyrants at bay is the perception of a strong America, that we would stand strong,' Johnson said this week. 'And we will. I think that Congress is going to show that. This is a very important message that we are going to send the world.'\nStill, Congress has seen a stream of world leaders visit in recent months, from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, all but pleading with lawmakers to approve the aid. Globally, the delay left many questioning America's commitment to its allies.\nAdvertisement\nAt stake has also been one of Biden's top foreign policy priorities \u2014 halting Russian President Vladimir Putin's advance in Europe. After engaging in quiet talks with Johnson, the president quickly endorsed Johnson's plan this week, paving the way for Democrats to give their rare support to clear the procedural hurdles needed for a final vote.\n'It's long past time that we support our democratic allies in Israel, Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific and provide humanitarian assistance to civilians who are in harm's way in theaters of conflict like Gaza, Haiti and the Sudan,' House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said at a news conference Friday.\nVoting on the package is likely to create unusual alliances in the House. While aid for Ukraine will likely win a majority in both parties, a significant number of progressive Democrats are expected to vote against the bill aiding Israel as they demand an end to the bombardment of Gaza that has killed thousands of civilians.\nAdvertisement\nAt the same time, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has loomed large over the fight, weighing in from afar via social media statements and direct phone calls with lawmakers as he tilts the GOP to a more isolationist stance with his 'America First' brand of politics. Ukraine's defense once enjoyed robust, bipartisan support in Congress, but as the war enters its third year, a bulk of Republicans oppose further aid.\nAt one point in the months-long slog to get Ukraine assistance through Congress, Trump's opposition essentially doomed the bipartisan Senate proposal on border security. This week, Trump also issued a social media post that questioned why European nations were not giving more money to Ukraine, though he spared Johnson from criticism and said Ukraine's survival was important.\nStill, the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus has derided the legislation as the 'America Last' foreign wars package and urged lawmakers to defy Republican leadership and oppose it because the bills do not include border security measures.\nAdvertisement\nJohnson's hold on the speaker's gavel has also grown more tenuous in recent days as three Republicans, led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, supported a 'motion to vacate' that can lead to a vote on removing the speaker. A few more were expected to soon join, said Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who is urging Johnson to voluntarily step aside.\nThe speaker's office has been working furiously to whip up support for the bill, as well as for Johnson. It arranged a series of press calls in the lead-up to the final votes on the package, first with Jewish leaders, then with Christian groups, to show support for the speaker and the legislation he is bringing to the floor.\nAri Fleischer, a former White House press secretary under President George W. Bush, said it was about time the United States 'did something to support Israel, fight Vladimir Putin and stand up to China.'\nAdvertisement\n'Coming together like this is a refreshing reminder of the old days when foreign policy had bipartisan support,' he said.\nThe package includes several Republican priorities that Democrats endorse, or at least are willing to accept. Those include proposals that allow the U.S. to seize frozen Russian central bank assets to rebuild Ukraine; impose sanctions on Iran, Russia, China and criminal organizations that traffic fentanyl; and legislation to require the China-based owner of the popular video app TikTok to sell its stake within a year or face a ban in the United States.\nStill, the all-out push to get the bills through Congress is a reflection not only of politics, but realities on the ground in Ukraine. Top lawmakers on national security committees, who are privy to classified briefings, have grown gravely concerned about the situation in recent weeks. Russia has increasingly used satellite-guided gliding bombs \u2014 which allow planes to drop them from a safe distance \u2014 to pummel Ukrainian forces beset by a shortage of troops and ammunition.\nAdvertisement\n'I really do believe the intel and the briefings that we've gotten,' Johnson said, adding, 'I think that Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed.'\nA former ambassador to Ukraine under President George W. Bush, John Herbst, said the months-long delay in approving more American assistance has undoubtedly hurt Ukrainian troops on the battlefield.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Stephen Groves,Lisa Mascaro","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QUFX45X62EI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.626916,"_id":"a3d6d8ee3cb8d84c2ed2c12105681352"},{"title":"Iraq investigates a blast at a base of Iran-allied militias that killed 1.

Jack Reed (R.I.), a Democrat, is the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Sen. Roger Wicker (Miss.) is the ranking Republican of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Last year, Americans watched, transfixed, as a Chinese spy balloon the size of several school buses made its way across the United States before it was shot down by the Air Force off the coast of South Carolina.\nThis highly public event turned out to be the tip of an increasingly large iceberg. Several more aerial objects have been discovered, and recent reports suggest spy balloons are but a few of thousands of aerial incursions our country has faced. Most involve small pilotless aircraft flying at a very low altitude, sometimes only 100 feet off the ground.\nThese uncrewed aircraft systems, or UAS, pose multiple challenges: They have interfered with commercial flightpaths and crossed our southern border uncontested. Many have been identified flying over military bases and nuclear facilities, such as Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri and our test ranges in the western United States.\nAdvertisement\nService members deployed overseas are increasingly facing threats from these uncrewed systems, too. The three American soldiers targeted in an attack in Jordan this January lost their lives to a small Iranian UAS. These systems have become a significant security problem, for which the U.S. military has minimal countermeasures. Iran's attack on Israel this month only underscored the threat.\nIn classified briefings and open settings, our committee has examined the threat posed by high-altitude craft and low-altitude drones. We discovered a series of underlying issues complicating an effective response to them.\nThe first problem is that our nation lacks adequate drone detection capability. We still rely on the early warning radars that served us so well during the Cold War. Today, though, they are unable to detect, identify and track small aircraft at both high and low altitudes. Inside the United States, we can hardly track anything other than commercial aircraft. Almost none of our domestic military bases have the sensors to identify small drones.\nAdvertisement\nIf we fixed our tracking problem, though, a second issue would arise. U.S. agencies lack clear lines of authority about which agency is responsible for stopping these incursions. Instead, a dizzying maze of overlapping jurisdictions and inflexible bureaucracies confuses, rather than clarifies, crisis response. Government officials from an alphabet soup of agencies \u2014 Defense Department, Justice Department, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 spend hours if not days simply discussing who can take action when a UAS is identified. Too often, low-altitude incursions are treated as a law enforcement matter instead of as a national security issue.\nThe United States must launch a broad overhaul of its detection capabilities and streamline its ability to respond once a threat is identified. A third step would be to significantly boost our defensive capabilities against hostile UAS at our military bases overseas, nearly all of which lack counter-drone capabilities.\nIn Congress, we are working with military officials to give service members the detection methods, statutory authorities, and counter-drone tools they need to handle the unique size and volume of small drones.\nAdvertisement\nRecent versions of the National Defense Authorization Act have included protocol reviews, various reforms and some procurement of new counter-drone tools. But no strategies to date have solved this problem in a comprehensive, sustainable fashion.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nWe need a master plan that crosses all agencies. As Iran's attack on Israel proved, our adversaries see drones as an inexpensive, deadly solution to penetrate the most sophisticated layered air defenses. There is no reason to think the challenge is limited to the skies over Iraq and Israel; it could threaten the United States, and fast. That means U.S. policymakers have no time to spare in generating a better blueprint for defenses against drones.\nIn the meantime, our initial efforts to counter low-altitude drones have turned into an unnecessarily complex problem. At least a half dozen organizations across the Pentagon are developing and fielding counter-drone equipment, and many of these efforts overlap or are at cross-purposes. As we spend time moving in too many directions, our enemies are upgrading their drones, while our own counter-drone equipment remains ineffective. This could soon have deadly implications downrange on the battlefield, or \u2014 with the state of our domestic defenses \u2014 far closer to home.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jack Reed,Roger Wicker","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NBIMMRVO4II63MF2T5BEJRXF3I.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.593582,"_id":"47bc09025a4486d590b237daf491c00b"},{"title":"Friday briefing: Israel strikes Iran; Trump jurors; new Title IX rules; Taylor Swift's \u2018Tortured Poets Department'; and more","author":"Jamie Ross","published_date":"2024-04-19 10:30:17","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/the-seven/2024/04/19/what-to-know-for-april-19","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Catch up in minutes with these 7 stories.","summary":"Women are more likely to suffer from insomnia and say they have lower sleep quality, a new review of ongoing research shows.

But on a recent afternoon, security officers watched as people scanned their school IDs to get in: An unauthorized protest was about to happen.\nInside, a phalanx of students suddenly appeared alongside the school's administration building, marching in black with kaffiyehs covering their faces. Another masked group appeared on the other side, descending the stairs. Soon protesters were massed at the center of campus, holding signs with messages such as 'GLOBALIZE THE INTIFADA.'\nXavier Westergaard, a doctoral candidate in biology, walked through the pro-Palestinian group wearing a yarmulke evoking the bright blue and white of Israel's flag, sat down facing the protesters, and began reading psalms aloud.\nA few tried to drown out the rally with a bullhorn. An Israeli professor kept demanding that university officials monitoring the event explain why it wasn't being shut down. The campus had been warned that students could be disciplined for attending the unauthorized demonstration. Some had just been suspended for a previous event. But protesters kept coming.\n'We will honor all the martyrs!' a tightly masked speaker called out. Protesters spoke of the deadly bombing of a hospital in Gaza, and \u2014 using a phrase heard by some as a Palestinian rallying cry and by others as an outright call to annihilate Israel \u2014 chanted, 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!'\nAdvertisement\nSix months after the Hamas attack, tensions over the Israel-Gaza war remain raw on college campuses, and administrators continue to face questions over their responses to protests such as this one. At Columbia, a school with a long history of student activism, some are asking whether the school is now censoring and stifling freedom of expression \u2014 or has repeatedly failed to protect vulnerable students from hatred.\nOn Wednesday, focus on what's happening on the campus will intensify as Columbia President Minouche Shafik will face questions from lawmakers about whether the university has done enough to combat antisemitism.

And it effectively toppled the presidencies of two Ivy League universities: Within weeks, Penn and Harvard's presidents had resigned.\nAt a time of intense polarization, university leaders across the country are trying to strike a delicate balance to protect their academic mission: To allow people to speak their minds without harming others, and to cultivate listening as well as shouting.\nShafik declined a request for an interview. 'Columbia is committed to combating antisemitism,' a university spokesperson said, 'and we welcome the opportunity to discuss our work to protect and support Jewish students and keep our community safe.'\nTensions on campus\nAt Columbia, protests are far less frequent than they were immediately after the war began, and are confined by new rules. But they can still be hostile, pitting student against student. Some say there have been improvements to the campus culture this semester. Others say divisions are hardening, and rhetoric is becoming more extreme. Lawsuits have been filed against the university by both pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian groups.

Lawsuits have been filed against the university by both pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian groups. The Education Department has an open investigation.\nIt's intense, said Nicholas Lemann, dean emeritus of the Columbia Journalism School, one of three faculty members leading an antisemitism task force that has held listening sessions and made an initial set of recommendations. Issues from all over the world end up on campus, he said. ' But this particular issue has a unique ability to raise the temperature way past the boiling point more than any other.'\n'But this particular issue has a unique ability to raise the temperature way past the boiling point more than any other.'\nThe tensions extend far beyond Columbia. A study of thousands of college students by the University of Chicago found that, in surveys conducted in December and January, 56 percent of Jewish college students, 52 percent of Muslim college students and 16 percent of other college students felt they were in personal danger \u2014 suggesting that 2 to 3 million U.S. students have been living in fear.\nAt Yale University, students supporting Palestinians and divestment from weapons companies launched a hunger strike this weekend. Vanderbilt University expelled and suspended students earlier this month after a protest. The Center for Islamic Life at Rutgers University was vandalized.\nAt Columbia in recent years, debate over Israel and Palestine has included divestment campaigns, calls for the university to end partnerships in Tel Aviv, student government votes, and faculty letters and petitions on opposing sides.\nBut the Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the ferocity of Israel's response in Gaza ignited demonstrations that immediately felt all-consuming and very personal for some, further dividing groups of students, faculty and others, multiple people on campus said.\nA lawsuit filed earlier this year against Columbia and Barnard College argues that Columbia enforces policies to avoid protecting Jewish and Israeli students from harassment, and hires professors who support anti-Jewish violence and spread antisemitic propaganda. Barnard is both an independent educational institution and a college of Columbia.\nAdvertisement\nDavid M. Schizer, a professor of law and economics who is helping to lead the antisemitism task force, said Columbia has mostly been exceptionally welcoming to Jewish and Israeli students and all others \u2014 but there have been challenges, and those were exacerbated by the war. In one case, Schizer said, a\nlaw student, who wears a yarmulke and is supportive of Israel, was observing a pro-Palestinian protest when someone spit on him, Schizer said. When he began to leave, Schizer said others at the protest began taunting him, saying things such as, 'You bomb hospitals,' 'You kill babies,' and, 'Tell your Israelis we're coming for you.'\nSeveral students said that some student clubs \u2014 even for dance and activities unrelated to the conflict in the Middle East \u2014 had become unwelcoming for Jewish and Israeli students as broad alliances formed backing Palestinian groups.\nWhat's happening in Gaza is a tragedy, Westergaard said, and people should be able to debate Israeli policies. But using phrases such as 'Death to the Zionist state,' or advocating for the destruction of any country is barbaric, he said.\nJonny Rosen, a junior from Baltimore whose grandmother survived the Holocaust, said he sometimes tries to talk with pro-Palestinian protesters, like when they chant 'intifada,' to ask if they know the history of the word.\nBut most refuse to interact, he said, when they see his yarmulke. 'It really feeds into the polarization on campus,' he said. 'How can anyone grow or learn, if we're not having conversations?'\nAdvertisement\nSome pro-Palestinian students said people on the opposing side are misunderstanding or distorting their views, as when they call them antisemitic for criticizing Israel.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nLayla Saliba, a student from North Carolina studying social work, said she has been accused of being part of Hamas. 'I would rather not engage with people who call me a terrorist,' said Saliba, who's a Palestinian Christian. She said some Zionist students laughed at an event when she was describing her families' bodies being pulled from the rubble.\nShe also said students are quick to take support for Palestinians as a personal attack. 'No. I don't want to attack you. I don't want to do anything to you,' she said. 'I just want the bombing to stop.'\nOthers on campus are alarmed by what they see as dangerous incursions into academic freedom, even censorship.\non campus are alarmed by what they see as dangerous incursions into academic freedom, even censorship.\n'There's an enormous amount of pressure being exerted on presidents, not just President Shafik, but other presidents,' said David B. Lurie, an associate professor of Japanese history and literature at Columbia, 'from people who would really like to see student speech and faculty speech constricted, as far as it applies to the ongoing conflict. So we're at a very dangerous time.'\nLurie is president of the school's chapter of the American Association of University Professors, which has registered alarm at what the organization sees as violations of academic freedom since the war began.\nwhat the organization sees as violations of academic freedom since the war began.\nLast month, the New York Civil Liberties Union and Palestine Legal filed a lawsuit against Columbia, saying the university's decision this fall to suspend two student groups, Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace, was unlawful.\nAdvertisement\n'I was only here for a year prior to this madness,' said Maryam Alwan, an organizer with Columbia's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine and a plaintiff in the case. 'That's been enough time to see the complete erosion of democracy, free speech, even my own sense of belonging and safety as a Palestinian student in the past six months.'\nThere's a lot of external pressure on the university, she said, from donors and from politicians, to discipline pro-Palestinian students and activism.\nIn a note to the campus after the recent protest, Shafik wrote, 'I did not become a university president to punish students.' But she said several students had been suspended as the university investigates an event held in campus housing that the university had barred, with outside speakers known to support terrorism and promote violence.\nseveral students had been suspended as the university investigates an event held in campus housing that the university had barred, with outside speakers known to support terrorism and promote violence.\n'I want to make clear that it is absolutely unacceptable for any member of this community to promote the use of terror or violence,' Shafik said.\nA pro-Palestinian student who said she had received an interim suspension and spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation by the university, said she was told to leave her student housing within 24 hours.

'Because when it comes to anti-Zionist Jews who demonstrate with us, who organize with us, Columbia does not care for their safety and actually enables violence, targeting and repression against them.'\nThe Columbia Task Force on Antisemitism issued its first report last month, suggesting stricter enforcement of existing rules to allow demonstrations in certain central spaces but to keep them from disrupting classrooms or dorms. It also suggested separating competing protests, and stopping them as they occurred, if necessary, rather than imposing discipline later. The recommendations, they wrote, could also help efforts to combat other types of bigotry, including anti-Arab bias and Islamophobia.\nIn February, the university implemented interim rules for demonstrations that included a requirement of two days' notice, prohibition on protests in academic spaces and consequences for violations.\nThe task force is part of a broader university-wide effort to foster more civil, academic debates. It's great to be in a setting where students can learn from people coming from different experiences, Tejasri Vijayakumar, Columbia College student body president, said, 'but it's not always going to feel comfortable, you know?' The war has been so personal and so traumatic for many on campus, she said, that it can be helpful to step back. 'Let's bring this back to the classroom a little bit.'\nWhile students routinely come together without incident, as at a spring music festival earlier this month, fault lines can be thrown suddenly into stark relief. At the recent protest, after speeches punctuated by protesters drumming, blowing horns and banging pots together, pro-Palestinian protesters abruptly began to march away from the school's central Sundial directly past Jewish and Israeli students. Rosen said the move made him nervous; his mind flashed to the idea that they might form a sort of wall around them.\nA few counterprotesters, waving an Israeli and an American flag, kept taunting the crowd. 'Free, free Palestine,' a student chanted sardonically, ' \u2014 from Hamas!'\nAs the protest moved toward academic buildings, a university official handed papers to marchers warning that they were violating campus rules. Some fluttered to the ground as people refused to take them, or dropped them in disdain.\nMarchers made a loop around the Morningside campus, chanting and waving signs. They slapped 'ISRAEL BOMBS' stickers onto surfaces as they went, including a bronze sculpture of a lion, Columbia's mascot. Rosen followed, at a distance, listening.\nA Palestinian student approached him. He began by telling Rosen he was sorry if he had lost anyone on Oct. 7.\ntelling Rosen he was sorry if he had lost anyone on Oct. 7.\nRosen said he agrees with much of what has been said about the loss of innocent lives in Gaza. The other student told Rosen he wouldn't chant for intifada because of the history of that word, which Rosen appreciated. As they spoke, there was understanding of the complexities. There was disagreement, especially about Israeli military strategies. The two of them sat down, joined by a few other students. The protest marched on.\n'I was more interested,' Rosen said, 'in having a conversation with him.'\nAdvertisement","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Susan Svrluga","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RDORSBXOZJIC4VYYPGJOLJOICA.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.565409,"_id":"cd51478172c15384e60512b5394b5351"}],"user_input":{"q":"Israel","search_in":["title_summary_en"],"lang":["en"],"not_lang":null,"countries":null,"not_countries":null,"from":"2024-04-15 00:00:00","to":null,"ranked_only":"True","from_rank":null,"to_rank":null,"sort_by":"relevancy","page":1,"size":100,"sources":["washingtonpost.com"],"not_sources":[],"topic":null,"published_date_precision":null}}
