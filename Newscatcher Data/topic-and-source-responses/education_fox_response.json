            "excerpt": "The Department of Education finalized a sweeping reversal of Trump-era Title IX reforms on Friday, a win for teachers unions that had advocated for such an action.",
            "summary": "The Biden administration's actions finalizing revised Title IX regulations represent a victory for powerful teachers unions, which have fueled Democrats' 2024 election campaigns.\nOn Friday morning, the Department of Education finalized sweeping new Title IX rules that it said will \"strengthen vital protections\" from sex-based harassment and prevent discrimination based on gender identity. The regulations dismantle Trump-era actions that bolstered protections, but also prescribed a strict grievance process that ensures the accused are treated as innocent until proven guilty.\nThe nation's two largest teachers unions, the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association, have for months heavily advocated for the regulations to be finalized. During the current election cycle, the two unions have funneled millions of dollars to Democrat-aligned political action committees, but virtually nothing to Republicans, according to federal filings.\n\"Prior to the 2020 rule, there was progress on changing the culture of sexual violence on our education campuses, as well as improvements to student safety. But the Trump-DeVos rule quashed open discussion of sexual harassment and gender-based violence,\" AFT President Randi Weingarten wrote in a comment letter supporting the Biden administration's regulations.\nWeingarten added that the administration's rules – which are set to go into effect in August – would \"remove dangerous regulations put in place in 2020 and put us back on the path of honestly discussing the modern realities of equal access to education.\"\nIn a separate comment letter, NEA President Rebecca Pringle similarly praised the regulations and urged the Education Department to act expeditiously to finalize them.\n\"We commend the Department for this proposed rule, which restores crucial protections, creates uniform processes, and provides much-needed clarification and formalization of protections that further the broad mandate of Title IX to prohibit sex discrimination in education,\" Pringle wrote to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona and Assistant Secretary Catherine Lhamon.\nPringle's letter emphasized the importance of the regulations' expansion of Title IX protections to include transgender students. She said they would protect a transgender student who is \"discriminated against and shamed when told they cannot use the bathroom.\"\nAccording to NEA, the regulations would prohibit schools from excluding students from any educational activity because of transgender status; prohibit \"misgendering\" transgender students or teachers, force the use of a name selected by a transgender student or teacher, and require students to be allowed to use restrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity.\n\"The Department's clarification of Title IX protections moves us closer to making our schools places where we are all free to thrive and support one another for who we are and where students across race, background, and gender have the freedom to learn without fear or intimidation,\" Pringle continued.\nIn addition to the expanded protections for transgenders in schools under Title IX, the regulations would also undo sexual assault due process rules put in place by the Trump administration.\nColleges will no longer be required to hold live hearings to allow students to cross-examine one another through representatives. Instead, college officials will be able to interview students separately, allowing each student to suggest questions and get a recording of the responses.\nIn evaluating the parties' evidence, a school must use the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard of proof unless the school uses the clear and convincing evidence standard in all other comparable proceedings.\nDepartment of Education officials first proposed the regulations in 2022, but have delayed finalizing them to review the tidal wave of more than 240,000 public comments. The Trump-era regulations were finalized by then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in May 2020.\nCivil liberties, students' rights and conservative legal groups have called on the Biden administration to preserve the 2020 regulations.\nAFT and NEA didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",

            "excerpt": "Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona vowed to crack down on the largest Christian university in the country during a House committee hearing.",
            "summary": "After Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona vowed to shut down Grand Canyon University (GCU), the largest Christian university in the U.S., GCU officials are pushing back, telling Fox News Digital the crackdown stems from \"deeply held bias.\"\nCardona made comments during a House Appropriations Committee hearing about cracking down on GCU and other universities like it on April 10.\nRep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., asked Cardona how the administration is working to shut down GCU, which she called \"a predatory for-profit school.\"\nCardona openly embraced their enforcement methods, declaring \"we are cracking down not only to shut them down, but to send a message to not prey on students.\"\n\"Last year, your Department took action against Grand Canyon University, a predatory for-profit college, over the school's failure to accurately disclose its cost to students, driving up the true cost for those students requiring for them to pay for continuation courses before they would graduate – scam courses added about $10,000 or more to the cost of education to these kids,\" DeLauro said.\n\"Going after predatory schools preying on first generation students. They have flashy marketing materials, but the product is not worth the paper it is printed on. Increased enforcement budget to go after these folks and crack down. Levied largest fine in history against a school that lied about costs and terminated a school from Title IV. We are cracking down not only to shut them down, but to send a message not to prey on students,\" Cardona responded.\nGCU appealed a $37.7 million fine imposed by the department in November on allegations that the Arizona-based higher learning institution misled students about the cost of its doctoral programs over several years.\nThe fine is much larger than what the Department of Education previously gave to schools like Penn State ($2.4 million) and Michigan State ($4.5 million) for failing to address Jerry Sandusky and Larry Nassar's crimes, respectively.\nThe department said in an October press release that an investigation conducted by the office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) found GCU \"lied\" to over 7,500 former and current students about the cost of its doctoral programs. The release also said GCU \"falsely advertises\" a lower cost for its doctoral programs, adding that about 98% of students ended up paying more than the advertised cost.\nThe university was given a 20-day deadline to request a hearing with the ED's Office of Hearings and Appeals or file a response to the FSA to explain why the fine should not be imposed. The Department also imposed specific conditions on the school to continue participating in the federal student aid programs.\nA GCU spokesperson told Fox News Digital that they do not expect a hearing to take place until January.\n\"Our next recourse after that decision would be another appeal within the Department, this time directly to the Secretary of Education,\" the GCU official said.\n\"This is far from being a few rotten apples in the bunch. Predatory for-profit colleges have engaged in a range of deceptions designed to increase enrollment and student costs to drive more revenue for owners and shareholders,\" DeLauro said during the April 10 hearing. \"How are you and your agency committing to increased oversight of these institutions and are there anyway in which we can shut these folks down?\"\nCardona said that the agency employed \"multiple strategies\" to crack down on for-profit universities, such as \"borrower defense, debt discharge, holding colleges more accountable, and holding higher education institutions more accountable.\"\nIn regard to borrower defense, Cardona added that for-profit colleges were \"preying on first-generation students.\"\n\"You have a shiny brochure and a great commercial. But the product is not worth the paper it's written on. We have students graduating 60K to 70K dollars in debt, only eligible for jobs making under 30K–that to me is unacceptable.\"\nIn response to Cardona's comment about shutting down universities like GCU, a GCU spokesperson told Fox News Digital that \"officials continue to make derogatory and inflammatory public statements that are legally and factually incorrect and not shared by any of the other 26 regulatory and accrediting bodies that oversee GCU.\"\n\"The Secretary's comments to the House Appropriations Committee were so reckless that GCU is demanding an immediate retraction, as they do not reflect the factual record in this case. He is either confused, misinformed or does not understand the actions taken by his own agency,\" the spokesperson added.\nThe president of GCU previously expressed to Fox News Digital sentiments of being \"unfairly targeted.\"\nCardona's comments came after the announcement of a petition to \"protect Christian colleges,\" launched by the American Principles Project (APP).\nThe petition was launched in \"light of the Biden administration's unprecedented attacks on our nation's largest Christian colleges\" and demands that \"the administration halt their crusade and let students choose the schools that fit their values.\"\n\"The federal government's education agenda is punishing schools that do not conform to their progressive ideology. It's time we take a stand against this egregious abuse of power,\" APP Policy Director Jon Schweppe said. \"The scrutinize-and-penalize campaign against faith-based institutions is not about students' interests or well-being. Rather, it's part of a concerted effort to snuff out education choice and promote far-left values. It's critical that Americans be aware of this shameful campaign and that we do all we can to put a stop to it.\"\nIn response to APP's efforts, GCU officials told Fox News Digital that the \"American people are losing confidence in the federal government to be fair and objective in their operations.\"\n\"There are clearly no checks and balances to prevent this type of behavior from the Department of Education,\" they added. \"We support any organization that is willing to shed light on the federal government's unwarranted and targeted actions taken against GCU. If they can make these claims against the largest Christian university in the country, other faith-based organizations could be next.\"\nAdditionally, the Goldwater Institute sued ED in February in federal court for \"refusing to turn over public records\" related to its $37.7 million fine against GCU. They claimed that the records specifically may inform the public about coordination between various federal agencies in what appears to be the \"intentional targeting of a successful university based on extraordinarily thin allegations.\"\nThe Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

            "excerpt": "New York middle school students are being \"pushed\" off campus to an old building to accommodate a surge in enrollment caused by the ongoing migrant crisis.",
            "summary": "Special needs students at a New York City middle school could be forced off of its campus due to an influx of migrant children as a result of the ongoing border crisis, a looming decision that sparked protests against the relocation.\nJustin Holland, a student at West Prep Academy, which is housed in the same school building as PS 145 in the Upper West Side, said he feels like he's being \"pushed out\" of a safe space.\n\"This is a change for me and I don't like change. I just don't like how we're being pushed into a new environment that's not safe for me,\" the seventh grader told the New York Post.\nSome of Holland's peers reiterated the same sentiment. India Ringold said the school's current location makes her feel \"safe,\" while sixth grader Logan Padron added that the new campus' cafeteria \"looks like a prison.\"\nWest Prep has a 43% population of children with special needs. As a replacement, they have been given an old schoolhouse with no outdoor space or adequate accommodations for its disabled students, the Post reported. One parent, Bianca Louch, was concerned.\n\"There's smoke shops everywhere, and there's also people outside that are bums, so why keep our kids in the street playing when there's literally a park right there where they can play basketball and all the sports that they have,\" Louch told the Post.\nThe academy's PTA president, Ty Ellis, said, \"We want to make sure that all students are safe, whether it's in this current building or any building. We don't want them to just offer us anything, like we are pieces of trash.\"\nWhat was once the campus of the Ascension School on 108th Street is now proposed to become West Prep's new home, without any upgrades or modifications to cater to its students, the Post reported. Parents are demanding the city's Department of Education let them stay or offer an appropriate alternative that would accommodate the students' needs.\nThis Tuesday, 20 students and parents wore shirts that read \"All Students Deserve FAPE(E),\" meaning free appropriate public equitable education. They gathered outside the building in protest of the relocation, shouting \"Stop the move!\"\nThe Post reported that the schoolhouse West Prep shares with PS 145, The John Tyler School, was already crammed before an influx of migrants began enrolling.\nDenise Johnson, another West Prep mother, was also worried about the state of the school's potential new home.\n\"This building is not equipped to house students with special needs [or] students that don't have any special needs — it's not equipped, it's 127 years old,\" she said. \"The issue is we are coming from a building that is substantial, with all [the] equipment to service their students to a building that lacks resources.\"\n\"The issue for me is the building in itself. It's not up to par for anyone to go into learning — it looks like a jail. And I don't think that's something that our Black and Brown kids should be provided by based off of someone else's decision,\" Johnson added. \"The parents didn't vote. If it's a population [problem], there's other options.\"\nDuring a town hall meeting earlier this year, Kaliris Salas, who serves on the Department of Education's Panel of Education Policy, expressed her safety concerns regarding the children at the proposed facility.\n\"There's multiple doors on the floors, where the children can open and can wander around there. There are concerns in terms of outdoor space. We know that children that are part of the ASC nests program have mandated outdoor time and services that cannot be provided in that building,\" Salas said. \"In turn, a lot of us on the PEP are very concerned about this particular move and would love for the Department of Education to address those concerns.\"\nAs community members await in anticipation for the panel's May 22 vote, the academy's parents made a petition on change.org to \"Stop the displacement of West Prep children.\"\nWest Prep's principal and vice principal did not respond to a request for comment, nor did the Department of Education.",

            "excerpt": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis says he is trying to stop the weaponization of school book bans after he signed a new education bill into law on Tuesday.",
            "summary": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law Tuesday that will make it harder for some people to ban books in the state's public schools.\nThe new law, part of the wide-ranging education bill HB 1285, will cap the number of challenges on school materials that an individual can make per year, if they do not have a student enrolled in that district.\nDeSantis said the bill will help protect schools from activists trying to politicize and disrupt a district's book review process.\n\"You have some people who are taking the curriculum transparency, and they're trying to weaponize that for political purposes,\" DeSantis said during a news conference Tuesday in Jacksonville.\n\"And so that involves objecting to normal books.\"\nPreviously, there were no limits in place on who could challenge books and other educational materials or how many challenges one person could submit.\nUnder the new bill, individuals without children in the district will be limited to one objection per month, Fox 13 Tampa reports.\nThe bill will, however, ensure that there are unlimited objections for parents with children in the school district, including homeschooled students accessing district materials.\nLawmakers have criticized parents on both sides of the political aisle for abusing the system and, at times, overwhelming districts with the number of challenges, Fox 13 reports.\nDuring the 2022-23 fiscal year, there were more than 1,200 book objections in Florida, according to state records. More than half came from counties Clay and Escambia.\n\"This is designed, like the governor mentioned before, to allow parents to have a say, allow parents to challenge books that shouldn't be in a school,\" Florida Education Commissioner Manny Diaz said.\n\"But anyone who creates a cottage industry of going around the state and just creating challenges just to gunk up the system and put school systems in arrears as far as reviewing these books, that person won't be able to do it anymore.\"\nFlorida leads the nation in public school book bans with 1,406 books banned in total, according to a report by the non-profit organization Pen America. That is about 40% of the total book bans reported in the U.S.\nHB 1285 also aims to simplify the process for parents to remove children from poor-performing schools and incentivize districts to increase the number of Purple Star schools that support military families.\nSchool districts and charter schools will be required to provide 11th and 12th-grade students with the opportunity to take the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) test and the ability to consult with a military recruiter.\nAdditionally, the bill provides a process for a struggling school to convert to a charter school.\n\"Florida is the number one state in the country for education,\" DeSantis said. \"By focusing on core academic subjects and rejecting indoctrination in the classroom, we have become a standard-bearer for educational excellence. The legislation I signed today continues to build on Florida's previous accomplishments.\"",

Bill educational benefits.\nThe court ruled 7-2 that the Department of Veterans Affairs improperly calculated the educational benefits for James Rudisill, a retired Army captain who lives in northern Virginia.\nRudisill, who's now an FBI agent, is in a category of veterans who earned credit under two versions of the G.I. Bill. One version applied to people who served before the Sept. 11, 2001, attack. Congress passed new legislation after Sept. 11.\nBut Rudisill served both before and after the attack, including tours in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nEach program gives veterans 36 months of benefits, and there's a 48-month cap. Rudisill thought he had 10 months of benefits remaining under the old program, plus another year in the new system. But the VA denied the additional year.\nRudisill said the decision forced him to give up his plan to attend Yale Divinity School, be ordained as an Episcopal priest and reenter the Army as a chaplain.\nHis lawyers said the decision could affect roughly 1.7 million veterans, but the VA disputed that the number is \"anything close\" to 1.7 million, noting that his lawyers didn't identify any other cases that presented the same issue.",

            "excerpt": "The U.S. Department of Education is trying to take down Grand Canyon University over \"ideological\" differences, according to GCU's president.",
            "summary": "FIRST ON FOX: Arizona's education department is pushing back against the U.S. Department of Education's (DOE) threat to shut down Grand Canyon University, calling it \"the latest episode of harassment\" against the school by the federal government.\n\"It is unwarranted and unjust,\" Arizona state Superintendent Tom Horne told Fox News Digital Friday. \"In the U.S., anyone accused of wrongdoing is presumed innocent and entitled to their day in court. Secretary Cardona's threat is contrary to those constitutional guarantees and unworthy of his position.\"\nHorne said he wrote to DOE Secretary Miguel Cardona last year about GCU's \"excellent\" reputation and urged him to sit down with GCU leadership to hash out their issues.\n\"That is a reasonable request, but, so far, he has chosen to be unreasonable,\" Horne said.\nThe Biden administration is trying to take down the largest Christian university over \"ideological\" differences despite the school being audited several times by separate state entities, according to the university's president.\n\"We are very, very universally loved and respected in the state of Arizona on both sides of the aisle,\" Grand Canyon University (GCU) President Brian Mueller told Fox News Digital Thursday. \"This thing is absolutely not political for us. There's a small group of people in Washington, D.C., in the Department of Education and the Federal Trade Commission, but none of the allegations that they're lobbing are corroborated any place else.\"\nWhile GCU will first try to appeal within DOE, Mueller said he believes \"the Supreme Court will hear this.\"\n\"There's so much at stake here,\" he said.\nGCU's accrediting body, the Higher Learning Commission, also described GCU's doctoral disclosures as \"robust and thorough\" in its 2021 comprehensive review of GCU's enrollment practices, a GCU executive told Fox News Digital. The Arizona State Approving Agency (SAA) of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which recently audited GCU specifically to investigate the DOE's claims, also concluded there were \"no substantiated findings.\"\n\"The Arizona SAA did not have any substantiated findings based on our review of Grand Canyon University,\" SAA's letter to GCU in March stated. \"There are no findings impacting the continued approval of Grand Canyon University at this time. There are no follow-up actions required by Grand Canyon University at this time.\"\nMueller's comments come as DOE Secretary Miguel Cardona vowed to shut down the school for being \"a predatory for-profit school\" during a House Appropriations Committee hearing about cracking down on GCU and other universities like it last week.\nThe DOE claims that GCU \"lied to students\" and \"falsely advertised\" the cost to complete a doctoral program, which the GCU rejects. In higher education, doctoral programs that include dissertations rarely have a fixed cost because the number of continuation courses varies for each individual student, a GCU spokesperson said in response.\nCardona made comments during a House Appropriations Committee hearing about cracking down on GCU and other universities like it April 10.\nRep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., asked Cardona how the administration is working to shut down GCU, which she called \"a predatory for-profit school.\"\nCardona openly embraced the enforcement methods.\n\"Last year, your department took action against Grand Canyon University, a predatory for-profit college, over the school's failure to accurately disclose its cost to students, driving up the true cost for those students and requiring for them to pay for continuation courses before they would graduate. Scam courses added about $10,000 or more to the cost of education to these kids,\" DeLauro said.\n\"Going after predatory schools preying on first-generation students,\" Cardona responded. \"They have flashy marketing materials, but the product is not worth the paper it is printed on. Increased enforcement budget to go after these folks and crack down. Levied largest fine in history against a school that lied about costs and terminated a school from Title IV. We are cracking down not only to shut them down, but to send a message not to prey on students.\"\nGCU appealed a $37.7 million fine imposed by the department in November based on allegations the Arizona-based higher learning institution misled students about the cost of its doctoral programs over several years.\nThe department said in an October press release an investigation conducted by the office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) found GCU \"lied\" to over 7,500 former and current students about the cost of its doctoral programs. The release also said GCU \"falsely advertises\" a lower cost for its doctoral programs, adding that about 98% of students ended up paying more than the advertised cost.",

            "summary": "A Nigerian chess champion and child education advocate is attempting to play chess nonstop for 58 hours in New York City's Times Square to break the global record for the longest chess marathon.\nTunde Onakoya, 29, hopes to raise $1 million for children's education across Africa. He is playing against Shawn Martinez, an American chess champion, in line with Guinness World Record guidelines that any attempt to break the record must be made by two players who would play continuously for the entire duration.\nOnakoya had played chess for 42 hours by 10:00 a.m. GMT on Friday. Support is growing online and at the scene, where a blend of African music is keeping onlookers and supporters entertained amid cheers and applause.\nThe current chess marathon record is 56 hours, 9 minutes and 37 seconds, achieved in 2018 by Hallvard Haug Flatebø and Sjur Ferkingstad, both from Norway.\nThe record attempt is \"for the dreams of millions of children across Africa without access to education,\" said Onakoya, who founded Chess in Slums Africa in 2018. The organization wants to support education of at least 1 million children in slums across the continent.\n\"My energy is at 100% right now because my people are here supporting me with music,\" Onakoya said Thursday evening after the players crossed the 24-hour mark.\nOn Onakoya's menu: Lots of water and jollof rice, one of West Africa's best known dishes.\nFor every hour of game played, Onakoya and his opponent get only five minutes' break. The breaks are sometimes grouped together, and Onakoya uses them to catch up with Nigerians and New Yorkers cheering him on. He even joins in with their dancing sometimes.\nA total of $22,000 was raised within the first 20 hours of the attempt, said Taiwo Adeyemi, Onakoya's manager.\n\"The support has been overwhelming from Nigerians in the U.S., global leaders, celebrities and hundreds of passersby,\" he said.\nOnakoya's attempt is closely followed in Nigeria where he regularly organizes chess competitions for young people living on the streets to boost his cause. More than 10 million children are out of school in the West African country — one of the world's highest rates.\nAmong those who have publicly supported him are celebrities and public office holders, including Nigeria's former Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, who wrote to Onakoya on X, formerly Twitter: \"Remember your own powerful words: 'It is possible to do great things from a small place.'\"\nThe Guinness World Record organization has yet to publicly comment about Onakoya's attempt, which could reach 58 hours by midnight on Friday. It sometimes takes weeks for the organization to confirm any new record.",

            "summary": "The Biden administration has unveiled new rules to safeguard LGBTQ+ students and change the ways in which sexual harassment and assault claims are adjudicated on campus.\nThe new provisions are part of a revised Title IX regulation issued by the Education Department, fulfilling a campaign pledge by President Biden to revamp those issued during the Trump administration.\nMissing from the new rule, however, is a policy forbidding schools from enacting outright bans on transgender athletes competing against biological females.\nThe Biden administration was widely expected to bring in such a policy but has instead put the provision on hold. The delay is widely seen as a political maneuver during an election year in which Republicans have rallied around bans on transgender athletes in girls' sports.\nUnder the new rules, sex discrimination includes discrimination based on gender identity as well as sexual orientation.\nBiden is also officially undoing sexual assault rules put in place by his predecessor and current election-year opponent, former President Donald Trump.\nThe final policy drew praise from victims' advocates, while Republicans said it erodes the rights of accused students.\nThe new rule makes \"crystal clear that everyone can access schools that are safe, welcoming and that respect their rights,\" Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said.\n\"No one should face bullying or discrimination just because of who they are, who they love,\" Cardona told reporters. \"Sadly, this happens all too often.\"\nBiden's regulation is meant to clarify schools' obligations under Title IX, the 1972 women's rights law that outlaws discrimination based on sex in education. It applies to colleges and elementary and high schools that receive federal money. The update is to take effect in August.\nThis is a developing story. Check back for updates.",

            "excerpt": "The tragic death of nonbinary teen Nex Benedict's has been manipulated by the media to depict her as a martyr. Even the medical examiner's report hasn't placated activists.",
            "summary": "‘Never let a good tragedy go to waste' is the unspoken mantra of the radical progressive left, and that mantra has been hard at work in Oklahoma these past few weeks in the case of Nex Benedict. Indeed, the grotesquely distorted radical, progressive, Democrat narrative surrounding the death of a teenage girl in Oklahoma last month has been the source of a great deal of national media attention.\nHowever, this child's memory and the truth of what actually happened to her are just the latest instances of collateral damage in the woke mob and corporate media's efforts to smear school choice, traditional values and the Oklahomans who believe in them.\nHere's how the leftist narrative goes: a young girl who identified herself as nonbinary was beaten up in a high school bathroom in Owasso. She later tragically died of her injuries all as the result of hateful rhetoric of national conservative leaders all across the country. These leaders led others to cause violence against her. This narrative was spun for weeks without any evidence or proof.\nThey continuously tried to co-opt this story into a tale of martyrdom, where everything they claimed that this was all from a so-called \"climate of hate and bigotry\" and allege some deluge of new information about harassment in Oklahoma's public schools because of the values that the Oklahoma State Department of Education has been working to reinstill in public education.\nThat is not hyperbolic in the least. If you believe the leftist opinion headlines, this tragedy was a direct and inescapable outcome of making students use bathrooms that correspond with biological reality.\nIn response, hundreds of LGBT organizations and activists called for me to step down. Now, as then, I will disappoint the woke mob and give them every reason to run back to their keyboards and spin even more dishonest rhetoric.\nBut facts — John Adams reminds us — are stubborn things. And the facts of this case have turned out to be quite inconvenient for the narrative peddlers. It still remains unclear specifically why Benedict was beaten in that bathroom.\nNo reason is sufficient to justify a physical altercation. While details are murky at best, the motive is not something to be assumed or spun up out of thin air. Further, bodycam footage released amid the aftermath of the incident shows Benedict admitting to starting the altercation. Further, law enforcement authorities have indicated that Benedict did not die as the result of trauma. Finally, and most awful, deeper reporting on the matter revealed allegations of a longer horrific history of parental sexual abuse and psychological trauma than mere bullying at school. Yet the media and the activist cadre have yet to own up to their crass manipulation of this young woman's suffering.\nBecause let's be frank about what's actually going on here. This isn't about a teenager's death. It isn't even really about bullying. This is a pretext for attacking the traditional values and the educational freedom agenda that the people of Oklahoma elected me to fight for. The mob took the first news story that it could use for its own ends and ran with it. That's it. That's why the facts don't matter, the narrative is what they needed.\nTragically, Nex took her own life, according to the medical examiner's report in March.\nThe bottom line is this: the safety of my students has always been my first and foremost priority as an educator, from my first day in the classroom to now. I never tolerated bullying of any kind for any reason when I was a teacher, and I do not tolerate it whatsoever as the superintendent of Education.\nAny Oklahoma public school teacher or administrator who believes otherwise on the topic is always welcome to find other employment. But, I will make zero apologies for representing the values of the Oklahoma voters who elected me. I make zero apologies for working to serve the needs and interests of the parents and students that I serve.\nI'm not afraid of politics. I knew I would be attacked when I decided to get into this business, and I knew I would be lied about. Nevertheless, it is still despicable that anyone would not only so brazenly use a thing as horrific as a child's death to gin up political discord for personal gain. It is even more despicable that so many would willfully and knowingly turn a blind eye to the facts, simple reason and basic human dignity to keep the whole thing going once contradicted.\nThis mob and its rabid propaganda cannot change the facts of Benedict's death any more than they can change the simple realities of human biology, no matter how much bile and misinformation they spew into the public discourse.",

Bill Cassidy, R-La., said in a statement. Cassidy serves as ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee.\nHe prefaced that his office is still examining the new regulations, \"but it appears to be an attempt by the Biden administration to pursue an ideological agenda on gender identity and inject federal bureaucrats into the parent-child relationship.\"\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the chairman of the HELP committee, did not provide comment to Fox News Digital.\nBiden announced new regulations for Title IX Friday morning, which included expanding the definition of sex discrimination to include both sexual orientation and gender identity, which the president's administration touts as protection for LGBT students.\nThe unveiled rule changes also rolled back regulations put in place by former Trump Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that ensured due process for the accused.\nSecretary of Education Miguel Cardona cheered the announcement of the rules.\n\"These final regulations build on the legacy of Title IX by clarifying that all our nation's students can access schools that are safe, welcoming and respect their rights,\" Cardona said.\n\"Title IX was meant to protect female students from sex discrimination,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Sadly, the Biden administration's new Title IX rule does the exact opposite and makes it harder for schools to protect women.\n\"As we saw in the tragic Loudon County case, these kinds of woke policies are putting our daughters at risk,\" Cruz warned, mentioning an event in northern Virginia where a female student was sexually assaulted in a bathroom by a male student wearing a skirt.\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said in a statement the regulations are \"not about protecting students.\" Instead, he claimed Biden's rules are \"about appeasing the radical members of their base by imposing woke policies that rob women and girls of equal opportunities and jeopardize their safety.\"\nReacting to the rules, Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., claimed, the \"left wants to use it as a tool to further its woke gender ideology.\"\n\"We identify as pissed off,\" Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., told Fox News Digital in a statement.\nThe congresswoman claimed Biden's administration is \"effectively saying that women's safety is expendable\" with the new rules.\n\"Recent incidents, like the appalling rape of a woman in Rikers by a biological male, are a stark reminder of the very real dangers posed by these reckless policies. This isn't progress; this is regression at its worst, and women are paying the price,\" she continued.\nSen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., who has made protecting women's sports a legislative priority, said in a statement, \"Today, the Biden administration redefined the definition of a ‘woman.'\n\"This means that biological women now have zero safe spaces and no real identity.\"\nTuberville recently offered an amendment to a federal government spending package, adding his Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act to it last month. However, the Senate voted along party lines to reject it, including the amendment in the massive government spending bill.\nSen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., also warned of the rule changes' effect on women's sports, telling Fox News Digital in a statement, \"Regardless of the propaganda being pushed by the left, men and women are biologically different. We've seen how Joe Biden's vision for female sports will result in two teams – one team of men and another team of folks that used to be men.\"\nTwo congressional aides informed Fox News Digital that lawmakers were briefed on the changes Friday by Catherine Lhamon, the assistant secretary in the Office for Civil Rights at the DOE. According to the sources, Lhamon reiterated that the regulations would not affect school athletics because the rulemaking process related to this is still ongoing. They added that no clarity was provided as to how sports would be unaffected when gender identity will be protected from discrimination.\nThe aides additionally raised concerns over the department's lack of a plan for assisting schools with implementation, which is required by Aug. 1. The sources said rules are traditionally rolled out with a plan to coordinate implementation with schools. This often includes webinars, they said.\nWhen asked if there was a plan to assist schools with implementation, a spokesperson for the department did not answer directly but shared that it would be available to provide technical assistance and other resources when deemed appropriate.\nDemocratic House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., disagreed with her Republican counterparts, telling Fox News Digital in a statement, \"I'm grateful to the Biden-Harris administration for defending gender equality and protecting the safety and well-being of students across the country.\n\"We must stand up for the basic dignity of every person amid so much hateful rhetoric and violence against [transgender] youth and women.\"",

            "excerpt": "Missouri legislators voted Thursday in favor of a bill to expand private school scholarships. If enacted, it would allow up to $6,375 in spending per child.",
            "summary": "Missouri lawmakers on Thursday passed a bill to expand private school scholarships statewide, an effort made possible by extensive compromises including a commitment to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more on public schools.\nThe GOP-led House voted with a bare-minimum margin of 82-69 to send the measure to Republican Gov. Mike Parson. If signed, it would offer up to $6,375 per child for expenses including tuition, textbooks, tutoring, transportation, extracurriculars and summer school.\nThe bill's passage is a victory for advocates who have struggled for years to expand access to charter schools, virtual schools and private schools in Missouri. Worries about taking away resources from traditional kindergarten-12th grade public schools have been bipartisan.\nThe heart of the legislation is the expansion of Missouri Empowerment Scholarships Accounts, which low-income families can draw from. The money will come from private donors, who in return get tax credits.\n\"This is a victory for parents who want more control over their children's education and for students who will now have more avenues to achieve their full potential,\" Republican Rep. Phil Christofanelli said in a statement.\nThe current scholarship program limits recipients to residents of the state's largest cities and to families who make less than 200% of the federal poverty level, which works out to $62,400 a year for a family of four.\nThe bill passed Thursday would raise the cap to 300%, or $93,600 for a family of four. Public school students who need extra help through individualized education plans would get some additional scholarship money under the new law.\nThe legislation increases the cap on tax credits for the private donations from $50 million to $75 million per year, to help pay for a possible influx of students.\nTo gain support from lawmakers focused on helping traditional public schools, senators included money to raise minimum teacher salaries to $40,000 a year and adjusted the state's formula for funding public schools, a change expected to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars more to public education over time.\nSeveral House Democrats cautioned that the state might not have enough revenue in future years to provide the massive influx in funding to public schools that the bill commits to.\n\"While the voucher expansion is essentially guaranteed, the promises to public schools depend on additional funding the state isn't expected to have and future lawmakers aren't required to provide,\" House Democratic Minority Leader Crystal Quade said in a statement.\nAnother provision would allow charter schools in Boone County, where Senate President Pro Tem Caleb Rowden lives. The bill also would require public votes to approve a school district's switch to four-day school weeks and incentivize schools that maintain five-day weeks.\nThis issue supporters call \"school choice\" has divided lawmakers beyond typical Republican-Democrat lines in Missouri.\nGOP legislators from rural districts have opposed allowing charter schools in their areas for years, fearing they could draw students away from traditional public schools seen as the backbone of their communities. Some Democrats, meanwhile, want students in underperforming urban schools to have more options.\nAnd some conservatives lobbied against more regulations for homeschoolers and private schools. One activist handed out \"dog poop\" brownies before the vote, suggesting that unwanted provisions could ruin what might otherwise be a nice treat.",

            "summary": "Patrick Mahomes is one of the most recognizable faces in the NFL and across sports and was recognized as Time magazine's \"Most Influential People\" on Tuesday.\nIn the profile, the deadly Super Bowl parade shooting in Kansas City, Missouri, was mentioned. One person was killed, and several others were wounded as the team tried to celebrate its second consecutive title, supplanting them as a dynastic team not seen since the New England Patriots.\nThoughts, prayers and calls for tighter gun-control measures rained onto social media as shots fired were reported. Mahomes offered his condolences, donated money to an aid fund for victims and went to the hospital to visit some of the victims.\nHowever, the three-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback stopped short of advocating for those measures. He explained why to Time magazine.\n\"I continue to educate myself,\" he said. \"I don't want to make a quick response to something that takes a lot of education to really learn and make a swaying comment based off that. But I know we have to find a solution of some way to make this stuff stop.\"\nMahomes has been involved in politics and societal issues in the past. He was among those who advocated for the NFL to condemn the police-involved killing of George Floyd and campaigned with LeBron James to urge Americans to head to the polls for the 2020 election.\nHowever, he did not endorse a presidential candidate. Time reported he did not appear to be on the verge of offering an endorsement this time around either.\n\"I don't want to pressure anyone to vote for a certain president,\" he told the outlet. \"I want people to use their voice, whoever they believe in. I want them to do the research.\"\nMahomes and the Chiefs will embark on a journey to do what no NFL team has done before – win three consecutive Super Bowl titles.\nFollow Fox News Digital's sports coverage on X and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.",

            "excerpt": "Georgia's public universities and colleges will increase tuition, effective at the start of the 2024-25 academic year, amid rising costs of operation.",
            "summary": "Students will pay more to attend Georgia's public universities and colleges in the 2024-2025 academic year, with officials saying schools face rising costs and must charge more to maintain a quality education.\nRegents voted Tuesday to increase tuition and fees at the system's 26 schools. The typical Georgia school will charge in-state undergraduates $6,466 in tuition and mandatory fees next year, up 2.4% from $6,317 this year.\nTuition and fees will range from $3,506 at Swainsboro-based East Georgia State College to $12,058 at Georgia Tech.\nThe typical student will still be paying less than in 2022, though. After that year, regents eliminated a fee that was charged on top of tuition, lowering costs at almost all institutions.\nUniversity System Chief Fiscal Officer Tracey Cook told regents that universities are paying higher costs for items including technology, software, food, utilities and insurance, while they are also having to spend more on employee salaries. While state appropriations fund pay raises for most academic employees, universities must fund pay raises for most support employees out of their own funds.\n\"We must at times increase tuition to maintain a consistent standard of quality, to improving how we graduate and retain our students, and as discussed, keep pace with rising costs, while we look for ways to be more efficient,\" Cook told regents during a Tuesday meeting at Gordon State College in Barnesville.\nCosts to rent dormitory rooms and buy meal plans will also rise systemwide.\nRegents had generally held tuition flat for four straight years and six years of the previous eight. Georgia's typical tuition and fees are lower than all but two states in the 16-state region covered by the Southern Regional Education Board.\nFor students receiving lottery-funded HOPE Scholarships, the scholarship will pay for higher tuition. However, students and their families must themselves pay for mandatory fees. Although many Georgia students receive other types of financial aid, more than 35% now borrow to pay for college with some students borrowing more than $5,500 on average.\nThe university system also approved a further increase in tuition for students coming from outside the country. They will now pay 2% more than students from outside Georgia, who already pay tuition rates that are three times or more what in-state students pay. Institutions sometimes waive out-of-state charges.\nThe system also said it would increase fees for students taking classes online at most universities. Many schools have been waiving all or part of their mandatory fees, because online students don't benefit from some of the things student fees pay for, such as student activities or athletics. Fees for online students would remain less than for in-person students.\nOfficials said student fees weren't generating enough money provide a financial cushion for projects they finance, such as student centers, recreation and athletic facilities and parking garages.\n\"Less students paying these fees translates into less revenue to cover expenses,\" Cook said. \"And these declines in revenues are occurring while institutions are experiencing an increase in costs.\"\nThe state will fund nearly $3.4 billion of the system's roughly $9 billion budget in the year beginning July 1. Lawmakers boosted state funding for universities by $200 million, or 6.4%, under a budget awaiting Gov. Brian Kemp's signature. Of that amount $97 million are for 4% salary increases for employees. Lawmakers also restored $66 million in teaching funds that were cut in a dispute last year. Regents said they would continue to give some extra money to smaller schools with shrinking enrollment.\nRegent Douglas Aldridge of Chattahoochee Hills said the budget increase will \"go a long way in providing a quality education experience for our students\"",

Video posted online shows the student standing over a teacher who is seated before striking her in the face.\n\"Do you think that affected me in any way?\" the teacher can be heard asking.\n\"Want me to hit you again?\" the student says, while stepping up and repeating the question.\n\"I don't want it,\" the teacher says, before she is struck again. The hit is so hard that her glasses fly off her face while the teenager continues his profanity-filled rant.\n\"Ain't nobody even coming. You got slapped,\" the student says. \"B----, go back to teaching.\"\nThe school's principal, Noel Keener, told parents in a message that the student would face disciplinary action in addition to criminal charges for \"inappropriate and unsettling\" behavior, according to local WGHP.\nNeither the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools spokesperson nor the superintendent responded to a Fox News Digital inquiry about what happened, but Superintendent Tricia McManus told local TV station WGHP that the student's \"behavior will not be tolerated\" and her focus was on making sure the \"teacher is taken care of and has the support needed to navigate through the lasting effects of this incident.\"\nThe superintendent also plans to recommend expulsion from the school district in a hearing separate from the legal ones.\n\"All of us should be outraged when those who educate us can be assaulted,\" FCSO Sheriff Bobby F. Kimbrough Jr. said in his department's release. \"We are praying for wholeness for those students who witnessed this and the educator involved.\"\nThe student faces one charge of communicating threats and two charges of misdemeanor assault. The sheriff's office says no additional information will be released since he is a juvenile.\nFormer teachers at the school told WFMY-TV they were not surprised after seeing the now-viral video of the assault circulating online, adding that behavioral problems at the school took a turn for the worse when students returned to the classroom following COVID-19 closures.",

            "excerpt": "Earth Day started in 1970 as consciousness raising. The 2024 version is a mix of woke and political correctness and at war with useful scientific discoveries like plastics.",
            "summary": "\"Planet vs Plastics\" is the theme of Earth Day this year. Why? Because, according to the event's organizers, \"plastics are a danger to humanity and all living creatures, disrupting the balance of life on Earth.\" Therefore, \"EARTHDAY.ORG is unwavering in our commitment to end plastics for the sake of human and planetary health, demanding a 60% reduction in the production of ALL plastics by 2040.\"\nThat sort of hyperbolic condemnation is typical of many recent Earth Days. The reality is that Earthlings and plastics must coexist. In many ways, plastics improve our quality of life. They have revolutionized medicine with life-saving devices, made space travel possible, lightened cars and planes (conserving fuel and lowering air pollution), and made all manner of consumer goods less expensive.\nIt is true that their convenience and low cost have spawned a throw-away culture that has a dark side: Single-use plastics currently account for about 40% of the plastic produced every year. That percentage could and should be reduced, but the absolutism of the Earth Day organizers illustrates what is wrong with today's environmental movement.\nThe first Earth Day celebration, a nationwide environmental teach-in held in 1970, was the brainchild of Democratic Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, who was interested in environmental issues.\nHe recruited Pete McCloskey, a conservation-minded liberal Republican California congressman, to serve as his co-chair. In the spirit of the time, it was a touchy-feely, consciousness-raising New Age experience, and most activities were organized at the grassroots level.\nSadly, today's Earth Day shares much with the current zeitgeist: It reeks of wokeness, political correctness and virtue signaling. It has devolved into an occasion for environmental activists to prophesy apocalypse, dish anti-technology dirt and allow passion and zeal to trump reality.\nA generation ago, the mantra was simple and broadly accepted: \"reduce, re-use and recycle.\" However, we hasten to note, as John Tierney highlighted in his classic New York Times Magazine piece, \"Recycling is Garbage,\" recycling isn't always beneficial.\nInstead of setting up a false dichotomy of \"Planet vs. Plastics,\" environmental activists would do well to redirect their zeal and predictions of catastrophe to imagining what we can do to protect the planet. A little innovation can go a long way toward protecting our environment.\nYet, unfortunately, many of those stumping for Earth Day on April 22 this year will oppose environment-friendly advances in science and technology. Consider these several examples:\nWe are now scratching the surface for ingenious ways to remediate contaminated soil by using plants with the ability to remove toxins such as heavy metals from soil. A comprehensive review of the progress and promise of this technique, known as phytoremediation, states that, \"Plant abilities to uptake, translocate, and transform heavy metals, as well as to limit their toxicity, may be significantly enhanced via genetic engineering.\"\nHowever, most prominent environmental groups oppose genetic engineering and would rather soil a promising technology than abandon a deeply held ideological position.\nSimilarly, some green groups opposed one of the most innovative efforts to address allegations of climate change caused by animal agriculture – the Impossible Burger, an ingredient of which is a plant-sourced protein, leghemoglobin.\nThe protein contains heme, also present in animal meat, and is partly responsible for the taste, texture and appearance of bloody-good meat. As Business Insider noted, \"a handful of environmental activists have also taken issue with the burger. But their issue with the burger isn't heme — it's the fact that the Impossible Burger is made using genetically engineered ingredients, or GMOs. Those concerns largely take the shape of the old and unsubstantiated claim that GMOs cause everything from autism to cancer, despite the scientific consensus that they are safe.\"\nA pervasive Earth Day meta-message will be disdain for the capitalist system that drives the innovation needed for effective environmental protection and conservation. (It's no coincidence that low-income countries tend to be the most polluted.)\n\"Education\" features prominently in Earth Day activities, as in, \"Fifty four years ago, the first Earth Day started an environmental revolution. Now, we are igniting an education revolution to save the planet. EARTHDAY.ORG passionately envisions a world where every student ... is embraced by a rich education weaving together climate and environmental understanding, coupled with a strong civic engagement component.\"\nWell, education can take many forms. For a previous Earth Day, seventh graders at a tony private school near San Francisco were given an unusual Earth Day assignment: Make a list of environmental projects that could be accomplished with Bill Gates's fortune.\nThis approach to environmental awareness fits in well with the progressive worldview that the right to private property is subsidiary to undertakings that enlightened thinkers deem worthwhile.\nAnd how interesting that the resources made \"available\" for the students' thought experiment were not, say, the aggregate net worth of the members of Congress but the wealth of one of the nation's most successful and most innovative entrepreneurs.\nAnother Earth Day assignment for those same students was to read Rachel Carson's best-selling 1962 book, \"Silent Spring,\" an emotionally charged but deeply flawed excoriation of the widespread spraying of chemical pesticides to control insects.\nAs described by Roger Meiners and Andy Morriss in their scholarly yet eminently readable 2012 analysis, \"Silent Spring at 50: Reflections on an Environmental Classic,\" Carson exploited her reputation as a well-known nature writer to advocate and legitimatize \"positions linked to a darker tradition in American environmental thinking: neo-Malthusian population control and anti-technology efforts.\"\nCarson's proselytizing and advocacy led to the virtual banning of DDT and restrictions on other chemical pesticides even though \"Silent Spring\" was replete with gross misrepresentations and atrocious scholarship.\nHer observations about DDT were meticulously rebutted point by point by J. Gordon Edwards, a professor of entomology at San Jose State University, a longtime member of the Sierra Club and the Audubon Society, and a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences.\nIn his stunning 1992 essay, \"The Lies of Rachel Carson,\" Edwards demolished her arguments and assertions and called attention to critical omissions, faulty assumptions, and outright fabrications.\nMeiners and Morriss concluded correctly that the influence of \"Silent Spring\" \"encourages some of the most destructive strains within environmentalism: alarmism, technophobia, failure to consider the costs and benefits of alternatives, and the discounting of human well-being around the world.\" Sounds a lot like the agenda of Earth Day 2024.\nHenry Miller, a physician and molecular biologist, is the Glenn Swogger Distinguished Fellow at the American Council on Science and Health.

            "summary": "Beverly LaHaye, the wife of the late evangelist Tim LaHaye and founder of Concerned Women for America (CWA), which describes itself as \"the nation's largest public policy women's organization,\" has passed away at the age of 94.\nCWA announced LaHaye died Sunday after forming the organization 45 years ago in \"response to the feminist movement of the time that she believed did not speak for the majority of American women.\"\n\"Mrs. LaHaye championed the forgotten women of this country, whose voices were not being heard in Washington and in the culture,\" Penny Nance, CEO and president of CWA, said in a statement. \"Her life is a testament to the impact one woman with a vision and mission can have on the course of history.\"\nThe CWA said LaHaye \"testified before Congress on multiple occasions against abortion and policies that dismantle the family and Christian values\" and \"worked closely with presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush as well as Members of Congress over the years.\"\nLaHaye was born in Detroit in 1929 and married ministerial student Tim LaHaye – a World War II Army Air Force veteran – a year after meeting him at Bob Jones University.\nThe couple had three children before relocating to San Diego in 1956 to begin their ministry at the Scott Memorial Baptist Church, according to her obituary.\n\"During that time of life Beverly had the opportunity to hear from a well-known Christian speaker who taught on the importance of being filled with the Holy Spirit. She was introduced to the concept that walking in the Spirit meant full dependence on Christ, no matter what she was called to do,\" it said. \"She was challenged to commit all aspects of her life … her marriage, her parenting, her fears, and her insecurities, into the hands of her Savior. This teaching changed her world.\"\nLaHaye launched CWA in 1979, which the obituary says, \"began as a local interest, but within two years, it had grown to become a national organization aimed at protecting and promoting Biblical and constitutional principles through prayer, education, and advocacy.\"\nIn 1985, the CWA moved its headquarters to Washington, D.C. and \"Beverly's growing influence in the conservative movement, as well as Republicans holding a majority place in office, led to LaHaye's prominence during the presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush,\" it said.\n\"She regularly testified in congressional hearings, including Supreme Court nomination hearings for Antonin Scalia, Robert Bork, and Clarence Thomas,\" it added.\nThe CWA now has chapters in nearly every state, and LaHaye – who has authored and co-authored several books and has received honors including the Southern Baptist Convention's Religious Freedom Award – retired from her role as president in 2006.\n\"Well into her eighties, Beverly still loved to be a voice in the cause and to educate future generations of Christian activists,\" her obituary says.",

            "summary": "Several congressional lawmakers decried antisemitism on college campuses, particularly Columbia University, this weekend as anti-Israel protesters briefly took over a part of the Ivy League school campus, resulting in hundreds of arrests.\nAmid the demonstrations that began last week, Columbia University President Dr. Nemat \"Minouche\" Shafik said in a statement posted Monday that she was \"deeply saddened\" by certain actions of agitators, who have formed an \"encampment\" on the campus and have riled students and faculty with anti-Jewish slogans and chants.\n\"I am deeply saddened by what is happening on our campus,\" Shafik wrote. \"Our bonds as a community have been severely tested in ways that will take a great deal of time and effort to reaffirm. Students across an array of communities have conveyed fears for their safety and we have announced additional actions we are taking to address security concerns. The decibel of our disagreements has only increased in recent days. These tensions have been exploited and amplified by individuals who are not affiliated with Columbia who have come to campus to pursue their own agendas.\"\nU.S. Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., visited the university over the weekend to stand with Jewish students, some of whom have said they don't feel safe on campus.\n\"Collectively, not just the folks here, but on a bipartisan basis, we in Congress are going to do something about it,\" he said in a video posted to X.\nRep. Rep Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J. condemned the Columbia protests in which demonstrators briefly set up an encampment on campus.\n\"The First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech and assembly, not freedom to harass and intimidate students just for being Jewish,\" he wrote.\nRep. Kathy Manning, D-N.C., said Columbia must educate its students and faculty about antisemitism while ensuring professors are not spreading hatred.\n\"It is critical that the Department of Education and the Department of Justice work with the White House to ensure that universities take steps necessary to keep Jewish students and faculty safe,\" she said in a statement.\nRep. Anthony D'Esposito, R-N.Y. called out protests in which pro-Palestinian supporters were heard chanting \"death to America\" and \"Death to Israel.\"\n\"This is truly an attack on democracy. It's an attack on our values,\" he said. \"It's not a Republican thing. It's not a Democrat (sic) thing. It's the right thing. To stand behind Israel. Stand behind its people and do the right thing.\"\nRep. Mike Lawler, also a New York Republican, said he was proud to co-sponsor a resolution introduced by D'Esposito that condemns the \"River to the sea chant,\" which many Jews have described as supporting the eradication of Israel.\nHe noted that 44 members of the House opposed the measure in a vote.\n\"It denies Israel's right to exist,\" Lawler said the popular pro-Palestinian saying. \"There is nothing aspirational about that. And the fact that 44 of my colleagues can't bring themselves to condemn it is appalling.\"",

            "summary": "The Congressional Progressive Caucus released an extensive 2025 policy agenda on Thursday, with its chair revealing that \"we are not seeing the momentum that we would like to see\" for President Biden's re-election bid.\nThe seven-point agenda, first obtained by NBC News, calls for a $17 minimum wage, free public higher education and comprehensive policing reform.\nIt sticks to domestic issues and makes no mention of the war in Gaza, which has once again been thrust into the national spotlight in recent days with anti-Israel protesters blocking roads and staging demonstrations around the country.\nThe Congressional Progressive Caucus did not immediately respond Thursday to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.\n\"If the progressive base is not excited and enthusiastic – and if they don't feel like we are trying to earn their votes and that they are important – then I think the horrific idea of a second Donald Trump presidency could become reality,\" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., who is the chair of the caucus, told NBC News. \"We cannot afford to let that happen. And we won't.\"\nIn an area of the agenda titled \"lowering health care costs,\" it calls for the creation of an Office of Drug Manufacturing within the Department of Health & Human Services that would be \"tasked with manufacturing select generic drugs, including insulin, and offering them to consumers at a fair price that guarantees affordable patient access.\"\nIt pushes to \"close the U.S. racial wealth and homeownership gaps by providing $100 billion in direct assistance to help first-time, working-class homebuyers purchase their first home.\"\nThe agenda also calls for an expansion of Social Security – which is already running into funding issues – and a minimum wage of $17 an hour by 2028.\nIn a section titled \"advance justice,\" the Congressional Progressive Caucus says it wants to \"codify the rights to abortion, contraception, and in vitro fertilization,\" pass a comprehensive policing reform bill, legalize marijuana, establish a committee to \"study and develop proposals for reparations for Black Americans,\" and create a \"fair and humane immigration system.\"\nOther parts of the agenda call to give Washington, D.C., statehood, ban Congressional stock trading and ownership, raise wages for teachers and to provide \"free tuition\" for public higher education.\n\"We have to excite our base. We have to show them what the path forward is – not just say, ‘This is the most important election of your life, and we expect you to vote.' I don't think that's going to turn people out. And so I think this agenda, really, speaks to the needs of poor people, working people, progressives across the country who want us to make that case to them,\" Jayapal told NBC News. \"We are not seeing the momentum that we would like to see. We're going to have a tough election. . . . We know we're going to have to put together that progressive coalition. And I think this is the thing that allows us to say, ‘Look, here's what we're fighting for.'\"",

            "excerpt": "Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee's plans to expand school vouchers and allow families to access public funds for private schooling has come to an end as legislative leaders do not reach an agreement.",
            "summary": "Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee conceded defeat Monday in his push to enact universal school vouchers this year, acknowledging there was \"not a pathway for the bill\" after months of Republican infighting.\n\"I am extremely disappointed for the families who will have to wait yet another year for the freedom to choose the right education for their child, especially when there is broad agreement that now is the time to bring universal school choice to Tennessee,\" Lee, a Republican, said in a statement.\nLee first unveiled his plans last fall to allow families to access public money for private schooling, regardless of income. At the time, he was surrounded by national school choice advocates, the state's top Republican legislative leaders and even Arkansas GOP Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who had signed into law a voucher proposal just that year and used the event to tout that a conservative education revolution was happening around the country.\nYet despite the initial support, Lee's vision was always considered ambitious in a state where rural GOP lawmakers have remained skeptical of losing limited public school money in their own districts.\nFor months, Tennessee's GOP-dominant General Assembly has been deeply divided on the details surrounding how such a statewide plan would work. Differing versions advanced in the House and Senate but ultimately stalled as legislative leaders worked behind the scenes to come up with a deal.\nBut as of last week, the tone inside the Tennessee Capitol had noticeably shifted as lawmakers entered into the final weeks of session and hopes of a deal began to plummet. As of last week, no one would publicly declare the bill dead, instead saying that ultimately that call had to come from Lee.\nLee has since promised to renew the school voucher talks next session, though it's unclear how much more successful that attempt will fare, as some members won't be returning next year because of retirement and others are facing opponents in this year's election.\nNotably, both House and Senate budget writers still set aside $144 million for the voucher expansion in their spending proposals. That means that money will sit idly for nearly a year until school voucher talks can resume next January.\n\"Many initiatives need multiple years, or even multiple general assemblies, before they are ripe for passage,\" said Senate Speaker Randy McNally. \"This is not an end, but a new beginning. Conversations will continue over the summer and fall, and we will revisit the issue next session with renewed purpose.\"\nLee first asked lawmakers to consider expanding school vouchers back in 2019, when the plan was to allow parents of students in certain low-income districts with three or more schools ranked in the bottom 10% to receive $7,300 from a government-authorized account to pay for approved expenses.\nAfter much editing, Republicans just barely passed a program that applied only to Democratic strongholds in Davidson and Shelby counties, which encompass Nashville and Memphis. Lee's victory came as some GOP members received assurances that it would never apply to their own districts.",

            "summary": "A woman was killed during an on-campus shooting at Delaware State University over the weekend, and a manhunt for the suspect or suspects is underway.\nThe victim is an 18-year-old woman, who hasn't been identified yet. She wasn't a registered student, according to a statement by the school president.\n\"Violence of any kind, particularly gun violence, happens too often on college campuses – large and small – throughout the country,\" DSU President Tony Allen said in a letter to the community.\n\"It does not make it acceptable, and it will never be rationalized away, minimized, or normalized here. Let us make sure we are collectively resolute on this point.\"\nGunshots rang out around 1:40 a.m. on Sunday in the area of freshman housing - Warren-Franklin Hall - and responding officers found the victim with a gunshot wound to her upper body, Dover police said.\nShe was rushed to an area hospital, where she died.\nThe woman's name hasn't been released until next of kin is notified. As of Monday morning, police don't have a description of a suspect (or suspects).\n\"The young lady tragically killed was merely 18 years old,\" the university president said. \"Although she was not one of our students, she was a daughter, a beloved family member, and a friend; and, senselessly, her life was cut short.\n\"We should pray for better days and pray for the safety and well-being of our campus as a whole.\"\nWhat sparked the fatal shooting, and the details surrounding the incident remain under investigation, according to police.\nTony Allen, the university president, said resident assistants worked with leadership and authorities \"to diffuse a tense situation.\"\nBut it's another example of on-campus crimes spiking after a decade of steady decline from 2010 to 2020, when crime bottomed out because of the pandemic.\nBut there's a recent uptick, according to the latest crime stats from the Department of Education.\nThere were 38,303 reported criminal offenses at colleges and universities in 2022, which is the federal government's latest data based on 5,783 institutions with 10,530 campuses.\nTo put the number in perspective, there were about 21,200 reported incidents in 2020, according to a September 2023 report by the National Center for Education Statistics.\nAllen alluded to the national upswing in on-campus crimes, which doesn't take into account the aftermath of Hamas' invasion of Isreal on Oct. 7, 2023 and current protests, in his strongly worded letter.\n\"Let me say that whoever believes that settling disagreements of any kind should be met with physical violence - including the threat of and eventual use of firearms - is simply not welcomed here,\" the university president wrote.\n\"An event that affects the safety of one of us affects all of us. That means each of us is responsible for holding one another accountable, saying so when something does not seem, sound, or look right, and denying wrongdoing in all its forms, no matter the person or the circumstance.\"\nClasses are scheduled to resume Tuesday, and the university will hold a forum for students, staff, faculty and parents.\nMeanwhile, police are tracking down leads to find the shooter.\nAnyone with information is asked to call the Dover Police Department at (302)736-7130. Callers may remain anonymous.\nTips may also be submitted to law enforcement through Delaware Crime Stoppers at 800-TIP-3333 or online at delaware.crimestoppersweb.com; a cash reward is possible for information leading to an arrest.",

            "excerpt": "Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, four-star general, spent 5 years as president of Columbia University, 1948-1953. Yet many appear to have forgotten his WWII-era warnings about rampant antisemitism.",
            "summary": "Dwight D. Eisenhower's career achievements are unparalleled in American history.\nPopular two-term president. Supreme Allied Commander of Allied forces in Europe in World War II. Led the epic D-Day invasion, helped reclaim postwar peace, launched NASA into orbit, sent America rolling down the interstate highway system.\nAlso mentored a then-future president, Ronald Reagan, on everything from national security to running for higher office.\nIke also served for five years as president of Columbia University.\nGiven the chaos and disruption on that campus in April 2024, however, it is almost unimaginable that a four-star general of his caliber would lead that institution of higher learning today.\nHe took the position at the top of the elite New York City Ivy League university in May 1948 — and resigned from it only after he won election to the U.S. presidency and moved into the White House in Jan. 1953.\nThe year he became Columbia's president, Eisenhower said, \"The principal purpose of education is to prepare the student for effective personal and social life in a free society. From the school at the crossroads to a university as great as Columbia, general education for citizenship must be the common and first purpose of them all,\" as Columbia itself noted.\nSeveral years before that, and as part of his lasting legacy, he vowed to keep alive the memory of the shock and horror, the images of evil lurking within our species, that he observed at the Ohrdruf concentration camp in Germany in April 1945.\n\"The things I saw beggar description,\" Eisenhower wrote to Gen. George C. Marshall, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in Washington, D.C.\n\"The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty and bestiality were so overpowering as to leave me a bit sick.\"\nThe victims were mostly Jews — first dehumanized by Adolf Hitler's far-left National Socialist German Workers Party, then brutalized in a systemic extermination of humans on an industrial scale.\n\"Bodies were piled like wood and living skeletons struggled to survive,\" the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum reported of Ike's arrival at Ohrdruf.\nEisenhower instinctively knew that the atrocities defied belief — and therefore needed proof.\n\"The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty and bestiality were so overpowering as to leave me a bit sick.\"\nHe vowed \"to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to ‘propaganda,'\" he wrote in his message to Gen. Marshall.\nOne third of the global population of Jews, about 6 million people, were slaughtered by the National Socialists in the Holocaust.\nMillions of other people were systemically killed, too.\nAt Eisenhower's frantic urging, members of Congress and a cadre of journalists descended on Ohdruf, and then on dozens of other death camps like it that the Allies discovered amid disbelief as they swept through Germany in the final weeks of World War II.\n\"He invited the media to document the scene. He compelled Germans living in the surrounding towns and any soldier not fighting at the front to witness the atrocities for themselves,\" the Holocaust Museum notes.\nIt added, \"Eisenhower foresaw a day when the horrors of the Holocaust might be denied.\"\nThat day is here right now — on the campus of Eisenhower's own Columbia University.\nAnti-Israeli student groups took over the Columbia quad this week as current university President Minouche Shafik testified before Congress on Wednesday about antisemitism on her campus.\nColumbia, and other schools around the nation, as well as city streets, have been overtaken by calls for Israel's destruction since the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attacks.\n\"Antisemitism has no place on our campus, and I am personally committed to doing everything I can to confront it directly,\" Shafik said in her opening remarks.\nComplaints of antisemitism and Islamophobia have increased at the New York City campus of 35,000 students, prompting the school to put limits on demonstrations, the Associated Press reported. Now, protests can be held only on weekdays at certain times and locations — with advance notice, the AP also noted.\nShafik cited this as evidence the school is serious about protecting students, saying 15 students have been suspended and six are on probation for breaches — though some maintain this interferes with free speech.\nYet a day after her appearance, a current Columbia University student who is of Jewish heritage told \"Fox & Friends\" on Thursday morning, April 18, that she does not feel safe at all on campus.\nColumbia, and other schools around the nation, as well as city streets, have been overtaken by calls for Israel's destruction since the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attacks slaughtered more than 1,000 civilian citizens of the Jewish-majority nation.\nAntisemitic protesters have shouted \"by any means necessary\" and \"from the river to the sea\" – essentially calling for another Holocaust, for the extermination of Jews.\nThe phrase \"by any means necessary\" has been spread around campuses, including Columbia's, by the far-left group National Students for Justice in Palestine.\nIts platform comes straight from Hitler's far-left National Socialist playbook: monolithic government and a belief that Jews are colonizers.\n\"A parasite in the bodies of other nations,\" as Hitler called Jews in \"Mein Kampf.\"\nColumbia's deans issued a statement on Dec. 20 that acknowledged the hatred on its campus.\n\"Phrases such as ‘by any means necessary' and ‘from the river to the sea,'\" the school noted, are \"antisemitic and deeply hurtful.\"\n\"Eisenhower foresaw a day when the horrors of the Holocaust might be denied.\"\nYet the shouts for the elimination of the Jewish state continue at Columbia and on other American universities today.\nEisenhower predicted this day.\nHe said the horrors of antisemitism, of the Holocaust, might be forgotten.\nMany believe that America's educational system today has failed to heed his important history lesson.",

That's according to the latest Fox News statewide surveys in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The polls were conducted April 11-16 and include over 1,100 registered voters in each state.\nThe surveys, released Thursday, show the head-to-head matchup between President Biden and former President Trump is tight. The candidates are tied in two states (Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) and Trump is ahead in two (Georgia and Michigan), although neither advantage is outside the margin of sampling error.\nIn addition, in all four state surveys:\nSee results from the individual state surveys: Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\nThe Fox News Poll is conducted under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R). The battleground surveys were conducted April 11-16, 2024, among registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file in Georgia (1,128), Michigan (1,126), Pennsylvania (1,141), and Wisconsin (1,198). Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines and cellphones or completed the survey online after receiving a text. Results based on the full sample in each state have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics of respondents are representative of the registered voter population.",

            "summary": "Multiple Los Angeles-area school districts have investigated instances of \"inappropriate,\" artifical intelligence-generated images of students circulating online and in text messages in recent months.\nMost recently, the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) announced that it is investigating \"allegations of inappropriate photos being created and disseminated within the Fairfax High School community,\" the school district told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"These allegations are taken seriously, do not reflect the values of the Los Angeles Unified community and will result in appropriate disciplinary action if warranted.\"\nA preliminary investigation revealed that the images were allegedly \"created and shared on a third-party messaging app unaffiliated with\" LAUSD. The school district said it \"remains steadfast in providing training on the ethical use of technology – including A.I. – and is committed to enhancing education around digital citizenship, privacy and safety for all in our school communities.\"\nAI apps and websites have the ability to superimpose photos of people's faces onto AI-generated nude photos, or in some cases, videos.\nTitania Jordan, chief parent officer at social media safety company Bark Technologies, told Fox News Digital in a statement that the recent incident within LAUSD \"is indicative of a larger problem affecting society: the use of AI for malicious purposes.\"\n\"Deepfakes — and specifically shared, fabricated non-consensual intimate images and videos — aren't just like fun TikTok or Snapchat filters. These deceptively realistic media can have devastating real-life consequences for the victims who did not consent for their likeness to be used,\" she said. \"Complicating matters is the fact that the technology behind them is getting better every day. It's already to the point where it can be hard to tell the difference between an authentic video and a deepfake.\"\nThe announcement comes after similar instances within the Beverly Hills Unified School District (BHUSD) and Laguna Beach Unified School District (LBUSD).\nEarlier this month, Dana Hills High School Principal Jason Allemann sent a letter to parents notifying them of AI-generated nude images of students circulating online, FOX 11 Los Angeles reported. The images circulated online and in text messages, according to the outlet.\n\"These actions not only compromise individual dignity but also undermine the positive and supportive environment we aim to foster at LBHS,\" Allemann said in the letter, according to FOX 11.\nAriana Coulolias, a senior at Dana Hills, told FOX 11 that the images looked \"really real.\"\n\"It's just kind of scary to see stuff like that happen,\" Coulolias told the outlet.\nIn February, middle school students informed Beverly Hills school administrators that inappropriate AI images were going around Beverly Vista Middle School.\n\"We want to make it unequivocally clear that this behavior is unacceptable and does not reflect the values of our school community,\" the district said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital at the time. \"Although we are aware of similar situations occurring all over the nation, we must act now. This behavior rises to a level that requires the entire community to work in partnership to ensure it stops immediately.\"\nThe district noted that misusing AI in such acts may not technically be a crime, as the laws are still catching up with the technology.\n\"[W]e are working closely with the Beverly Hills Police Department throughout this investigation,\" the district said. \"We assure you that if any criminal offenses are discovered, they will be addressed to the fullest extent possible.\"\nTitania Jordan with Bark Technologies noted that even Taylor Swift recently became a victim of \"this violation of privacy\" stemming from \" viral 4chan challenge\" using AI deepfake technology. \"Ms. Swift may have brought major attention to this issue, but it's been around for a while, and it happens more often than most people realize. Unfortunately, law enforcement and legal action have been slow to catch up to this technology because of how new it is,\" Jordan said.\nShe added that \"[s]tudents, families, and schools need to work together to educate their community about how dangerous and unacceptable it is to create deepfakes without permission.\"\n\"It's not just the potential harm from fake nudes, either — deepfake technology can also be used in scams, heists, and even to influence political behavior,\" Jordan explained.",

            "summary": "At least three female Arizona State University students were allegedly sexually assaulted by a \"random stranger\" in public areas of the Tempe campus in a 30-minute span.\nIt was described as \"an isolated incident\" on April 11 by the university in a statement to Fox News Digital, but it's an isolated incident for ASU, not the country, where a national spike in on-campus crimes has reverted to pre-pandemic highs, according to the Department of Education statistics.\nAt the end of February, four college students were murdered in a 10-day span, and just over the last week, two Appalachian State students allegedly stabbed a classmate, and Michigan State University reported a sexual-orientation-motivated assault in the campus library.\nPlus, antisemitic attacks on college campuses are on a \"drastic\" rise since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) said in a statement pushing a bipartisan bill to combat antisemitism on campuses.\nThere were 38,303 reported criminal offenses at colleges and universities in 2022, which is the federal government's latest data based on 5,783 institutions with 10,530 campuses.\nTo put the number in perspective, there were about 21,200 reported incidents in 2020, according to a September 2023 report by the National Center for Education Statistics.\nBefore that, the number of on-campus crimes decreased by 15% (32,100 to 27,200) between 2010 and 2019, the report says, before it bottomed out during the height of the pandemic in 2020.\nAs students returned to on-campus learning, criminal activity picked back up (as seen in the bar graph below), which is fueled by sex crimes, according to the report.\n\"It's terrifying,\" ASU student Addison Gleason told Fox 10 in Phoenix after his female classmates were attacked. \"Definitely makes it scary, especially when there's a lot of people that walk around, like, late at night.\"\nFront and center of the campus crime debate is the University of California, Berkeley, arguably one of the most prestigious schools in the country, and the so-called SafeBears, a group of more than 1,300 California parents and community allies working together to protect university students, their website says.\nThe SafeBears said on their site that there is a \"significant increase\" in violent crime in and around the campus.\nThat includes several shootings (one was fatal), gunpoint robberies and a stabbing near university housing. There was also a reported rash of break-ins.\nSo they took safety matters into their own hands by reaching into their wallets and ultimately shelling out $40,000 to hire private security, which sparked a contentious feud with university leaders.\nThe pilot program ended on March 23, and university leaders don't seem to want the program to return.\nA spokesperson from UC Berkeley told Fox News Digital in a previous interview, \"Hiring private security raises a number of concerns including the training and experience of individuals hired by such firms.\"\nBut even Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguín, who was a believer in the \"defund the police\" movement and cut almost $10 million from the police budget in 2020, created a crime preventative coalition two months ago.\nDuring a February press conference, he acknowledged the increase in criminal activity and said it's important to \"deter crime, and hold these individuals accountable.\"\nExperts haven't reached any definitives conclusions about what's fueling the rash of on-campus crimes that seem to headline news outlets every day across the country.\nMany point to a full return to school, with the pandemic in the rearview mirror, as a contributing factor, as well as overseas hostilities, such as the Hamas invasion of Israel.\nOddly enough, violence, particularly murder, dropped in the U.S. in 2023 and continues to decline in 2024, according to crime analyst Jeff Asher, despite several surveys and polls that show as many as 75% of Americans believe crime is still climbing.\n\"Murder is down around 20 percent in 2024 in more than 180 cities with available data this year compared to a comparable time frame last year\" Asher wrote in an April 4 post on Jeff-alytics.\n\"Murder is down 20.5 percent in 183 cities with available data through at least January, down 20.2 percent in 174 cities with data through at least February, and down 20.8 percent in 59 cities with data through at least March 20.\"\nBut colleges and universities seem to be on the reverse track, which has concerned parents – like the SafeBears – who are taking action.\n\"Beyond the private security pilot program, I think an organization like SafeBears is needed to hold the university and city accountable and to push for more safety measures,\" Victoria Cole, a UC Berkeley parent, told Fox News Digital in a previous interview.\nIt remains to be seen if on-campus crimes will even out, or if programs like SafeBears will become more common.",

            "summary": "FIRST ON FOX - A decades-old interview is adding to a widening scandal involving a former high-ranking Iranian official and controversial Princeton professor. Seyed Hossein Mousavian is accused of endorsing Hezbollah and Hamas in a 1997 German newspaper interview.\nThe new revelations about Mousavian's pro-Hamas and pro-Hezbollah interview in a German paper, coupled with what some claim was an endorsement of an Iranian regime fatwa (religious order) ordering the assassination of British-American author Salman Rushdie, comes at a time when the Ivy League professor is the subject of a congressional probe. Mousavian is currently facing a U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce investigation for allegedly advancing the interests of Iran.\nIn November, Fox News Digital exclusively reported on the investigation into Mousavian's ties to the world's worst state-sponsor of terrorism, the Islamic Republic of Iran. The investigation is ongoing, and the congressional committee has not issued any findings.\nIn an interview back in 1997 with the left-wing German daily paper Taz, Mousavian, who was Iran's Ambassador to Germany at the time, was asked if Iran supports groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. Mousavian seemed to put his support behind Hamas. \"If by that you mean that we supply Hamas with weapons: No, we do not. But if you mean that we support the Palestinians in their struggle, yes, we do.\"\nWhen asked by the paper if Iran provides Hezbollah support materially or financially, Mousavian said \"We support Hezbollah morally and not by supplying weapons.\"\nThe U.S. Middle East Media Research Institute first translated Mousavian's German language interview earlier this month on its website and provided background material on his alleged role in stoking terrorism in Europe, including the assassination of Kurdish dissidents in a Berlin restaurant named Mykonos in 1992.\nMousavian, a Middle East security and nuclear policy specialist at Princeton University, was hosted by the Obama administration, according to the Washington Free Beacon, at least three times at the White House, and invited to speak at an important U.S. STRATCOM military event in August 2023 during the Biden administration\nAccording to the congressional letter, first obtained by Fox News Digital, Mousavian's appearance at the STRATCOM symposium \"concerned members of the Armed Services Committees of both the House and the Senate. Additionally, aspects of this issue trouble us as members of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.\"\nMousavian told Fox News Digital in November that, \"My talk at the U.S. Strategic Command was all about peace in the Middle East and why the U.S. should avoid wars and focus on peace and cooperation.\"\nWhen asked by Fox News Digital if he considers Hamas and Hezbollah terrorist organizations, Mousavian refused to answer numerous Fox News Digital press queries via email, telephone and WhatsApp. Fox News Digital approached Princeton University via telephone and email for comment. The Ivy League institution did not respond to Fox News Digital's questions.\nMousavian also seemed to defend the Iranian-led campaign to assassinate U.S. and British writer Salman Rushdie because the famous novelist depicted the Muslim prophet Muhammad irreverently.\nIn 2022, a 24-year-old man named Hadi Matar, who is fan of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization, allegedly stabbed Rushdie in the neck and liver during the author's speech in Chautauqua, New York. After the attack, Rushdie lost sight in one eye and the use of one hand.\nA Nov. 5, 1992 Reuters report, titled \"German Opposition Wants Iranian Envoy Expelled,\" said that, \" ...Hossein Mousavian was summoned to the German Foreign Ministry after remarking in a radio interview that Bonn would not act against its trade interests with Iran to back Rushdie's request for the death decree to be lifted.\"\nThe Reuters report continued \"Social Democrat Freimut Duve told parliament in a special debate on what has become known as the ‘Rushdie Affair' that Mousavian should leave Germany as he did not respect its laws.\"\nIn the radio interview after Rushdie's appearance, Mousavian defended the historic Islamic practice of imposing the death sentence for blasphemy.\nMousavian declined to answer numerous Fox News Digital press queries about whether he continues to endorse the Iranian religious decree to murder Rushdie.\nMousavian denied his country's role in the Iranian state-sponsored murders of the four Kurdish dissidents in the Mykonos restaurant. He termed the Berlin court verdict, which convicted Iranian and Hezbollah operatives of the assassinations, as \"nonsense\" in the German Taz interview. Mousavian refused to answer Fox News Digital press queries about his rejection of the Berlin court Mykonos verdict.\nAccording to a 1997 article from the Berlin newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, Abolghasem Mesbahi, a former senior-level Iranian intelligence official, told a Berlin court during the Mykonos trial, \"Mousavian participated in most of the [Iranian regime's] crimes that took place in Europe.\"\nDuring Mousavian's tenure as Iran's ambassador to Germany, he was in charge of the embassy that the Berlin court found \"served as the ‘headquarters\" for the planning of the 1992 assassination of four Iranian dissidents at the Greek restaurant Mykonos in Berlin.\"\n\"This accusation is a big lie,\" Mousavian told Fox News Digital in November. \"The 398-page verdict is published, and everyone can have access to it. The Berlin court verdict does not contain any direct or indirect allegations against me. German authorities never forced me to leave the country. … I have been a frequent visitor to Germany,\" added Mousavian.\nThe calls for Mousavian to be fired coincide with the scandal-plagued pro-Iran regime academic, Mohammad Jafar Mahallati, who taught at Oberlin College in Ohio.\nMahallati was Iran's former ambassador to the U.N. from 1987-1989. Oberlin College ousted Mahallati in November 2023 after a mushrooming series of scandals, including Mahallati's pro-Hamas teachings and calls for the destruction of the Jewish state. According to Amnesty International, Mahallati covered up the Iranian regime's mass murder of 5,000 Iranian dissidents in 1988.\nThe California-based Alliance Against the Islamic Regime of Iran Apologists (AAIRIA) spearheaded the high-intensity campaign to fire Mahallati.\nIranian American human rights activist Lawdan Bazargan, the lead organizer on the AAIRIA campaign, told Fox News Digital about Mousavian \"It is profoundly disheartening that Princeton University would appoint such an individual, allowing him to masquerade as a proponent of peace. To think that an agent of an oppressive Islamic regime, known for its flagrant disregard for religious freedom and its menacing slogans of ‘death to America' and ‘death to Israel,' could have the audacity to proclaim involvement in peace initiatives is nothing short of a cynical farce.\"\nShe added, \"Princeton's endorsement of Mousavian tarnishes its reputation and undermines the principles of peace, tolerance, and academic integrity it purports to uphold.\"\nAAIRIA urged Princeton to summarily fire Mousavian, who is not a tenured academic, and the NGO announced a protest at Princeton University next week against the controversial academic. Just last month, the National Association of Scholars issued a call to terminate Mousavian's employment.\nA leading antisemitism expert has claimed that Mousavian's account contains antisemitic posts against Israel. Mousavian falsely claimed in an October X post that Israel bombed a hospital in Gaza and termed it \"a crime similar to the Holocaust of Nazi Germany.\"\nRabbi Abraham Cooper, the associate dean of the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center, told Fox News Digital that \"Cleary, this is a person who feels no matter what he does that his status will be protected at Princeton.\"\nRegarding Mousavian comparing Israel with the crimes of Nazi Germany, Cooper said \"that anyone who uses that language is proving his antisemitic credentials. He feels confident and is immune from any action against him.\"\nA Fox News Digital examination of Mousavain's X Posts since Oct. 7 shows the overwhelming number of posts are attacks on the Jewish state and support of many Hamas talking points, including that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.\nCooper said \"I think Princeton has a lot to answer for,\" and Mousavian should be disqualified as an academic in American higher education.\n\"To say this is a scandal would not give justice to the issues exposed. It might be time to call Princeton University forward at a congressional hearing because it covers issues of sensitive national security, \"said Cooper, who has testified in Congress about antisemitism.",

            "summary": "Florida school districts will soon have the option of allowing volunteer chaplains to counsel students under a bill signed Thursday by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who dismissed critics opposed to mixing religion with public education.\nThe only requirements for a chaplain to participate would be passing a background check and having their name and religious affiliation listed on the school website. The chaplains would \"provide support, services, and programs to students as assigned by the district school board.\" The law that takes effect July 1.\nDeSantis stressed that the program is voluntary. Schools don't have to have a chaplain and students don't have to work with them. Parental permission would be required if they do.\n\"No one's being forced to do anything, but to exclude religious groups from campus, that is discrimination,\" DeSantis said. \"You're basically saying that God has no place. That's wrong.\"\nFlorida is among more than a dozen states that have sought to create school chaplain programs. Texas became the first under a law passed in 2023.\nSupporters in Florida argued the legislation will provide another resource for children and pointed out that chaplains already serve in other government roles by working with police and serving in the military. The Legislature itself hosts a chaplain of the day when it's in session and there's a non-denominational chapel in the state Capitol.\nOpponents cite several problems with the new Florida law, including there being no training requirements for chaplains. They also fear that some students might be ostracized if they are atheist or belong to a non-Christian religion in a Christian majority district.\n\"When you have a military chaplain, they go through intensive training and they have to be in a position where they can provide information which is factually correct and appropriate to the situation,\" said Democratic Sen. Lori Berman of Palm Beach County.\nWithout that training, a chaplain could provide psychologically damaging counseling, Berman said. She suggested schools add more social workers, guidance counsellors or psychologists if they need them.\n\"Let's put the trained professionals in and not some unlicensed, untrained people with a religious affiliation,\" Berman said.",

            "summary": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Commission proposed Thursday to start negotiations with the United Kingdom to allow young people to move freely, work and study in both regions after Brexit — the U.K.'s departure from the EU four years ago.\nAccording to the EU, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU following a referendum in 2016 has damaged mobility between the two areas.\n\"This situation has particularly affected the opportunities for young people to experience life on the other side of the Channel and to benefit from youth, cultural, educational, research and training exchanges,\" the Commission said.\nWhen the U.K. was still a member of the economic and political bloc, its nationals had the right to live and work freely in the EU, with reciprocity for EU nationals in the U.K. Under the agreement proposed by the EU's executive arm, EU and UK citizens between 18 and 30 years old would be eligible to stay up to four years in the destination country.\nThe deal would also allow equal treatment of EU and UK students in the field of university tuition fees. Most EU students must now pay international tuition fees if they want to study in the U.K. The Commission says these vary between 11,400 and 38,000 pounds ($14,200-$47,300) per year and are a strong deterrent for EU students who generally don't have to pay as much within the bloc.\nThe Commission's recommendation will be discussed by EU member countries who must give the green light before the executive arm can start negotiations with the UK.\n\"We have successful Youth Mobility Schemes with 13 countries, including Australia and New Zealand, and remain open to agreeing them with our international partners, including EU member states,\" the British government said in a statement.\nThe U.K. has its own Youth Mobility Scheme, which it has offered to some EU member states. The Commission believes the British plan is less ambitious than its own proposal.\n\"Our agreements provide a valuable route for cultural exchanges providing partner countries are also willing to offer the same opportunities for young British people,\" the British government added.",

The Israeli pavilion was built in 1952 as a permanent representation of Israel inside the Giardini, the original venue of the world's oldest contemporary art show and the site of 29 national pavilions. Other nations show in the nearby Arsenale or at venues throughout the city.\nBut even before the statement, curators and critics had signed an open letter calling on the Biennale to exclude the Israeli national pavilion from this year's show to protest Israel's war in Gaza. Those opposed to Israel's presence had also vowed to protest on-site.\nItaly's culture minister had firmly backed Israel's participation, and the fair was opening amid unusually heightened security.\nThe national pavilions at Venice are independent of the main show, and each nation decides its own show, which may or may not play into the curator's vision. Patir's Israeli exhibit was titled \"(M)otherland.\"\nThe curators of the Israeli pavilion, Mira Lapidot and Tamar Margalit, said they were delaying the opening of the exhibit because of the \"horrific war that is raging in Gaza,\" but that they hoped the conditions would change, so the exhibit could open for public view.\n\"There is no end in sight, only the promise of more pain, loss, and devastation. The exhibition is up and the pavilion is waiting to be opened,\" they said. For now, a video work made by Patir can be seen through the pavilion window.\nThe (M)otherland exhibit was set to run from Saturday, April 20, through Sunday, November 24.",

            "summary": "Jerry Seinfeld's upcoming Netflix comedy will be featured during this weekend's IndyCar race at Long Beach as rookie Linus Lundqvist will drive a car painted to look like a Pop-Tart in recognition of the movie \"Unfrosted.\"\nChip Ganassi Racing's No. 8 will be painted in the texture of an unfrosted Pop-Tart along with images of Seinfeld and some of the movie cast members. The partnership, which is in collaboration with Ganassi sponsor American Legion, is promoting the May 3 film release.\nThe movie marks the directorial debut for the comedian.\nSeinfeld claimed all the way back in 2018 that he had been \"thinking about an invention of the Pop-Tart movie. Imagine the drunk on sugar-power Kellogg's cereal culture of the mid-60s in Battle Creek, (Michigan) That's a vibe I could work with.\"\nThe movie, co-written by Seinfeld, stars Seinfeld along with Jim Gaffigan, Melissa McCarthy, Amy Schumer, Hugh Grant, James Marsden, Bill Burr, Fred Armisen, Dan Levy and others. \"Unfrosted\" tells the tale of 1963 Michigan, the year before Pop-Tarts hit grocery store shelves.\n\"Making a movie about Pop-Tarts has led to so many wonderful, unexpected surprises, and as a car guy, I honestly cannot believe our film's logo will be on an IndyCar entry this weekend,\" Seinfeld said. \"I am grateful to Chip Ganassi Racing for making this happen, and honored to be affiliated with The American Legion and the work they do to support American Veterans.\"\nThe American Legion signed off on the promotion as part of its \"Be the One\" mission that aims to save the lives of veterans by raising awareness, destigmatizing mental-health treatment and educating veterans, service members and their loved ones about what to do when a person appears at risk of suicide. Comedy is often used as a way to alleviate the symptoms that can lead to thoughts of suicide.\n\"The ability for the American Legion to partner with Jerry Seinfeld, ‘Unfrosted' and Netflix is an incredible opportunity to expose our organization and the work we do for veterans to an entirely new audience within the entertainment community — and — the general public that are fans of Jerry Seinfeld and his comedy,\" said Dean Kessel, chief marketing officer of The American Legion.\n\"We know that humor can be therapeutic for those battling mental health issues. Partnering with the ‘Unfrosted' project ties nicely into our ‘Be The One' platform and our efforts to destigmatize veterans who are seeking help and our prevention of veteran suicide.\"",

            "excerpt": "Hundreds of protesters gathered at the University of Southern California on Sunday in support of Class of 2024 valedictorian Asna Tabassum after her commencement speech was canceled, along with other…",
            "summary": "Days after the University of Southern California (USC) announced it would cancel its valedictorian speech, along with all outside speakers during this year's commencement ceremonies, protesters gathered on the school's campus on Sunday to show support for the student.\nUSC announced it would not be allowing biomedical engineering major Asna Tabassum to give her valedictorian speech during the main stage commencement, which draws 65,000 people to the University Park Campus, following a series of social media posts she made about Israel.\n\"Given the highly publicized circumstances surrounding our main-stage commencement program, university leadership has decided it is best to release our outside speakers and honorees from attending this year's ceremony,\" a statement posted on the university's commencement website read.\nTabassum's social media, which critics called out as antisemitic, reportedly called for an end to the Jewish state. In a CNN interview, the USC valedictorian defended her position.\n\"The abolishment of the state of Israel, I‘d like to clarify, is the abolishment of an apartheid system. It inherently is a system that subjugates Palestinians as dehumanized. And it subjugates Palestinian life as not worth the same as other human life,\" she said.\nUSC's move sparked outrage as an organization called \"CODEPINK\" organized a demonstration to demand the school allow Tabassum to give her speech. \"As the LA Times Festival of Books was hosted this year at USC, we rallied in solidarity with the silenced 2024 valedictorian, Asna Tabassum! Shame on USC! Reinstate Asna's speech!,\" the group wrote in a post on X.\nAccording to the organization's website, CODEPINK is a feminist grassroots organization working to end U.S. warfare and imperialism, support peace and human rights initiatives, and redirect resources into healthcare, education, green jobs and other life-affirming programs.\nA spokesperson for the group told Fox News Digital that with the cancelation of all the graduation speakers, they are working on their next strategy.\n'Our hopes are that the voice of a young Muslim woman is not censored and silenced. Shame on USC for doing so,\" the group said.\nUSC says the valedictorian is not being silenced for her political views on the ongoing unrest in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas but for the safety of Tabassum and others in attendance.\n\"After careful consideration, we have decided that our student valedictorian will not deliver a speech at commencement. While this is disappointing, tradition must give way to safety,\" Andrew Guzman, Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs, wrote in the statement.\nGuzman stated that the decision was necessary in order to maintain the school and its students' safety.\n\"To be clear: this decision has nothing to do with freedom of speech. There is no free-speech entitlement to speak at a commencement. The issue here is how best to maintain campus security and safety, period,\" Guzman wrote.\nUSC also told The Los Angeles Times that they had received threats via letters, phone calls, and emails.",

            "excerpt": "A jawbone belonging to Marine Corps Captain Everett Leland Yager, who died in 1951, was recently positively identified after a boy turned over his rock collection to authorities.",
            "summary": "New Jersey researchers recently announced that a U.S. Marine's partial remains had been sitting in a child's rock collection for an unknown number of years.\nAccording to officials, the story begins with the death of Marine Corps Captain Everett Leland Yager in July 1951. He was flying over Riverside County, California, when an accident occurred during a military training exercise.\nThe young man hailed from Palmyra, Missouri. All of his remains were thought to have been taken there, according to a press release published by Ramapo College on Monday.\n\"All of his remains were recovered in the Riverside County, California area and buried in Palmyra, Missouri, or at least thought to have been,\" Ramapo College officials said in a statement.\n\"Fast forward years later to a child who wanted to build a rock collection, and increased said collection by one during a scavenging exploration, presumably in Arizona.\"\nEventually, it was discovered that the rock was really a human bone – a jaw bone, it would later turn out. The skeletal remains were handed over to the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office.\nThe office, along with the Yavapai County Medical Examiner, referred the case to the Ramapo College Investigative Genetic Genealogy Center in January 2023.\nResearchers used DNA analysis to link the bone to Yager, having obtained a sample from Yager's daughter.\nHis daughter may be Yager's last living child, as an online obituary indicates that his son Richard passed away in 2022. He was six years old when his father died.\n\"It was not until March 2024 that the DNA sample from Capt. Yager's daughter confirmed a parent/child relationship, resolving the case and confirming that Rock Collection John Doe was indeed Capt. Everett Leland Yager,\" Ramapo College's press release read.\nBut why exactly the jawbone was found in Arizona, when the accident took place in California, had stumped university researchers.\n\"One theory is that a scavenger, such as a bird, picked it up and eventually deposited it during its travels over Arizona,\" Ramapo College said in a statement.\nThe Yavapai County Sheriff's Office later told FOX 10 Phoenix that the \"rock\" belonged to the boy's grandfather, who found it in California and brought it back to Arizona.\n\"This case was a lesson in expecting the unexpected, and a testament to the power of IGG education at Ramapo College of New Jersey,\" Ramapo College IGG Center assistant director Cairenn Binder said in a statement.\n\"The team that worked on this case at our IGG bootcamp included some truly outstanding researchers, and we are so proud of them for helping to repatriate Captain Yager's remains and return them to his family.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to Yavapai County Sheriff's Office and Ramapo College for comment, but did not immediately hear back.",

            "summary": "That coffee you slurped this morning? It's 600,000 years old.\nUsing genes from coffee plants around the world, researchers built a family tree for the world's most popular type of coffee, known to scientists as Coffea arabica and to coffee lovers simply as \"arabica.\"\nThe researchers, hoping to learn more about the plants to better protect them from pests and climate change, found that the species emerged around 600,000 years ago through natural crossbreeding of two other coffee species.\n\"In other words, prior to any intervention from man,\" said Victor Albert, a biologist at the University at Buffalo who co-led the study.\nThese wild coffee plants originated in Ethiopia but are thought to have been first roasted and brewed primarily in Yemen starting in the 1400s. In the 1600s, Indian monk Baba Budan is fabled to have smuggled seven raw coffee beans back to his homeland from Yemen, laying the foundation for coffee's global takeover.\nArabica coffee, prized for its smooth and relatively sweet flavor, now makes up 60% - 70% of the global coffee market and is brewed by brands such as Starbucks, Tim Horton's and Dunkin'. The rest is robusta, a stronger and more bitter coffee made from one of arabica's parents, Coffea canephora.\nTo piece together arabica coffee's past, researchers studied genomes of C. canephora, another parent called Coffea eugenioides, and more than 30 different arabica plants, including a sample from the 1700s — courtesy of the Natural History Museum in London — that Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus used to name the plant.\nThe study was published Monday in the journal Nature Genetics. Researchers from Nestlé, which owns several coffee brands, contributed to the study.\nThe arabica plant's population fluctuated over thousands of years before humans began cultivating it, flourishing during warm, wet periods and suffering through dry ones. These lean times created so-called population bottlenecks, when only a small number of genetically similar plants survived.\nToday, that renders arabica coffee plants more vulnerable to diseases like coffee leaf rust, which cause billions of dollars in losses every year. The researchers explored the makeup of one arabica variety that is resistant to coffee leaf rust, highlighting sections of its genetic code that could help protect the plant.\nThe study clarifies how arabica came to be and spotlights clues that could help safeguard the crop, said Fabian Echeverria, an adviser for the Center for Coffee Research and Education at Texas A&M University who was not involved with the research.\nExploring arabica's past and present could yield insight into keeping coffee plants healthy – and coffee cups full – for future early mornings.",

Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, vetoed bills on Tuesday that would have codified biological sex definitions and permitted teachers in public schools to read or have a copy of the Ten Commandments in their classrooms.\nThe move drew criticism from the state Senate Republican caucus, who said Hobbs is \"abandoning God\" and that laws \"should be based in objective reality and uniform for all Arizonans.\"\n\"Instead of helping these confused boys and men, Democrats are only fueling the disfunction by pretending biological sex doesn't matter,\" Republican Senate president Warren Petersen said in a statement. \"Our daughters, granddaughters, nieces, and neighbors are growing up in a dangerous time where they are living with an increased risk of being victimized in public bathrooms, showers, and locker rooms because Democrats are now welcoming biological males into what used to be traditionally safe, single-sex spaces.\"\nSB 1628, called the \"Arizona Women's Bill of Rights,\" would have made the definition of biological sexes, either male or female only, \"objective and fixed.\" It would exclude gender identity \"or any other term that is intended to convey a person's subjective sense of self and may not be used as a synonym or substitute for the term sex.\"\nIt would also have maintained single-sex spaces \"to ensure girls' and women's protection and privacy in those spaces, while not changing current law or creating new restrictions on anyone's legal rights,\" according to the Republican Caucus.\n\"As I have said time and again, I will not sign legislation that attacks Arizonans,\" Hobbs said in a letter explaining her veto.\nAnother bill in the Arizona state senate, SB 1151, would have amended the state law to permit educators or administrators in any school to read or post in any school building copies or excerpts of the Ten Commandments.\nHobbs wrote in her veto letter that she had \"serious concerns\" about the constitutionality of the bill and called it \"unnecessary.\"\n\"I'm appalled the state's top elected official is abandoning God and the very foundation our country was built upon by not allowing teachers to expose their students to the morals and ethics outlined in the Ten Commandments,\" Sen. Anthony Kern, one of the bill's sponsors, said in a statement. \"When children are exposed to good, noble, honest, and righteous ideas, they are more prone to being better human beings with sound character, able to navigate life's problems with grace, and have a greater chance of treating each other with respect and dignity throughout life.\"\nDuring Hobbs' term as governor so far, she has reaffirmed her support for LGBTQ+ issues. Hobbs signed an executive order making gender transition surgeries and hormones covered under state healthcare plans last year.",

The pamphlets, which included a link to a Substack page, were \"propaganda-based\" and promoted far-reaching conspiracy theories such as that \"some of our educational institutions are a front for the mob,\" officials said.\nAfter he was engulfed in flames, Azzarello took a few steps and fell onto a police barrier and to the ground. Court officers, police officers and other witnesses attempted to extinguish the flames with coats and other items. The fire was eventually extinguished by responding police.\nAzzarello was transported to a burn center in critical condition. Four officers also suffered minor injuries from exposure to the fire.\nThe self-described investigative researcher arrived in New York City earlier in the week and began protesting in front of the courthouse, criticizing both Republican and Democrat politicians. His family was unaware he had traveled to the city.\nA police official said Friday afternoon that it \"appears he did post something about this event online prior to the incident.\"\n\"This extreme act of protest is to draw attention to an urgent and important discovery: We are victims of a totalitarian con, and our own government (along with many of their allies) is about to hit us with an apocalyptic fascist world coup,\" Azzarello wrote in a manifesto on the Substack page.\nThe park was open to the public at the time of the incident and Azzarello did not breach any security protocols, police said.\nAzzarello had three prior arrests across several days in Florida in August of last year, including for disturbing the peace and damage to property.\nHis behavior leading to the arrests allegedly included tossing a glass of wine at former President Bill Clinton's autograph on a wall protected by a frame inside the lobby of a hotel and, just two days later, stripping down to his boxers and yelling at customers at the same hotel.\nAfter his third arrest, Florida police said Azzarello was suicidal.",

            "summary": "Anti-Israel agitators were caught on video lighting flares outside a Columbia University \"occupation,\" as the president of the prestigious New York institution testified before Congress on antisemitism spikes.\nVideo shared online also showed demonstrators clad in Palestinian flags and other garb shouting through microphones, \"We want justice you say how,\" with the response being \"stop bombing Gaza now,\" \"stop arming Israel,\" and \"end the occupation now.\"\nDemonstrators set up what they deemed \"the Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" on campus the day Columbia University President Dr. Nemat \"Minouche\" Shafik testified before the House Education and the Workforce Committee in Washington, D.C., about the scourge of antisemitism seen after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks in southern Israel.\nAt one point, progressive \"Squad\" member Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., attempted to argue that there have been no \"anti-Jewish protests\" on campus, only those that are either \"pro-war\" or \"anti-war.\" However, House GOP Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., challenged Shafik's earlier testimony, getting the university president to concede that, indeed, the campus demonstrations where protesters shouted chants including \"F the Jews,\" \"Death to Jews,\" \"F Israel,\" \"No place,\" \"Death to the Zionist state,\" and \"Jews out\" were indeed \"anti-Jewish.\"\nHouse Republicans also grilled Columbia leadership over tenured professor, Joseph Massad, who celebrated the Oct. 7 attacks and Hamas' slaughter of nearly 1,200 Jews as \"awesome,\" \"astonishing,\" \"astounding\" and \"incredible.\" Shafik later confirmed Massad is under investigation for the antisemitic remarks, though he maintains his employment at the school.\nHundreds of protesters swarmed Columbia University's South Lawn while Shafik testified Wednesday, demanding \"divestment\" from Israel, according to the student newspaper, the Columbia Spectator.\n\"The presence of tents on South Lawn is a safety concern and a violation of university policies,\" a university spokesperson wrote in a statement to the Spectator. \"We are informing the students they are in violation of university policies and for their own safety and for the operation of the university they need to leave.\"\nThe student paper reported that the anti-Israel protesters were given paper notices from the university informing them around 7 p.m. that they should \"immediately cease your participation in this encampment and leave the campus.\"\nThe university notice told protesters to \"disperse by 11:00 a.m.\" or \"they would face sanctions.\"\nThe congressional hearing also featured discussion over consequences for students carrying out antisemitic demonstrations. The school suspended several students over an unsanctioned event that featured a speaker with known ties to a terrorist group, but lawmakers noted at Wednesday's hearing that those same students came back to campus and protested again anyway.",

            "excerpt": "The Chicago City Council has approved an extra $70 million in addition to an existing $150 million budgeted for this year for care of migrants in the city.",
            "summary": "The Chicago City Council on Friday green-lit an extra $70 million for the care of illegal immigrants in the Windy City despite a massive backlash from residents that foreign nationals are being prioritized over native Chicagoans.\nThe council voted 30-18 to approve the request made by Mayor Brandon Johnson in order to help deal with the ongoing migrant crisis it is facing. CBS News reported that the vote, which came after an hour of heated debate, accompanied an approval of $48 million in grant money from state and federal governments.\nThat money is on top of a $150 million assigned to migrant care in the budget already. Johnson, along with a number of other mayors, have appealed to the federal government for billions more in funding than it is already providing.\n\"Yes, this is a challenge. Do we want to spend this money like this right now? Of course not, but again, we have an obligation, and we have a responsibility to move this ball forward,\" said Jason Erwin, the council's budget committee chair, according to CBS.\nJohnson's office had said the funding request was to ensure the city is prepared \"should there be any sudden increases in new arrivals sent by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.\" The city aims to provide \"basic necessities\" including food, shelter, medical care, education, vaccines, case management and resettlement support.\nAccording to Johnson's office, the city has at its peak been dealing with more than 2,000 migrants coming in a week. Nearly 40,000 have arrived since August 2022. The mayor has also been calling for more funding, national coordination of resettlement and faster employment documents.\nHowever, residents showed up in force at a City Council meeting on Wednesday to protest the request for more funding ahead of the vote, with furious residents accusing the government of prioritizing funds to migrants that should be going to residents.\n\"We need that money in my neighborhood, we need that money on my block,\" railed one Black woman wearing a red \"Make America Great Again\" cowboy hat. \"So I'm asking y'all to use our tax money for our people, we need it.\"\n\"Vote for the money for these immigrants today and we coming for those seats, you can believe that,\" she said. \"You better be worrying about your job, you better be worrying about your longevity because we gonna vote and we gonna getcha out, 'cause you ain't doing right by us, that's what time it is.\"\n\"They're showing up here in New York and Chicago attacking people in the streets,\" another resident said on Wednesday. \"The police are fighting with them in the… shelters that you guys are funding.\"\nMeanwhile, some residents have been pushing to recall Johnson. A group is currently laying the groundwork by gathering signatures for a ballot referendum to change state law, which currently does not allow for the recall of anyone except the governor.",

Ilhan Omar's, D-Minn., daughter says she has nowhere to go and nothing to eat following her suspension from Barnard College after taking part in anti-Israel protests at Columbia University last week.\nIsra Hirsi was among more than 100 people arrested and issued a summons for trespassing on Thursday after protests at Columbia University. Hours earlier, she said she had been suspended from Barnard College for \"standing in solidarity with Palestinians facing a genocide.\"\nThe 21-year-old has gone into more detail about the suspension. Along with not being able to go to classes, she said she has been evicted from campus housing and banned from using the dining hall with her meal plan.\n\"I was a little bit frantic, like, where am I going to sleep? Where am I gonna go? And also all of my s--- is thrown in a random lot. It's pretty horrible,\" she told Teen Vogue. \"I don't know when I can go home, and I don't know if I ever will be able to.\"\nThe student said she reached out to campus administration, but did not hear back until 48 hours after her suspension was handed down, when she was told she could pick up a prepackaged bag of food.\nBarnard College is one of four Columbia undergraduate schools that has an independent admissions process, curriculum and financial structure, as well as a separate administration, according to the New York Post. The college did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.\nDozens of anti-Israel activists began protesting at Columbia University on Wednesday morning, creating an encampment on the main lawn in protest of Israel's war against Hamas. Protests continued into the overnight hours with calls for an intifada and the death of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nOmar praised her daughter's participation in the protests. Earlier in the week, she questioned Columbia administrators during a congressional hearing on Capitol Hill about anti-Israel activism on the Ivy League campus.\nDuring the hearing, Omar sounded the alarm about what she called an \"attack\" with a \"toxic chemical substance\" at an anti-Israel protest at Columbia University. However, according to court documents, the substance was a non-toxic flatulence spray called \"Liquid A--\" and \"Wet Farts.\"\nFox News Digital has reached out to Omar's office.\nRep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., suggested Hirsi's suspension was a reprisal for her mother's questions.\n\"The day after @IlhanMN questioned Columbia leadership's commitment to free academic expression, the school suspended her daughter?\" Bowman posted online. \"It's clear what is happening here. Our educational institutions should not be in the business of political reprisals.\"",

            "summary": "Hollywood actress Susan Sarandon joined the pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University this week, marching with anti-Israel demonstrators and leading them in a chant despite being dropped from her talent agency months ago for appearing at a similar rally.\nFootage captured Sarandon marching with a crowd of Columbia students just outside of campus on Friday, as they chanted, \"Columbia, you will see! Palestine will be free!\"\nAnother recording captured Sarandon addressing the students, which amounted to a speech she broke into stanzas for the demonstrators to repeat.\nShe began, \"It is very important\" – followed by repetition – \"to have their voices heard\" – followed by a repetition, with the rest of the speech being broken into stanzas that the students chanted in return.\nA chunk of Sarandon's speech went, \"It is very important to have their voices heard and that this is their right in a democracy, especially in a place of education and supposedly higher thought. To be attacked with racism and intolerance is not acceptable.\"\nShe continued in chant form, \"There are many, many people who stand with you. You must know that you inspire so many people, people who are afraid, people who are old and afraid, are looking to you and your voices and your organization and your tenacity and your kindness to make a difference in this situation.\"\nFootage of the actress' presence near campus marked another day of fiery protests at and around the New York City campus that began Wednesday as dozens of anti-Israel activists created an encampment on the main lawn of campus.\nThe protests continued into the night and into the next couple of days with protesters calling for an intifada and the death of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. One Jewish Columbia University student was even told to \"kill yourself\" and repeatedly kicked in the stomach during the protests.\nThe tension reached a breaking point on Thursday, when the NYPD arrested 108 people who refused to leave the encampment. Each was given a summons for trespassing.\nAmong the arrested was Rep. Ilhan Omar's, D-Minn., daughter, Isra Hirsi, who claimed she had been suspended from the nearby Barnard College for participating in the protests.\nSarandon has made a number of appearances at pro-Palestinian rallies since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel. Most notably, her appearance and speech at a pro-Palestinian rally in New York City on Nov. 17 prompted her talent agency, UTA, to drop her as a client.\nDuring the demonstration, the Academy Award-winning actress addressed the crowd, stating, \"There are a lot of people that are afraid, that are afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are getting a taste of what it feels like to be a Muslim in this country, so often subjected to violence.\"\nAfter the event, a UTA spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital that Sarandon was no longer repped by them.\nSuch repercussions have not deterred Sarandon's pro-Palestinian activism, as she has attended multiple rallies since then, including another one in New York City where over 100 protesters were arrested for blocking traffic around Manhattan.",

            "summary": "A senior at Columbia University decried her institution and classmates who took part in anti-Israel protests on campus and in greater Morningside Heights.\nKatie, who described herself as being of Iranian descent with elders who escaped the theocratic hardliner regime in Tehran to avoid religious persecution, said she had to move off campus because the demonstrations in Morningside Heights became too overwhelming.\nIn one clip aired by \"The Story,\" young people — some clothed in Palestinian flags — were seen shouting their hope that every day would be \"an Oct. 7\" in reference to Hamas' massacre of Israeli civilians last October.\nKatie said her friend shared the video with her, which appeared to be taken near a food cart on Broadway.\n\"I think Columbia certainly has a lot of culpability in this. They've hired professors who have said that these attacks on Oct. 7 were awesome, were great victories for the Palestinian martyrs, and who have been known to be antisemitic,\" Katie said.\nShe highlighted one Arab studies professor who was invoked during a recent House Education Committee hearing where the school's president was being grilled.\nRep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., asked Columbia President Minouche Shafik on Wednesday about Dr. Joseph Massad's comments about the Hamas Oct. 7 massacre.\nWalberg noted Massad wrote at the time about the \"innovative Palestinian resistance\" and of \"awesome\" scenes from that day — although not the massacre directly. In response, Shafik said in part that she condemns the professor's remarks and that he \"has been spoken to,\" though her fuller answer was interrupted by the lawmaker.\nOn \"The Story,\" Katie cited Massad as an example of a factor that could lead to students protesting so virulently.\n\"You wonder how these students get indoctrinated with these beliefs, but I think it goes even deeper than that, honestly. I think it's a rejection of American values,\" she said.\n\"As a descendant of Iranians who escaped the regime for religious persecution, I'm so grateful, and so is my family, to be in such a wonderful country, to have these freedoms, and the fact that people take advantage of it not only to spew hate, but also to take it to this level to burn the American flag.\"\nKatie added that the protests changed her view of the school for which she had worked toward attending all her life. She said Columbia was her \"dream school,\" but that it's become a \"miserable\" experience.\n\"I cannot wait to get out of there, and I will never return,\" she said, adding she also moved off campus.\n\"So many people, including people who I was friends with, turned out to support the murder of my friends and family,\" she added.\nKatie said the protesters' claims the IDF are an imperial, bloodthirsty militia are not grounded in fact — as she compared the Israeli military to that of U.S. forces, whom she described as a \"moral, wonderful, defensive force that takes so many precautions.\"",

It's a death warrant on Palestinians,\" Bush said Saturday at an anti-Israel rally on Capitol Hill. \"It's a death warrant that says it means that. Apparently, it means that Palestinians are not as valued, that their lives are not as valuable as Israeli lives. And I have to say this.

For her part, Tlaib, who has Palestinian roots, has been a vocal critic of Israel even before Oct. 7.\nFox News Digital has reached out to Tlaib's office.\nRepublicans, for the most part, have been united in their support for Israel and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nMany critics have accused the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) of committing genocide as it battles Hamas fighters in Gaza. Israeli and U.S. leaders have pushed back against those claims.\n\"If we don't move now, if we don't say cease fire now. So many will die,\" Bush said. \"So we didn't have to be at 34,000, plus tens of thousands more under rubble, plus folks dying from starvation.

Yes. We won't stop fighting for humanity. We won't stop fighting for every single Palestinian. For every single person in the region.

            "excerpt": "Louisiana holds many attractions that tourists might not know about, like nearly two dozen state parks, 10 state museums and festivals all year round.",
            "summary": "Louisiana is a state with a rich cultural history and an irresistible charm.\nWhile almost everyone has heard of Louisiana Cajun cooking and New Orleans' Mardi Gras celebration, the Bayou State has even more to offer.\nLouisiana is home to a litany of festivals all year round as well as nearly two dozen state parks and 10 state museums. And, of course, Cajun food and Creole food; as any Louisiana native would tell you, there is a difference.\nLouisiana's 21 state parks are dispersed across its northern, central and southern regions. Water sports, hiking and fishing are popular activities in the parks, and many flock to the parks to witness the seasonal migration of diverse varieties of birds.\nChicot State Park is the largest in Louisiana at 6,400 acres. The park is popular among canoeing, kayaking and fishing enthusiasts, and it has even been the site of state record-setting freshwater catches. Visitors can hike trails around Lake Chicot and keep their eyes peeled for wild creatures like deer and bobcats that call the rural park home.\nThe park is also the site of the Louisiana State Arboretum, a 300-acre forest that is a favorite of camping fans. Miles of hiking trails, including boardwalks over the water, are waiting to be explored, and boating around the cypress trees growing out of the water is an experience unlike any other.\nFontainebleau State Park is located about an hour from New Orleans. Inside the park, visitors can imagine the hustle and bustle of what used to be the sugar plantation on which the park is now built. Aged brick ruins still dot the landscape, and the park offers an educational experience with items such as old handcrafted tools on display.\nFontainebleau offers campsites, hiking trails and a scenic pier over Lake Pontchartrain, as well as swimming at the lakefront and cabins with beautiful lakeside views. Its 2,800 acres contain ample opportunities to see more than 400 species of birds and other wildlife that live or migrate through the park. Like most of the Pelican State, Fontainebleau State Park falls within the Mississippi Flyway, a bird migration route that stretches from central Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, so if you time your visit just right, you could be in for a show.\nThough the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, a native Louisianian would never get them twisted.\nCajun food comes from the French colonists who lived in the Acadia region of Canada before they were ousted by the British and subsequently moved to Louisiana. The term \"Cajun\" is derived from the name for this group in French, \"les Acadiens.\"\nCajun food is known for its abundant seasoning, especially cayenne pepper, and using a base of celery, onion and bell pepper. The French colonists' influence mixed with the other cultures of the bayou to produce what we today think of as Cajun-style cooking.\nIt is sometimes said that Creole food is from the city and Cajun food is from the countryside. This may be because Creole food originated in high-society kitchens, where it was typically cooked by slaves who had access to a wider variety of ingredients and spices. As a result, the Creole cultural blend that includes Spanish, African, Caribbean, Native American, German and Portuguese influences seeped into the cooking and produced dishes that involved a greater number of components than most Cajun food. Cajun food is also less likely to contain tomatoes.\nThough Louisiana is home to more than 10 museums, its 10 state museums are some of its most popular.\nThe 1850 House is a model of what an upper middle-class New Orleans home might have looked like in 1850, a prosperous time period for the city.\nThe Cabildo is one of New Orleans' most important historical buildings. It is where the Louisiana Purchase transfer ceremonies took place in 1803 and where the landmark Plessy v. Ferguson decision was given in 1892. Much more has happened here, but since 1908, the Cabildo has served as a Louisiana history museum.\nThis museum traces Louisiana's unique cultural heritage, explaining how European colonists, Native Americans and enslaved Africans came together to create the culture of the Bayou State. Rotating and permanent exhibits expose Louisiana's diverse history.\nOn the scenic Bayou Lafourche, this National Historic Landmark was home to Edward Douglas White, governor from 1835 to 1839, and his son, Edward Douglass White, the U.S. Supreme Court chief justice from 1910 to 1921. The museum explores the family's history as well as that of the Bayou Lafourche region, featuring exhibits on the Chitimacha Indians, Acadian settlers, slavery and sugar cane plantations.\nThe Louisiana Civil Rights Museum features three dynamic exhibits titled \"the Right to Assemble,\" \"the Right to Education\" and \"the Right to Vote.\" They bridge the gap between late-19th century events and the modern civil rights movement through videos, oral histories and an interactive virtual reality room.\nTwo museums were combined into one site. As you might expect, the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame lauds the achievements of Louisiana athletes and coaches, illustrating sports' importance in Louisiana life. The Northwest Louisiana History Museum honors the history and culture of the region.\nMadame John's Legacy is another National Historic Landmark and one of the best examples of French colonial architecture in North America. It is one of the few remaining Louisiana-Creole, 18th-century residential-style buildings.\nThe New Orleans Jazz Museum is in the heart of the city's vibrant music scene, right on Frenchman Street's live music corridor. The museum includes a state-of-the-art performance venue with a near-perfect sound environment used to record performances for historical archives. The Jazz Museum promotes the global understanding of jazz as one of the most historically pivotal musical art forms in world history.\nThe Presbytère features a permanent exhibit on Mardi Gras, diving into the history and culture of the yearly festival, and another on Hurricane Katrina and the ensuing rescue, rebuilding and renewal. The building was designed in 1791 to match the Cabildo and was built on the site of the residence, or \"presbytère,\" of Capuchin monks.\nThe Wedell-Williams Aviation Collection tells the story of Louisiana aviation pioneers Jimmie Wedell and Harry P. Williams. The Cypress Sawmill Collection documents the history of the cypress lumber industry in Louisiana, the state's first significant manufacturing industry.\nAside from sampling regional cuisine, exploring natural wonders and learning American history, there is always a festival or celebration of some kind going on in Louisiana. The ever-popular Mardi Gras serves as the state's calling card, but cultural enrichment opportunities abound all year round.\nIn downtown Shreveport in autumn, the Red River Revel comprises musical performances all day for nine days in a row. Businesses and families alike take advantage of the lively atmosphere to network and bond as they admire the artwork on display by visual artists who congregate to sell their pieces.\nThis food festival is another fall favorite that includes live music and plenty of activities for the whole family. In downtown New Iberia, a weekend of local cooking competitions determine the yearly winner of the Gumbo Cookoff, Youth Gumbo Cookoff, Meanest Beans Competition and more.\nEach June sees the monthlong Food, Wine, Music & Art Festival return to Historic Downtown Covington. The month is filled with special events like wine tastings and Vintners' Dinners, during which participating restaurants cook gourmet meals served with wine pairings. Proceeds benefit marketing for local businesses through nonprofit organizations.\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle.",

            "excerpt": "Chicago voters are pushing back against Mayor Brandon Johnson for his 'insulting' and 'disrespectful' migrant funding plan that would re-allocate tax dollars to illegal immigrants.",
            "summary": "An outraged Chicago resident spoke out against Mayor Brandon Johnson for re-purposing tax dollars for illegal immigrants shortly before the city is set to vote on a $70 million proposal to bolster sanctuary city resources.\n\"P-Rae\" Easley called out Johnson for the \"disrespectful\" effort to use residents' hard-earned tax dollars for the migrant crisis during \"Fox & Friends,\" but also thanked him for inadvertently uniting the city against the proposal.\n\"It's the most disrespectful thing we've ever encountered in our lives,\" Easley told Lawrence Jones on Friday.\n\"We've been paying property taxes in the city for generations, and to see them so openly give our money to people who don't deserve it is very insulting. … I want to thank our mayor for uniting the city in a way that we haven't seen since the '96 Bulls, and that's against him and this progressive agenda,\" she said later in the interview, referencing the NBA team's dynasty under Michael Jordan.\nHer remarks come after she and other residents showed up in force at a City Council meeting on Wednesday to protest the liberal mayor's request for an additional $70 million in taxpayers' funds to be spent on tackling the migrant crisis, while a petition that would give residents the right to recall the mayor is gathering traction.\nThe progressive mayor, who has vigorously defended the city's sanctuary policies in the past, wants aldermen to greenlight the extra cash despite the Windy City having already poured $300 million into housing, food and health care for migrants, according to the city's latest numbers.\n\"They're showing up here in New York and Chicago attacking people in the streets,\" another resident said on Wednesday. \"The police are fighting with them in the… shelters that you guys are funding.\"\nThe $70 million, should the full City Council approve the proposal, will be drawn from the city's assigned fund balance from 2022, Budget Director Annette Guzman said Monday, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.\nEasley slammed city leaders for entertaining the allocation given the fact the city has struggled to provide funding for basic city resources like education.\n\"It's extremely insulting,\" she said. \"They've been telling us my entire life that they don't have money for this. They don't have money for that. We have to compromise. We must go without, but now we're seeing that they are able to print money out of the clear blue sky, and we want to know why wasn't our tax money given to us?\"\nEasley suggested that because the city has been united against Johnson's progressive agenda, Chicago voters are likely to head to the polls in droves in November to invoke change at the national level.\n\"We are looking forward to bringing back Donald John Trump Sr. as our 47th president,\" Easley said. \"He's the only president who has a plan to close the southern border, which is going to cut off the pipeline of human and drug trafficking that's flooding the West side of Chicago, and we cannot wait to get you back in office. Mr. President, please come see us in Chicago.\"",

            "excerpt": "Kurt 'CyberGuy\" Knutsson reveals how a Redditor exposed false recycling claims at their apartment, highlighting a report that only 21% of U.S. recyclables are processed.",
            "summary": "Imagine diligently separating your recyclables, placing them into the green bin as instructed, and then discovering it's all for naught. That's the frustrating reality a Redditor faced, sparking a conversation on r/Apartmentliving about the disheartening state of recycling in their complex. The green dumpster was just a facade, and the company didn't even offer residential recycling. It begs the question: Is anyone else's complex out there lying about something so obvious?\nThis isn't an isolated incident. Across the nation, renters find themselves handcuffed by landlords who block eco-friendly practices like gardening or air-drying laundry. Yet, there's hope. In the U.S., 74 million people live under homeowners associations where there's room to navigate or even alter the rules for the betterment of the community.\nThe discourse on Reddit resonates with many who share similar struggles. One user lamented their building's failed recycling attempt due to contamination, and another mentioned the absence of recycling services altogether, leaving the responsibility on individuals to transport recyclables to centers.\nIn Washington, D.C., a report by The Recycling Partnership sheds light on the dire state of U.S. residential recycling. A mere 21% of recyclables actually get recycled. The report, \"State of Recycling: Present and Future of Residential Recycling in the U.S.,\" reveals the gap between current practices and the five pillars of an efficient recycling system. It's a call to action for policymakers, companies and communities to bridge these gaps.\nUnder-recycled materials: A staggering 76% of recyclables end up in the trash at home. Only 73% of households have recycling access, with a significant disparity between single-family (85%) and multifamily homes (37%). Participation is low, with only 43% of households recycling, and even then not to full potential.\nState-by-state disparities: Some states like Alabama and Mississippi recycle less than 10%, while others like California and New York exceed 30%. The report suggests that extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies could elevate recycling rates significantly.\nThe million-ton loss: Eleven states, including some with high recycling rates, lose over a million tons of recyclables each year. Local investment solutions are crucial for revamping the recycling infrastructure.\nThe Recycling Partnership's Chief System Optimization Officer, Cody Marshall, emphasizes the need for comprehensive action. Investing in access to recycling services and improving communication can lead to substantial progress. The report urges:\nPolicymakers: Adopt EPR to fund recycling improvements.\nCompanies: Design recyclable packaging and invest in closing the system's gaps.\nCommunity leaders: Use the report's data to enhance recycling efforts through education and engagement.\nThe report is an urgent call for action. Systemic change is a slow process, but the road map is clear. It's time for concerted efforts to ensure recycling fulfills its role in waste reduction and resource conservation.\nThe stories shared by individuals on platforms like Reddit aren't just tales of frustration; they're a rallying cry for change. From the deceptive green dumpsters to the stark disparities in recycling access, the issues are as real as they are widespread. But there's a silver lining – the collective voice of communities and the actionable insights from reports like The Recycling Partnership's are powerful catalysts for change. It's a reminder that every effort counts, and together, we can turn the tide on the recycling conundrum we find ourselves in.\nWhat changes do you think are necessary to make a real impact as far as recycling in this country?

            "excerpt": "Columbia University student, professor and alum react to anti-Israel protests on campus, including saying the protesters have crossed the line and become violent.",
            "summary": "Anti-Israel agitators on Columbia University's campus have \"crossed the line\" and become a terrorist organization amid ongoing protests at the Ivy League school, a professor told Fox News Digital.\n\"Yesterday, what we saw is that the pro-terrorist student organizations have crossed the line to being an actual terror organization,\" business professor Shai Davidai told Fox Digital.\nDavidai cited video footage from Saturday as a breaking point for when protesters \"crossed the line.\" One demonstrator was seen holding a sign reading, \"Al-Qasam's next targets,\" while pointing at a group of Jewish students who were singing and waving Israel's flag. Al-Qassam is the military wing of the terrorist organization Hamas.\nHundreds of protesters were seen on Columbia's campus again Saturday, with social media videos showing them releasing red smoke while chanting in front of the Columbia East Gate.\n\"Up, up with liberation. Down, down with occupation,\" they yelled through the locked campus gate.\nThe protesters also shouted and chanted: \"Al-Qassam you make us proud, kill another soldier now,\" \"We say justice, you say how. Burn Tel Aviv to the ground!\" and \"Hamas we love you. We support your rockets too!\"\nThe protests, which follow war breaking out in Israel on Oct. 7, focus on demands from students and protesters that Columbia completely divest from Israel.\n\"We demand that Columbia sever academic ties with Israeli universities and we demand that Columbia stop censoring and intimidating students who are standing up and advocating for Palestinian liberation,\" one protester yelled last week, the New York Post reported.\nDavidai pinned blame for the antisemitism on campus to the administration and faculty who, he says, encouraged the protesters after they failed to take any action on campus antisemitism since war broke out in Israel.\n\"All the faculty that were named in the congressional hearing, and more, are not just egging them on, not just cheering them on, but they have been repeatedly showing up in the illegal encampment of terrorists and telling them to keep going. And encouraging them to fight until the end, no matter what. And finally, they are being encouraged by the administration, who did a big show on Thursday of bringing in the NYPD, arrested 108 students for trespassing, and like a turnstile, brought them back on campus,\" he said.\nDavidai compared the protests and antisemitism to a fire, arguing that \"student mobs that are being brainwashed are the burning material,\" while the \"administration that has done absolutely nothing for six freaking months\" serves as the oxygen that feeds the fire, and the \"the pro-Hamas professors are the arsonists.\"\nAt least three people were arrested Saturday, according to the New York Post, including for disorderly conduct. Another person was seen being carried out on a stretcher by EMS and treated for an unknown issue.\n\"We want justice, you say how? Stop arming Israel now!\" the protesters chanted Saturday.\nThe protest Saturday comes after more than 100 protesters were arrested on Thursday, when police raided a tent encampment they set up, dubbed the \"Gaza Solidarity encampment\" and \"liberated zone.\" Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar's daughter was among those arrested on Thursday, after she said earlier that day she was suspended from Barnard College for \"standing in solidarity with Palestinians facing a genocide,\" Fox Digital previously reported.\nDavidai also took issue with New York politicians who have remained silent on the protests, pointing specifically to Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand as \"shameful.\"\n\"And Chuck Schumer, who's the senator of New York, has said absolutely nothing. And Gillibrand has said absolutely nothing. And these people are shameful. They are shameful. And I hope to see them go, not because I don't believe in their liberal values, but I don't believe in their morals. You cannot just say things and let the Jewish students fend for themselves. And last night, and this morning, and for the past four days, and for the past six months, we have seen the Jewish students fending for themselves,\" Davidai said.\n\"And it's time not just for the NYPD, but for the National Guard. Gov. Hochul has to come in and say something,\" he added.\nNew York native and Jewish influencer Lizzy Savetsky told Fox that the protests are \"deeply troubling\" considering New York City is home to the world's largest Jewish community outside of Israel, and echoed Davidai that more local leaders need to step up and take action on the protests.\n\"Columbia's violent protests contrast sharply with our city's values of diversity and mutual respect. As a Jewish activist in NYC, I stand with students facing threats and discrimination on campus. Columbia must prioritize the safety of all students and ensure that access to education is protected. With the alarming rise in antisemitic attacks across our city, state and local officials must urgently step up to protect the Jewish community at Columbia and combat these terrorist supporters in our streets,\" she said.\nRepublican New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who has been publicly condemning U.S. campus antisemitism for months, called for Columbia President Minouche Shafik to \"immediately resign\" last week and for the school to appoint an individual \"who will protect Jewish students and enforce school policies.\"\nBarnard College, Columbia University student Yola Ashkenazie told Fox News Digital on Sunday that the environment on campus is \"scary, dangerous, and untenable\" and that protesters have crossed a line and become \"violent.\"\n\"On Saturday night, student protesters proudly chanted for the death of Jewish and Israeli students. They did so by chanting in support of Hamas' military wing and called on them to strike Israeli cities and pro-Israel students at Columbia. As a university that prides itself on critical thinking, I've seen a complete loss of it this week,\" she said.\n\"Jewish students are unable to be on campus right now. Prohibiting us from receiving the education that we work so hard to be able to obtain is unacceptable, and university administration must do everything they can to ensure that we can resume our studies as soon as possible,\" Ashkenazi said.\nColumbia alum Sheila Nazarian, a plastic surgeon originally from Iran, told Fox Digital that she's stopped donating to the school over campus antisemitism, and said it's time for the National Guard to respond to campus, while the administration must expel students who take part in the protests.\n\"Having studied in the classrooms of Columbia University, I've always valued the institution's dedication to intellectual diversity and open discourse. However, the recent events unfolding on campus, with anti-Israel protests and inflammatory rhetoric, are deeply troubling. As an alumna, I believe it's crucial for Columbia to uphold its principles of inclusivity while safeguarding the rights of all students, including those of Jewish descent. Columbia has stopped receiving donations from many alumni, including me, since they failed to stop the student body from passing a BDS resolution. They will continue to not receive a penny from me in donations until this antisemitism problem is cleaned up,\" she said.\n\"It's imperative for the university administration to start taking definitive steps to address and condemn any form of discrimination or hostility targeting Jewish students. Call in the National Guard. Stop taking money from foreign bad actors. Fire terrorist sympathizers on staff. Expel terrorist students. These are all adults. And they must be held accountable,\" she added.\nFox News Digital reached out to the school for comment on the reactions to the protests, but did not immediately receive replies.\nThis weekend, the Orthodox rabbi at Columbia University and Barnard College told students in a message to leave campus \"as soon as possible\" until the situation improves, noting that \"what we are witnessing in and around campus is terrible and tragic.\"\n\"The events of the last few days, especially last night, have made it clear that Columbia University's Public Safety and the NYPD cannot guarantee Jewish students' safety in the face of extreme antisemitism and anarchy,\" Rabbi Elie Buechler wrote. \"It deeply pains me to say that I would strongly recommend you return home as soon as possible and remain home until the reality in and around campus has dramatically improved.\"",

            "excerpt": "Police said Columbia University does not want NYPD officers on campus amid antisemitic protests and an encampment celebrating terror groups.",
            "summary": "New York City police officials on Monday told reporters that Columbia University \"does not want NYPD present on campus,\" despite an anti-Israel encampment featuring antisemitic and pro-terror chants, sparking serious security concerns for Jewish students at the start of Passover.\nAt a press conference, NYPD Deputy Commissioner Michale Gerber emphasized that Columbia University is private property, so police can enter only in the scenario of a crime in progress or someone in danger.\n\"If someone is, for example, who is being attacked, we're going to go in to Columbia University, as we would to a private home to help protect that person,\" Gerber said. \"But absent exigency, absent some ongoing crime, we cannot just go on the Columbia campus as we see fit. It is up to the university to decide whether or not they want us on campus. As a general matter, Columbia University and this goes back many years, does not want NYPD present on campus. That is their decision.\"\nOn Thursday, the day after Columbia President Dr. Nemat \"Minouche\" Shafik was held to account before the House Education on the Workforce Committee regarding soaring antisemitism at the Ivy League school in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas militants on southern Israel, the university informed NYPD that they had students who were trespassing.\nSo, Gerber explained, Columbia leadership asked police to come onto campus and take action. More than 100 people were arrested and later released.\n\"But that was an exceptional case in the normal course. They've made clear that we're not to be there,\" Gerber said. \"And so we're not there now around the university, in the streets, around the university, that's public property there. We have a very large police presence. And our officers obviously are going to take action to prevent crime and to make arrests if there is a crime.\"\nHe added that any kind of violence, property damage or criminality \"is not going to be tolerated,\" including \"harassment or threats or menacing or stalking\" not protected by the First Amendment.\nDespite New York City Eric Adams even calling out chants from Columbia anti-Israel agitators \"supporting a terrorist organization that aims to kill Jews,\" decrying such speech as \"sickening and despicable,\" NYPD Deputy Commissioner Tarik Sheppard confirmed at the press conference, \"There's been no credible threats to any particular group or individual coming from this protest or any other.\"\nShafik, breaking her silence over the weekend in issuing an overnight statement, canceled in-person classes on Monday, calling for a \"reset\" as \"tensions have been exploited and amplified by individuals who are not affiliated with Columbia who have come to campus to pursue their own agendas.\"\nInstead of bringing in police to disperse the \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" that has persisted for days on the South Lawn, Shafik promised a \"working group of Deans, university administrators and faculty members will try to bring this crisis to a resolution\" in the coming days, including through \"continuing discussions with the student protestors and identifying actions we can take as a community to enable us to peacefully complete the term and return to respectful engagement with each other.\"\n\"I know that there is much debate about whether or not we should use the police on campus, and I am happy to engage in those discussions,\" Shafik said. \"But I do know that better adherence to our rules and effective enforcement mechanisms would obviate the need for relying on anyone else to keep our community safe. We should be able to do this ourselves.\"",

            "summary": "Washington Post opinion columnist Karen Attiah raised eyebrows on social media Tuesday when she argued that \"many will not survive\" unless there is a shift in cultural and political systems in the country.\nIn a lengthy thread on X, Attiah said the last few months have been \"clarifying\" after referencing the ongoing war in Gaza. She went on to warn \"marginalized communities\" and minorities to \"divest\" from institutions and systems in the U.S. and enter into a \"self-preservation\" mode, arguing that it's clear they \"will not save us.\"\n\"Those of us who are minorities or come from marginalized communities— I hope the last few months have been clarifying. Our governments will not save us. Our institutions will not save us. People of color in high places will not save us. Only we can save us. Adjust accordingly,\" she wrote.\nAttiah pointed to the decision by the University of Southern California (USC) to cancel a Muslim valedictorian's speech at the school's graduation ceremony after a series of anti-Israel social media posts she allegedly made were discovered.\n\"The silence, censorship, racism, and hypocrisies on to the assault, starvation, and depopulation of Palestinians in Gaza is revealing,\" Attiah wrote. \"For decades, we were told ‘Never Again' to genocide and mass atrocities. The Holocaust. Rwanda. Bosnia. Darfur. We were taught to spot the warning signs--dehumanizing rhetoric, violence, forced depopulation, and the destruction of culture. We were told to speak out and act.\"\nThe university's decision, Attiah claimed, \"shows that the credibility/legitimacy of many liberal institutions died in Gaza.\"\n\"Western journalistic objectivity died in Gaza. True academic freedom died in Gaza. Do we see how much violence it takes to uphold an imperial status quo?\" she went on.\nAttiah continued, \"Many Black and other PoC are going to withdraw/ divest from these systems and go into self + community preservation mode,\" she claimed. \"Storms are gathering. We keep trying to educate white folks especially on how to build new shelters, but they keep holding on to old, broken tools.\"\n\"Some of us are using new tools, and will try to build new shelters,\" Attiah concluded. \"Many will not survive what is ahead of us if our cultural and political systems don't change course.\"\nIn October, Attiah was dragged on social media after arguing in a column that, \"we cannot stand and watch Israel commit atrocities.\"\nShe wrote that Palestinians were \"rightfully\" pointing out \"that their own pain and deaths under the actions of the Israeli state have been ignored for years\" following Hamas' unprecedented terrorist attack against Israel and argued that the U.S. can't let Israel retaliate.\nThe former global opinions editor for the Washington Post, also faced online ridicule when she warned White women that they are \"lucky that we are just calling them ‘Karen's'\" and \"not calling for revenge\" in a since deleted tweet.\nAttiah responded to the backlash at the time by writing, \"America is a racist *and* patriarchal society. We cannot dismantle the full range of oppression in this society without addressing how toxic ideas of white masculinity interplay with the notion of ‘protecting' their women from Black people.\"\nAttiah also received backlash in the past when she said the Texas Rangers team name \"must go,\" claiming it \"is not so far off from being called the Texas Klansmen.\"\nCritics were therefore surprised when she announced that she had been promoted to the role of opinion columnist in 2021.",

            "summary": "House Republicans on Wednesday grilled Columbia University President Dr. Nemat \"Minouche\" Shafik regarding the employment of a professor who celebrated the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks as \"awesome.\"\nDuring the House Education and the Workforce's hearing to discuss antisemitism on Columbia's campus, Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., condemned what he called the \"perverse\" statements by a tenured Columbia professor, Joseph Massad, who is listed as the chair of the School of Arts and Sciences Academic Review Committee.\nIn the aftermath of Oct. 7, Massad penned an article praising \"the innovative Palestinian Resistance\" and Hamas militants for attacking Israel and glorifying Hamas's slaughter of nearly 1200 Jews. He described the terror attack on southern Israel as \"awesome,\" \"astonishing,\" \"astounding,\" and \"incredible.\"\n\"Professor Massad has also been known to have called Israelis, quote, ‘cruel and bloodthirsty colonizers,' end quote. And who join them? Israeli military as, quote, ‘baby killing Zionists, Jewish volunteers for Israeli Jewish supremacy,' end quote,\" Walberg said. \"In 2005, an investigation by Columbia corroborated allegations that Massad yelled at a Jewish student who questioned his views to, quote, ‘Get out of my classroom.' Can you imagine free speech diversity on campus?\"\nWalberg blasted how, as chair of the School of Arts and Sciences Academic Review Committee, Massad oversees the periodic review of all departments, centers and institutes and in the school. The congressman asked Shafik if Massad had faced any consequences for his words.\n\"He has been spoken to,\" Shafik replied.\nWhen pressed about whether Massad had faced any further consequences, Shafik said he had been removed as chair of the committee. Later on, House Republican Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., stated that Massad was still listed as chair on the school's website. Shafik said she would have to confirm whether he was still serving in that role. Stefanik pressed Shafik on whether she would remove him from that role if he was indeed still in that position, and she ultimately said, \"Yes.\"\nWalberg noted that Massad is a tenured professor, and asked Columbia Board of Trustees co-chairs Claire Shipman and David Greenwald if they would approve tenure for him if they could make that decision today. Both said they would not.\nStefanik also pressed Shafik on another professor, Dr. Mohamed Abdou, a visiting professor in Modern Arab Studies. According to the congresswoman, Abdou was hired after the Oct. 7 terrorist attack in Israel, and on Oct. 11, posted \"Yes, I'm with Hamas and Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad.\" Stefanik said the professor also \"decried false reports accusing Arabs and Muslims of decapitating the head, decapitating the heads of children and being rapists.\"\n\"We know that there were decapitations of babies, of innocent Israeli citizens, of seniors of women. There were rapes. And yet Columbia hired this individual as a professor. How did that hiring process work? Were you aware of those statements before the hiring?\" Stefanik demanded to know.\nUnder pressure, Shafik confirmed that Abdou will not be returning after this semester, and he \"will never work at Columbia again.\"\nThe House GOP chair questioned the presidents of Harvard, UPenn and MIT in December on whether calls for the genocide of Jews violated rules against bullying and harassment of their schools' codes of conduct. Unlike the presidents of those three universities, the Columbia president and board of trustee co-chairs all answered definitively \"Yes\" when asked the same question by Democratic Rep. Suzanne Bonanici, of Oregon.",

            "summary": "Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY), pressed Columbia University's president about pro-Hamas professors on campus during a congressional hearing Wednesday.\nStefanik, a senior member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, had numerous rounds in which she attacked the Columbia president for antisemitism on campus under her watch.\n\"I'm talking about the faculty members who are supporting terror,\" Rep. Stefanik said while questioning Dr. Nemat \"Minouche\" Shafik, Columbia's president since July.\nOne of the professors, Joseph Massad, called Oct. 7 terror attacks in Israel \"awesome\" in an opinion article the day after the attack. A petition with over 70K signatures calling for Massad's firing back in October was \"ignored\" by the university, according to critics.\n\"I think [Massad] was told [by his department] that that language was unacceptable,\" Shafik told Stefanik.\nAs for whether there was disciplinary action taken, the president said, \"In his case, he has not repeated anything like that ever since.\"\n\"You have no action? No disciplinary action,\" Stefanik asked.\nThe congresswoman also addressed the hire of Islamic anarchist Mohamed Abdou, who was hired as an \"Arcapita Visiting Professor in Modern Arab Studies\" professor for the Spring 2024 semester.\nAccording to his biography, Abdou \"is a North African-Egyptian Muslim anarchist interdisciplinary activist-scholar of Indigenous, Black, critical race, and Islamic studies, as well as gender, sexuality, abolition, and decolonization with extensive fieldwork experience in the Middle East-North Africa.\"\n\"Abdu… was hired after the Oct. 7 terrorist attack against Israel,\" Stefanik said.\nShe went on to say that Abdou had posted on Oct. 11, \"I'm with Hamas and Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad.\"\n\"He also decried false reports accusing Arabs and Muslims of decapitating the head, decapitating the heads of children and being rapists. We know that there were decapitations of babies, of innocent Israeli citizens, of seniors, of women. There were rapes. And yet Columbia hired this individual as a professor. How did that process work? Were you aware of those statements before the hiring?\" Stefanik asked.\n\"I share with you your repugnance at those remarks. I completely understand that on my watch, faculty who make remarks that cross the line in terms of antisemitism, there will be consequences for them.,\" Shafik responded.\nStefanik asked, \"What are the consequences in this case at the moment?\"\n\"I have five cases at the moment [of employees] who have either been either taken out of the classroom or dismissed,\" the president said. \"He will he will never work at Columbia again.\"\nStefanik responded, \"So he has been terminated?\"\n\"He has been terminated,\" the president said. \"And not just terminated, but his files will show that he will never work at Columbia again.\"\nHowever, Shafik stated Abdou would continue to work at the university to finish class work.\n\"He is grading his students' papers and will never teach at Columbia again,\" the president said.\nStefanik then asked about how the Islamic anarchist's alleged proclamation of U.S.-desginated terror groups went under the radar during the hiring process.\n\"I agree with you that I think we need to look at how to toughen up those requirements,\" the president said.\nLater in the hearing, Stefanik rebutted the notion that Abdou was busy grading papers.\n\"Just to let you know, Mr. Abdou is not grading papers right now. He's on campus on the unsanctioned anti-Israel, antisemitic event that is being supported by pro-Hamas activists on campus. So that's what Professor Abdou is doing at this time.\"",

            "summary": "Half of the world's 75 poorest countries are experiencing a widening income gap with the wealthiest economies for the first time this century in a historical reversal of development, the World Bank said in a report on Monday.\nThe differential between per capita income growth in the poorest countries and the richest has widened over the past five years, according to the report.\n\"For the first time, we see there is no convergence. They're getting poorer,\" Ayhan Kose, deputy chief economist for the World Bank and one of the report's authors, told Reuters.\n\"We see a very serious structural regression, a reversal in the world ... that's why we are ringing the alarm bells here,\" he said.\nThe report said the 75 countries eligible for grants and zero-interest loans from the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA) risk a lost decade of development without ambitious policy shifts and significant international aid.\nKose said growth in many IDA countries had already begun to taper off before the COVID-19 pandemic, but it would be just 3.4% in 2020-2024, the weakest half-decade of growth since the early 1990s. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, climate change, increases in violence and conflict also weighed heavily on their prospects.\nMore than half of all IDA countries are in Sub-Saharan Africa; 14 are in East Asia and eight are in Latin America and the Caribbean. Thirty-one have per capita incomes of less than $1,315 a year. They include the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan and Haiti.\nOne in three IDA countries is poorer now than on the eve of the pandemic. IDA countries account for 92% of the world's people who lack access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food. Half of the countries are in debt distress, meaning they are unable to service debt or are at high risk of not being able to.\nAnd despite their young populations - a demographic boon at a time when populations were aging nearly everywhere else, rich natural resources and abundant solar-energy potential, private and government creditors had been backing away from them.\nU.S. Treasury Undersecretary Jay Shambaugh raised concerns about the worsening situation last week, warning China and other emerging official creditors against free-riding by curtailing loans to low-income countries just as the IMF or multilateral development banks were pouring funds in.\nAlmost 40 countries saw external public debt outflows in 2022, and the flows likely worsened in 2023, he said.\nKose said ambitious policies were needed to accelerate investment, including domestic efforts to strengthen fiscal, monetary and financial policies, and structural reforms to improve education and increase domestic revenues.\nSignificant financial support from the global community was also essential to make progress and lower the risk of protracted stagnation, Kose said, noting that the World Bank hoped to drum up a robust replenishment of IDA funds by December.\nStronger international coordination on climate change, debt restructurings and measures supporting cross-border trade would also be crucial, it said.\nIndermit Gill, World Bank chief economist, noted that China, India and South Korea - now major economic powerhouses - had once been among the world's poorest countries, but were able to tackle extreme poverty and raise living standards.\n\"The world cannot afford to turn its back on IDA countries,\" he said.",

            "excerpt": "House GOP chair Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., torched Columbia University President Dr. Nemat \"Minouche\" Shafik's \"glaringly inconsistent testimony\" and \"arrogance.\"",
            "summary": "House Republican Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., gave a blistering review Wednesday of the testimonies of Columbia University leadership who appeared before the House Education and the Workforce Committee's hearing to discuss antisemitism soaring at the prestigious New York campus. After the hearing, Stefanik issued a statement regarding Columbia University President Dr. Nemat \"Minouche\" Shafik's response to a line of questioning from Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., about whether there have been any explicitly \"anti-Jewish\" protests on campus.\n\"Today's hearing of Columbia University president and board members epitomizes the failed leadership on ‘elite' college campuses to combat antisemitism and protect Jewish students,\" Stefanik said in a statement. \"From the university president's moral equivocation on antisemitism, to glaringly inconsistent testimony regarding disciplinary action and lack thereof taken against antisemitic students and pro-terrorist faculty, to astonishingly stating that there has been no ‘anti-Jewish' protests on campus only to then acknowledge that ‘F-- the Jews' & ‘Death to the Jews' is in-fact anti-Jewish when she was further pressed.\"\nArguing there have simply been what she categorizes as \"anti-war\" or \"pro-war\" protests at the university, Omar asked Shafik if she's seen any \"protest saying we are against Jewish,\" to which the Columbia president responded \"I have not.\" But Stefanik rejected the assertion, later on at the hearing noting how \"the slurs and the chants have been ‘f the Jews. Death to Jews. F Israel. No place. Death to the Zionist state. Jews out.' You don't think those are anti-Jewish?\"\nShafik agreed, \"Completely anti-Jewish, Completely,\" to which Stefanik said, \"So you changed your testimony on that issue as well. So there have been anti-Jewish protests.\"\nAt the hearing, Stefanik and other House Republicans also questioned why a tenured Columbia professor, Joseph Massad, who praised \"the innovative Palestinian Resistance\" and Hamas militants for attacking Israel and glorifying Hamas's slaughter of nearly 1,200 Jews, describing the terror attack on southern Israel as \"awesome,\" \"astonishing,\" \"astounding,\" and \"incredible,\" remained as the chair of the School of Arts and Sciences Academic Review Committee. Shafik at first testified she believed Massad was no longer chair of the committee, but Stefanik later pointed out he was still listed as holding the position on the university's website. Shafik later clarified that Massad is under investigation for the antisemitic remarks.\nIn her post-hearing statement, Stefanik said that during a break, \"the witnesses were overheard discussing how well they thought their testimony was going for Columbia.\"\n\"This arrogance is eerily reminiscent to the previous three university presidents who believed walking out of the hearing that their testimony was acceptable,\" Stefanik said. \"Columbia is in for a reckoning of accountability. If it takes a member of Congress to force a university president to fire a pro-terrorist, antisemitic faculty chair, then Columbia University leadership is failing Jewish students and its academic mission. No amount of overlawyered, overprepped, and over-consulted testimony is going to cover up for failure to act.\"\nNotably, the House GOP chair grilled the presidents of Harvard, UPenn and MIT in December on whether calls for the genocide of Jews violated university policy against bullying and harassment or their codes of conduct. Each school leader said more context would be needed, failing to give a definitive response.\nMonths later, after those testimonies prompted widespread outcry and the resignations of two of the three presidents, Shafik and other Columbia witnesses testified definitively, \"yes,\" to the same question.",

            "summary": "A Utah mother is fighting for her teenage daughter's access to diabetes medicine.\nRuby Smart, 15, has been taking Levemir (detemir) insulin since she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes more than two years ago.\n\"Levemir is uniquely suited to her situation,\" Alison Smart, the girl's mother, told Fox News Digital in an interview.\nThe family was stunned when Novo Nordisk, the Denmark-based manufacturer of Levemir, announced in November 2023 that the drug was being discontinued.\nSmart has now made it her mission to convince Novo Nordisk to continue making Levemir — or to find a pharmaceutical company to create a biosimilar (generic) alternative.\nLevemir is a long-acting basal insulin that's injected once or twice a day to control high blood sugar in adults and children with diabetes, according to Novo Nordisk's website.\nFor Smart's daughter, an active athlete who plays on the tennis team at Woods Cross High School, Levemir has enabled her to continue with her regular activities while controlling her diabetes.\nWhile there are a couple of other types of basal insulin on the market, Smart said Levemir is best suited to her daughter's needs.\n\"Levemir is unique in that it is a relatively shorter-acting basal insulin, making it ideal for those with fluctuating basal insulin needs, including teenagers, menstruating women, pregnant women and athletes,\" she said.\n\"The two remaining insulins also have side effects we don't worry about when using Levemir.\"\nThey did try an insulin pump for a few weeks, which is a wearable device that provides a steady flow of insulin to the body. But Smart said it was not compatible with her daughter's high activity levels.\n\"She's super active, and plays tennis almost every day,\" Smart said. \"The pump was fine for daily activity, but for tennis tournament days, it didn't work.\"\nSmart is advocating for people to be able to choose.\n\"The bottom line is that Levemir works for us,\" she said. \"Our lives are much easier and less complex on a regimen of multiple daily injections using Levemir insulin.\"\nNovo Nordisk provided three main reasons for why it's discontinuing Levenir.\n\"After careful consideration, we made this decision because of global manufacturing issues, decreasing patient coverage, and because we are confident that patients in the U.S. will be able to find alternative treatments,\" the company said in a press release.\nWhen contacted by Fox News Digital, Novo Nordisk provided the following recommendation to doctors and patients.\n\"During this time, we strongly encourage that health care professionals and patients discuss transitioning to alternative treatment options prior to the discontinuation date. Novo Nordisk, along with other companies, provides a number of alternative treatment options for people living with diabetes who require basal insulin.\"\nThe company suggested that patients switch to other basal insulin options, including but not limited to Basaglar, Insulin Degludec, Insulin Glargine U-300, Lantus, Rezvoglar, Semglee, Toujeo and Tresiba.\n\"The other options for basal insulin are not equal and are not sufficient — they have different side effects and different qualities.\"\nMany parents, however, say these alternatives are not the same.\n\"The other options for basal insulin are not equal and are not sufficient — they have different side effects and different qualities,\" Smart told Fox News Digital.\n\"They're not as flexible, and not as easy to use with someone who has varying basal insulin needs, like a teenager.\"\nOther parents are also concerned about being forced to switch medications.\nJaime Losinski, a mother in Tampa, Florida, has a 14-year-old son with type 1 diabetes. He's been taking Levemir for years.\n\"Levemir is a valuable insulin for children and teens, who have ever-changing insulin needs as they grow,\" she told Fox News Digital.\n\"Levemir's action profile makes it perfect for patients who need to make rapid and continual changes,\" she went on.\n\"An insulin such as Lantus or Tresiba, which the industry tells us to ‘just switch to,' lasts far too long in the system for someone like him and would be dangerous overnight,\" she said. \"They also come with side effects, all of which he experienced when we tried them both shortly after his diagnosis seven years ago.\"\nAlthough Levemir is expected to be available until Dec. 2024, Smart said providers have warned her to \"expect supply disruption\" in the meantime.\nSome insurance companies have already stopped coverage of the drug due to the discontinuation.\nSmart received a letter from her insurance company in November saying Levemir would not be on her plan any longer. They later agreed to add it back on — but only if she paid a premium.\nErin Palinski-Wade, a certified diabetes educator in New Jersey, said the discontinuation of Levemir is \"understandably surprising and frustrating\" for patients who rely on this brand of insulin.\n\"Although there are other forms of long-acting insulin on the market, each has its own slight differences, such as peak times, which can have a significant impact on blood glucose management during the day,\" she told Fox News Digital.\n\"For children and teens, there may be greater fluctuations in blood sugar.\"\n\"Transitioning from one brand of insulin to another is not as cut and dry as it might seem, and can lead to periods of high blood sugar or hypoglycemia episodes (dangerously low blood sugars) as the adjustment occurs,\" Palinski-Wade added.\nFor parents who rely on Levemir, the expert recommended working with a physician, endocrinologist and/or dietitian to create the \"best transition plan possible\" to minimize fluctuations in blood sugar while finding an alternative that works best.\nWhen transitioning to a new insulin, increased testing of glucose levels is needed to prevent and correct highs and lows as they occur, Palinski-Wade noted.\n\"This is especially important for children and teens, as there may be greater fluctuations in blood sugar due to activity, growth and hormone fluctuations,\" she said.\nTanya Freirich, a certified diabetes educator in New York City working as The Lupus Dietitian, agreed that the closest replacement in terms of duration of action is Lantus (insulin glargine).\n\"One of the differences is the peak time,\" she told Fox News Digital.\n\"Lantus peaks [or lowers the blood sugar the most] at six hours after administration, while Levemir peaks at eight to 10 hours after administration. This difference would affect the appropriate timing for the medication to prevent dangerous blood sugar lows.\"\nDr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor, said he is also disappointed by the news of the discontinuation.\n\"It is based on supply chain and production issues rather than a problem with the product,\" he told Fox News Digital.\n\"We definitely need biosimilar versions to replace it,\" he said. \"It can be life-saving.\"\n\"It is based on supply chain and production issues rather than a problem with the product.\"\n\"Some patients really need a version of insulin and Levemir may be their best option.\"\nAlthough Levemir is \"very similar\" to Lantus, Siegel said, it has two important differences: \"It causes less weight gain and less hypoglycemia (low glucose).\"\nAfter Novo Nordisk's November announcement of the discontinuation, Smart sprung into action.\nShe set up an online petition and began contacting the Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization.\n\"This drug is on the World Health Organization's list of essential medicines,\" she said. \"I just couldn't wrap my head around the possibility of this happening and people not being as outraged as I was.\"\nSmart also teamed up with other parents to form the Alliance to Protect Insulin Choice. She has visited Washington, D.C., twice to meet with senators and congressional representatives.\n\"Our goal is to have Novo Nordisk slow down the discontinuation, and produce Levemir insulin for a few years until a biosimilar is widely available,\" she said.\n\"We would like to find a biosimilar manufacturer to make this insulin, so it stays available.\"\nWhile Smart recognizes that the medication may not be available \"forever,\" she aims to slow down the discontinuation and keep Levemir available for a few more years — \"because it will take that long to get a biosimilar up and running.\"\nSmart's efforts have also caught the attention of billionaire Mark Cuban, who expressed his willingness to partner with Novo Nordisk to continue producing Levemir.\nWhen contacted by Fox News Digital, Cuban said that his pharmaceutical company, CostPlus Drug Company, is \"trying to figure out a way to source [Levemir].\"\n\"We aren't there yet, but we are trying,\" he said.\nFor more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health.",

            "summary": "FIRST ON FOX: A government watchdog group is suing the Biden administration over documents it has sought via information request related to proposed regulations targeting menthol cigarettes.\nProtect the Public's Trust (PPT) filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), alleging that the agency has violated its obligations under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Protect the Public's Trust submitted four FOIA requests for documents pertaining to the proposed federal menthol cigarette ban with HHS and subagency the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) late last year, all of which have gone unfulfilled.\nPPT describes itself as nonpartisan, a \"project dedicated to ensuring there is only one standard – one set of rules that our leaders must live by no matter what party affiliation or ideological bent,\" according to its website. It's headed by Michael Chamberlain, a former communications official at the Department of Education in the Trump administration.\n\"The Biden administration and FDA probably thought they would be greeted as conquering heroes when they announced the menthol ban,\" Chamberlain said in a statement. \"But the science and, as they soon found out, the politics appear to be a lot more complicated than that.\"\n\"The rule is highly controversial, and it's important for the American public to understand the factors driving the administration's actions here,\" he added. \"But, despite our best efforts and Mr. Biden's claim of running the most transparent administration in history, the agencies won't produce records. That seems to indicate there's something they don't want the public to know.\"\nPPT filed its FOIA requests with HHS and FDA in December. The requests asked for communications between several senior officials related to the menthol ban.\nHowever, in the more than 90 days since the four requests, HHS has not produced responsive documents and has not communicated the scope of the documents it intends to produce or withhold, according to PPT. As such, the group argues that HHS has not met its statutory obligations to provide the requested records for the FOIA requests.\n\"Through HHS' failure to either to make a determination within the time period required by law, PPT has constructively exhausted its administrative remedies and seeks immediate judicial review,\" the lawsuit states.\nHHS, which was listed as the sole defendant in the lawsuit, didn't respond to requests for comment.\nMeanwhile, the White House has repeatedly missed target dates for finalizing the proposed menthol cigarette regulations, the latest of which was this month, and it remains unclear when they will be finalized. The regulations, which would broadly ban menthol cigarette sales nationwide, were first proposed by the FDA two years ago and sent to the White House for final approval months ago.\nThe FDA said the proposal would reduce disease and even death from tobacco product use by reducing youth experimentation and addiction, while increasing the number of smokers that might quit. Tobacco smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death nationwide, according to the agency.\n\"The FDA remains committed to issuing the tobacco product standards for menthol in cigarettes and characterizing flavors in cigars as expeditiously as possible; these rules have been submitted to the [Office of Management and Budget] for review, which is the final step in the rulemaking process,\" an FDA spokesperson recently told Fox News Digital. \"As we've made clear, these product standards remain at the top of our priorities.\"\nAt the same time, the proposed crackdown on menthol cigarettes has sparked a contentious debate between health advocates, who favor the regulations, and civil liberties and business groups, which oppose the regulations.\nGroups representing minorities, like the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement and the nonprofit National Action Network – the latter of which was founded by civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton – argue that banning menthol cigarettes while not restricting non-menthol cigarettes \"puts a microscope on minority communities.\" They say it could increase the probability of negative interactions between police and minorities.\nThe National Organization of Black Law Enforcement, National Action Network, National Newspaper Publishers Association and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump met with HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, FDA Commissioner Robert Califf and White House domestic policy adviser Neera Tanden to discuss the proposal in November, according to White House records.",

The group calls it \"completely unlawful\" and says it puts Americans' financial data at \"grave risk.\"\n\"By seizing all financial data from all Americans who trade in the American exchanges, SEC arrogates surveillance powers and appropriates billions of dollars without a shred of Congressional authority — all while putting Americans' savings and investments at grave and perpetual risk,\" said Peggy Little, NCLA senior litigation counsel.\n\"The Founders provided rock-solid protections in our Constitution to prevent just these autocratic and dangerous actions. This CAT must be ripped out, root and branch,\" she said.\nThe lawsuit, filed in the district court for the Western District of Texas, calls CAT \"the greatest government mandated mass collection of personal financial data in United States history.\"\n\"Historically, a government that wished to track its citizens had to devote large resources to having them followed. That is no longer the case: modern surveillance tools enable mass tracking of individuals' every movement, every transaction, every purchase, sale, or transfer of securities at low cost while powerful computer algorithms can process that information to reveal personal and private details of each person's financial life or investment strategy,\" the lawsuit states.\n\"This class action complaint challenges SEC's shocking arrogation of power to impose dystopian surveillance, suspicionless seizures, and real or potential searches on millions of American investors.\"\nLittle told Fox News Digital that the SEC collects and stores in its database \"every trade information on every investors' trades from inception to completion,\" naming funds like 401(k) or 529 Education Fund as examples.\n\"And there is simply no law that permits them to do that, and the Fourth Amendment forbids them to do that,\" she said.\n\"And here's the dirty little truth: all investing Americans will pay for this because it's paid for by fees that the SROs [self-regulatory organizations] extract from the brokerage houses, who charge their customers… I mean, this is a multibillion-dollar tax on American investors and American investing, and nobody ever voted for it.\"\nA spokesperson for the SEC told Fox News Digital that \"the Commission undertakes its regulatory responsibilities consistent with its authorities.\"\nIn an op-ed published Monday in The Wall Street Journal, former Attorney General William Barr argued that \"even when the government seeks information about a citizen from banks, phone companies and others with whom he has done business, the government isn't free to vacuum this up carte blanche.\"\nBarr noted that the crux of the SEC's argument for the CAT program is that \"it could investigate things more easily if it weren't limited to gathering investor information on a case-by-case basis after suspected wrongdoing took place.\"\n\"But the whole point of the Fourth Amendment is to make the government less efficient by making it jump through hoops when it seeks to delve into private affairs,\" Barr wrote.\n\"For an agency to argue that it should be able to avoid these hoops to make investigations easier is to assert that it should be exempt from the Fourth Amendment.\"",

            "excerpt": "The number of Chinese nationals entering the U.S. illegally has skyrocketed this fiscal year compared to prior years, and fiscal 2024 is already outpacing last year.",
            "summary": "The number of Chinese nationals entering the United States illegally and stopped by Border Patrol so far this fiscal year has exceeded the enormous number seen in all of fiscal year 2023 — with six months still to go.\nAccording to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data, in the first six months of fiscal 2024, which began in October, Border Patrol had caught 24,296 Chinese nationals crossing illegally between ports of entry. That exceeds the 24,125 caught in all of fiscal 2023.\nFor comparison, in fiscal 2022, there were just 1,987 apprehensions, and in fiscal 2021 there were just 342.\nThose numbers only account for those entering illegally between ports of entry. Including ports of entry, there have been 41,970 encounters, compared to 52,700 in fiscal 2023.\nFox reported earlier this month that the number of Chinese nationals entering illegally has surged by over 6,300% since fiscal 2021. That report came as 182 Chinese nationals were encountered in a single sector in a single day.\nLawmakers and officials have raised concerns about the migrants' potential ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the movement of fentanyl into the U.S.\n\"There have been numerous documented instances of Chinese nationals, at the direction of the CCP, engaging in espionage, stealing military and economic secrets,\" lawmakers, led by Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., said last year.\nBrandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, which represents all rank-and-file Border Patrol agents nationwide, told Fox News in February the majority of the Chinese border crossers are single adult males of military age.\n\"That is a very scary prospect. We know that China does not like us. We know that we are in the crosshairs of China,\" he said. \"And they are exporting so many people to our country, and you have to really fear about that.\"\nThis week, a bipartisan House report found the Chinese government has given tax rebates and grants to companies that make certain fentanyl and synthetic drug precursors used by drug traffickers as long as they are sold outside of China.\n\"Through its actions, as our report has revealed, the Chinese Communist Party is telling us that it wants more fentanyl entering our country,\" said Rep. Mike Gallagher, the Republican chairman of the special House committee. \"It wants the chaos and devastation that has resulted from the epidemic.\"\nIllicit fentanyl is typically created in Mexico using Chinese precursors and then moved across the southern land border.\nLast month, a Chinese illegal immigrant was detained in California after entering a Marine Corps base without authorization and ignoring orders to leave.\nThe Biden administration has also acknowledged the national security threat from China more broadly in its national threat assessment, although not specifically from migrants, who it says are fully vetted using biographic and biometric information.\nBorder officials have stressed there will be consequences for those who enter the U.S. illegally, including those from China.\n\"DHS continues to enforce United States immigration laws, expanding lawful pathways while strengthening enforcement consequences for those who cross our border unlawfully,\" the agency said in a statement when the Chinese national was arrested at the military base.\n\"Individuals and families without a legal basis to remain in the U.S. are subject to removal pursuant to Title 8 authorities and are subject to a minimum five-year bar on reapplying for admission and potential criminal prosecution if they subsequently re-enter without authorization.\"\nFox News has also spoken to Chinese migrants who have said they are just trying to benefit themselves and their families.\n\"My English is not very good, and I don't know anyone in the United States,\" one migrant told Fox last month. \"Once I get to the United States, I know I have to start all over again. But I want to live a good life in the future, and I want my children to be educated well. I strive to take root in the United States as soon as possible.\"",

            "excerpt": "Anti-Israel encampments that are raising security concerns for Jewish students were seen at Columbia, Yale, NYU, MIT and Emerson College on Monday.",
            "summary": "Anti-Israel encampments swept across elite universities on Monday, as antisemitic and pro-terror demonstrations at Columbia University reached a fever pitch at the start of Passover.\nAs Columbia held classes remotely following a weekend of hateful rhetoric surrounding it pro-Gaza encampment on the South Lawn, where incidents have included a young woman holding a sign with an arrow pointing to Jewish students stating \"Al-Qasam's Next Targets,\" and anti-Israel agitators shouting \"We are Hamas\" and \"We don't want no Zionists here,\" police officials said that Columbia University leadership \"does not want NYPD on campus.\" Yet, a strong police presence was seen outside Columbia's gates, where officers appeared to start making arrests on Monday afternoon, according to photos from the scene.\nAnother similar demonstration popped up outside a New York University building.\nUnlike Columbia, which locked its gates amid the protests, NYU does not have an enclosed campus space.\nTents with the anarchy symbol and a sign attempting to connect Black Rock to \"Israel Apartheid\" were seen pitched along the sidewalk near the NYU building, as anti-Israel agitators banged pots and pans and picketed in a circle. Other signs at the NYU demonstration, captured in footage shared by FreedomNews.TV, read \"Honor the Martyrs of Palestine\" and \"We are all SJP,\" a reference to the anti-Israel group known as \"Students for Justice in Palestine.\" Columbia notably suspended its SJP chapter for staging an \"unauthorized\" die-in event on campus back in November.\nEncampment-style demonstrations were also erected at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Emerson College.\nPhotos showed tents near Emerson's Boston campus with signs reading \"from the river to the sea,\" the antisemitic phrase calling for the eradication of the Jewish state, as well as \"No more money for Israel's crimes,\" \"drop all charges on student activists\" and \"neutrality\" is complicity with the Palestinian flag.\nAerial footage captured by CBS Boston over MIT showed anti-Israel agitators setting up an encampment on the campus lawn. Notably, the MIT president was the only one to keep her job when she and the presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania failed to explicitly condemn calls for the genocide while testifying before the House Education and the Workforce Committee hearing in December.\nColumbia's president testified before the same committee on Wednesday, and on Thursday, allowed the NYPD onto campus to arrest more than 100 people for trespassing. They have since been released from custody.\nOn Sunday, Elie Buechler, a rabbi for the Orthodox Union's Jewish Learning Initiative at Columbia, sent a WhatsApp message to nearly 300 Jewish students recommending they go home because campus police and the NYPD \"cannot guarantee Jewish students' safety in the face of extreme antisemitism and anarchy.\"\nA New Haven, Connecticut, police spokesperson said about 45 protesters were arrested at Yale on Monday morning and charged with misdemeanor trespassing.\nAll were being released on promises to appear in court later.\nProtesters set up tents on Beinecke Plaza on Friday and demonstrated over the weekend, calling on Yale to end any investments in defense companies that do business with Israel.\nIn a statement to the campus community on Sunday, Yale President Peter Salovey said university officials had spoken to the student protesters multiple times about the school's policies and guidelines, including those regarding speech and allowing access to campus spaces.\n\"Putting up structures, defying the directives of university officials, staying in campus spaces past allowed times, and other acts that violate university policies and guidelines create safety hazards and impede the work of our university,\" he said. School officials said they spoke with protesters over several hours and gave them until the end of the weekend to leave Beinecke Plaza. They said they again warned protesters Monday morning and told them that they could face arrest and discipline, including suspension, before police moved in.\nA large group of demonstrators regathered after Monday's arrests at Yale and blocked a street near campus, a police spokesperson said. There were no reports of any violence or injuries.",

            "excerpt": "Rabbi Moshe Hauer spoke to Fox News Digital about the ongoing 'anarchy\" surrounding the Columbia University student protests intimidating Jewish students.",
            "summary": "Rabbi Moshe Hauer is calling on the White House and federal government to take a harder stance on combating campus antisemitism after the \"anarchy\" at Columbia University.\n\"What was very clear last week was basically a cry from the university leadership of Columbia and from the law school, the former law school dean, who's the head of the antisemitism Task Force, that they don't know how to draw the line between what is permitted and what is forbidden. And that task should not be on a task force of the community. That task, that definition, should be provided by the government of the country that tells them what's permitted, what's forbidden,\" Hauer told Fox News Digital.\nHe continued, \"The Justice Department, the Department of Education, should be telling the schools where the line is, should be telling the schools what appropriate enforcement looks like. Meanwhile, they're left to figure it out for themselves. And that's helping to grow this problem, the absence of crystal-clear guidance from our government and moral support in that enforcement.\"\nOn Sunday, Orthodox Union-Jewish Learning Initiative (OU-JLIC) Director Rabbi Elie Buechler put out a recommendation for Jewish students to return home ahead of Passover.\n\"The events of the last few days, especially last night, have made it clear that Columbia University's Public Safety and the NYPD cannot guarantee Jewish students' safety in the face of extreme antisemitism and anarchy,\" Buechler wrote. \"It deeply pains me to say that I would strongly recommend you return home as soon as possible and remain home until the reality in and around campus has dramatically improved.\"\nHauer, as the Executive Vice President at the Orthodox Union, similarly put out a statement in support of Buechler and advised students to avoid the \"anarchy\" on campus to celebrate Passover.\n\"The anarchy inside and outside Columbia's campus is disturbing, disorienting, and frightening for all of us to witness, but it has been downright dangerous for the Jewish students experiencing it. While OU-JLIC – like our campus partners in Hillel and Chabad – will continue to steadfastly support Jewish students on campus, we do not believe that it is the responsibility of the Jewish students either at Columbia or elsewhere to be heroes,\" Hauer wrote.\nHe echoed that sentiment to Fox News Digital, emphasizing that the events on campus do not represent free speech but intimidation.\n\"Those events represent anarchy. They represent the situation where there has simply been inadequate effective responses to open expressions of antisemitism. This is not free speech. Free speech is the right which everyone has, every Palestinian, everyone who is upset by the damage which has happened in Gaza to express their opinion, everyone who thinks that Israel doesn't have a right to exist to express their opinion,\" Hauer said.\n\"What's happening there is not people expressing their opinions. It's people intimidating, threatening and making the people in front of them, the Jewish people in front of them, feel unwelcome and unsafe. That's not free speech on campus. That's closing down free speech on campus. And the impact of it has been pretty terrible. And disorienting for even those who don't live anywhere near it.\"\nColumbia University has announced that some protesters have been arrested and suspended since the protests escalated. Though Hauer was hopeful there would be fewer points of conflict if Jewish students returned home, he remained uncertain about whether the situation could improve.\n\"We couldn't have guessed how quickly and drastically it would turn. So we're going to stop guessing. And we're going to just focus on getting people to do the right thing quickly and effectively,\" he said.\nThe White House later condemned the \"blatantly antisemitic\" protests \"in the strongest terms\" in a statement Sunday afternoon. Hauer was glad the White House responded to the situation, but called for a firmer response.\n\"We need more than statements of sympathy. We need concrete and real enforcement, tools of enforcement, moral support for enforcement where police and campus administrators don't feel that they're going to be sued the next day for doing what the law really requires of them to do,\" Hauer said.",

            "summary": "Rep. Virginia Foxx, chair of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, sent a letter to Columbia University leaders demanding they take action against the anti-Israel protests on campus that have made Jewish students feel unsafe.\nFoxx's letter on Sunday was addressed to Columbia President Minouche Shafik and Columbia Trustees Co-Chairs David Greenwald and Claire Shipman.\n\"I am gravely concerned by the ongoing chaos at Columbia University caused by the radical, unlawful Gaza Solidarity Encampment, which has now entered its fifth day,\" Foxx, R-N.C., wrote. \"The encampment and related activities have created a severe and pervasive hostile environment for Jewish students at Columbia. A Jewish chaplain at the University has recommended Jewish students depart campus due to the University's inability to guarantee their safety. Multiple Jewish students have already sought shelter off-campus.\"\n\"Columbia's continued failure to restore order and safety promptly to campus constitutes a major breach of the University's Title VI obligations, upon which federal financial assistance is contingent, and which must immediately be rectified,\" she continued. \"If you do not rectify this danger, then the Committee will not hesitate in holding you accountable.\"\nAnti-Israel agitators occupied Columbia's south lawn in New York City for hours on Wednesday as Shafik testified before Congress about antisemitism on the university's campus.\nAn encampment with tents was set up on the main lawn of campus and the protests continued into the night for several days.\nProtests at the university have called for an intifada and the death of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. One Jewish Columbia University student was told to \"kill yourself\" and was repeatedly kicked in the stomach.\nFoxx wrote: \"The encampment and related activities have resulted in widespread antisemitic harassment and intimidation, assaults, frequent celebration of terrorism, and major disruptions of Columbia's learning environment. … The Committee is aware of multiple Jewish students seeking shelter off-campus due to their well-founded fears regarding their physical safety and continuing to be subjected to what is clearly a hostile environment.\"\nOn Thursday, the New York City Police Department arrested 108 people who refused to leave the encampment, each of whom was issued a summons for trespassing. The university also began handing out suspension notices to the students who were arrested.\n\"This situation is unacceptable, and it is imperative that Columbia's leaders restore order and safety without further delay, in line with their commitments before the Committee at its April 17 hearing,\" Foxx said, referring to comments made by Shafik, Greenwald and Shipman stressing the importance of student safety.\n\"Columbia is failing to deliver on these commitments, as Jewish students are being harassed, assaulted, threatened, and intimidated to the point where they are departing campus for safer environments,\" she added.\nThe congresswoman said students, faculty, and staff are \"responsible for this mayhem,\" including members of the campus groups Students for Justice in Palestine, Jewish Voice for Peace, Columbia University Apartheid Divest and Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine. She said these groups have \"repeatedly and flagrantly\" violated multiple university rules and even federal law in some cases.\n\"The University must decisively hold them accountable in a manner commensurate with the severity of their offenses, including expulsion and termination of employment,\" Foxx concluded.\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and the White House have criticized the protests at Columbia as antisemitic and dangerous.\n\"The First Amendment protects the right to protest, but students also have a right to learn in an environment free from harassment or violence,\" Hochul said. \"At Columbia or on any campus, threatening Jewish students with violence or glorifying the terror of October 7 is antisemitism.\"\nOn Monday, students are planning a walk out to demand amnesty for student and faculty protesters as well as the university's divestment from \"Israeli apartheid.\"\nShafik's office said in a statement to Fox News Digital that students have a right to protest, but they may not harass and intimidate other students.\n\"As President Shafik has said repeatedly, the safety of our community is our number one priority,\" the statement said. \"Columbia students have the right to protest, but they are not allowed to disrupt campus life or harass and intimidate fellow students and members of our community. We are acting on concerns we are hearing from our Jewish students and are providing additional support and resources to ensure that our community remains safe.\"",

            "summary": "\"Reacher\" star Alan Ritchson sparred with a police organization and trashed Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., on social media this week after being called out for recently claiming that \"cops get away with murder all the time.\"\nRitchson, who also stars in the new film \"The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,\" ripped the National Fraternal Order of Police on Instagram Tuesday for its \"emotionally immature response\" to his charged comments in a Hollywood Reporter interview.\nDuring that interview published earlier this month, Ritchson was asked about an Instagram photo of him in 2020 that depicted the actor wearing a T-shirt that read, \"Arrest the cops that killed Breonna Taylor.\"\nThe action star told the outlet that the recently resurfaced photo represented his perspective that police brutality is common in America.\n\"Cops get away with murder all the time, and the fact that we can't really hold them accountable for their improprieties is disturbing to me. We should completely reform the way that we do it,\" he declared, adding, \"I mean, you shouldn't have to spend more time getting an education as a hairstylist than as a cop who's armed with a deadly weapon.\"\nDuring the same interview, Ritchson also trashed Christian supporters of former President Trump, stating, \"Trump is a rapist and a con man, and yet the entire Christian church seems to treat him like he's their poster child and it's unreal. I don't understand it.\"\nOn April 12, the police organization slammed Ritchson's post.\nOn its Facebook page, the group wrote, \"While Mr. Alan Ritchson gets his face and forehead powdered on set, our officers are out doing a job he doesn't have the courage to do. While he gets to hear loud pops and have blanks fired at him, our officers feel the heat of the bullets as they pierce their skin. There are no take two's or take three's in real life Mr. Ritchson.\"\nThe post concluded by calling Ritchson \"another useless Hollywood actor, virtue signaling for attention at the expense of brave police officers around this country,\" and told him to \"Go back to your pampered life and let the heroes handle this.\"\nRitchson fired back with a long post on Instagram, Tuesday, which suggested that the group's attack on him shows that law enforcement can't calmly handle interactions with the public.\n\"This kind of emotionally immature response is the epitome of what concerns me about law enforcement today. If this is how leadership handles a peaceful disagreement, what does life look like for those unseen interactions in the street?\" he stated.\nAs the movie star's post continued, he touted his own bravery for speaking out on the issue: \"You belittle me for being incapable of demonstrating bravery, but I believe that's exactly what I've shown. You've haplessly fired multiple shots at me simply because I have called for more accountability. I did this knowing people like you who crave a pat on the back and zero accountability would criticize me.\"\nHe went on to mention that there are plenty of \"good and brave cops who deserve the public's gratitude,\" as well as \"rogue or ill-equipped officers who remind us that we need higher barriers to entry and stricter regulations so abuses are relegated to the past.\"\nFor added measure, he slammed DeSantis for policies that enable these rogue cops, stating, \"To make matters worse, in Florida, voters perpetuate these issues by continuing to support people like Gov. Desantis who just passed a law making it illegal for anyone other than the police to police themselves.\"\nDeSantis signed two bills into state law last Friday: HB 601 and SB 184. The first will prevent investigations of local law enforcement by civilian review boards and the second will criminalize harassing or impeding law enforcement officers and first responders.\nIn his post, Ritchson trashed the bills, adding, \"I'm certain efforts like these take us further from the world I hope to leave for my children, which is one with extreme prudence when deciding who we arm and a glass house for public institutions. Especially ones with the ability to end lives.\"\nRitchson's reps did not immediately reply to Fox News Digital's request for comment.",

            "excerpt": "New York Post columnist and part-time Columbia University student Rikki Schlott shares what she witnessed during several days of pro-Palestine protests on campus.",
            "summary": "Columbia University was the epicenter of the latest string of pro-Palestine protests erupting in New York City. Despite mass arrests, students and ant-Israel agitators continued with their \"shocking\" display.\nOne part-time Columbia University student argued the ordeal illustrates how the post-October 7 \"craziness\" has reached a \"fever pitch.\"\n\"I really think this post-October 7 craziness on campus is really reaching a new level in the fever pitch,\" New York Post columnist Rikki Schlott said on \"Fox & Friends Weekend\" Saturday.\n\"I would never have imagined that I would watch NYPD officers in literal riot gear need to break up hundreds of Columbia students who are willfully getting arrested in support of of Palestine and in support of, I think, a cause that they really clearly don't fully understand.\"\nSchlott, who is in her first semester at Columbia, had a \"front row seat to the madness\" that unfolded on Thursday and Friday.\nLike many Ivy League college campuses, Columbia University has seen numerous pro-Palestinian protests sprout since Oct. 7. The demonstrations have gotten more intense as Israel continues to conduct its military offensive in the Gaza Strip against Hamas.\nDozens of protesters camped out in tents on school grounds since early Wednesday, calling on the university to divest itself from companies that have ties to Israel, as Shafik testified on Capitol Hill.\nThe university had locked down its campus to ID holders only in anticipation of unrest relating to Shafik's testimony.\nOn Thursday, demonstrators set up the \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" on a campus lawn just hours before the university President Minouche Shafik testified before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce regarding antisemitism on campus.\n\"Basically what the demands supposedly are of the encampment are that they would like the university to divest any of its investments in Israel through its endowment. And they were saying that they're not going to leave until that happens,\" Schlott explained.\nSchlott also gave credit to the NYPD, who was eventually invited to the university by Shafik and began arresting several protesters.\nIn total, 108 people were arrested and given a summons for trespassing, the New York Police Department (NYPD) said during an early evening press conference. Two people were additionally given a summons for obstruction of governmental administration.\nNYPD officers noted that many of the protesters were peaceful and didn't resist arrest. However, around 500 students left their classrooms and told officers they were the \"KKK,\" \"baby killers\" and to \"go kill ourselves,\" a police official said.\nUnfazed by Thursday's mass arrests, protests continued at Columbia University on Friday and a large police presence — with officers in riot gear — was reported.\nSchlott did differentiate between outside protesters and Columbia students, claiming outside agitators were \"more aggressive\" and \"more radical.\"\n\"[Columbia] did shut off the actual campus to anyone who didn't have an ID, so it was students only, which is why I was able to get in. And I would say that actually the protesters outside, including the one who shouted, 'we are Hamas,' who is presumably not a student, in my view and in my experience, were a lot more aggressive and a lot more radical than the students inside,\" she said.\nOver the several days of protests, Schlott said she heard demonstrators shout \"Intifada,\" \"we are Hamas,\" \"Divulge, Divest,\" and others.\n\"Students were trespassing and were clearly in violation of school rules, were being arrested. I saw Lesbians for Liberation, which is really a rich one, considering that it seems like these students don't really understand how LGBTQ people are treated in Palestine,\" the part-time student said.\nSchlott said, although prepared from her previous attendance at NYU, said the protests were \"shocking.\"\nA Columbia University spokesperson previously told Fox News Digital: \"While the encampment has been dismantled, our community has had protest activity on campus since October, and we expect that activity to continue.\"\nThe spokesperson continued, \"We have rules regarding the time, place, and manner that apply to protest activity and we will continue to enforce those. We remain in regular contact with our students and student groups and are committed to ensuring the core functions of the University continue.\"\nFox News Digital also reached out to Columbia on Saturday for a comment.",

            "summary": "FIRST ON FOX – House Republican Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., accused Columbia University President Dr. Nemat \"Minouche\" Shafik of attempting to \"cover-up\" for a \"pro-terrorist\" professor who had celebrated the Oct. 7 attacks, during her congressional testimony this week.\n\"A reminder to President Shafik that knowingly misleading Congress is a felony,\" Stefanik warned in a statement shared first with Fox News Digital. \"Despite Columbia President Shafik's testimony, there has been NO action to fire or discipline pro-terrorist and antisemitic faculty chair Professor Joseph Massad.\"\n\"Columbia has attempted to cover up for Shafik's lies updating their website to show Massad as ‘outgoing chair' but refuse to immediately remove him despite Shafik committing to at the hearing,\" Stefanik continued. \"Meanwhile, Massad claims no one from the University has even spoken to him about his hateful statements or any investigation.\"\n\"Shafik's false testimony and refusal to address the severity of the rampant antisemitism on her campus is an affront to the Jewish students and faculty at Columbia under her failed leadership,\" she said.\nStefanik and other House Republicans hammered Shafik during Wednesday's House Education and the Workforce Committee hearing to discuss pervasive antisemitism at the Ivy League school, demanding to know what consequences, if any, Professor Joseph Massad faced after writing an article praising the Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel by Hamas militants as \"awesome,\" \"astonishing,\" \"astounding\" and \"incredible.\"\nRep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., asserted that Massad's piece glorified Hamas' slaughter of nearly 1,200 Jews.\nAsked whether Massad faced any disciplinary action, Shafik testified that the professor had been \"spoken to\" by the head of his department of Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies and his dean. Though the university president said she was had not been a part of those discussions, Shafik said to Congress that Massad was told that the language he used in his article \"was unacceptable.\"\nBut Massad's statements to CNN after the congressional hearing contradicted Shafik's testimony. \"I was shown solidarity by my chair and deans based on the death threats that I received and the campaign targeting me,\" he reportedly told CNN Thursday regarding prior talks.\n\"No one has contacted me at all from the university with regards to my current chairmanship,\" he added, saying that the fact that he was under investigation by the school was \"news\" he learned through the hearing.\nFox News Digital reached out to Columbia University for comment Friday but did not immediately hear back.\nShafik initially testified that Massad was no longer chair of the School of Arts and Sciences Academic Review Committee and that he \"does not have a leadership role,\" but Stefanik later challenged why the tenured professor remained listed as chair on the university's website.\nShafik recanted, telling Congress that she needed to check whether Massad was still chair of the committee, which oversees the periodic review of all departments, centers and institutes at the school.\n\"You stated that Professor Massad was no longer chair. Then you stated he's under investigation. He is still chair on the website. So, has he been terminated as chair?\" the congresswoman asked.\nShafik said she wanted \"to confirm the facts before getting back to you,\" and Stefanik acknowledged that the university president did confirm that Massad was under investigation for alleged discrimination. \"Did you confirm he was still the chair?\" Stefanik asked. \"I need to confirm that with you. I want to – I need to check,\" Shafik said. Stefanik pressed, \"Well, let me ask you this: Will you make the commitment to remove him as chair?\"I think that would be – I think I would, yes. Let me come back with yes. But I think I just want to confirm his current status before I reply,\" Shafik told the committee, to which Stefanik replied, \"We'll take that as a yes, that you will confirm that he will no longer be chair.\"\nMassad reportedly told CNN on Thursday that he intends to remain a member of the committee next year for a three-year term. CNN also highlighted how Massad is an outgoing chair because of term limits, meaning that he would be leaving the leadership role in a matter of weeks anyway without any disciplinary action.",

            "summary": "Planet Fitness, which plummeted $400 million in value in March after gym-goers boycotted the franchise over a transgender policy, announced it was hiring a new CEO Tuesday who has a history of pushing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).\nColleen Keating headed FirstKey Homes for the past four years, where she signed onto the \"CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion pledge,\" which promises to \"continually strive to diversify our workforce, hiring through a DE&I lens to find talent in multiple locations and backgrounds,\" according to The New York Post.\nIn LinkedIn post from two years ago she said she signed the CEO DEI pledge \"to crystallize my unwavering commitment to advancing #diversity, #equity and #inclusion in the workplace and the communities we serve.\"\n\"I was proud to be a part of this critical conversation with my peers who are equally committed to making our workplaces trusting places to have complex, and sometimes difficult, conversations about diversity and inclusion, implement and expand unconscious bias education, share best practices (and lessons learned!), and create and share strategic inclusion and diversity plans,\" the post added.\nIn a 2022 interview with Triple Pundit, Keating said ensuring the corporate DEI push isn't just a flash in the pan but \"starts with DEI being embedded in a company's culture and clearly demonstrated in words and actions across the organization. When we stop thinking about DEI as a ‘program' and recognize it as an imperative that's woven into the very fabric of our company then DEI can't be a half-measure or a failure.\"\nWhen reached for comment, Planet Fitness pointed to its press release announcing Keating's hiring.\n\"Colleen's deep operational knowledge, strategic mindset and understanding of large-scale franchise operations and consumer-facing brands made her stand out among the candidates considered,\" Planet Fitness board chairman Stephen Spinelli Jr. said in the release. \"She also has a proven track record of building results-oriented teams and instilling cultures that put a premium on operational excellence and rigor, which we believe will be additive to Planet Fitness. We are confident that Colleen is an exceptional leader with the desired skills, experience and culture-first mindset necessary to accelerate Planet Fitness's next phase of growth.\"\nThe Western New England University graduate is set to replace Chris Rondeau as CEO of the \"judgment free zone\" gym on June 10. The Post reports Planet Fitness revenue fell by an additional 1.7% earlier this week.\nThe decline in revenue started with the story of Patricia Silva, a Planet Fitness regular in Fairbanks, Alaska, who sparked outrage on social media by recounting her experience of seeing \"a man with a penis\" shaving in the women's locker room in front of what appeared to be a 12-year-old girl.\n\"Planet Fitness is defending the man in the women's locker room, the man with a penis, rather than the child sitting in the corner with a towel wrapped around her,\" the 67-year-old said in a video posted on X.\nThe gym revoked Silva's membership, saying photographing another gym-goer is against Planet Fitness policy.\nHowever, Silva's experience wasn't the first encounter of its kind that the international gym franchise has run into.\nOn April 4, 38-year-old Christopher Miller was arrested and charged by North Carolina police for indecent exposure in the women's locker room at a Planet Fitness for allegedly stripping naked and asking a teen to shower together, all while declaring he identified as a woman.\nThe Post found that Miller gave no indication that he was transgender prior to barging into the changing room. He was held at Gaston County jail on a$25,000 bond.\nIn the fall, a 25-year-old man allegedly exposed himself in front of a 15-year-old girl at a Planet Fitness in Georgia, and 45-year-old Layton Kessler of North Dakota was arrested for installing devices to record women at another one of the gym's locations.\nEarlier this winter, Fox 2 reported that in Michigan, local police arrested 30-year-old Jeremiah Wiltfong for masturbating in his vehicle at a Planet Fitness parking lot as he reportedly recorded women walking by.\nThe health club lets members use the locker room of their \"self-reported gender,\" and says the following on its website: \"Planet Fitness locker room facilities and programs based on their self-reported gender identity; these facilities include bathrooms, showers, and all other facilities separated by sex.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to Keating but did not receive a response in time for publication.",

There's nothing quite like the peace of mind that comes from having a physical backup, which places control firmly in your hands, irrespective of whether you use a Mac, PC or even a Chromebook.\nOne of my favorite tools for this task is the WD Portable Drive, which offers 2 terabytes of storage. It easily connects to your device via SuperSpeed USB 3.0, ensuring quick and efficient data transfer and is fully compatible with Chromebook. A reliable drive like this is a must-have; I use another similar WD model for my MacBook and PC.\nIn addition to regular ongoing backups either on the cloud or another drive, I use this WD drive that plugs into your Mac, PC or Chromebook as an extra copy of my important data that can be disconnected and kept in a safe place away from hackers and other threats.\nWhen deciding what to back up from your computer, it's crucial to prioritize documents, files and memories that are important and irreplaceable. Here's a comprehensive list to consider.\n1) Personal documents: Include items like birth certificates, passports, social security cards, marriage certificates, wills and other legal documents that could be difficult or time-consuming to replace.\n2) Financial records: This category should cover bank statements, tax returns, investment records and other financial documents that are essential for personal record-keeping and legal compliance.\n3) Photos and videos: Family photos, vacation videos, special events like weddings or graduations and other personal memories that cannot be recreated.\n4) Work and educational documents: If you use your computer for work or school, ensure you back up important projects, research papers, presentations and related correspondence.\n5) Emails: Some emails might contain important information, agreements or attachments that you may need to refer back to. Consider backing up important emails or archiving them.\n6) Contacts: A backup of your digital address book can save you a lot of trouble in case you lose access to your devices.\n7) Music and media collections: For those who collect music, movies and books digitally, backing up these files ensures you don't lose your collection.\n8) Software and app data: Back up settings and data for apps that you use frequently, especially if they help manage your schedule, finances or health.\n9) Website bookmarks: If you rely on bookmarks to navigate the internet efficiently, backing them up can save time if you need to restore or switch to a new device.\n10) Game saves and profiles: If you're a gamer, backing up your game saves and profiles can prevent loss of progress in case of system failure.\n11) Creative works: Include writings, artwork, design files, coding projects or any other personal or professional creative work.\nThe reality of digital threats, whether from ransomware attacks, viruses or even technical glitches in the cloud, is not a matter of \"if\" but \"when.\" By maintaining a physical backup of your most crucial data, you ensure that in the event of a digital catastrophe, what matters most remains safe in your hands.\nRemember, safeguarding your digital life with a reliable physical backup isn't just a precaution, it's a necessity. This spring, take the time to protect yourself from potential future data disasters. Unplug your backup drive and store it in a safe place. It's a simple step that could save you a lot of heartaches.\nWhat's your \"data disaster\" story and what lessons did you learn about digital backups from it?

            "excerpt": "A restaging of Hollywood film noir musical 'Sunset Boulevard\" won in several categories of the Olivier Awards as theatre in London bounces back post-pandemic.",
            "summary": "A radical restaging of Hollywood film noir musical \"Sunset Boulevard\" was the big winner on Sunday at the London stage Olivier Awards, taking seven trophies including best musical revival and best actress for American star Nicole Scherzinger.\nSoccer-themed state-of-the-nation drama \"Dear England\" was named best new play, while Sarah Snook and Mark Gatiss were among the acting winners.\nScherzinger was rewarded for her performance as fading silver screen star Norma Desmond in a flashy revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"Sunset Boulevard,\" three decades after the musical's 1990s debut. Her co-star Tom Francis won the corresponding best actor prize as a struggling screenwriter fatefully drawn into Desmond's orbit.\nJamie Lloyd took the directing trophy for the technically innovative production, which melds live video with the onstage action and also won Oliviers for sound and lighting design. It's due to open in New York later this year, and Lloyd predicted it would \"take Broadway by storm.\"\nScherzinger said that when she was growing up in Kentucky, \"I always wanted to be a singer and do musicals.\"\n\"I dreamed of so many roles I wanted to do — and honestly this role, Norma Desmond, was not one of those roles,\" she said. \"But God works in mysterious ways.\"\nThe prize for best new musical went to \"Operation Mincemeat,\" a word-of-mouth hit based on an audacious real-life espionage operation that deceived the Nazis during World War II. The show began life in a tiny theater in 2019 and has moved to progressively larger venues, gathering accolades along the way.\n\"Stranger Things: The First Shadow,\" a dazzlingly staged prequel to the Netflix supernatural series, was named best new entertainment or comedy.\nThe Oliviers — the U.K. equivalent of Broadway's Tony Awards — are celebrating a bumper year for new shows in the West End, finally bouncing back from the COVID-19 pandemic. Several winners lamented the soaring cost of theater tickets, and cuts to arts education that are squeezing working-class talent out of theatrical careers and theater audiences.\n\"If you don't tell a kid to go and see a show … they're not going to develop that habit, they're not going to get that experience,\" said \"Dear England\" playwright James Graham, who grew up in a small mining town. \"So I am really worried.\"\nBut the mood was largely celebratory as \"Ted Lasso\" star Hannah Waddingham presided over an exuberant ceremony at London's Royal Albert Hall, opening the show by belting out \"Anything Goes\" alongside the London Community Gospel Choir. The show was peppered with performances from several of the nominated musicals, including \"Guys and Dolls,\" \"Hadestown\" and homegrown hit \"The Little Big Things.\"\nThe prizes, which recognize achievements in theater, opera and dance, were founded in 1976 and named for the late actor-director Laurence Olivier. Winners are chosen by voting groups of stage professionals and theatergoers.\nSnook – the scheming Shiv Roy in \"Succession\" – beat a talented field including Sarah Jessica Parker and Sophie Okonedo to be named best actress in a play for \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" an adaptation of Oscar Wilde's cautionary fable in which Snook plays more than two dozen characters.\nBackstage, the Emmy Award-winning Australian performer said the solo stage show was \"so much harder\" than doing TV.\n\"I've never done anything harder than this,\" said Snook, who said she'd asked herself \"why am I doing a 60,000-word monologue with an 8-month-old baby?\" She revealed she'd learned her lines for the play during filming of the final series of \"Succession,\" at night while breastfeeding her daughter.\nGatiss — co-creator of the BBC TV series \"Sherlock\" — won the best actor trophy for playing theater great John Gielgud in \"The Motive and the Cue,\" Jack Thorne's play about the struggle to mount a 1964 production of \"Hamlet\" with Richard Burton.\nGatiss recalled that Gielgud had considered awards ceremonies \"vulgar.\"\n\"I'm very, very thrilled to be in such wonderfully vulgar company,\" he said.\nGatiss beat \"Dear England\" star Joseph Fiennes and Andrew Scott, who had been the favorite to win for the solo show \"Vanya.\" The Anton Chekhov adaptation by Simon Stephens took the prize for best revival.\nWill Close was named best supporting actor in a play for his performance as footballer Harry Kane in \"Dear England.\"\nHaydn Gwynne, who died in October, was posthumously awarded the best supporting actress prize for her final stage role in \"When Winston Went to War with the Wireless,\" about the early days of radio in Britain.\nAwards for supporting performances in musicals were Amy Trigg for \"The Little Big Things\" and Jak Malone for \"Operation Mincemeat.\"\nThe show ended with a tribute to the National Theatre, which turned 60 in 2023 — culminating in a star-studded cast singing the anthem \"You'll Never Walk Alone.\"",

            "excerpt": "Former U.S. Ambassador Victor Manuel Rocha, who pleaded guilty last week to serving as a Cuban spy, blames radical politics from Yale during formative college years.",
            "summary": "A former National Security Council member and U.S. ambassador to Bolivia, who admitted to secretly acting as an agent for the government of the Republic of Cuba, blames the radical politics pushed on him during his formative college years for turning on his country.\nA federal judge sentenced 73-year-old Victor Manuel Rocha of Miami to 15 years in prison last week for working against the U.S. government for decades for communist Cuba in \"clandestine intelligence-gathering missions.\"\nBefore the judge handed down the sentence, Rocha issued a statement on his guilty plea, which was shared by Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., on X.\n\"I am a 73-year-old man. During my formative years in college, I was heavily influenced by the radical politics of the day,\" Rocha said. \"My deep commitment at that time to radical social change in the region led me to the eventual betrayal of my oath of loyalty to the United States during my two decades in the State Department.\"\nRocha graduated from Yale University in 1973 before going on to earn his master's degree in public administration from Harvard University in 1976, then a master's degree in international relations from Georgetown University in 1978, according to the State Department's website archives.\nFox News Digital reached out to Yale for a comment regarding Rocha's statement. The university declined to comment.\nRocha was a former U.S. Department of State employee who served on the National Security Council from 1994 to 1995, and as U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia from 2000 to 2002.\nAccording to a criminal complaint from the DOJ, Rocha used his employment in the State Department between 1981 and 2002 to obtain classified information and affect U.S. foreign policy.\nFollowing his employment at the State Department, Rocha transferred in 2006 as an advisor to the Commander of the U.S. Southern Command, a joint command of the U.S. military whose area of responsibility includes Cuba.\nThe DOJ said that Rocha provided false and misleading information to the U.S. to maintain his secret status, traveled outside the U.S. to meet with Cuban intelligence operatives and made false and misleading statements to obtain travel documents.\nAfter serving the foreign service, he settled in Miami as a businessman in the private sector.\n\"Today, I no longer see the world through the radical eyes of my youth,\" Rocha said in his statement. \"I left the Government 22 years ago, moved to this great city, and dedicated the rest of my life to my family and the education of my children. My long and successful transition to the private sector culminated in my becoming a top international executive in the mining sector for well over a decade.\n\"The latter, however, cannot erase the damage done during my earlier career working for the Government,\" he added.\nRocha told the judge he takes full responsibility for his actions and accepts the penalty he has to pay.\n\"Importantly, I am making, and will continue to make as required, significant amends through my unconditional collaboration to those I have betrayed,\" the former ambassador said. \"I know that my actions have caused great pain to my family, former colleagues, and the closest of friends. I ask them all for their understanding and their forgiveness.\"\nThe judge accepted Rocha's guilty plea to counts 1 and 2 of the indictment, which charged him with conspiring to act as an agent of a foreign government and conspiring to defraud the U.S. and acting as an agent of a foreign government without notice as required by law.\nHe was then sentenced to the statutory maximum penalty of 15 years in prison, a $500,000 fine, three years of supervised release and a special assessment.\n\"Convicted spy Victor Manuel Rocha worked as a spy for Communist #Cuba, while he served as a United States Ambassador,\" Gimenez said in a post on X in which he shared Rocha's statement. \"He is a traitor to our nation [and] must face the MAXIMUM sentence. No one believes his bogus Statement of Allocution!\"\nUnder the terms of the parties' plea agreement, Rocha must cooperate with the U.S., including assisting with any damage assessment related to his work on behalf of the Republic of Cuba. Rocha must relinquish all future retirement benefits, including pension payments, owed to him by the U.S. based upon his former State Department employment.\nHe must also assign to the U.S. any profits that he may be entitled to receive in connection with any publication relating to his criminal conduct or his U.S. government service.",

            "summary": "HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Ellen Ash Peters, who was the first woman to serve as Connecticut's chief justice and wrote the majority opinion in the state Supreme Court's landmark school desegregation ruling in 1996, has died. She was 94.\nPeters, who also was the first female faculty member at Yale Law School, passed away Tuesday, according to the Connecticut Judicial Branch. The cause and location of her death were not immediately disclosed.\n\"What a trailblazer she was!\" the current chief justice, Richard Robinson, said in a statement. \"While small in stature, she was a fearless legal giant who was dedicated to upholding the rule of law. She also recognized the importance of fairness, openness, transparency and providing true equal access to justice for all.\"\nPeters was appointed to the state Supreme Court in 1978 by then-Gov. Ella Grasso, a Democrat and the first woman who was not a spouse or widow of a former governor to be elected the governor of a U.S. state. Peters was also the first woman to serve on the state's highest court. She became chief justice in 1984, served on the court until 1996 and later took part-time senior status.\nIn her last year as chief justice, Peters wrote the majority opinion in a 4-3 ruling in the Sheff v. O'Neill case, declaring the segregation of Hartford-area schools to be unconstitutional. In particular, the majority said the extreme racial isolation of minorities in Hartford schools deprived them of a state constitutional right to equal education.\n\"In staying our hand, we do not wish to be misunderstood about the urgency of finding an appropriate remedy for the plight of Hartford's schoolchildren,\" Peters wrote. \"Every passing day shortchanges these children in their ability to contribute to their own well-being and to that of this state and nation.\"\nIn response, the state legislature created a network of magnet schools and school choice options to attract a mix of city and suburban children. But the legal case that prompted the ruling continued to be litigated because of what advocates said were continuing inequalities until 2022, when a settlement was reached.\nDuring her time on the Supreme Court, Peters presided over cases ranging from ones involving the death penalty to property disputes. She also led an effort to prevent gender and racial bias in the court system.\nIn 1995, she wrote the majority opinion in a ruling that upheld the state's ban on assault weapons.\nOn her last day as chief justice, she spoke of the importance of preserving justice for all people.\n\"The court embodies the pluralist spirit of America,\" Peters said. \"If the court is to be a leader in the development of the law, it must be prepared to respond″ to all of the population.\nPeters was born in Berlin, Germany, in 1930. Her family fled eight years later in fear of Nazi party rule and emigrated to New York City, according to a biography by Yale Law School.\nShe went on to graduate from Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania in 1951 and from Yale Law School in 1954. After law school, she was a clerk for a federal appeals court judge in New York City and then taught at the University of California at Berkeley. In 1956, when she was 26, she became Yale Law School's first female faculty member, according to the university.\nPeters also became the first woman to earn tenure at Yale Law School, in 1964. After being appointed to the Supreme Court, she continued to teach law at Yale as an adjunct professor until she became chief justice.\nThe late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, at a 1994 event, said Peters \"gave generations of women law students cause for hope (and) a reason to believe that they, too, could aspire and achieve.\"\nTop political leaders and legal experts were praising Peters on Tuesday.\nConnecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, also called Peters a trailblazer and noted the importance of the school desegregation ruling.\n\"Throughout her tenure, she dedicated her work to ensuring that Connecticut's courts are operated fairly and are equally accessible to all of this state's residents,\" Lamont said in a statement. \"Her service is to be emulated and she will be remembered for her intelligence, her tenacity, and her remarkable fortitude.\"\nFormer Connecticut Chief Justice Chase Rogers, the state's second female chief justice who retired in 2018, said Peters was a brilliant jurist dedicated to ensuring justice was achieved.\n\"Chief Justice Peters not only smashed the glass ceiling for other women who wanted to become judges but also served as a role model for all judges,\" Rogers said.\nPeters' husband, Phillip Blumberg, who was a professor and dean at the University of Connecticut School of Law, died in 2021. They lived in West Hartford.",

            "excerpt": "Fox News poll shows registered voters show Trump ahead of Biden by three points in Michigan, a shift from Biden's strong lead ahead of the 2020 election",
            "summary": "Four years ago this month — in the early lockdown stages of the coronavirus pandemic — Joe Biden led Donald Trump by 8 points among Michigan voters in a head-to-head presidential matchup. Today, they prefer Trump by 3 points.\nA new Fox News survey of Michigan registered voters finds President Biden receives 46% support to former President Trump's 49%. That's within the margin of sampling error. In February, it was 45% Biden — 47% Trump. In April 2020, Biden was at 49% to Trump's 41%.\nTrump's advantage is mainly due to a 19-point lead among men. He is also the favorite among White men without a college degree (by 33 points), rural voters (+23), voters under age 35 (+16), and White voters (+13). Plus, he is helped by a 4-point edge among independents as well as garnering a bit more support among Republicans (94%) than Biden gets among Democrats (92%).\nBiden's best groups include Black voters (+56), urban voters (+27), suburban women (+21), and voters ages 65 and over (+14).\nSince February, Trump is up 5 points among men, and while Biden has made similar gains among Black voters (+7), his 75% support among Blacks is about 20 points below where it was when he won Michigan in 2020.\nVoters living in union households go for Biden by 12 points, while the much larger non-union segment backs Trump by 7.\nTrump retains more of his 2020 voters, with 95% still supporting him compared to 90% of Biden's 2020 voters backing him.\nIn a potential 5-way race, Trump is ahead of Biden by 42%-40%, with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. receiving 9%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 2% each. It was announced Thursday that Kennedy will appear on the ballot in Michigan in November.\nBiden won Michigan by less than three percentage points in 2020. Ninety-six percent of Democrats voted for him, but fewer of them today, 83%, approve of the job he is doing.\nThe president's overall job rating stands at 43% approve and 56% disapprove. Some 11% of those disapproving of Biden's job performance still prefer him over Trump in the matchup.\nMichiganders have mixed views of Biden's approach to the Israel and Hamas war in Gaza, with 24% saying he is too supportive of the Israelis, 21% too supportive of the Palestinians, and 40% about right. Democrats (33%) and independents (22%) are more likely than Republicans (15%) to think Biden is too supportive of the Israelis -- and that shows up in the presidential vote preference. More than one-third of those saying Biden is too close to Israel back Trump (35%), the highest of the four battleground states where Fox News conducted surveys this week (Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin).\nJust over half of Michigan voters are either getting ahead financially or holding steady and those voters choose Biden, while just under half are falling behind and they go big for Trump.\nMore voters trust Trump by wide margins on some of the major issues of the campaign — immigration (+15 points), the economy (+11 points), and foreign policy (+8), while Biden is more narrowly preferred on election integrity (+6), health care (+6), and abortion (+5). The two are trusted about evenly on energy policy (Trump +2).\nBy a 9-point margin, more think Trump (49%) has the mental fitness to serve effectively as president than Biden (40%). Some 22% of Democrats think Biden lacks the metal soundness to serve. That's more than twice the number of Republicans who say the same about Trump (10%).\nMajorities of voters under age 35 disapprove of Biden (63%), think he lacks the mental fitness to serve (68%), trust Trump to handle the economy (61%), and favor Trump in the head-to-head ballot (+16 points).\nOverall, more voters view Biden negatively than positively by 16 points (41% favorable, 57% unfavorable). Trump's personal rating is also in negative territory but by a narrower 8 points (45-53%). Kennedy is underwater by 3 (39-42%), with one in five unable to rate him (19%).\nForty-six percent of voters say they would back the Republican candidate for Congress in their district, while 43% prefer the Democrat. Almost all of those backing the Democratic candidate go for Biden (92%) and most of those favoring the Republican candidate back Trump (93%).\nConducted April 11-16, 2024 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,126 Michigan registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (186) and cellphones (653) or completed the survey online after receiving a text message (287). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sample error of ±3 percentage points. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics of respondents are representative of the registered voter population.",

            "excerpt": "Police in Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's district shut down an illegal flea market only for some vendors to return and continue selling their goods.",
            "summary": "The NYPD raided an illegal open-air \"flea market\" operating in Squad member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's district earlier this week, confiscating counterfeit goods and other items.\nBut some sellers have thumbed their noses at law enforcement and are back on the streets peddling their merchandise.\nThe sellers, many of whom are reported to be migrants, have been blocking sidewalks in the Queens neighborhoods of Jackson Heights, Corona and Elmhurst, shilling various items such as second-hand goods and clothes.\nLocal residents say the neighborhood looks like a Third World country due to its shabby-looking and unsanitary-like conditions. Prostitution is also rampant in the area, with some nicknaming the neighborhood's main strip along Roosevelt Avenue as the \"avenue of the sweethearts.\"\nVideo obtained by Fox News Digital last month shows an endless stream of vendors with piles of clothes stacked along the streets of Roosevelt Avenue and 91st Street, while others sell sneakers, pots and pans, toys and photo frames. It's not all family-friendly merchandise: Prostitutes are also known to frequent the area.\nIn another video shot last Saturday, more illegal vendors could be seen lined up next to each other along a 1,000-foot stretch just a few blocks away on Junction Boulevard.\nBut on Monday and Tuesday, police were seen raiding the now notorious hotspot along Roosevelt Avenue near 91st Street and loading the goods into the back of an NYPD truck. The sanitation department and other agencies also took part in the raid, police say.\n\"Now you see it… now you don't,\" NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Operations Kaz Daughtry wrote on X Tuesday. \"This ‘flea market' has been at the center of many quality-of-life complaints in Jackson Heights. We conducted an operation yesterday in response to these community concerns... we addressed the unlicensed peddlers, selling counterfeit goods on the streets of Queens!\"\nPolice also posted a photo of dozens of large see-through trash bags filled with phone covers and other accessories from inside the local precinct. The New York Post reports that at least one vendor on the sidewalk had been selling power tools bearing tags from a nearby Home Depot.\nIn video shot on Tuesday by state Assembly candidate Ramses Frías, a former Democrat turned Republican, illegal vendors could be seen back on the streets flouting the law and pushing their goods.\nFrías says it proved that the raid was short-lived and warned that conditions will only get worse once the weather heats up.\n\"If there isn't a consistent police presence and/or team set in place to educate these illegal vendors then this will all continue,\" Frías, who has lived in the area his whole life, tells Fox News Digital.\n\"The constant neglect from the actual representatives of this area like Ocasio-Cortez, Assembly Members Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas and Catalina Cruz and the rest have angered and frustrated the residents here in these communities. We are done with the mess being brought about by prostitution, open-air illegal markets and crime,\" he adds. \"Things are spiraling out of control and the lawlessness must come to an end.\"\nThe raid took place on the edge of Ocasio-Cortez's 14th Congressional District. The long strip along Junction Boulevard is also part of the progressive congresswoman's district.\nThe area is mostly represented by progressive politicians, including Congresswoman Grace Meng, Assembly Members Cruz, González-Rojas, Steve Raga and Council Member Shekar Krishnan. State Senators Michael Gianaris and Jesscia Ramos, both Democrats, also represent the district.\nDemocrat Council Member Moya also represents the district and has been a vocal opponent of illegal vendors and prostitution and in the neighborhood, often at odds with his fellow party colleagues.\nThe NYPD raid was carried out in conjunction with Moya, who also teamed up with the mayor in January to raid several brothels in the neighborhood. Neither of the raids resulted in arrests, police say.\n\"The number one complaint to my office is the congestion and garbage caused by illegal street vendors,\" Moya wrote on Instagram following Sunday's crackdown. \"Mothers can't push their strollers through our sidewalks, businesses are being robbed and undercut steps from their doors and residents are being put at risk from unsafe food handling. Enough is enough.\"\nMeanwhile, following the police sweep, New York City Mayor Eric Adams pinned the blame on illegal immigrants not being able to work. He has often said migrants have a \"right to work\" in the U.S. and not allowing them to do so is \"anti-American.\"\n\"Some of the problems we're facing in our city, this is the byproduct of bringing thousands of people to a city and telling them they cannot work… this is what we're seeing,\" Adams said Monday, according to Fox 5 New York. \"Some of the illegal shops, sex trafficking that is taking place, all of this is a by-product. … I keep telling folks, you have 3,000 people on Randall's Island [migrant facility] that cannot do anything all day. That's just not right.\"\nA spokesperson for Ocasio-Cortez did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.",

            "excerpt": "Republican candidate Curtis Bashaw of New Jersey is optimistic the GOP in 2024 can break a nearly half century long losing streak in Senate elections in the Garden State",
            "summary": "EXCLUSIVE - It's been over a half century since a Republican won a Senate election in blue state New Jersey.\nBut real estate developer and hotelier Curtis Bashaw is optimistic about his party's prospects in November's elections to end the decades-long losing streak.\nBashaw, one of the two leading contenders in a multi-candidate field in June's GOP Senate primary in New Jersey, emphasized \"I believe this is a once in a generation opportunity.\"\n\"I can't wait to see how we prove to the rest of the country that New Jersey is a lot more purple than people realize,\" he added in a national digital exclusive interview with Fox News.\nA major reason for Bashaw's optimism is the prospect of a three-way race in New Jersey. Longtime Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who was indicted last year on federal corruption charges, is not running for re-election as a Democrat and instead is mulling an independent bid, which polls indicate would potentially take votes away from likely Democratic Senate nominee Rep. Andy Kim.\nBashaw, an entrepreneur and historic preservationist who is recognized in the Garden State for leading the restorations of the historic Congress Hall and the Virginia Hotel in Cape May, at the southern tip of the Jersey shore, is a first time politician.\n\"I'm a political outsider,\" Bashaw emphasized. \"I'm a business guy. I built a business over 35 years restoring landmark abandoned hotels.\"\nAnd he highlighted that he grew his business from 25 to 1,000 employees.\n\"I'm in it because I want to unshackle small business from over regulation,\" he said.\nBashaw's chief rival for the GOP nomination is Christine Serrano Glassner, who's served for four years as mayor of Mendham Borough, in the northern part of the state.\nBashaw holds a formidable fundraising advantage in the Republican race - thanks in part to a large self-investment in his campaign.\nHe also enjoys an advantage on the primary ballot, as he has the county line in two-thirds of the state's 21 counties.\nNew Jersey has long allowed counties to print ballots that include a prominent party line, which are widely viewed as helping candidates with establishment backing. Kim sued in federal court to overturn the county lines in the Democratic Primary. But the GOP county lines were upheld.\n\"New Jersey is made up of thousands and thousands and thousands of small businesspeople. We are going to get to them really quickly and our name ID will go up really fast,\" Bashaw said.\nAnd pointing to a busy schedule on the campaign trail ahead of the primary, Bashaw showcased that \"I go to six coffees a day. I go talk to every single county in our state. I put a lot of miles on the car.\"\nAsked about former President Donald Trump, who is the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee, Bashaw told Fox News \"I'm supporting this ticket top to bottom.\"\nIt's been 36 years since a Republican carried New Jersey in a White House race, but Trump is planning a campaign stop in the state next month.\n\"Donald Trump thinks New Jersey's in play. I agree with him. Trump believes he can flip the country from blue to red. I believe we can flip this Senate seat from blue to red,\" Bashaw said.\nHe argued that \"there's a massive opportunity to pull\" New Jersey's large pool of unaffiliated voters \"to the Republican tent…. We are going to pull those unaffiliated voters our way this fall.\"\nNational Republicans to date have not made any investments in the Senate race in the Garden State.\nBut National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director Mike Berg said \"we're keeping a close eye on New Jersey.\"\nA national Democratic Senate campaign aide, asked about the contest, told Fox News that \"Democrats have won every New Jersey Senate race since 1978 and 2024 will be no different.\"\nBashaw, in his interview, spotlighted a couple of key issues, including crime.\n\"New Jerseyans are not feeling safe and secure in their homes,\" he argued.\nOn immigration and border security, another key issue Republicans are spotlighting, he charged that New Jersey \"is now a border state. There are illegals coming into all of our counties.\"\n\"The woke ideology has permeated through our culture and we now have in our state, schools keeping secrets from parents about very, very, personal decisions,\" he claimed, as he defended parental rights in public education.\nOn the issue of abortion, which Democrats are spotlighting, Bashaw pointed to the two-year-old blockbuster decision by the Supreme Court's conservative majority that overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which for a half century had legalized abortion nationwide.\n\"I believe that the Dobbs decision was the correct decision,\" Bashaw said.\nBut he added that \"I don't support a federal ban,\" which some in his party are backing.\nThe Dobbs decision moved the fight over abortion back to the states, and in New Jersey abortion is legal in all stages of pregnancy.\n\"New Jersey's decided it,\" Bashaw said, before charging that \"the Democrats are the extremists on this issue, passing legislation allowing abortions up until the day of birth.\"",

            "excerpt": "I went to my YMCA for 40 years without a problem, until I dared say that men don't belong in the women's locker room. Then I was bullied, harassed and treated like I was the villain.",
            "summary": "I live in the small town of Port Townsend, Washington. We have a community pool, built in the 1960s. There are two dressing areas, one for men and one for women, both with curtained gang showers. Stick figure logos direct men to one side, women to the other. I've been swimming there for 40 years, meeting friends, exercising and practicing good pool etiquette — until July 26, 2022.\nThat day was the beginning of my firsthand experience with the vicious and unforgiving wrath of people who believe in modern gender ideology.\nWhile showering after my weekly swim, I heard a man's voice. Peering past the billowing curtain, I saw a biological man in a woman's swimsuit looking at two little girls. I was flabbergasted. My immediate reaction was instinctual and protective. I'm a mother of daughters. I also have experience as an advocate for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. I know that men should not be allowed in women-only areas; it's unsafe and creates potentially traumatizing situations for women and children.\nI told the man to leave \"right now.\" Within seconds, a YMCA staff person appeared. I asked her to get him out. Without any inquiry, she immediately accused me of discrimination, banned me from the pool for the rest of my life, and called the police. Instead of protecting the little girls or trying to understand my concerns, I became the accused. I was the culprit.\nWhat I didn't know at the time was that our community pool, managed by the local YMCA, now has a policy that allows men who identify as women to use the women-only dressing/shower room. The YMCA didn't publicize this new policy, change the signage, or warn women that men are now allowed into this once-private space.\nI felt strongly that people needed to know about this policy. I made a sign, \"men who identify as women are using the women's dressing/shower room,\" and picketed outside the public pool for two days. My intent was to let unsuspecting women and parents know this was happening, hoping other swimmers would speak up. Instead, crowds of people opposing my concerns gathered to accost and demean me. I felt unsafe, so I quit picketing.\nI decided to go to a City Council meeting to tell my story and ask the council to inform the community about mixing men and women in the same dressing area. I suggested that they provide staff with training on how to handle this extreme cultural shift, that they put up signage to alert people, and that they provide patrons with choices. The chamber was unusually crowded that evening; many transgender believers spoke along with some very wise community members. The mayor allowed commenting to continue for two hours.\nBut I felt I had to keep advocating for women. On August 15, 2022, I spoke at a press conference across from city hall to protest the pool policy, the failure to respect women's right to privacy and safety. It was a small gathering, but as we spoke, hundreds of transgender advocates closed in on us, screaming, pushing, knocking people down. They tried to steal signs and the PA system. Bicyclists riding way too close knocked into me and others.\nAcross the street, several police officers stood by, watching. We called for help. It was almost an hour before local authorities responded to the attacks. And while this was happening outside city hall, the council, inside, passed a proclamation. Using data from unverified studies, they declared the town's support for transgender people.\nThus began my education about the 21st-century phenomenon of transgender ideology. I was faulted as disrespectful for not using rejiggered pronouns. I learned the Washington State Human Rights Commission had adopted changes in the definition of sex, scrambling it with gender, facilitating new laws and policies that sound so right — diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI) — but harbor dark outcomes.\nLaws and policies are now worded to allow confabulation in our cultural practices, mores and biological sciences. What to me appeared to be a fad — lingo and costuming — is, in fact, big business.\nKids are now taught DEI ideas, pseudo-biology and nonsensical pronouns in early grades. Women who protest the loss of their civil rights to privacy and safety are subjected to all manner of humiliation, their right to speak muzzled.\nAcross the street, several police officers stood by, watching. We called for help. It was almost an hour before local authorities responded to the attacks. And while this was happening outside city hall, the council, inside, passed a proclamation. Using data from unverified studies, they declared the town's support for transgender people.\nI was harassed and maligned for weeks in the local newspapers and on social media. There was a collective hysteria in the community. If this had been the 17th century, I would likely have been burned at the stake.\nWe, our grandmothers, and those who came before us had to battle to the point of torture, imprisonment and death to gain our rights as women — right to safety and equality, to ownership, to vote, to hold office.\nMake no mistake, those rights have been usurped. Gone is the English grammar of our culture and laws based on biology and science. Gone are privacy and safety in public facilities; we've lost parental rights; women's careers as top athletes abolished. And it's all by the most astonishing cultural and legal phenomenon our society has ever experienced.\nI am exiled from the community pool for the rest of my life — but what of the lives of the women to come?",

            "excerpt": "President Biden and former President Trump in a dead heat in the latest Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters",
            "summary": "The Keystone State looks headed for another tight race as President Biden and former President Trump are in a dead heat in the latest Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters, a state Trump won by less than a point in 2016 and Biden reclaimed by just over a point in 2020.\nThe survey of registered voters, released Thursday, finds the former and current presidents tied at 48% each, a slight improvement for Biden who was down by 2 percentage points in March.\nBiden saw modest gains among nonwhite voters (+5), suburban voters (+5) and voters under age 35 (+9), while Trump's coalition, such as conservatives, White evangelicals, White men without a degree, and rural voters, held relatively steady. What's more, Trump kept the advantage he had among independents: He was ahead among them by 7 points in March and maintains an 8-point edge now.\nBiden won union households by 5 points in 2020. Today, he holds the small subgroup by 2 points (49% Biden, 47% Trump). Non-union households split 48% each.\nIn a potential five-way race that includes third-party candidates, Trump comes out on top by 2 points: Trump 44%, Biden 42%, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. 8%, Jill Stein 2%, and Cornel West 1%. In this scenario, 8% of two-way Trump supporters break for Kennedy (none for Stein or West), while 10% of Biden supporters go for Kennedy (6%), Stein (3%), and West (1%).\nBiden is in the Keystone State this week, focusing on the economy and advocating for higher taxes on the wealthy as he visits several cities, including his hometown of Scranton.\nOver 4 in 10 voters feel they are falling behind financially (44%). Almost as many (41%) say they are holding steady, while just 14% say they are getting ahead. Trump leads among those who feel they are falling behind by 53 points, while Biden is ahead by 42 points among those saying getting ahead/holding steady.\nThe March Fox News Poll identified the economy as the top issue for Pennsylvanians, when voters surveyed felt Trump would better handle the issue. Trump's advantage on the issue (+12 points) held steady in the April poll.\nTrump also has a 16-point lead on another top issue: immigration and border security, while voters favor him on foreign policy by 4 points.\nBiden is seen as better at handling abortion (+10), election integrity (+6), and health care (+6).\nThe two major candidates are nearly tied on energy policy (Biden +1), despite concerns among some Democrats that Biden's opposition to fracking might be unpopular, especially after the administration paused new exports of U.S. natural gas earlier this year. A House Oversight Committee hearing on Thursday saw Republicans question the impact the pause would have on the U.S., especially internationally.\nVoters split over the Biden administration's handling of the conflict in the Middle East: 24% think he's too supportive of the Israelis vs. 23% say he's too supportive of the Palestinians. The largest number, 40%, says Biden's approach is about right.\nDemocrats are more likely to think the White House is too supportive of the Israelis, while Republicans are more likely to think it is too supportive of the Palestinians.\nBiden's job approval rating is nearly identical to his personal favorability rating: 45% approve of the job he's doing and 44% have a favorable opinion of him, while 55% disapprove of his job performance and have an unfavorable view of him.\nTrump is perceived slightly better than Biden on his favorable rating, but still underwater by 5 points (47% favorable vs. 52% unfavorable), while Kennedy is underwater by 6 points (40% favorable, 46% unfavorable, 15% can't rate).\nThe candidates' mental soundness has been a topic of debate and Pennsylvania voters are more likely to think Trump has the mental fitness to serve effectively as president (49%) than say the same of Biden (43%). At least half think they both don't have the mental soundness to perform the duties of president (50% Trump does not, 55% Biden does not).\nThe Pennsylvania congressional race is tight as well: 47% say they would vote for the Democratic candidate in their district while 46% support the GOP candidate. That's a reversal from March when Republicans were up by 3 points.\n\"The liabilities Biden has nationally are present in Pennsylvania, but they're muted,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"His standing with core Democratic constituencies is a little stronger, and he does a little better on issues like abortion, health care, and election integrity. It's the difference between being down a few points versus being tied.\"\nConducted April 11-16 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,141 Pennsylvania registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (211) and cellphones (628) or completed the survey online after receiving a text (302). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics of respondents are representative of the registered voter population.",

            "summary": "Former first lady Melania Trump stressed the importance of unifying the nation, telling Fox News Digital that \"equality\" needs to be the \"everyday experience of every American.\"\nThe former first lady is expected to headline an event at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday, hosted by the Log Cabin Republicans — a pro-LGBT group. The event will focus on the group's \"Road to Victory,\" a voter-turnout program planned for gay voters in swing states.\n\"We must unite in our effort to establish a society where equality is the everyday experience of every American,\" the former first lady told Fox News Digital. \"Individual freedom provides a unifying set of principles, and ultimately establishes our American way.\"\n\"Together, we must nourish and safeguard the seeds of liberty,\" she continued. \"Because, when successful, America blossoms into a magnificent place where everyone can practice their beliefs, share new ideas, and express individualism — this is when we are our best.\"\nThe former first lady is working alongside former Amb. Ric Grenell for the event. Grenell, who served during the Trump administration as the ambassador to Germany and the acting director of national intelligence, was the first openly gay member of the presidential Cabinet in U.S. history. However, Grenell said that \"means absolutely nothing in terms of special treatment.\"\n\"It simply means that the American dream is alive and well — if you work hard and have a little bit of luck and God's grace, you can do anything you want in America regardless of your skin color, socio-economic situation, or sexual orientation,\" Grenell told Fox News Digital. \"We want what every American wants, to be treated equally not differently.\"\nGrenell told Fox News Digital that the Republican Party has grown \"increasingly welcoming of gay conservatives over the last 20 years.\"\n\"But we made the most progress when Donald Trump and Melania Trump moved into the White House,\" Grenell told Fox News Digital.\nGrenell said that, \"Gays and lesbians are no longer reflexively leftist.\"\n\"They realize they have incredible liberties in America and that they are not opposed,\" he explained, noting there are more than 80 Log Cabin chapters across the country that have seen an \"explosion of membership.\"\n\"The gay left continues to try and convince America's gays and lesbians that they don't have personal freedoms — it's absurd,\" Grenell said.\nHe added, \"Gays and lesbians around the world are literally dying to come to America. We live in the greatest country in the world and Log Cabin members are proud to say it.\"\nGrenell told Fox News Digital that the 2024 election is \"about the elites in D.C. versus the rest of America.\" He told Fox News Digital that the media and Democrats are \"shamelessly defining support for trans kids as a litmus test for supporting gay rights, and it infuriates gay conservatives.\"\nAs for unity, Grenell said it is Democrats and far-left activists who are to blame for separating Americans.\n\"Gay, Inc, and the far-Left activists who control Gay, Inc are spending millions of dollars to separate gays in America,\" Grenell said. \"They tell young people they must step away from the rest of society because they are oppressed in America. They work hard to make gays angry, weird, separated, and fringe. They want separate flags, pronouns, bakeries, and bathrooms. It's crazy.\"\nGrenell said the left \"won't admit that the equality fight is largely over in America but just beginning in the 69 countries around the world that criminalize gays.\"\n\"But gay conservatives know this is the greatest country in the world to be who you are — We are welcomed in every community,\" he said. \"We aren't oppressed in America.\"\nThe former first lady told Fox News Digital that the Log Cabin Republicans' overarching mission is \"important\" and \"rooted in respect.\"\n\"Based on this central value, people thrive and exist together in a world where all are honored and celebrated,\" she said.\nThe former first lady was given the Lincoln Award at a Log Cabin event at Mar-a-Lago in 2021.\nMeanwhile, Fox News Digital asked the former first lady what her plans would be for a second term in the White House, should her husband, former President Trump, win the 2024 election.\n\"The safety and well-being of American families remains my top priority,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"Our children are our future leaders, tomorrow's innovators.\"\nShe told Fox News Digital that it is \"essential we provide the highest level of care to our next generation; to insure they not only thrive but reach their full potential.\"\n\"In turn, our nation will sustain for generations,\" she said.\nDuring her time as first lady, Trump hosted virtual roundtables on foster care as part of her \"Be Best\" initiative, and focused on strengthening the child welfare system. She worked with members of Congress on legislation that secured funding for grants awarded to youth and young adults currently or formerly in foster care to help pay for college, career school or training. The bill ultimately was signed by then-President Trump in December 2020.\nSince leaving the White House, the former first lady has also created special edition Non-Fungible Tokens. A portion of those proceeds went toward her initiative \"Fostering the Future\" to secure educational opportunities and scholarships for children in the foster care community.",

            "summary": "Another day, another newsroom in turmoil.\nAnd it features a familiar cast of characters: Senior executives who say they are upholding old-fashioned standards of fairness, and younger, woke rebels who want only their point of view – the liberal point of view – represented.\nThe balance of power has shifted in recent years. Managers at major media companies are so concerned with the anger of their rebels and the denunciations on social media that they frequently cave.PROSECUTORS PUSH SALACIOUS PORTRAIT OF TRUMP, WINNING SOME BUT NOT ALL BATTLES\nThe subject of the latest eruption, and not for the first time, is the New York Times.\nAnd the information comes to us from the Wall Street Journal, which has this tantalizing lead:\n\"The New York Times is investigating itself.\"\nTurns out there was a potentially damaging leak, and a top Times editor, Charlotte Behrendt, has interviewed nearly 20 staffers to find out whodunit.\nThe subject is coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas.\nIt's no secret that many younger liberals blame Israel for the war, even though it was launched by Hamas terrorists in the unspeakably brutal massacre launched on Oct. 7. Some Times employees questioned the reporting behind a story saying Hamas weaponized sexual violence during these attacks, the Journal says, and complained that the suffering of Gaza residents isn't getting the same attention.\nTo his credit, Times Executive Editor Joe Kahn, the lowest-profile person to run the paper in decades, speaks on the record.ISRAEL'S SUCCESS, IRAN'S FAILURE AND THE CHANCES OF IGNITING THE MIDEAST POWDER KEG\n\"The idea that someone dips into that process in the middle, and finds something that they considered might be interesting or damaging to the story under way, and then provides that to people outside, felt to me and my colleagues like a breakdown in the sort of trust and collaboration that's necessary in the editorial process,\" he said. \"I haven't seen that happen before.\"\nKahn also nails this point: that digital workers weren't trained in independent journalism and haven't learned tolerance on college campuses.\n\"Young adults who are coming up through the education system are less accustomed to this sort of open debate, this sort of robust exchange of views around issues they feel strongly about than may have been the case in the past,\" says Kahn.\nThe leak of the internal debate, to the liberal site Intercept, has sparked a backlash. Reporter Stacy Cowley, a union official who sat in on some interviews, accused the company of going after those who feel their concerns about Gaza have been ignored.\n\"Instead of taking them seriously, the company is turning around and bullying that group into silence,\" Cowley says. A union grievance says the company was targeting a group of staffers of Arab and Middle Eastern descent, which the Times denies.\nWay down in the story is this CYA sentence:\n\"War coverage has also fueled tensions at the Wall Street Journal, with some reporters in meetings and internal chat groups complaining that coverage is skewed – either favoring Israel or Palestinians.\" Just in case anyone was wondering.\nA similar explosion just occurred at NPR, where award-winning senior business editor Uri Berliner resigned under pressure yesterday. He had been suspended for five days without pay for publishing a piece (without permission) in the Free Press about how the radio network has moved from merely left-leaning to blatant liberal activism, triggered by the election of Donald Trump.\nBerliner, no fan of Trump, cited example after example of NPR being anti-Israel, having a pro-transgender agenda, and blowing off the Hunter Biden laptop story on grounds that it wasn't really a story. He pointed to the hiring of CEO Katherine Maher, a former Biden campaign worker whose past tweets show a history of far-left activism and intolerance. (She says she was a private citizen then.)\n\"I cannot work in a newsroom where I am disparaged by a new CEO whose divisive views confirm the very problems at NPR I cite in my Free Press essay,\" tweeted Berliner, who says he repeatedly complained to management to no avail.\nAnd it was only three weeks ago that an on-air revolt by MSNBC's liberal hosts, openly trashing their NBC bosses, forced them to fire ousted RNC chief Ronna McDaniel just four days after the network had trumpeted her hiring.SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIESThe Times was the first major news organization to capitulate by firing Editorial Page Editor James Bennet for the sin of running an online column by GOP Sen. Tom Cotton, advocating that the military be used to control the 2020 urban riots. Bennet wrote late last year that \"the leadership of the New York Times is losing control of its principles.\"CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThat the Times is again being torn apart, this time over the Mideast war, just brings us full circle.

            "summary": "In a two-way ballot test in the Peach State, former President Trump maintains a slim majority, while President Biden sees a 2-point improvement since January, according to the latest Fox News Poll of Georgia registered voters released Thursday.\nTrump holds steady with 51% support in the rematch (same as in January), while 45% of voters back Biden (up from 43%). That 6-point difference is just inside the poll's margin of error.\nBiden's movement can be attributed to modest gains among Black voters (76% now vs. 71% in January) and voters under age 35 (49% vs. 43%), as well as a notable shift among the small subgroup of independents. In January, Trump had the advantage by 20 points (51% to 31% Biden), while the two presumptive candidates are tied today (42% each).\nTrump's coalition has held relatively steady, with some of his best groups being White evangelical Christians (83%), White men without a degree (75%), rural voters (67%), and voters ages 65 and over (58%).\n\"Trump stalled at 49% in 2020 and GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker was at 48-49% in 2022,\" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican Daron Shaw. \"If Georgia voters have soured on Democrats even a little bit, the state is a major pickup opportunity for Trump.\"\nIn a hypothetical five-way race, Trump has a 7-point lead over Biden (46% to 39%), with third-party candidates Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (7%), Cornel West (2%), and Jill Stein (1%) in single digits. This is about where the race stood in January.\n\"Georgia may be the weakest state from Biden's 2020 coalition,\" says Shaw. \"On the plus side, if he can rally African Americans and younger voters, he might be able to recreate his 2020 victory. On the minus side, he might have maxed out that vote in 2020 and it's unclear how compelling his message is to these voters in 2024. I'm in the minority on this point, but it seems North Carolina might be a more promising target this time around.\"\nOn specific issues, Georgia continues to favor Trump, as he is seen as better able to handle — mostly by double-digits — five out of seven issues.\nNotably, Trump has the advantage on the two issues that have been dominating the campaign: immigration (Trump preferred by 23 points) and the economy (+22). He is also favored on foreign policy (+15) and energy policy (+8).\nOn other issues, neither candidate has a significant advantage: Trump has the edge on abortion (+2), whereas Biden is narrowly ahead on health care (+2) and election integrity (+3).\nForty-four percent of voters feel they are falling behind financially vs. 41% who are holding steady and 15% who are getting ahead. Voters saying they are falling behind go for Trump by 54 points, while those getting ahead/holding steady go for Biden by 31 points.\nVoters view Trump more favorably than Biden and see the former president as more mentally fit for the job than the incumbent.\nBy a 2-point margin, Georgians view Trump favorably (50% favorable vs. 48% unfavorable), a reversal from July 2022 when he was viewed negatively by 11 points (43% vs. 54%). They also see Trump as having the mental soundness to serve effectively as president (54% has mental soundness vs. 44% does not).\nBiden's favorable rating is underwater by 15 points (42% favorable vs. 57% unfavorable), and more say he lacks the mental soundness to serve by 22 points (38% mentally sound vs. 60% not).\nBiden's job approval rating is also upside down: 42% approve vs. 58% disapprove, which is about where it was in January.\nA few more things…\n— Views on Kennedy are split, with 39% rating him favorably, 39% unfavorably, and 22% unable to rate him. Democrats are more likely to view him negatively (31% favorable, 46% unfavorable), while Republicans are the opposite (45% favorable, 36% unfavorable). Independents are somewhat split (38% favorable, 33% unfavorable).\n— By a 6-point margin, Georgia voters think the Biden administration is too supportive of the Palestinians (27%) rather than too supportive of the Israelis (21%) in the war in the Middle East. Still, 4 in 10 think Biden's support of each is about right (39%). Democrats are almost 7 times more likely than Republicans to think there's too much support for the Israelis, while Republicans are 4 times more likely to think there's too much support for the Palestinians.\n— In a hypothetical U.S. House race, Georgians prefer the Republican candidate by 8 points (50% to 42% for the Democrat).\nConducted April 11-16 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,128 Georgia registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (150) and cellphones (699) or completed the survey online after receiving a text message (279). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of ± 3 percentage points. When necessary, weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics are representative of the registered voter population.",

            "excerpt": "Times are changing rapidly in the new Portland. The tolerance of drugs is long gone and business is back. The region is working hard to welcome investment and serve as a tech hub.",
            "summary": "After three years of legalized hard drugs and rampant overdose deaths in Portland, Oregon, lawmakers this month rightly said enough is enough. There is a better option: strong progressive economic policies and ending untethered drug use promises to help repair the Portland image, attract new businesses and retain others downtown. This new more pragmatic progressivism we see shows a major shift in our state.\nGovernor Tina Kotek and the Democratic-majority legislature decisively steered away from ultra-progressive drug policies this year. The state's evolution reflects an increasing recognition among bipartisan policymakers of the need for practical solutions to address challenging social issues while becoming a more business-friendly state. And I have seen this work before.\nI hail from Detroit and contributed to the city's post-bankruptcy restructuring, which is currently drawing in investors, innovators and young adventurers. Coming to Portland, I was struck by the similarities between my new city today with that of my youth in Detroit's Cass Corridor.\nLike Detroit's blend of academic and economic opportunities juxtaposed with the stark realities of urban decay and crime, Portland's downtown today grapples with a similar set of opportunities and challenges.\nThis was exacerbated by voter-approved Measure 110 which ushered in the most lenient drug laws in the nation in attempt to encourage drug treatment and cut down addictions. Despite the well-meaning intentions of Portland voters, the unintended outcomes have been severe.\nLike Detroit, beneath visible urban challenges, Portland pulsates with vitality. Greater Portland boasts an extraordinary industrial base, fosters the education of trailblazers, and remains a strategic West Coast location for any sector.\nThe repeal of Measure 110, effective September 1, signals a commitment to growth, creating a safer and more conducive business climate. Unfortunately, Measure 110's failures reminded Portlanders of the importance of basic order to maintain a city's quality of life.\nAnd when polls this year showed 56% of voters favored repealing the measure, bipartisan legislators went for it, allowing local governments and law enforcement agencies the option to arrest or pursue substance abuse treatment for hard drug users. Kotek's leadership here mirrors Portland's metamorphosis, as she emerges as a centrist West Coast leader.\nHer work to allocate $240 million in tax incentives to 15 semiconductor companies also underscores Portland's dedication to embracing change and propelling progress in ways it simply had not done before to attract business. In June 2023, the state had approximately $11 million in cash incentives available for companies expanding their footprint in the state.\nOregon's political shift on tax incentives has solidified greater Portland's position as the nation's leading location in the semiconductor sector, shaping America's new economy in this critical industry that employs 40,000 people in the region.\nMoreover, this strategic move aligns seamlessly with the overarching federal effort for manufacturing investment, most notably from the CHIPS Act. Last December, the governor led a Portland central city task force of public and private sector leaders. We created solutions to the city's more pressing challenges and a long-term strategic vision for economic prosperity for the region.\nThis month, Multnomah County and Portland leaders unveiled an ambitious goal to cut the region's unsheltered homeless population in half by 2026, by adding hundreds of new shelter beds, building more affordable housing, and expand access to mental health and substance abuse treatment.\nRecently, Portland city council introduced an innovative Downtown Business Incentives Credit Program, expanded enterprise zones, and is exploring new Tax Increment Financing districts, signifying a turning point in the economic posture of the city nestled between the majestic Cascade Mountains and the tranquil vineyards of the Willamette Valley.\nCombined, these new incentives and the reversal of legalized open-air hard drug use show a region committed to turning the page on three years of economic uncertainty. With these changes, business leaders can now confidently consider expanding in the Portland area, knowing that favorable policies are in place to support their success.\nDriving down drug use and crime creates economic wins. In Detroit, policies like these ended much of the dilapidation I witnessed in my youth. That city now experiences high-priced condos, retail, and the newly erected Little Caesars Arena (home to two of the city's pro sports teams, the Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Pistons).\nOregon's political shift on tax incentives has solidified greater Portland's position as the nation's leading location in the semiconductor sector, shaping America's new economy in this critical industry that employs 40,000 people in the region.\nSimilarly, Portland's allure transcends its urban confines. Today, as Portland confronts its challenges head-on, it stands on the cusp of emerging stronger, more vibrant, and more resilient than ever before.\nAs someone who talks to corporations seeking fresh industrial land, high-value talent, and a high quality of life, the repeal of Measure 110 will help further reposition Portland once again as the Pacific Northwest's prime choice for business. My new hometown of Portland is charting a course toward once again being the West Coast's best value for business.",

            "summary": "Wisconsin voters split their preference between President Biden and former President Trump in a hypothetical 2-way presidential race — and between backing the Democratic and the Republican congressional candidates in their House district, according to a new Fox News survey of Wisconsin registered voters.\nIn the head-to-head presidential matchup, Biden and Trump tie with 48% support each.\nBiden gets significant backing from urban voters (+29 points), Whites with a college degree (+26), suburban voters (+10), and union households (+8).\nFor Trump, some of his highest support is from White evangelical Christians (+46 points), White men without a college degree (+29), and rural voters (+15).\nVoters under age 45 back Biden by a single point, while those ages 65 and over go for Biden by 10 points.\nThere's a 17-point gender gap, as men go for Trump by 8 points and women for Biden by 9.\nBiden receives a touch more support among Democrats (95%) than Trump gets among Republicans (93%), but Trump is the choice of the small subgroup of independents (by 8 points).\nWhen potential third-party candidates are included, Biden tops Trump by 2 points (43-41%), with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. getting 9%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 2% each. In January, it was Trump who was up by 3 points over Biden, with Kennedy at 7%.\nKennedy receives a bit more of his backing from those who favor Trump (9%) in the 2-way ballot than from Biden (5%).\nBiden won Wisconsin in 2020 by 20,682 votes, less than one percentage point. Trump's 2016 victory was also by less than a point (22,748 votes).\nMore voters trust Trump to do a better job handling immigration (by 13 points) and the economy (+9). Biden is preferred over Trump on abortion (+9), health care (+7), and election integrity (+7). They are rated more evenly on foreign policy (Trump +2) and energy policy (even).\nOn the Middle East, equal numbers think the Biden administration is too supportive of the Israelis (25%) and the Palestinians (24%). Yet the largest share says Biden's support of each is about right (38%) — and they favor him over Trump by 38 points.\nOverall, Wisconsinites feel somewhat positive about their personal finances, as 6 in 10 say their situation is either holding steady (45%) or improving (14%). Both of those groups largely favor Biden, while the 4 in 10 who are falling behind financially go for Trump by a wide margin.\nIn the Congressional ballot test, 46% go for the Democratic candidate in their district and 45% for the Republican. Neither Biden nor Trump is a drain on his party, as 94% of those backing the Congressional Democrat favor Biden and 93% of those supporting the Republican go for Trump.\n\"Data from the 2022 election suggests MAGA candidates ran three to four points worse than non-MAGA Republicans,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts Fox News polls with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"But we're not seeing that ‘Trump tax' so far in the 2024 numbers. Neither are we seeing Biden underperforming other Democrats. It looks like partisans are behaving like partisans.\"\nBy a 5-point margin, more voters think Trump (48%) has the mental soundness to serve effectively as president than Biden (43%). Most Republicans (89%) say Trump has it and most Democrats say Biden does (85%), but independents are 17 points more likely to say Trump is mentally fit.\nThe survey finds 44% approve of Biden's job performance and 55% disapprove — unchanged since January (44-56%). His 48% support in the 2-way race is higher than his approval because 10% of those disapproving of the job he's doing still pick him over Trump.\nNearly two-thirds think Biden was legitimately elected in 2020, and they back him over Trump by 53 points and are twice as likely to approve of the job he's doing (67% approve, 32% disapprove). Among the one-third who say Biden was not legitimately elected, 98% favor Trump in the 2-way race and 98% disapprove of Biden's job performance.\nWisconsin voters are unified when it comes to having a negative opinion of both Biden and Trump. Views of each are net negative by a 10-point margin, as they both receive the same rating: 44% favorable vs 54% unfavorable.\nKennedy's ratings are negative by 13 points, 35% favorable vs. 48% unfavorable. He's viewed much more positively by Republicans (49%) and independents (44%) than Democrats (19%).\nAmong the small segment of so-called double haters (those viewing both Biden and Trump unfavorably), the vote preference splits: Biden 38% vs. Trump 39% % in the two-way ballot test. When third-party candidates are included, they back Kennedy (34%), followed by Biden (21%), Trump (13%), West (10%), and Stein (9%).\nConducted April 11-16, 2024 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,198 Wisconsin registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (174) and cellphones (669) or completed the survey online after receiving a text message (355). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics are representative of the registered voter population.",

            "excerpt": "A handful of vulnerable House Democrats are under fire after their ties to a left-wing Gen Z advocacy group advocating things like abolishing cash bail came to light.",
            "summary": "A handful of vulnerable House Democrats, including those in pivotal battleground states, celebrated partnering with a left-wing Gen Z advocacy group ahead of 2024 that supports policies such as decriminalizing prostitution and abolishing cash bail.\n\"I am thrilled to be a Voters of Tomorrow Youth Vote Champion. As elected officials, my colleagues and I have a unique opportunity to give young Americans a voice in their future,\" Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Matt Cartwright said of the endorsement, according to an X post from the Voters of Tomorrow.\nA left-wing advocacy group that promotes voting among Gen Z voters, Voters of Tomorrow has a particular focus on \"justice\" issues such as decriminalizing prostitution, dismantling \"racist\" institutions — including those that carry out \"racial profiling in education and policing\" and ending \"racist voting laws\" — as well as calling for stricter gun control, and ending \"the abusive practices of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection.\"\nVoters of Tomorrow announced last year that 36 members of Congress joined a \"Youth Vote Champion\" pledge in an effort to engage young Gen Z voters, a generation typically considered to include anyone born between 1997 and 2013.\n\"We have to engage young voters not only in the two weeks before the election, but in the two years before the election,\" Jack Lobel, 18, the national press secretary of Voters of Tomorrow, told Axios at the time.\nAs the election season heats up this year, Fox News Digital found that a handful of the House members who took the Voters of Tomorrow pledge are located in swing-districts, including Cartwright, Rep. Greg Landsman of Ohio, Rep. Mary Peltola of Alaska, and Rep. Susan Wild of Pennsylvania.\nThe four members of Congress were identified last year by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as vulnerable in the 2024 elections, assigning them as members of the Frontline Program for vulnerable incumbents. Each member celebrated joining forces with the Voters of Tomorrow in comments shared by the advocacy group on social media.\n\"I wholeheartedly agree with Voters of Tomorrow's view that empowering Gen Z in our political process is a requirement for building a better future,\" Landsman said in a message of his support of Voters of Tomorrow.\n\"I ran for Congress to be an advocate for all Alaskans — from every region, background, and generation. Encouraging young people to get involved in our political process benefits everyone — and is a responsibility I take very seriously,\" Peltola said in another message posted by Voters of Tomorrow last year.\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) told Fox News Digital that the four Democrats aligning with Voters of Tomorrow ahead of 2024 shows they are not \"moderate\" Democrats, but instead \"complete frauds that should never be re-elected.\"\n\"Self-proclaimed moderate House Democrats are once again showing the American people where their true priorities lie: abolishing cash bail, defunding the police, ending ICE & CBP, and decriminalizing sex work and drugs. It's dangerous, and exposes how Cartwright, Landsman, Peltola, or Wild are complete frauds that should never be reelected,\" the NRCC's rapid response director Macy Gardner told Fox News Digital.\nFox News Digital reached out to the campaigns for comment, but did not receive replies.\nImmigration and the economy are two of the biggest issues weighing on voters this election cycle, while crime still ranks high for voters following 2020's historically bloody year, which was followed by other ongoing crime trends, such smash-and-grab robberies and carjackings.\nProstitution has spiraled in certain areas of the country in recent months, which has been compounded by the immigration crisis and local state laws. Residents in California have particularly voiced their outrage over rampant and brazen prostitution on city streets, which many pin blame on a law that repealed a previous law that banned loitering with the intent of engaging in prostitution. New York City has also seen \"third world\" conditions, including prostitutes and pimps walking the streets of Queens in broad daylight.\nVoters of Tomorrow argues prostitution should be decriminalized, saying that \"Sex work is work.\"\n\"Criminalizing consensual sex, including the exchange of these services, is taking away from the human right to autonomy and privacy. The government should not be telling consenting adults who they can have sexual relationships with and on what terms,\" the group says on its website.\nThe group also advocates for the end of cash bail, which would abolish the requirement that suspects charged with crimes post bail in order to leave jail while they await court proceedings.\n\"If the ‘justice' system has policies or laws in place that have a monetary value tied to them, then those policies only apply to low-income people. No one should have to remain in prison for the duration of their case just because they do not have the financial means to pay their bail. Cash bail only applies to low-income people and we need equal justice,\" the group states.\nVoters of Tomorrow was founded in 2019 by a ​​17-year-old immigrant from Mexico, Santiago Mayer, after he \"noticed a lack of political engagement at his high school,\" according to the group's website. The group has since gone on to advocate that Gen Z vote, including in both the 2020 election and the 2022 midterms.\nThe Republican Party had a lackluster 2022 in the midterms, which some have attributed to lack of outreach to America's youngest voting generation.\n\"Another reason that the polling was so inaccurate and that so many critical races swung to Democrats is the growing importance of Gen Z voters, which appears to have been completely ignored by the GOP,\" Fox News contributor Liz Peek wrote in an op-ed in 2022, arguing Gen Z \"stopped the Republicans' expected red wave.\"\n\"Not only did Gen Z show up in force, they overwhelmingly picked Democrats, by a 28-point margin. That preference was close to their vote in 2020, which went 62% Democrat and only 32% GOP.\"",

            "excerpt": "House Republicans derided Columbia University President Dr. Nemat Shafik's testimony when first asked by Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., that she had not seen any \"anti-Jewish\" protests.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON, D.C. – House Republicans excoriated progressive Squad member Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., for suggesting during the House Education and the Workforce Committee's hearing tackling antisemitism at Columbia University that none of the demonstrations deriding Jews on campus have been \"anti-Jewish.\" Fox News Digital caught up with two Republicans on the committee at the Capitol after the hearing, asking their thoughts about Columbia University President Dr. Nemat \"Minouche\" Shafik initially testifying that she had not seen any campus protests that were explicitly \"anti-Jewish.\"\nOmar argued that campus demonstrations were merely \"pro-war\" or \"anti-war,\" but House Republican Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., further pressed Shafik on whether she considered anti-Israel agitators' chants of \"F-- the Jews\" and \"Death to the Jews\" in fact anti-Jewish. Shafik conceded that those slogans heard on campus were \"completely anti-Jewish,\" amending her earlier testimony.\n\"I thought her answer to that was wrong to begin with, and she had a chance to correct it. I was flabbergasted, actually, when she said no,\" committee Chair Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., told Fox News Digital at the Capitol after the hearing. \"She said there had been no anti-Jewish, incidents. Well, what is this whole hearing about? The whole hearing is about that.\"\n\"What I found interesting is the leadership's response to that. And you saw Representative Stefanik really follow up with that,\" Rep. Brandon Williams, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital of the exchange. \"They are in deep denial that they cover with these clever phrases … just because everything inside the protest was antisemitic, well, it wasn't an antisemitic protest because it wasn't labeled as such. Now that's absurd. You know, I think a third grader would be able to discern, you know, the deception. But, but evidently that's hard for, you know, the professors and the leadership at Columbia.\"\nAs the hearing was underway, protesters could be heard yelling outside demanding entry to the Capitol proceeding. Back at Columbia University's campus in New York City, hundreds of anti-Israel agitators staged an \"occupation\" protest calling for the Ivy League school to \"divest\" from Israel. Video captured demonstrators lighting flares after nightfall, and the New York City Police Department arrested at least four people Thursday morning when crowds defied the school's order to cease the \"encampment,\" which included tents set up on a campus lawn.\n\"I think it's very important that the Jewish students know that this committee has their back, that we will continue to fight with them against antisemitism,\" Foxx told Fox News Digital. \"And that's my commitment to them. I think they understand that commitment. They've seen the other hearings that we've had. They've heard the things that we've said. And I think it's important that they know they're not alone on that campus, that we are going to be with them, whether we're there physically with them, we're there, mentally, psychologically and morally with them.\"\nFoxx and other House Republicans hosted a group of Jewish students at the Capitol, offering them the opportunity to speak at a press conference before hearing kicked off Wednesday morning.\nOne of those students, Eden Yadegar, the daughter of Iranian immigrants, described recent instances of antisemitism on campus, including how a tenured Columbia professor allegedly told students that Jews who regularly attend temple are \"indoctrinated,\" a Jewish student having a Star of David necklace ripped from her neck, and on several occasions Jewish students being accosted by other students at the law school or in the kosher section of the dining hall yelling, \"F--- the Jews.\"\nShe said Jewish students have grown fearful of reporting instances of discrimination and harassment because \"of how little faith they have that the university will take the necessary steps to protect them,\" arguing the \"university's action has left Jewish students abandoned\" after months of silence from the school leadership.\nAnother student who spoke at the press conference, Yola Ashkenazi, described how Columbia has recognized clubs that say things like, \"Zionists not invited,\" and, \"the Holocaust wasn't that special.\" She cited how swastikas have been drawn in campus buildings and said, \"Columbia permits hate rallies on our campus that call for violence and eradication of the Jewish state\" and call for \"intifada revolution.\"\nAshkenazi described how on Feb. 2, when one of her friends was physically held outside the wall of the campus fitness center by demonstrators, Columbia public safety officers told him afterward to \"not wear anything identifying him as Jewish when tensions are high.\"\nSpeaking with Fox News Digital ahead of the hearing, Yadegar said she was not surprised by the anti-Israel demonstrations happening again back on campus.\n\"I think that we've gotten to a point where these student demonstrators feel that anything is fair game because they have not been disciplined adequately, and so I'm hoping that this hearing will shift us away from that direction,\" Yadegar said outside the committee room.\n\"We've been isolated on campus in certain organizations, in the classroom. It's been incredibly difficult, but the Jewish people are incredibly resilient, and as Americans, as Jews, it's our duty to continue to participate in these spaces that we've worked so hard to get to,\" she said. \"I do have a little bit of faith left in their leadership, and I do hope that they will follow through. They claim that antisemitism is abhorrent and that it has no space in our university, and our campus. The action over the past five months doesn't coincide with that rhetoric, however the actions taken over the past couple of weeks are edging in that direction.\"",

            "excerpt": "Olympic gold medalist Scott Hamilton spoke to Fox News Digital about his experience as a cancer survivor and how his excellence in figure skating has given him a platform to do more.",
            "summary": "Former American figure skater Scott Hamilton dedicated his early life to his sport.\nHe was rewarded with an incredible winning streak in the early 1980s that saw him win four consecutive U.S. titles and four consecutive world championships. He never lost between 1981 and 1984, and his hard work culminated in a gold medal performance at the 1984 Winter Olympics.\nHowerver, Hamilton, now 65, has dedicated his post-Olympic life towards a new goal – funding cancer research with the hope of giving people the chance at \"a second life,\" an opportunity he was given many times over.\nHamilton opened up about his personal battles with cancer and how his mother's death at just 18 shaped his mindset early on in an interview with Fox News Digital.\n\"I was given a chance to skate, and I had to figure out how to do it at a high level,\" Hamilton said. \"My parents ran out of money and somebody stepped in to help me. And so that model of generosity was set in stone. And then I lost my mother to cancer, and I had to wake up and put my big boy pants on, and honor her in everything I did. And that allowed for a winning streak that I never, ever could have imagined.\"\nHamilton, who was adopted, said that his mother's death from metastatic melanoma drastically altered his thinking and ultimately opened the door to what would become his life's work.\n\"I decided that there was nothing I could do to bring her back, but I became a fundraiser that morning, and then 20 years later – and we did a lot of fundraising in those 20 years – but 20 years later, having won an Olympic gold medal and having been on ‘Stars on Ice' and building that into a pretty major tour, I was diagnosed with cancer almost two months shy of the 20th anniversary of losing my mom.\n\"And it was there that I went from fundraiser to activist because I realized that there needs to be a better way of not only treating cancer, but also preparing a patient for the journey. I was not prepared. I was blindsided, like most people are. And so I needed to figure out a way to not only give people the information they needed, but the support they needed.\"\nPlagued with health issues at a young age, Hamilton would be met with his biggest challenge yet when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1997. Seven years later, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. He was treated, but it returned in 2010, and he later dealt with complications from the surgery.\nIn 2016, he was again diagnosed with a brain tumor, but his approach had changed. He was not going to seek treatment in the traditional sense.\n\"There's just something in me that just says 'get strong,'\" Hamilton recalled thinking when learning of the news from his doctors. \"And I was so confused because I didn't know where it was coming from. And it was just overwhelming in my spirit 'Just get strong.'\"\nHamilton, who is a believer in both western and holistic medicine, has poured himself into living a healthier life in all respects, including his faith. With that approach, the tumor shrank. The former Olympian told Fox News Digital that he cautions cancer patients to seek the best advice and educate themselves – something that the Scott Hamilton CARES foundation works at diligently.\n\"If I become symptomatic, of course, I'm going to be responsible and not stupid or prideful, and I'm going to do what I can to get rid of it. But in the meantime, I'm living my life, and I'm living it joyfully, productively, faithfully.\"\nHamilton founded his foundation in 2014. He continues to work toward funding cancer research that prioritizes patient care.\n\"Now it's all about funding immunotherapy and targeted therapy research to treat the cancer and spare the patient harm. ... When we put our stake in the ground for immunotherapy, that was three years before the first immunotherapy drug came out. So we know we were right. And, now it just comes down to really finding the right research to fund and making sure that anybody that's diagnosed with cancer has a chance at a second life, like I had a second life.\"\nHamilton's charitable efforts and work in cancer research recently have not gone unnoticed. Last month, at the Gold Meets Golden event, he was awarded the Gold Legacy Award.\n\"It's really a cool thing to be able to celebrate the excellence that comes from Olympic sport and to see what athletes do with their lives post podium,\" he said Thursday. \"For me, someone gave me the line of 'turning a podium into a platform' and it just allowed me to be able to be more impactful. That Olympic moment allowed me in to more doors [that] were open to me to be able to build and grow, sort of impact in the cancer community. And, I guess there's some, some level of credibility that comes with winning a gold medal, where you can leverage that into the next.\"\nIn February, Hamilton celebrated the 40th anniversary of his gold medal performance. Despite the ups and downs, Hamilton maintains a positive outlook on his life, his achievements, and what the future holds.\n\"It feels like for every single moment, good or bad, to be considered an opportunity – that's kind of where I'm really most grateful. Yeah, cancer wasn't fun. It wasn't easy. But it was an opportunity for me to step into the cancer community, not just as a fundraiser, but as a survivor now who understands what it feels like to go through cancer, understands what chemotherapy is, understands what post-surgical issues are.\"\nFollow Fox News Digital's sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.",

            "excerpt": "Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene is all about drama queen energy and antics. But here is so much at stake in 2024. Defeating Biden is the real goal, not burning down the House.",
            "summary": "It's high time someone in the Republican Party told Marjorie Taylor Greene to turn all that bombastic self-serving showmanship and drama queen energy on Democrats, and stop trying to defeat her own party.\nThe Georgia Republican, who famously displayed sexually explicit photos of Hunter Biden during a committee hearing and called fellow representative Lauren Boebert a bitch on the House floor, is known for wild antics and equally hairbrained conspiracy theories.\nCurrently, she is threatening to oust Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson. The Louisiana Representative, with a five-vote majority in the House, is attempting to keep his caucus intact as he navigates treacherous issues including funding Ukraine, which has become unpopular with some conservatives, and reauthorizing the controversial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. He also struggled to pass a funding bill, which required relying on Democrats to get another big spending package over the threshold.\nTo be sure, not all Republicans approve of spending billions more to arm Ukraine, especially since our own border remains wide open; many in the GOP wanted Johnson to demand border enforcement in exchange for support of Kyiv. Ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries in the world (which is perhaps why Hunter Biden was so richly employed there) and it not clear that America's billions sent to fight Vladimir Putin have all been spent towards that end. There is almost certainly inadequate oversight, as I wrote early in the war.\nNonetheless, countering Russia's power-mad dictator is the right thing to do. Putin's ambitions will not stop at Ukraine. The next target might well be a NATO ally, which would put U.S. boots on the ground.\nThough the war has taken a terrible toll on the valiant people of Ukraine, it has revealed Russia to be vulnerable. If President Biden had allowed an all-out aggressive war against Moscow, we would not be at a seeming stalemate. Because he dithered, Ukraine is now losing ground and urgently needs weapons and ammunition.

            "excerpt": "Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene is all about drama queen energy and antics. But here is so much at stake in 2024. Defeating Biden is the real goal, not burning down the House.",
            "summary": "It's high time someone in the Republican Party told Marjorie Taylor Greene to turn all that bombastic self-serving showmanship and drama queen energy on Democrats, and stop trying to defeat her own party.\nThe Georgia Republican, who famously displayed sexually explicit photos of Hunter Biden during a committee hearing and called fellow representative Lauren Boebert a bitch on the House floor, is known for wild antics and equally harebrained conspiracy theories.\nCurrently, she is threatening to oust Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson. The Louisiana Representative, with a five-vote majority in the House, is attempting to keep his caucus intact as he navigates treacherous issues including funding Ukraine, which has become unpopular with some conservatives, and reauthorizing the controversial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. He also struggled to pass a funding bill, which required relying on Democrats to get another big spending package over the threshold.\nTo be sure, not all Republicans approve of spending billions more to arm Ukraine, especially since our own border remains wide open; many in the GOP wanted Johnson to demand border enforcement in exchange for support of Kyiv. Ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries in the world (which is perhaps why Hunter Biden was so richly employed there) and it not clear that America's billions sent to fight Vladimir Putin have all been spent towards that end. There is almost certainly inadequate oversight, as I wrote early in the war.\nNonetheless, countering Russia's power-mad dictator is the right thing to do. Putin's ambitions will not stop at Ukraine. The next target might well be a NATO ally, which would put U.S. boots on the ground.\nThough the war has taken a terrible toll on the valiant people of Ukraine, it has revealed Russia to be vulnerable. If President Biden had allowed an all-out aggressive war against Moscow, we would not be at a seeming stalemate. Because he dithered, Ukraine is now losing ground and urgently needs weapons and ammunition. This can be remedied; we need to provide the funding and push the White House to outline the path to victory.\nAs to the FISA, Republicans are wary of allowing warrantless surveillance and rightly so.

            "summary": "Democrat New York Gov. Kathy Hochul refused to send in the National Guard on Monday to quell anti-Israel protests at Columbia University – despite mounting pressure from lawmakers and experts saying she has the legal justification, if not the obligation, to do so.\nThe NYPD also has yet to take action on campus as tensions continued to rise on the eve of the Jewish Passover holiday, despite in-person classes being canceled Monday due to concerns about Jewish students' safety.\n\"The fact that they had to go to remote learning today, because they can't keep their students safe is disgraceful,\" Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"There should certainly be NYPD on campus, the governor should be offering National Guard and shutting down these horrific antisemitism events.\"\nMalliotakis also added her voice to the rising chorus calling for the resignation of Columbia University President Dr. Nemat \"Minouche\" Shafik. Malliotakis said that Shafik had permitted antisemitism to \"fester on campus for months.\" Shafik, who was called to testify before Congress to address the school's inaction on antisemitism after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, said on Monday she was hoping the school \"will try to bring this crisis to a resolution\" in the coming days.\nShafik's didn't respond to Fox News Digital when asked if the NYPD or National Guard would be requested to de-escalate the protest and disperse the \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment.\"\nIf requested by the governor – or the Biden administration – the use of the National Guard would be a justified measure to restore \"public order,\" said Ilya Shapiro, the director of constitutional studies at the Manhattan Institute.\n\"And the justification would be Title VI, which ensures equal educational opportunity,\" Shapiro told Fox News Digital. \"And the argument is that Jewish students are being denied that, and that Columbia is failing of its obligation to enforce it.\"\nTitle VI, part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \"provides that no person\" in the U.S. \"shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.\"\n\"Eisenhower sent the 101st to Little Rock. It's time for Biden to call out the National Guard at our universities to protect Jewish Americans.\" - Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas\nShapiro, a legal scholar who in 2022 stepped down from his brief tenure as executive director at Georgetown University's Center for the Constitution due to a free speech dispute, noted that not all speech is protected under the First Amendment, including speech that incites violence or death threats, which places many of the anti-Israel agitators at odds with the law.\n\"Similarly, beating somebody up, harassing them, false imprisonment, vandalism – you don't get defenses for that,\" he said.\nOther lawmakers took to X on Monday urging the National Guard to disperse protesters lobbing antisemitic chants and supporting Islamist terrorist group Hamas as \"freedom fighters.\"\n\"Eisenhower sent the 101st to Little Rock,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said on X Monday. \"It's time for Biden to call out the National Guard at our universities to protect Jewish Americans.\"\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who in 2020 wrote a New York Times op-ed advocating for the use of the military to quell riots that occurred during that summer's nationwide social justice protests, said on X that if Mayor Eric Adams \"won't send the NYPD and Kathy Hochul won't send the National Guard, Joe Biden has a duty to take charge and break up these mobs.\"\nThe throngs occupying Columbia University grounds hurled violent threats against Jewish students beginning last week. Those at Columbia set up encampments, waved Palestine flags, and refused to leave.\n\"We are Hamas,\" some agitators chanted, while others called for the expulsion of Zionists.\n\"The First Amendment protects the right to protest, but students also have a right to learn in an environment free from harassment or violence,\" Hochul said in a statement Monday. \"At Columbia or on any campus, threatening Jewish students with violence or glorifying the terror of October 7 is antisemitism.\"\nStill, she refused to call on authorities to break up the encampment. Hochul's office did not respond when asked by Fox News Digital if the National Guard would be requested.\nMeanwhile, Shafik said that she was \"deeply saddened\" by certain actions of agitators, who have formed an \"encampment\" on the campus and have riled students and faculty with anti-Jewish slogans and chants.\n\"I know that there is much debate about whether or not we should use the police on campus, and I am happy to engage in those discussions. But I do know that better adherence to our rules and effective enforcement mechanisms would obviate the need for relying on anyone else to keep our community safe,\" she said. \"We should be able to do this ourselves.\"\nThe statement comes after the Orthodox rabbi at Columbia University and Barnard College sent a message encouraging Jewish students to leave campus and go home after protesters were caught on camera espousing full-on support for terrorism and supporting violence toward Jewish students.\nRabbi Elie Buechler sent a message to hundreds of students recommending they leave \"as soon as possible\" until the situation improves, noting that \"what we are witnessing in and around campus is terrible and tragic.\"\nAdams, a Democrat, said in a statement he condemns \"this hate speech in the strongest of terms.\"\n\"Supporting a terrorist organization that aims to kill Jews is sickening and despicable. As I have repeatedly said, hate has no place in our city, and I have instructed the NYPD to investigate any violation of law that is reported. Rest assured, the NYPD will not hesitate to arrest anyone who is found to be breaking the law,\" Adams said. \"We will not be a city of lawlessness, and those professional agitators seeking to seize the ongoing conflict in the Middle East to sow chaos and division in our city will not succeed.\"\nBy Monday afternoon, NYPD remained on standby surrounding the campus. Police officials told reporters that Columbia University does not want NYPD on campus, but said they will enter the property if violence occurs.\n\"As a general matter, Columbia University, and this goes back many years, does not want NYPD on campus. That is their decision,\" Michael Gerber, the NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Legal Matters, told reporters.",

            "excerpt": "An upstart climate activist group known as Gas Leaks is increasing in prominence and financial backing, despite much of its information being shielded from the public.",
            "summary": "A secretive climate activist group with significant financial backing is quietly taking on a more prominent role advocating against natural, gas-powered appliances, like stoves.\nThe Gas Leaks Action Campaign — which appears to have been first established in late 2021 or early 2022 — recently launched a $1 million ad campaign warning of the dangers posed by natural gas, the largest-ever effort of its kind. The group states on its website that natural gas harms the environment, pollutes the air inside homes and makes stoves \"constantly at risk of explosion.\"\nThe group has also spearheaded a campaign against the American Gas Association (AGA), the nation's leading industry group representing natural gas providers. At a Washington, D.C. event earlier this month, Gas Leaks hosted Sens. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., along with several environmental groups like the Sierra Club to blast the AGA's lobbying activities.\n\"Instead of turning off the tap on fossil fuels, our country has been flooding the market with gas and, unless we do something, we are all going to drown,\" said Markey, who is an original sponsor of the Green New Deal.\nAGA President and CEO Karen Harbert said in a statement that natural gas is \"fundamental to protecting America's energy security, achieving our environmental goals, and promoting economic prosperity.\"\n\"Despite advocacy groups willfully spreading misinformation and promoting ill-informed energy policy that would drive up prices and sacrifice environmental progress, this industry will continue to implement inclusive solutions to deliver life-essential energy and reduce emissions for our customers and communities,\" she added.\nMeanwhile, according to a Fox News Digital review of job search sites, Gas Leaks has posted several positions, including executive director, senior communications director, digital manager and digital designer, over the last two years with salaries ranging from $65,000 to $160,000. Altogether, the positions indicate the group's yearly salary and wage costs potentially exceed $465,000.\nBut despite Gas Leaks' growth and increasing influence with Democratic lawmakers and similarly climate-focused organizations, the group shares very little about itself online – its founders, funding and history are all shielded from public view. A Reuters report last month broadly stated that Gas Leaks was \"formed by climate advocacy veterans.\"\nA LinkedIn search revealed that those \"advocacy veterans\" include Caleb Heeringa, a former Sierra Club communications official who serves as Gas Leaks' campaign director; and Jamie Henn, the founder of Fossil Free Media, co-founder of 350.org and a board member of Gas Leaks.\nAccording to Gas Leaks' \"about page,\" which appears to have been removed from the group's site but remains archived, Gas Leaks is supported by the clean energy advocacy organization Climate Nexus, which is itself fiscally supported by Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, a nonprofit that regularly funnels money from donors to progressive initiatives.\nThe arrangement means Gas Leaks isn't required to file its own 990 tax ID form with the Internal Revenue Service and can, therefore, operate without publicly sharing information about its internal operations or finances.\n\"Senator Whitehouse conveniently abandons his soapbox railing against dark money when it's time for him to cozy up to a dark money group that is pushing his preferred radical climate agenda,\" said Caitlin Sutherland, Executive Director of Americans for Public Trust, a nonprofit government watchdog group. Sutherland noted the contrast between both Whitehouse's relationship with Gas Leaks and his high-profile push against dark money in politics.\n\"This latest pop-up green group is pedaling misinformation in a shadowy attempt to ban gas stoves.\"\nA Fox News Digital analysis of grants identified a single Gas Leaks donor: the California-based Heising-Simons Foundation, which states on its website that it seeks to advance \"sustainable solutions in climate and clean energy, enable groundbreaking research in science, enhance the education of our youngest learners and support human rights for all people.\"\nIn 2022 and 2023, the Heising-Simons Foundation wired two $150,000 grants to Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, earmarking both for the Gas Leaks Action Campaign.\nThe Heising-Simons Foundation has reportedly given more than $3.3 million in recent years to the Rocky Mountain Institute, a climate think tank that was involved in the aggressive push last year targeting gas stoves via regulation. The Heising-Simons Foundation was also co-founded in 2007 by Mark Heising, who remains its vice chair and is involved financially in a number of green energy companies.\n\"The only thing green about today's environmental movement is the billions in cash that flow freely between lefty billionaires, their operatives in the green movement, and the politicians who do their bidding,\" said Tom Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit.\n\"Their campaign to ban natural gas stoves is yet another example of the nexus between self-dealing wealthy elites like Mark Heising, green pressure groups like the Rocky Mountain Institute, and the Democratic Party machine.\"\nWhile environmentalists have for years sought to crack down on natural gas and gas appliances over their climate impacts, the push came to a head early last year when Richard Trumka Jr., a member of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, said banning gas stoves was \"on the table.\" The Department of Energy then issued regulations targeting gas stoves shortly thereafter.\nIn a social media post at the time, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm pointed to a Rocky Mountain Institute-funded study and said the government \"must FIX this\" by increasing access to electric stovetops. The study, which was also cited by environmentalists and other officials, tied 12% of childhood asthma cases to gas stoves.\nGas Leaks, Climate Nexus, Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors and the Heising-Simons Foundation didn't respond to requests for comment for purposes of this story. Markey and Whitehouse also didn't respond to requests for comment.",

            "summary": "Federal supervision policies are supposed to help people successfully return to their communities from prison. Unfortunately, in many cases, they erect barriers to successful reintegration. The bipartisan Safer Supervision Act would break down those barriers, reduce recidivism and improve public safety.\nI've experienced the barriers created by onerous federal supervision policies firsthand. In 2019, President Donald Trump personally invited me to attend the State of the Union address at the capitol. But the decision to attend this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity was not mine alone to make. That decision also rested with my probation officer.\nBack in the 1990s, I was a single mother about to lose my house. In a desperate moment, I made a life-altering bad decision to become a low-level player in a drug operation. When law enforcement authorities broke up the drug operation, I was prosecuted and sentenced to life in prison – even though it was my first offense and I had never personally touched, seen or sold a single drug.\nWhile in prison, I never gave up hope. I bettered myself by working in the prison hospice, volunteering in the prison church, becoming an ordained minister, and writing and directing original plays. I was an exemplary prisoner and a role model.\nSo, when Kim Kardashian heard about my story, she became my champion and brought my case to the attention of Trump. On June 6, 2018, the president commuted my prison sentence, and I was finally free. Or so I thought.\nThough I was out of prison, I didn't yet have my freedom legs. That's because Trump's commutation did not affect the conditions of my release. I would still be under federal supervision for five years, even though I had already served more than two decades in federal prison as a model prisoner and was clearly not a threat to public safety.\nWhile under supervision, I had to check in with my local probation officer, filling out paperwork to get permission to do simple things like briefly traveling out of my home state, getting a new job, or changing residences. These rules nearly prevented me from attending the State of the Union address and other White House events when the president himself invited me.\nThankfully, my supervision term was dissolved when I received my official pardon from Trump in 2020. But not everyone can rely on a presidential pardon.\nFederal supervised release was originally meant to be applied only in cases where it was necessary for public safety. Unfortunately, it is now imposed in nearly every case. About 110,000 individuals are under federal supervised release — a 200% increase from three decades ago. As a result, case officers have become overburdened, often managing up to 100 cases at once. With probation officers overstretched, they cannot devote adequate time or resources to managing those who pose higher public safety risks, and this \"mismatch\" can lead to recidivism.\nUnnecessary supervision also comes with roadblocks that make it harder for low-risk people who have paid their debts to society to reintegrate into their communities. In 2020, more people saw their supervised release revoked due to technical violations — such as failing to make a meeting with a probation officer or traveling without permission — than for committing new crimes.\nIndeed, a quarter of annual prison admissions are due to technical supervision violations.\nThese disruptions make it difficult for people on supervision to settle into their new lives, place unwarranted financial and emotional stress on their families, and can even result in job loss, which is particularly concerning since steady employment is one of the best deterrents to recidivism.\nThese misguided policies also cost taxpayers $500 million each year—money that could be better spent on evidence-based initiatives that have been proven to reduce recidivism and improve public safety. The Safer Supervision Act, which has broad support from law enforcement, legal experts and criminal justice groups across the political spectrum, would tackle many of the issues that are causing the current system to fail.\nFirst, instead of implementing one-size-fits-all supervision sentences for everyone exiting the justice system, the Safer Supervision Act would require courts to conduct individualized assessments to determine if supervision is necessary, and if so, what restrictions are needed to protect public safety or better support successful reentry.\nThis would ensure that the people who need the most support receive it while allowing people who are at lower risk of recidivism to fully stretch their freedom legs. It would also prevent probation officers from becoming overburdened with irrelevant caseloads.\nAnother critical piece of the bill is that it creates incentives for maintaining good conduct and reintegrating successfully into society. The legislation establishes a presumption of early termination once someone has served half of their supervision period, has shown good conduct and complied with supervision terms, and has been assessed as a low public safety risk.\nThis will encourage more people to take the steps needed to succeed, whether that involves undergoing substance use disorder treatment, pursuing more education or maintaining steady employment.\nOther provisions in the bill also focus on rehabilitation. For example, it would give courts the option to send people on supervised release who are found in possession of illicit substances to treatment and rehabilitation programs instead of requiring a mandatory revocation that often comes with prison time. This would only apply in cases of simple possession, not possession with the intent to distribute.\nLastly, the bill calls for a thorough report on federal post-release supervision and reentry services to ensure taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently and responsibly.\nToo many of our federal supervision rules are counterproductive. Not only do they keep too many people who have served their time in prison and are not a threat to public safety from living full lives, but they overburden our law enforcement officers and make us less safe.\nThe Safer Supervision Act will help change that, giving deserving people a real second chance while ensuring public safety.",

            "excerpt": "The $1.7 trillion student debt crisis has resulted in repeated Biden attempts at bailouts. It's time to change the whole narrative and make the schools bear the burden.",
            "summary": "After his first attempt at large-scale student loan forgiveness produced a last-minute surge of young voters to the polls in the 2022 midterms before it was struck down by the Supreme Court, President Joe Biden is trying the same trick again in 2024. In swing state Michigan on April 8, the president unveiled another plan to unilaterally reduce or eliminate the loans of 23 million undergraduate and graduate borrowers.\nIn announcing what is now a third round of student loan forgiveness after a more minor middle attempt, the Biden administration is performing a cynical dance for young voters: vote for me now and blame the courts when this latest gambit to avoid Congress pulls the rug out from under them. But because Republicans have advanced no serious alternative that addresses the growing student loan crisis, the oldest demagogue trick in the book is likely to succeed.\nThe student debt crisis is very real — $1.7 trillion and counting — and derives from a simple truth: the value of a college degree has not kept up with the skyrocketing cost of tuition. College costs have soared well above already-inflationary middle-class staples like health care and grocery bills for decades, a rise fueled by generous government loans and grants, as well as the greed of the universities themselves, even when labeled \"nonprofit.\"\nUniversities have used that taxpayer-funded boom to hire disproportionate swarms of administrators and bureaucrats, as well as to construct fantasy-like facilities, like lazy rivers and rock-climbing walls, alongside classes on Harry Potter to attract the next graduating class of hapless 18-year-olds.\nThe same combination of federal incentives and lack of institutional scruples has led universities to drop academic standards for admission, to the extent that only 60% of incoming freshmen end up graduating in six — not four — years.\nFour in 10 find themselves in the unenviable position of having college loans but no degree, a situation that predictably often leads to default. If it were private banks making these six-figure loans to 18-year-olds for trips to Machu Picchu, everyone would recognize the scheme as predatory, but for some reason universities get left off the hook. And private banks are basically nonexistent in the student debt market, where the federal government holds 93% of all loans.\nAll this has worked out well for universities, some of which have been able to build endowments the size of top-10 hedge funds, but badly for everyone else. Graduating high school students face Hobson's choice between taking out ever-higher loans for degrees stagnating in value, or facing a shrinking market for jobs that don't require a credential.\nThe latter pool is shrinking less because entry level positions that didn't require a bachelor's 20 years ago suddenly discovered how much better a receptionist with a Queer Studies degree performs, and more because employers have been forbidden, under regulatory expansions of the Civil Rights Act never intended by its authors, to administer virtually any other assessment of basic competency.\nSimple screening tests asking potential employees to prove some level of aptitude for the tasks of the job produce a \"disparate impact\" on the racial group level, a reality unforgivable to the DEI crowd. It's a rigged system aptly described by legal scholar Gail Heriot, who holds a longtime position on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, as an interpretation of the law that \"makes almost everything presumptively illegal.\"\nEverything, that is, that the EEOC, the committee made up of unelected bureaucrats who govern the application of Title VII, chooses to look at. Conveniently, the EEOC has never applied that same disparate impact lens to $100,000 college credentials, which also produce racial disparities alongside burdensome debt.\nCoupled with degree inflation, escalating government loans, and the increasing academic unseriousness of universities themselves, this dynamic has produced a kind of \"credentialing treadmill,\" which forces young Americans to take out more and more debt in order to stay in place, getting the same jobs their parents did without six-figure loans.\nIt's a treadmill that's unsustainable, which is why if Biden's first unconstitutional attempt at forgiveness had succeeded, we would be back at the current level of debt crisis in a mere four years.\nLoan forgiveness without reform of the system and without giving universities any reason to provide a better value for a lower cost, as the Biden administration proposes, is a temporary band-aid; an extremely unfair one to the millions of taxpaying Americans who either did not go to college or have painstakingly paid off their loans who now find themselves stuck with the bill.\nBut, as with any scheme to rob Peter to pay Paul, it's popular with the desperate young voters starting out in life with a debt burden that would have been unthinkable a couple decades ago.\nThe reality is that college cost and the attendant debt catastrophe are not going away, and affect millions of Americans — Americans who vote. Democrats will continue to cynically use public debt giveaways to bolster their poll numbers while doing nothing to address the underlying problems in higher education.\nThe only fair solution is to place the bill — a bill which is currently looming over taxpayers whether we like it or not — where it justly belongs, with the universities that have profited generously from a system that leaves everyone else indebted or on the hook.\nRepublicans should propose debt forgiveness and restructuring for the same borrowers the Biden administration is appealing to, but instead of asking the mechanic without a four-year degree to pay the check, they should pay it by raising the tax on university endowments, and closing loopholes around other university moneymaking enterprises.\nUnlike any of the three forgiveness plans from the current administration, this solution would not blow a hole in an already deficit-laden federal budget, nor would it ask economically struggling Americans to dig into their own pockets to pay off the loans of others.\nEven more importantly, tying the university sector itself to the problem of student debt would finally force higher ed to put some skin in the game, and provide a sharp incentive to take responsibility for the debt burdens of their graduates.\nThe same combination of federal incentives and lack of institutional scruples has led universities to drop academic standards for admission, to the extent that only 60% of incoming freshmen end up graduating in six — not four — years.\nSince the 1960s, we have been lavishing benefits and honors on universities, and the government has been spending trillions in service of sending as many people through their halls as possible. Universities have proven themselves wholly unworthy of that special treatment.\nInstead of cynical stopgaps and election-year ploys, we should deliver real debt relief to millions, not from one group of citizens to another, but out of the pockets of the universities that have become rich selling a product that's bad for their students and bad for America.",

            "summary": "An attorney who witnessed a horrifying murder-suicide inside a Las Vegas law firm is speaking out – telling her story to Fox News Digital.\nLisa Rasmussen was inside the conference room at Prince Law Group on the morning of Monday, April 8 when fellow attorney Joe Houston pulled out a gun without warning and opened fire.\nThe terminally ill Houston gunned down prominent Las Vegas attorney Dennis Prince and his wife, Ashley, before turning the gun on himself. The bizarre shooting was the culmination of an \"incredibly tense\" custody battle with \"​​a lot of venom going back and forth,\" Rasmussen said.\n\"All of a sudden there's this horrible noise and I couldn't even identify it. It was like a bomb,\" Rasmussen said, recalling the moment the shooter, who was seated right next to her, began his violent rampage.\n\"It was sort of echoing in my head… I had no idea what it was. I turned to my right to kind of look at Joe, maybe, and say, ‘What… what the hell was that?' And I just see, right next to me, a barrel and a sleeve,\" Rasmussen said. \"I don't even remember seeing the hand. It's so weird. I just saw the barrel of a gun.\"\n\"I just see, right next to me, a barrel and a sleeve,\" Rasmussen said. \"I don't even remember seeing the hand. It's so weird. I just saw the barrel of a gun.\"\nRasmussen said it took her brain a minute to comprehend what was happening.\n\"I recall Joe standing up and pointing across the table with the barrel – the gun. And by that time, and at that moment, I was really clear on what was happening. I'm like, ‘okay, that was a gunshot. That's a gun. He's pointing it,'\" Rasmussen said. \"I wasn't going to stand around. I peeled back to my left – jumped up.\"\nRasmussen fled the conference room for her life along with her client, an 8-months-pregnant associate and a court reporter. She searched desperately for safety as shots continued to ring out in the conference room.\nWhen the violence stopped, the gravity of the tragedy became apparent. Joe Houston, 77, had murdered Dennis Prince, 57, and his wife Ashley Prince, 30, Rasmussen said. The Princes were locked in a contentious custody battle with Dylan Houston, Ashley's ex-husband and Joe Houston's son.\nRasmussen was representing Joe Houston's wife, Kelly, at the time. The group had gathered at Prince Law Group that fateful morning so Kelly could be deposed in the case.\n\"People ask me if I think Joe came with a plan to do this, and I say no,\" Rasmussen said. \"I just really think it just unfolded in a moment of rage, whatever. And we're never going to know, right? Because Joe took his own life. We're never going to know what happened.\"\nRasmussen said Joe Houston displayed no warning signs that morning. She described him as \"jovial.\"\n\"I was aware that he had a cancer diagnosis, but he did not seem just so, you know, terminally ill,\" she said. \"He was able-bodied, and he had a full head of hair, and he was jovial. He didn't seem sick or even like he didn't feel well. He didn't look pale. He didn't. So he may have had a diagnosis that was problematic. I, of course, have no idea what was going through his mind.\"\nShe walked with Joe Houston and his wife up to the conference room where they met several other associates to begin the deposition.\nDennis Prince entered the conference room with his wife, not knowing it would be the last few moments of their lives. Rasmussen said Dennis skipped the usual pleasantries.\n\"It was immediately odd because there was no prelude. There was no ‘good morning. Does anyone want water? The bathrooms are in the hall,'\" she said. \"He just looked at the court reporter and said, ‘please swear in the witness,' which isn't, you know, the best way to put the witness at ease.\"\nBefore the questioning began, Rasmussen said, Joe asked Dennis if there was any way they were ever going to be able to resolve any of the issues for the sake of children.\n\"And Dennis didn't respond. There was no response to that. He just turned to Kelly and started asking her the deposition questions. And not even, like, normally in a depo, there's some prelude, you know, please wait until I finish my question until you start your answer. There was none of that,\" Rasmussen said. \"He just started asking her the substantive questions, which was, you know, probably not the way most people would do it.\"\nRasmussen said they only got through three questions before Joe Houston pulled out the gun.\n\"I didn't see anyone get shot,\" she said. \"It's weird because in the process of, like, looking to my left, watching her answer the question, hearing the noise, kind of going to my right, seeing the barrel, seeing him stand up, going back to my left. My whole memory of across the table is nothing. And I don't know if my mind's blocking it out or if they ducked. I just remember seeing nothing across the table.\"\n\"My whole memory of across the table is nothing. And I don't know if my mind's blocking it out or if they ducked. I just remember seeing nothing across the table,\" Rasmussen said.\nRasmussen told Fox News Digital she is in therapy and thankful for all of the support she has received following the tragedy. She has already returned to work.\n\"Whether I'm ready to do another deposition is another question, but so far, I'm doing fine,\" she said. \"And I have really been blessed with the support I've received from my community, from other lawyers, from judges. Everyone has been very kind.\"\nLooking ahead, Rasmussen hopes some good can come from the unthinkable tragedy. She hopes to one day share her story with other lawyers to help bring more \"respect and civility\" back to the profession.\n\"I hope one day, when I feel a little bit healed from this, to be able to perhaps talk to other lawyers – to participate in some continuing legal education – to reiterate the importance of civility,\" Rasmussen explained. \"I hope to be a part of the conversation going forward in the future about how much civility matters. It just matters… lawyering should not be a gladiator sport.\"\nDennis Prince leaves behind four children. He shared an infant daughter with Ashley Prince, his fourth wife.",
