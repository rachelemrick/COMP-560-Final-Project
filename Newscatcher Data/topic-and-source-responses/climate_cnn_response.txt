According to the United Nations, the world is heading toward a gain of nearly 3 degrees of global warming in the next century, even with current climate policies and goals \u2013 and researchers say individuals could bear the economic burden.\nAccording to the United Nations, the world is heading toward a gain of nearly 3 degrees of global warming in the next century, even with current climate policies and goals \u2013 and researchers say individuals could bear the economic burden. The researchers in Wednesday's study, published in Nature, said financial pain in the short-term is inevitable, even if governments ramp up their efforts to tackle the crisis now.\n'These impacts are unavoidable in the sense that they are indistinguishable across different future emission scenarios until 2049,' two of the study's researchers from the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research, Maximilian Kotz and Leonie Wenz, told CNN via email.\nHowever, they say immediate actions to reduce climate change could stem some losses in the longer term.\nNoah Diffenbaugh, a professor and environmental researcher at Stanford University, said the economic damage from climate change will take different shapes. Not only can extreme weather events result in costly repairs to damaged property, but elevated temperatures can also impact agriculture, labor productivity, and even cognitive ability in some cases.\nWhile discourse about the cost of climate change often refers to potentially expensive mitigation efforts like curbing oil and gas use or technology to pull carbon pollution out of the air, investing in greener technology, the study argued that short-term financial damage wrought by climate change already outweighs the cost of trying to solve the crisis.\nor technology to pull carbon pollution out of the air, investing in greener technology, the study argued that short-term financial damage wrought by climate change already outweighs the cost of trying to solve the crisis. Researchers estimated it would cost the global economy $6 trillion by 2050 to comply with the Paris Climate Agreement\u2014the international agreement among nearly 200 nations to tackle climate change\u2014compared to the study's estimated $38 trillion economic damage due to climate change.\n'Adaptation could offer ways to reduce these damages,' the researchers Kotz and Wenz said.\nBernardo Bastien, a researcher at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego, said that adaptation strategies, which are approaches designed not to reduce climate change, but to respond by limiting its negative effects, could help save money on a longer time horizon.\nBastien gave an example: utility companies in the state of California that have shut down the electrical grid to prevent wildfires.\n'When you turn off electrical grids, you're turning off industry and you're turning off a lot of households that use electricity for their well-being,' Bastien said. 'It's very costly but very necessary.'\nAnd while the study concludes some economic damage is guaranteed before 2049, its authors argue that benefits from curbing climate change could emerge a few decades down the line.\n'Damage estimates diverge strongly across emission scenarios after 2049, conveying the clear benefits from mitigation from a purely economic point of view,' the study said.\nHowever, the expected financial hit won't be distributed evenly.\nDiffenbaugh, who was not associated with the study, said that while research showing the aggregate impact of climate change is important, 'embedded in those aggregate impacts are very stark disparities in who is most impacted by climate change.'\n'We have clear evidence that overall, the poor are harmed more,' he said. 'That's what's likely to happen from the global warming that's already occurred and what's likely to happen even for small increments of global warming.'\nThe Nature study estimated the economic damage of different regions. North America and Europe are expected to see a lower income reduction in the next 26 years at 11%, compared to South Asia and Africa at 22%.\nThe United States, a historically large polluter, will take a smaller economic hit than some neighboring countries, according to the study. However, it won't be spared from disruptions caused by a warming planet \u2014 especially younger generations of Americans.\n\u2014 especially younger generations of Americans. A different paper, published Tuesday in Consumer Reports from global consulting firm ICF, estimates that the lifetime personal cost of climate change for a baby born in the US in 2024 could be as high as $500,000.\nThe ICF paper said price hikes on essential elements of the cost of living in the US will add up due to climate change. Housing costs are projected to increase by $125,000 over the lifetime of a person born in 2024, owing to elevated maintenance and insurance costs due to the risks of flooding and other weather-related damage, the paper said. Food prices are also seen rising by an estimated $33,000 over the lifetime of a 2024 baby, due to disruptions to agriculture and supply chains, the paper said. Other expenses, like energy, transportation and health care, are expected to balloon in the next few decades, as well.\n'For many Americans, this financial loss will require difficult decisions about how to pay for food, housing, and other daily expenses, which climate change will increase by approximately 9 percent over their lifetime,' the paper said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"business","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Samantha Delouya,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap24094707946139.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNbusiness","_score":8.4013405,"_id":"90e29ab161269d551c9d0066bd2c76ca"},{"title":"Jane Fonda's advice to people depressed about the future: Get involved","author":"Lisa Respers France","published_date":"2024-04-16 18:05:06","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/16/entertainment/jane-fonda-advice-climate-change/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Jane Fonda knows what it feels like to worry about the future.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Jane Fonda knows what it feels like to worry about the future.\nIn an exclusive interview with USC Annenberg Media, Oscar-winning actor and activist, 86, reflected on her six-decade-long career and her efforts to address the climate crisis.\nThat work, she said, helped lift her out of darkness.\n'Maybe five or six years ago, I was really despondent about the climate situation. I was doing stuff, but I knew I could do a lot more given that I have a platform,' Fonda said. 'It was hard for me to even get out of bed, I was so depressed. Then I started Fire Drill Fridays and the minute I started my activism full-on, the depression lifted.'\nBeing an activist helps keep her 'hopeful,' she said, despite acknowledging we're living in a 'very dangerous time right now.'\n'I think that the most dangerous threat facing us is the climate crisis, because if we don't confront it in time it's going to be very hard to achieve democracy, equality, anything that we want in a stable society,' she said. 'When I decided to devote myself to the climate crisis issue full-time, it was to try to alert people of what's coming. We have about six years to reduce our fossil fuel emissions.'\nFonda's work as an activist began in earnest back in the 1970s, when her mentor, a Black attorney, offered her some words of wisdom.\n'I said to him, \u2018I think I'm going to not be an actor anymore because it's too hard for me when I'm working with people who are in a very different situation in the world,'' she recalled.

You should not only keep doing what you're doing but you got to pay more attention, own it. Own your career, make it work for you as an activist.''\nThat's just what she did thriving as both an activist and as an actress in beloved films, including '9 to 5,' 'Coming Home' and 'The China Syndrome.'\nNow Fonda wants others to also catch fire for doing good as well.\n'While I have the opportunity, with every ounce of my being, I want to say to the young people that will read this: please vote and vote with climate in your heart.

He gives me inspiration that I otherwise might not have. He gives me perspective. I think that I'm a believer that humans can be a net positive for the planet.

He called the climate crisis an 'existential threat' that requires 'full and clear action.'\n'As president, I've seen the devastating toll of climate firsthand,' Biden said, speaking of wildfires, extreme weather and deadly heat.

I'm determined \u2013 absolutely determined [that] we move forward.'\nUnder the Environmental Protection Agency's Solar for All program, the administration announced funding awards to states territories, tribal governments, municipalities and nonprofits 'to develop long-lasting solar programs that are targeted towards the communities and people who need them most,' EPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe told reporters during a Friday call.\nPer McCabe, the funding will enable nearly one million households in low-income and disadvantaged communities to benefit from solar power, saving more than $350 million in electric costs annually and more than $8 billion over the life of the program for overburdened households.\nBiden also announced new action on the federal Climate Corps \u2013 a workforce training and service initiative aimed at preparing young Americans for jobs in clean energy and climate resilience. The government will ease Climate Corps members' transition to other federal jobs after they graduate from the program.\nBiden said service programs like the Climate Corps bring 'out the best in young people to do what's best for America.'\n'You'll get paid to fight climate change, learning how to install those solar panels, fight wildfires, rebuild wetlands, weatherize homes, and so much more,' Biden added.\nHe also announced a new partnership between the administration and TradesFutures, the non-profit arm of the North America's Building Trades Unions, allowing Climate Corps members to access some of the union's apprenticeship programs.\nHe also touted an announcement from three states \u2014 Vermont, New Mexico and Illinois \u2014 launching their own state-based climate corps. Climate corps programs will employ people doing conservation work, as well as work constructing renewable energy like wind and solar.\nBiden and other progressive lawmakers, including Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, delivered remarks in Virginia's Prince William Forest Park, a site developed by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps, on which the American Climate Corps is modeled.\n'In the midst of a depression, President Roosevelt called on the American people to come together, to take on the challenge and unlock the opportunity that sat inside of that\u2013 the opportunity to heal, to lift folks up, and to move America forward,' White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi said Friday. 'President Biden will talk about how the United States, in the face of a climate crisis fully manifest to the American people in communities all across the country, is also an opportunity for us to come together.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Donald Judd,Ella Nilsen","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2148203597.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":7.685218,"_id":"fadce571088ee8017c99eca2efc9d1d1"},{"title":"Ocean heat is driving a global coral bleaching event, and it could be the worst on record","author":"Rebecca Wright","published_date":"2024-04-15 15:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/15/climate/global-coral-reef-mass-bleaching-climate-hnk-intl","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"At least 54 countries are experiencing mass coral bleaching as the climate crisis drives ocean temperatures to record-breaking levels","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Coral reefs around the world are experiencing a mass bleaching event as the climate crisis drives record-breaking ocean heat, two scientific bodies announced Monday \u2014 with some experts warning this could become the worst bleaching period in recorded history.\nMore than 54% of the world's coral reef areas have experienced bleaching in the past year, affecting at least 53 countries and territories including large swaths of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, a joint statement from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and The International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI) said.\n'It is likely that this event will surpass the previous peak of 56.1% soon,' Derek Manzello, the coordinator for NOAA's Coral Reef Watch program, said in an email to CNN. 'The percentage of reef areas experiencing bleaching-level heat stress has been increasing by roughly 1% per week.'\nWhen corals are exposed to stress from marine heatwaves, they spit out the algae living within their tissue, which provides them with both their color and most of their energy. If ocean temperatures don't return to normal, bleaching can lead to mass coral death, threatening the species and food chains that rely on them with collapse.\nThis marks the world's fourth global bleaching event, and the second in the past decade \u2013 with previous periods in 1998, 2010, and between 2014-2017.\nIn the past year, mass bleaching has been confirmed in regions including Florida and the wider Caribbean, Mexico, Brazil, Australia, the South Pacific, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, Indonesia, and the Indian Ocean including the east coast of Africa and the Seychelles.\nProfessor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, a climate scientist specializing in coral reefs based at the University of Queensland in Australia, predicted this mass bleaching event months ago.\nbased at the University of Queensland in Australia, predicted this mass bleaching event months ago. 'We knew sea temperatures were increasing rapidly, but not at this speed,' Hoegh-Guldberg told CNN on Monday. 'The worrying issue is that we don't know how long this massive temperature change is likely to last.'\nThe last 12 months have been the planet's warmest on record and ocean temperatures have been surging off the charts. Global sea surface temperatures hit record highs in February and again in March, according to data from the European Commission's Copernicus Climate Change Service.\nIn February, scientists at the Coral Reef Watch program at NOAA added three new alert levels to the coral bleaching alert maps, to enable scientists to assess the new scale of underwater warming.\nEl Ni\u00f1o, a natural climate pattern which originates in the Pacific Ocean along the equator and tends to push up global temperatures, has helped drive the unprecedented ocean heat.\nNOAA predicts La Ni\u00f1a, El Ni\u00f1o's cooler counterpart, could arrive between June and August this year, which provides 'a nugget of hope' for coral reefs, NOAA's Manzello said.\nBut, he added, bleaching events have still occurred during La Ni\u00f1a in the past few years.\n'I am becoming increasingly concerned about the 2024 summer for the wider Caribbean and Florida,' Manzello said. 'When we roll into summer and the bleaching season for Florida and the Caribbean, it won't take much additional seasonal warming to push temperatures past the bleaching threshold.'\nIn mid-February, CNN witnessed extensive coral bleaching on Australia's Great Barrier Reef \u2013 the world's largest coral reef system \u2013 on five different reefs spanning the northern and southern areas. A mass bleaching event was officially confirmed there last month after aerial and underwater surveys by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.\n'The increasing frequency and extremity of marine heatwaves driven by climate change, is testing the tolerance levels of coral reefs,' said Selina Stead, the CEO of AIMS. 'Climate change is the biggest threat to coral reefs worldwide and this global confirmation illustrates just how extensive its impact has been across the last 12 months.'\n'That is why it is critical the world works to reduce carbon emissions,' Stead added. 'It is also important to ensure coral reefs are well managed at local and regional levels.'\nThe UN Environment Programme has warned that if the world fails to aggressively lower its emissions, the planet is heading towards nearly 3 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels this century.\nScientists predict that even at 2 degrees of warming \u2014 which the world could reach around 2050 \u2014 approximately 99% of corals on Earth would die.\nAs well as being an essential habitat for marine life, coral reefs are crucial for the world's coastal communities \u2014 they act as a vital defense system against the threat of flooding from storms and sea level rise, and also provide livelihoods and a vital food source for an estimated billion people globally.\nDavid Ritter, CEO of Greenpeace Australia, said reefs were facing 'existential danger' and that blame lies 'squarely with the main culprits fueling global warming: fossil fuel companies, and the governments who prop up this industry.'\n'We are running out of runway to avoid irreversible climate disaster,' he added, 'and must act quickly to ensure an immediate end to new fossil fuels.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Rebecca Wright","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gopr0951.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":7.4771457,"_id":"3c677567ff0cb63351e9de80db4d3aea"},{"title":"How climate change could be driving \u2018killer' cold outbreaks in oceans","author":"Rachel Ramirez","published_date":"2024-04-15 16:51:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/15/climate/cold-ocean-upwelling-sharks-climate","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The same planet-warming pollution that's driving the climate crisis is likely to blame for 'killer events' on the colder end of the temperature spectrum.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 It's not just ocean heat that's affecting marine life \u2013 new research shows extremely cold events are welling up and causing mass mortalities. And the same planet-warming pollution that's driving the climate crisis is likely to blame for these 'killer events' on the other end of the temperature spectrum.\nThe world's oceans have been plagued by unprecedented heat over the past year, fueling concerns for marine life. Billions of crabs disappeared in the northern Pacific; sea lions and dolphins are washing up sick; iconic coral reefs are undergoing mass bleaching.\nBut even as ocean temperatures climb, extremely cold upwelling events \u2014 when strong winds and ocean currents bring pockets of cold water up to the surface, replacing the warm water that was there \u2014 are also becoming more frequent and intense, threatening sea life, according to the study published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change.\n'Climate change is actually really complex,' said Nicolas Lubitz, lead author of the study and a researcher at James Cook University in Queensland, Australia. 'It's not just warming of the globe, but it's really changing the way our oceans function.'\nWhen Lubitz heard reports of marine animals like sharks, manta rays and squids washing up dead in the southeast coast of South Africa in March 2021, he started investigating. More than 260 marine animals from 81 different species died in that one extreme event.\nHe said seasonal upwelling events are common in that area, with water temperature dropping quickly. But Lubitz said the March 2021 die-off was 'quite an extreme event, because we had rather warm water before it happened.'\n'And then the winds changed, and the currents started changing slightly, which is a seasonal thing,' he added. 'Then all of a sudden, the temperature within 24 hours dropped by 11 degrees.'\nThe researchers analyzed killer upwelling events in the Indian Ocean's Agulhas Current and the East Australian Current, using 41 years of sea surface temperature data and 33 years of wind records to see how deadly cold ocean extremes can be.\n'We're seeing changes in how often the upwelling occurs, how intense it is, which might impact the fishing communities in these areas,' he said. 'It's really an economic thing as well as the biodiversity thing.'\nAccording to the study, the lethality of a cold event is likely linked to how fast the temperature drops. If the cold event lasts for multiple days, which has been occurring more frequently, research shows that marine animals including turtles and many fish species could suffer from hypothermia and physiological malfunction or ultimately die.\nFor a different study, Lubitz already had bull sharks electronically tagged with a transmitting locator device, which also recorded the depth and temperature of the part of the ocean they swim to.\n'That was really the key in this study in that we could see when the sharks migrate,' he said. 'We could see how the temperature profiles change, and how the sharks were swimming shallower when they were in upwelling areas because they were trying to avoid the colder water from the depths.'\nThe findings provide a 'very reasonable explanation' to the many unexpected marine mortality events people have been seeing around the world, said Ajit Subramaniam, research professor with Columbia University's Climate School's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.\n'It's one of those unexpected findings and it's not something we talk about a lot,' Subramaniam, who was not involved with the study, told CNN. 'And therefore, this is a timely thing to remind us that the climate crisis works in both ways.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Rachel Ramirez,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-476956821.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":7.453632,"_id":"c4834a0058331a9f28b35ddd979155f8"},{"title":"RFK Jr.'s onetime allies in environmental advocacy call for him to drop out","author":"Aaron Pellish","published_date":"2024-04-19 15:24:54","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/19/politics/robert-kennedy-natural-resources-defense-council","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Environmental groups are condemning Robert F.

It's a compelling vision of a potential solution in the face of a worsening climate crisis that has fueled unprecedented heat and devastating extreme weather. Efforts to rein in global heating remain hugely off track, and many scientists are now warning that, in addition to rapidly reducing fossil fuels, the world will also need to remove carbon pollution humans have already pumped into the atmosphere.\nin the face of a worsening climate crisis that has fueled unprecedented heat and devastating extreme weather. Efforts to rein in global heating remain hugely off track, and many scientists are now warning that, in addition to rapidly reducing fossil fuels, the world will also need to remove carbon pollution humans have already pumped into the atmosphere. This Singapore plant is one example of a slew of recent projects that are looking to the oceans, which already absorb almost 30% of humanity's planet-heating pollution, as a tool to do this. Other projects include sprinkling iron particles into the ocean to stimulate CO2-absorbing phytoplankton, sinking seaweed into the depths to lock up carbon and spraying particles into marine clouds to reflect away some of the sun's energy.\nBut carbon-removal projects are controversial, criticized for being expensive, unproven at scale and a distraction from policies to cut fossil fuels. And when they involve the oceans \u2014 complex ecosystems already under huge strain from global warming \u2014 criticisms can get even louder.\nThere are 'big knowledge gaps' when it comes to ocean geoengineering generally, said Jean-Pierre Gatusso, an ocean scientist at the Sorbonne University in France. 'I am very concerned with the fact that science lags behind the industry,' he told CNN.\nEquatic's technology, which has been tested in small pilot projects in LA and Singapore, requires three main ingredients: seawater, rocks and electricity.\nIt works like this: The plant pumps in seawater and runs an electric current through it, separating it into four components: two liquids, one acid and one alkaline, and two gases, hydrogen and oxygen.\nThe acidic water will be mixed with crushed rocks to get the pH back to the same levels as seawater and then sent back into the ocean.\nFans will pump air through the alkaline stream, which causes carbon dioxide to form solid calcium carbonate, the material from which seashells are formed, which will look like a fine sand, as well as dissolved bicarbonate.\nThe solid and dissolved minerals, which Equatic says can lock up carbon for at least 10,000 years, will be returned to the ocean or used on land. The seawater will also be sent back into the sea, ready to absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\nNone of the processing happens out in the open ocean, said Gaurav Sant, an Equatic founder and professor of sustainability at UCLA, 'this is important because it allows you to measure everything that you're doing perfectly.' This includes the electricity the plant uses as well as the amount of carbon locked away.\nThe $20 million facility will be fully operational by the end of the year and able to remove 3,650 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, said Edward Sanders, chief operating officer of Equatic, which has partnered with Singapore's National Water Agency to construct the plant. That amount is equivalent to taking roughly 870 average passenger cars off the road.\nThe ambition is to scale up to 100,000 metric tons of CO2 removal a year by the end of 2026, and from there to millions of metric tons over the next few decades, Sanders told CNN. The plant can be replicated pretty much anywhere, he said, stacked up in modules 'like lego blocks.'\na year by the end of 2026, and from there to millions of metric tons over the next few decades, Sanders told CNN. The plant can be replicated pretty much anywhere, he said, stacked up in modules 'like lego blocks.'\nAs the plant scales up, they will need to make sure there aren't negative impacts, Sant told CNN. 'There's a big difference whether you do this on a scale of one ton, versus a million tons, versus a billion tons. You need to measure, you need to monitor, you need to adapt.'\nThe upfront costs are high but the company says it plans to make money by selling carbon credits to polluters to offset their pollution, as well as selling the hydrogen produced during the process.\nEquatic has already signed a deal with Boeing to sell it 2,100 metric tons of hydrogen, which it plans to use to create green fuel, and to fund the removal of 62,000 metric tons of CO2.\nFor some critics, however, the risks far outweigh the benefits.\nLili Fuhr, the deputy director of the climate and energy program at the Center for International Environmental Law, criticized the use of 'speculative technology' at a time when 'climate change is already killing our oceans.'\nProcessing vast amounts of seawater could kill marine life, Fuhr told CNN. 'We already know that power plants kill fish larvae and other marine life. Equatic would process much more seawater per plant than a power plant,' she told CNN, 'And thousands of such plants would be needed to make any meaningful impact on the global climate.'\nThe impacts would need to be closely monitored, said James Niffenegger, a researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, who wrote a report on ocean carbon removal. The 'artificial movement of water at this scale is going to be massive,' he told CNN.\nThe process could also potentially disrupt the delicate balance of ocean chemistry, Niffenegger said. While there is plenty of research into the negative impacts of ocean acidification, there is much less on what might happen if the ocean becomes more alkaline.\nThere are indications the impacts may be low, he added, but 'we're not going to be able to understand the potential of this solution until we start actually deploying this kind of thing.'\nThen there are the energy requirements \u2014 as the world moves away from fossil fuels, the demand for clean energy is increasing exponentially. 'Moving seawater would require vast amounts of renewable energy that would be better used to displace fossil fuels in the first place,' Fuhr said.\nIt's a point echoed by Gatusso, who said 'justice must be considered when precious electricity is used to remove carbon rather than providing it to populations in need.'\nEquatic said it filters the seawater to ensure marine life does not enter the system, and that water discharged back into the ocean will have the same composition as normal seawater and will comply with Singapore's environmental guidelines.\nThe company also said the production of hydrogen, which could be used to power the process, means its overall energy use is lower than other carbon removal methods.\nEquatic's project encapsulates a broader debate among those who fear rushing into geoengineering could unleash untold damage on ecosystems, versus those who believe the climate crisis is so acute this technology must be an option.\nIt's clear which side Equatic is on.\n'Inaction is not a climate strategy,' said UCLA's Sant, adding that it's vital to be able to make decisions with uncertainty. 'If we're serious about mitigating the trajectory of climate change,' Sant said, 'we need to be willing to move, and move quickly at scale.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Laura Paddison,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/beach-equip-trio-feb-27-playin-rt-1d.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":7.285129,"_id":"7d752dac19b4c7ba08c5c94a7bacd347"},{"title":"RFK Jr.'s former environmentalist allies call for him to drop out","author":"Aaron Pellish","published_date":"2024-04-19 15:24:54","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/politics/robert-kennedy-natural-resources-defense-council/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Environmental groups are condemning Robert F.

The Interior Department will block oil drilling on over 13 million acres in the Western Arctic, including about 40% of the land of the NPR-A \u2013 a remote area that is home to protected animal species including polar bears and caribou.\nThe reserve is more than 23 million acres of public land and an underground emergency oil supply for the US Navy that was designated in the early 1920s. More recently, it's become the site of the ConocoPhillips-owned Willow project, a controversial oil drilling venture in the Arctic.\npublic land and an underground emergency oil supply for the US Navy that was designated in the early 1920s. More recently, it's become the site of the ConocoPhillips-owned Willow project, a controversial oil drilling venture in the Arctic. When the Biden administration approved Willow in March 2023, it sparked intense backlash among young people on social media, as well as environmental and climate groups. Friday's action could improve President Joe Biden's approval among young voters.\n'These natural wonders demand our protection,' Biden said in a statement. Biden said he was 'proud' of his administration's move to conserve more than 13 million acres in the Western Arctic, but added, 'as the climate crisis imperils communities across the country, more must be done.'\nSome Alaska Natives are critical of the drilling ban across such a significant swath of the NPR-A. It has proved controversial with Alaska's bipartisan congressional delegation, as well as Alaska Native groups who say they depend on the tax revenue from oil drilling to fund schools and basic services.\nIt has proved controversial with Alaska's bipartisan congressional delegation, as well as Alaska Native groups who say they depend on the tax revenue from oil drilling to fund schools and basic services. The final rule 'does not reflect our communities' wishes,' said Voice of the Arctic I\u00f1upiat President Nagruk Harcharek, adding the move 'will hurt the very residents the federal government purports to help by rolling back years of progress, impoverishing our communities, and imperiling our I\u00f1upiaq culture.'\nThe ban will also open the president to attacks from Republicans that he is failing to prioritize American energy independence and is driving up the price of gasoline. But under Biden's tenure, the US is producing more oil than any country in history, CNN Business reported, and gas prices are down $1.35 from their all-time high in June 2022.\nIn addition to protecting a vast amount of the NPR-A on Friday, the Biden administration moved to block the Trump administration-approved Ambler road in the Alaskan wilderness. If built, the road would serve as the access point for a proposed copper mine. The administration signaled it wanted to take 'no action' on the mine, effectively blocking the road's access to federal land.\nIn a statement, Ambler Metals, the company seeking to mine copper in the region, said it was 'deeply disappointed' in Interior's decision. Ambler's managing director Kaleb Froehlich said the move would deprive local communities of jobs and tax revenue and prevent the US 'from developing a domestic supply of minerals that are critical for clean energy technology and national security.'\nThe Alaska announcements cap off a week that saw a flurry of actions from Biden's Interior Department. On Thursday, the department announced a new rule that elevated conservation to put it on equal footing as other public land uses like grazing, mining and other energy development. The new conservation rule covers 245 million acres largely in the Western United States \u2013 about a tenth of the land in the nation.\nNext week, Biden is poised to expand two national monuments in California, CNN previously reported, adding to the several he has already designated throughout his presidency.\nInterior Sec. Deb Haaland said the administration's Alaska conservation announcements 'underscore our commitment to ensure that places too special to develop remain intact for the communities and species that rely on them.'\nIn a statement, Haaland added the move would be big step to safeguard 'the way of life for the Indigenous people who have called this special place home since time immemorial.'\nEnvironmental groups and some indigenous groups applauded Biden's announcements on Alaska conservation as an 'important step.'\n'It's no secret that the Reserve \u2013 a vast region of tundra and wetlands teeming with wildlife \u2013 has frequently landed in the crosshairs of the insatiable fossil fuel industry,' said Earthjustice attorney Jeremy Lieb in a statement. 'We applaud this move and call for even bolder action to keep the fossil fuel industry out of the Arctic, for the sake of the climate and future generations.'\nRosemary Ahtuangaruak, the former mayor of the North Slope village of Nuiqsut, and a staunch opponent of Willow, called upon the Biden administration to build on the protections in a statement, saying it would help Alaska Natives 'continue to sustain and pass along the traditions and activities of our elders for years to come.'\nAhtuangaruak told CNN in a recent interview that construction of infrastructure and ice and gravel roads needed for the Willow project is well underway. Ahtuangaruak fears the project is already impacting an annual caribou migration that's an important source of food for locals.\n'The animals have already begun their migration; we also have animals that get impeded and get stuck on the ice road areas,' Ahtuangaruak told CNN.

Here are some of the policies Biden says he would enact if elected for a second term.","summary":"President Joe Biden's main pitch to voters ahead of November is simple: They should vote for him because he is not Donald Trump. In speeches and political events since his reelection campaign began in earnest earlier this year, Biden had said that his second term would essentially be a continuation of his first: 'Let's finish this job,' Biden said in a video announcing his reelection campaign last year. In making his case to voters, Biden has contrasted his own ideas of governance with Trump's stated plans to drastically alter how the federal government works, how executive power would be used and how America's role on the world stage will change if the former president wins a second term. Biden, meanwhile, has promised to protect American democracy, pass a federal law to codify the right to an abortion into law, preserve the country's international alliances and agreements and deliver on climate benchmarks. His ability to deliver on these promises even if he wins a second term, though, is not a certainty. Many of his more lofty ambitions would require congressional approval and action. In some of his most significant and enduring acts as president, Trump appointed three conservative nominees to the Supreme Court. The ensuing right-wing supermajority paved the way for the court's 2022 decision that overturned Roe. V Wade, which had enshrined the right to an abortion in federal law for nearly half a century. Biden has made the court's decision, and Trump's repeated promises to go further in restricting abortion access if he were to win in November, a centerpiece of his reelection campaign. 'Like most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right,' Biden said during his State of the Union address on March 7. '\u2026 But my predecessor came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned. He's the reason it was overturned \u2014 in fact, he brags about it.' 'Look at the chaos that has resulted,' Biden added. During the speech, Biden promised to codify the abortion-related protections enshrined in Roe v. Wade into federal law if he wins a second term, but he acknowledged that would require the cooperation of a Democratic-controlled Congress. 'If Americans send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you, I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again,' Biden said. Biden called for codifying Roe into law when he was running for president in 2020. While seeking office in 2020, Biden made ambitious climate-related promises, warning that climate change presents an existential threat to humanity. Some of those promises panned out: Biden's landmark legislative achievements, the bipartisan infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act, include hundreds of billions of dollars to encourage clean energy production and the manufacturing of electric vehicles. Pollution-falling emissions fell by 2% in the United States last year. Activists on Biden's left flank still think the president has not done enough \u2014 they want Biden to declare a climate emergency that would free up federal resources to confront climate change. Biden will need more time to fulfill some of his other pledges, including cutting emissions in half by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, and having a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. Biden said the 2020 race was a 'battle for the soul of the nation.' Now, he has made preserving democracy the focal point of his 2024 campaign \u2014 saying the value Americans place on a free and democratic society is the most important question of our country's time. He lays out the stakes in stark terms: If Trump wins a second term, the United States will face a crisis that could lead to the erosion of democratic norms. 'Not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault here at home as they are today,' Biden said during his State of the Union address last month. Today, he warned, there are 'forces taking us back in time.' Biden urged Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. The acts, which would have made Election Day a federal holiday, bolstered voting-related security measures, allowed all voters to request mail-in ballots and updated parts of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act, were blocked by Senate Republicans in 2021. 'Pass and send me the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act,' Biden told Congress during his address, 'and stop denying another core value of America \u2014 our diversity across American life.' Biden has criticized Republican-led drives to ban certain books from public schools. 'Banning books \u2013 it's wrong,' he said in his State of the Union address. The United States, he said, shouldn't be erasing history. In the same speech, Biden also called for expanded pre-kindergarten for 3- and 4-year-olds, along with raises for teachers in public schools. He said he wants to continue making college more affordable by expanding access to Pell grants for working-class families, renewing a 2020 promise he made to double the grants' value. 'To remain the strongest economy in the world,' Biden said, 'we need the best education system in the world.' In some of his first actions as president, Biden worked to return the United States to the presence it held on the world stage before Trump became president. As president, Trump denigrated alliances like NATO and withdrew the United States from crucial international agreements, including the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accords. While running in 2020, Biden promised to undo damage wreaked by Trump on America's international partnerships. Biden has said he will continue to repair relationships that have faltered under Trump's control \u2014 and uphold American commitments to NATO and Ukraine. Trump, meanwhile, has said he would encourage Russia to do 'whatever the hell they want' to NATO-member countries who don't fulfill certain funding obligations. Biden frequently refers to those comments while speaking with supporters. 'The rest of the world is wondering what in the hell is happening to us,' Biden said at a campaign event in New York last month. 'And they're relieved, not because I'm so special but that I'm not Trump.' In an earlier Dallas fundraiser, Biden said the United States' international reputation was 'crushed when (Trump) was president.' 'Imagine what will happen if he's reelected,' Biden said. In 2022, Biden signed the most comprehensive gun-reform legislation in nearly 30 years. The law, passed shortly after a White supremacist massacred 10 people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket, allocated more than $750 million to help states implement crisis-intervention programs, closed certain loopholes in existing gun-control legislation and required more thorough reviews for people aged 18 to 21 who wanted to buy firearms. Biden has said he wants to go further. 'I'm demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,' Biden said at his State of the Union address. 'Pass universal background checks. None of this violates the Second Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners.' He made a similar promise while running in 2020 but has not been able to get Congress' support. Biden has homed in on Trump's statements suggesting he would be open to cutting programs like Social Security and Medicare. In an interview with CNBC last month, Trump said: 'There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements,' Trump said on CNBC. Biden responded on X: 'Not on my watch.' He reiterated his vow to protect Social Security during his State of the Union address. 'Many of my Republican friends want to put Social Security on the chopping block,' Biden said 'If anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age I will stop them.' 'I will protect and strengthen Social Security and make the wealthy pay their fair share,' he added. ``\nPresident Joe Biden's main pitch to voters ahead of November is simple: They should vote for him because he is not Donald Trump.\nIn speeches and political events since his reelection campaign began in earnest earlier this year, Biden had said that his second term would essentially be a continuation of his first: 'Let's finish this job,' Biden said in a video announcing his reelection campaign last year.\nIn making his case to voters, Biden has contrasted his own ideas of governance with Trump's stated plans to drastically alter how the federal government works, how executive power would be used and how America's role on the world stage will change if the former president wins a second term.\nBiden, meanwhile, has promised to protect American democracy, pass a federal law to codify the right to an abortion into law, preserve the country's international alliances and agreements and deliver on climate benchmarks.\nHis ability to deliver on these promises even if he wins a second term, though, is not a certainty.

The\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 The Biden administration is contemplating scrapping the most futuristic aspect of its highly anticipated and impactful power plant pollution rules, two sources familiar with the plan told CNN. The administration may also allow a slower phase-in for a portion of the rules, which are due to be finalized as soon as next week.\nThe potential change of plans comes as the administration faces fierce political headwinds, a conservative Supreme Court majority that has shown aggressive interest in curtailing the Environmental Protection Agency's authority and questions over how fast electric utilities can pivot to the most innovative climate solutions.\nThe EPA is considering eliminating a proposal for new natural gas plants to use hydrogen alongside natural gas to make electricity, the sources said. The expected changes mean both existing coal and new gas plants would primarily rely on carbon capture and storage to cut their climate pollution, rather than hydrogen fuels. Hydrogen, while in its infancy, is seen by scientists as the future of clean fuel.\nThe power plant rules are still under review and no final decisions on them have been made.\nEPA spokesperson Tim Carroll declined to comment, saying, 'The draft final rule is currently with the Office of Management and Budget under interagency review.' A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe EPA power plant rules are one of the most important and highly anticipated planks of President Joe Biden's climate agenda.\nThe potential change comes amid questions on how quickly the industry could scale up clean hydrogen, a relatively nascent technology derived both from fossil fuels such as natural gas, as well as cleaner hydrogen \u2013 which uses clean electricity to split water.\nA handful of projects have demonstrated the ability to burn hydrogen in a gas turbine, 'but it's not a widespread technology yet,' Mike O'Boyle, the senior director of electricity at nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation, told CNN.\nUtilities have proposed building more natural gas plants to keep electricity flowing onto a grid with increased demands from the growing number of electric vehicles and AI and data centers. Clean energy and climate groups have argued in favor of cleaner and cheaper sources of energy such as wind, solar and battery storage.\nThe possible move away from hydrogen could make it easier for the EPA to defend against potential court challenges to the plan.\nThe conservative Supreme Court and its 2022 ruling on West Virginia v. EPA has loomed large over how the agency has crafted its rules. The Supreme Court ruling significantly curtailed the EPA's ability to regulate carbon pollution at power plants by having utilities outfit their power plants with carbon capture, rather than requiring a shift from coal or natural gas-fired power to cheaper and cleaner sources like wind and solar.\nWest Virginia v. EPA has loomed large over how the agency has crafted its rules. The Supreme Court ruling significantly curtailed the EPA's ability to regulate carbon pollution at power plants by having utilities outfit their power plants with carbon capture, rather than requiring a shift from coal or natural gas-fired power to cheaper and cleaner sources like wind and solar. One of the thorny issues facing the EPA was how using hydrogen at natural gas plants would fall in the Supreme Court's narrow definition. And some environmental groups were concerned it would be tough for the federal government to ensure the hydrogen was clean, not more polluting.\nThe EPA is also considering pushing back its initial timeline requiring existing coal-fired power plants to cut or capture 90% of their planet-warming pollution using carbon capture and storage by two years to 2032, the sources said.\nThe EPA announced in February it would delay the rule-making process for carbon emissions from existing gas plants, which had initially been covered under the agency's proposal last year.\nO'Boyle said that, judging from the comments and wide disagreement from industry and environmental groups, it is very likely that EPA will face a lawsuit.\n'One thing we can all count on is that the EPA will be sued by an aggrieved party under this rule, no matter what,' O'Boyle said. 'There will be lawsuits.'\nVickie Patton, an attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund, told reporters on a Thursday call she believes the EPA's final rule will be on 'strong' legal footing.\n'They've really followed the law, and they have also a very rigorous record,' Patton said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Ella Nilsen","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1246984994.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":6.800236,"_id":"35c0431926c5858c9a6de967e57d29c5"},{"title":"Colossal prehistoric snake discovered in India","author":"Katie Hunt","published_date":"2024-04-18 21:48:10","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/18/india/giant-prehistoric-snake-india-scn/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Fossils unearthed in India revealed a prehistoric snake that may have been one of the longest to have ever lived, according to a new study.","summary":"Sign up for CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter.

However, the snake would have rivaled the largest known snake species \u2014 the extinct Titanoboa \u2014 in size.\nIdentified from fossils in Colombia, Titanoboa would have weighed 1,140 kilograms (2,500 pounds) and measured 13 meters (42.7 feet) from nose to tail tip.\nSnakes are cold-blooded and need heat from the environment to survive. Their size, therefore, depends on how warm the climate is.\n'Their internal body temperature fluctuates with the ambient temperature of the environment,' the authors said.

Boeing has faced more than five years of questions about its commercial jets following two fatal crashes of a different model, the 737 Max, in 2018 and 2019.

The deluge of water triggered the question: Was this disaster caused by the United Arab Emirates' cloud-seeding program?\nOfficials at the country's National Center of Meteorology have been cited as saying the rain was not caused by cloud seeding. CNN has reached out to the center for comment.\nBut even if the program did fly its planes through the sky leading up to the storm, it's exceedingly unlikely the efforts would have produced more rain than was going to fall naturally.\nThese understandable attempts to squeeze more moisture out of clouds have been around for decades, but with little evidence of success.\nBut that hasn't stopped some countries, including the UAE, China and the US, from trying to modify the weather.\nHere's what to know about cloud seeding.\nCloud seeding is a weather modification concept that attempts to draw more rain or snow out of a cloud than would occur naturally.\nCloud droplets don't form spontaneously. The moisture needs something to condense on \u2013 like the water that forms on the side of a cold glass on a hot day. In a cloud, so-called condensation nuclei are teeny, tiny particles in the air the moisture can grab onto.\nCloud seeding adds more of those particles to the air. Aircraft fly through existing clouds and inject the tiny particles, like silver iodide, with the goal of creating more water or ice droplets.\nRelated article Chaos in Dubai as UAE records heaviest rainfall in 75 years\nRelated article Chaos in Dubai as UAE records heaviest rainfall in 75 years In any cloud, once enough droplets merge, they become heavy and fall to the Earth as rain or snow.\nNatural tiny particles, like dust and dirt, typically serve as the driving force for clouds to condense and let go of their moisture. Silver iodide can theoretically serve the same purpose.\nIt's incredibly difficult to determine what \u2013 if any \u2013 impact cloud seeding has on precipitation. Experimentation and attempts to quantify its effectiveness have been fraught with challenges.\n'How do you know how much precipitation that might actually end up falling from that cloud occurred due to the seeding? Or how much would have fallen without the seeding?' Daniel Swain, climate scientist at UCLA, previously told CNN. 'This isn't a setting where you can do a truly controlled experiment.'\nResearchers have tried. A 2020 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, indicated one cloud seeding experiment may have produced up to 10% more precipitation than would have fallen naturally.\nBut skepticism still lingers in the scientific community.\n'There needs to be controlled studies that actually shows it was the seeding that increased the precipitation in a meaningful way,' Swain asserted.\nAs the climate continues to warm due to human-caused climate change, certain parts of the world are becoming hotter and drier. Cloud seeding could be perceived as a solution to bring more water to areas that need it, but it could also potentially make other areas drier in the process.\nWater \u2013 like any other matter \u2013 cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be transformed while moving through the closed loop of the water cycle.\n'It is possible that you're actually stealing water from someone else when you do (cloud seeding), because it may be, at least on a regional basis, a zero-sum game where if water falls out of the cloud in one spot, it's even drier by the time it makes it downwind to the next watershed,' Swain said.\nThe heavy rain that set off unprecedented flooding in the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Iran didn't just appear out of nowhere. It also didn't only affect areas that participate in cloud seeding.\nTorrential rainfall was driven by a large, slow-moving storm that traversed the Arabian Peninsula and tracked into the Gulf of Oman over the course of multiple days. This storm was able to take deep, plentiful tropical moisture located near the equator and unload it like a firehose over the region.\nRegardless of whether cloud seeding occurred, the storm was part of an extreme set up that appeared in forecast models days in advance.\nTorrential rainfall events like this will become more frequent as the atmosphere continues to warm, allowing it to soak up more moisture like a towel and to ring it out as flooding rainfall.\nCNN's Rachel Ramirez and Angela Fritz contributed to this report.\nCNN's Rachel Ramirez and Angela Fritz contributed to this report.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN Meteorologist,Mary Gilbert","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/01-gettyimages-2147875887-jpg-2.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnn","_score":6.3264227,"_id":"ec031279f4d8598a660c5610ef736a41"},{"title":"Start your week smart: Foreign aid package, surveillance bill, Memphis shooting, VW union vote, USC graduation drama","author":"Andrew Torgan","published_date":"2024-04-21 13:01:11","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/21/us/5-things-april-21-trnd","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"CNN's 5 Things brings you all the news you need to start your week smart.","summary":"The pandas are coming!

Data from hundreds of emergency departments across the country shows that 180 out of every 100,000 total visits were due to heat-related illness in 2023, compared with 151 out of every 100,000 total visits from 2018 to 2022.\nThe risks of peak heat are also becoming more extreme, with the rate of heat-related emergency department visits surging above peaks from previous years and other parts of the same warm season. In July and August of last year, there were more than 300 heat-related emergencies for every 100,000 total emergency department visits, CDC data shows. That's nearly 50% higher than the average peak rate from 2018 to 2022, and about three times higher than the rate from other warm-season months in the same year. In previous years, risk during the peak heat season was about twice as high as in other warm months in the same year.\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services considers a day to be an extreme heat day if the temperature rises above 95% of the average historical temperatures in that region. The CDC assessed trends in heat-related emergency department visits against a similar threshold.\nIn 2023, all regions of the US experienced at least one day where the rate of heat-related emergency department visits reached an extreme level, topping 95% of rates from 2018 to 2022. In a particular southern region \u2014 encompassing Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas \u2014 emergency department visits for heat-related illness reached this extreme level for more than a third of 2023's warm season, including a period of 16 consecutive days. In four southern regions, comprised of 21 states, 2023 brought more days with extreme rates of emergency department visits for heat-related illness than any other year on record.\n'Deaths and illnesses associated with heat exposure are a continuing public health concern as climate change results in longer, hotter, and more frequent episodes of extreme heat,' CDC experts wrote in a report that published Thursday. 'Near real-time monitoring of weather conditions and adverse health outcomes can guide public health practitioners' timing of risk communication and implementation of prevention measures associated with extreme heat.'\nLast August, HHS' Office of Climate Change and Health Equity in partnership with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched a dashboard that uses data from the National EMS Information System to track the rates of EMS responses to 911 calls for heat-related illness and injury. Data updates weekly with a lag of no more than two weeks, showing where states and counties fall relative to the national average and disparities by age, race, gender and urban-rural area.\n'Heat is the most lethal of all types of extreme weather and heat exposure is worsening with increasing global warming,' Dr. John Balbus, acting director of the HHS Office of Climate Change and Health Equity, said at the time. 'But existing data on heat-related deaths don't shed light on where people actually fall ill. This new dashboard makes it possible to see where the needs are greatest, plan for the future, and save lives.'\nCDC has also used data collected from health departments that participate in the National Syndromic Surveillance Program Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics (ESSENCE) to monitor heat-related health trends. In June and August, high levels of heat-related emergency department visits prompted the agency to issue public health alerts, according to Thursday's report.\nThe new CDC analysis may underestimate the prevalence of heat-related illnesses since it doesn't capture cases among people who sought treatment elsewhere, and the Covid-19 pandemic may have generally affected health care utilization patterns. Broad regional analysis may also obscure more local trends.\nUnderstanding regional trends and differences in emergency department visits for heat-related illness can help public health officials better develop and implement intervention strategies, according to the new CDC report.\n'Effective implementation of heat mitigation strategies is associated with social determinants of health,' the authors wrote, such as access to air conditioning, cooling spaces and reliable power grids.\nCertain groups are particularly susceptible to the health risks of heat waves, including children and adults with underlying health conditions, pregnant women and outdoor workers. In July, President Joe Biden asked the Department of Labor to issue a 'hazard alert' for heat and ramp up enforcement to protect workers from extreme heat.\n'For years, heat has been the number one cause of weather-related deaths in America. And workers, including farmworkers, farmers, firefighters, and construction workers, are disproportionately impacted by extreme heat,' the administration wrote in a statement \ufeff on the 'hazard alert' proposal.\n\ufeff on the 'hazard alert' proposal.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"science","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Deidre McPhillips,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1624084177.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":6.0156965,"_id":"9318e5ccca4c3e5f70bc8551f538e473"},{"title":"Camels evolved from a cold-weather ancestor.

Armadillos, giraffes and humpback whales are the current top three, but when picking a name for his tee-ball team, he suggested the Brooklyn Cockatoos.\nWhile I can't yet bring myself to tell him how many of his favorites are endangered \u2014 or how his worried dad has been collecting practical ways to survive and thrive amid so much loss and change \u2014 I can at least update his animal fables to fit the times.\n'Once upon a time, there was a camel,' I begin, after settling into the night-night chair and flipping to a picture of his old man after a ride around the Great Pyramids of Giza. I point out the splayed toes perfect for walking on sand, and eyelids seemingly custom-made to see through a sandstorm. 'It looks like they were born to live in hot places, doesn't it?'\nRiver nods.\n'Wrong!' I blurt with the zeal of discovery. 'The camel is actually from Canada! Like your mom!'\nI explain how fossils now show that for 40 million years, the so-called 'ships of the desert' were ambling over beaver dams, nibbling through boreal forests and dodging bears across North America, until a train of dromedaries wandered west over the Bering land bridge around 17,000 years ago. Somewhere along the genetic line, camels' ancestors discovered a big hump of fat used to get through cold winters can also help cross big, hot deserts.\nCamel fur turns out to be a decent sunscreen that helps with thermal regulation, those snowshoe feet perform well in sand while triple eyelids evolved in countless blizzards also work in Sudanese haboobs.\nBut these accidental advantages were just the beginning. Camels got better at closing their noses to keep out sand and lock in moisture. They learned to drink saltwater, eat toxic plants and position their bodies in the coolest possible angles to the sun.\nCamels changed everything \u2014 anatomy, physiology and behavior \u2014 to fit into their hot new climate.\nBut while they had eons to adjust, one generational tweak at a time, record-shattering heat is sending millions of species of plants and animals in search of more comfortable latitudes and elevations, some at speeds fast enough to challenge the definition of 'invasive species.'\nAnd to get my most poignant lesson in heat adaptation, I had to trade desert gear for a snowsuit, sail to the bottom of the world and hang out with penguins.\n'They were everywhere ,' I told River after returning from a reporting trip to the Antarctic Peninsula. He is happiest with nose pressed to the penguin house glass at the Central Park Zoo, so the kid sat rapt as I showed him my pics of a gentoo father diligently building a nest with his beak, one rock at a time.\neverywhere ,' I told River after returning from a reporting trip to the Antarctic Peninsula. He is happiest with nose pressed to the penguin house glass at the Central Park Zoo, so the kid sat rapt as I showed him my pics of a gentoo father diligently building a nest with his beak, one rock at a time. But then I had to figure out a way to tell him none of these babies would survive.\nPenguins need relatively dry, bare rock to nest, and after a warmer, wetter Antarctic summer dumped enough rain and snow to delay nesting season by a month, the new gentoos I'd met simply wouldn't have enough time to grow the feathers and fat needed to swim and fish the Southern Ocean over winter.\ndumped enough rain and snow to delay nesting season by a month, the new gentoos I'd met simply wouldn't have enough time to grow the feathers and fat needed to swim and fish the Southern Ocean over winter. But before I could mourn them for long, I learned the birds gathering rocks for worthless nests are the one species that happen to be surprisingly crushing Darwin's survival-of-the-fittest test.\n'Gentoo penguins are big climate change winners in the Antarctic,' Heather Lynch told me. As the endowed chair for ecology and evolution at Stony Brook University, her team had spent recent years watching as chinstrap and Ade\u0301lie penguins remained committed to ancient nesting spots, fruitlessly trying to hatch eggs in standing water with populations crashing as a result.\nConversely, the more flexible gentoo penguins keep moving farther and farther south, chasing new prey, and even abandoning nests to increase the odds of long-term survival. As a result, gentoo population numbers have exploded by as much as 30,000% in just a few years.\n'I think there's a lesson in here for us as well,' Heather Lynch said. 'If we just stick to what we've always done, it's not going to turn out well for us. Just because Manhattan has always been where it is, does it make sense that it will be there in two hundred or three hundred years? I don't know. But I think we would benefit from being flexible and adaptive. And I think that's kind of what the gentoos are telling us.'\nHere lieth the lesson of the camel and the gentoo: Heat will move us, one way or another. An overheated atmosphere and the resulting flood, drought, and storm will rearrange life on Earth, and those who can't move like the gentoo will have to adapt like the camel.\nAs northern climates way up on the 50 th parallel now experience the kind of temperatures once reserved for the tropics, folks from British Columbia to Yorkshire, England, suddenly understand why smart Arizonans keep oven mitts in the car.

Sales of air-conditioned shirts and day- or weeklong heatstroke insurance policies are booming in Japan. Seville, Spain, became the first city to start naming heat waves like hurricanes, and after they appointed a chief heat officer, Miami, Los Angeles and Phoenix soon followed suit.\nAs our kids get older, our cities will get brighter.\nWhile locals in places like Mykonos have been painting houses white for centuries, Los Angeles painted a million square feet of its heat-trapping asphalt with reflective paint. And Purdue professor Xiulin Ruan and his students supercharged the idea and discovered ways to make a white so brilliant, it can reflect up to 98 percent of sunlight back into deep space and keep a surface up to 19 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than its surroundings.\nSeville is also reviving the use of qanats and windcatchers, 1,000-year-old Persian inventions that vent enough cool air from underground canals to lower the temperature of baking streets by 10 to 15 degrees. This $5 million investment, along with a 'policy of shade' to extend awnings, tree plantings and drop-in cooling centers, is part of a specific campaign to save the cultural treasure known as charla al fresco \u2014 that delicious moment after sunset when grandmothers can pull their chairs together in courtyards for a 'cool chat.'\ncharla al fresco \u2014 that delicious moment after sunset when grandmothers can pull their chairs together in courtyards for a 'cool chat.'

In 2018, the International Energy Agency found fans and air conditioners make up 20% of the total electricity used by buildings around the world, but not a single nation places minimum energy performance standards on cooling equipment that beat the efficiency of today's readily available technology.\n'Don't let the cold out!' my dad would bellow as I left the door wide open in an urgent need to play, but both of us were clueless that our dumb energy hog was already working harder because most American air conditioners lacked a common part with the unsexy name of 'inverter.' We could control the fan speed on window units, swamp coolers, and split systems back in the day, but the cooling compressor had only two settings\u2014on and off. An inverter AC adjusts compressor speeds according to temperature and humidity, making the machine quieter and faster to cool while using 30\u201350% less juice.\nand humidity, making the machine quieter and faster to cool while using 30\u201350% less juice. While 90% of Americans enjoy air conditioning, they are outnumbered seven-to-one by people in the Global South who do not. But much the way they leapfrogged landlines with cell phones, the smartest developing markets are leaving the past in the past. The market share of inverter ACs in China exploded from 9% to 65% in a decade, thanks to government incentives and public affection, while in India, inverters were in 85% of the machines sold in 2022.\nAnd then there is the heat pump.\nThey've been around since the 1850s, but if you had quizzed me for a definition over most of my life, I would have guessed it is a dance from the seventies. Who would ever consider such a thing when in sweaty need of home cooling? But it turns out that an air conditioner is \u2014 get this \u2014 a heat pump! It just pumps it in one direction, from inside to out, the same way our refrigerator pulls the heat away from our groceries. But a heat pump goes both ways and even in subzero extremes can find enough warm air outside to keep things toasty inside at up to five times the efficiency of an electric radiator.\nIn 2023, only 16% of US homes had heat pumps, but with state and federal incentives helping cover the upfront costs, Maine blew past a goal to install 100,000 of them by 2025 two years early and are now shooting for another 175,000 by 2027.

In the popular tourist destination Dubai, flights were canceled, traffic came to a halt and schools closed.\nOne-hundred millimeters (nearly 4 inches) of rain fell over the course of just 12 hours on Tuesday, according to weather observations at the airport \u2013 around what Dubai usually records in an entire year, according to United Nations data.\nThe rain fell so heavily and so quickly that some motorists were forced to abandon their vehicles as the floodwater rose and roads turned into rivers.\nExtreme rainfall events like this are becoming more common as the atmosphere warms due to human-driven climate change. A warmer atmosphere is able to soak up more moisture like a towel and then ring it out in the form of flooding rainfall.\nThe weather conditions were associated with a larger storm system traversing the Arabian Peninsula and moving across the Gulf of Oman. This same system is also bringing unusually wet weather to nearby Oman and southeastern Iran.\nIn Oman, at least 18 were killed in flash floods triggered by heavy rain, the country's National Committee for Emergency Management said. Casualties included schoolchildren, according to Oman's state news agency.\nA 70-year-old man died after flooding swept away his vehicle in the UAE's Ras Al-Khaimah, a police statement said on Tuesday.\nThe rainfall continued to shift east Wednesday, impacting parts of southern Iran and Pakistan, areas that see little rainfall this time of year. Iran's southernmost city of Chabahar, in the Sistan and Baluchestan province, recorded 130 mm of rain.\nPeople attempting to travel by road into the center of Dubai on Wednesday were trapped on the city's highway. Some taxi drivers refused to take the commuters any further due to the blocked roads, rendering them stuck on the main artery in Dubai.\nCommuters were seen walking across the road through giant puddles, trying to find alternative methods of transportation. Some of those stuck had travelled from abroad to Dubai to attend the World Blockchain Summit, a crypto conference scheduled for early next week.\nShocking video showed the tarmac of Dubai International Airport \u2013 recently crowned the second-busiest airport in the world \u2013 underwater as massive aircraft attempt to navigate floodwaters. Large jets looked more like boats moving through the flooded airport as water sprayed in their wake and waves rippled through the deep water.\nDisruption to airport operations continued into Wednesday, after the storm had cleared, with access roads blocked by flooding and multiple airlines including flag carrier Emirates reporting flight delays. Budget airline Flydubai canceled all flights until 10 a.m. local time Wednesday.\nOn Wednesday morning, Dubai International advised people to 'NOT to come to the airport, unless absolutely necessary,' saying flights continue to be delayed and diverted.\nEmirates suspended check-in for passengers departing Dubai from 8 a.m. local time on Wednesday until midnight on Thursday due to 'operational challengers caused by bad weather and road conditions.'\nSome 134 million passengers flew through the UAE's airports last year, including 87 million traveling through Dubai International Airport alone. The UAE is home to approximately 10 million people. The UAE is a hub for five airlines.\nVideo shared on social media showed furniture flying off balconies. In the Dubai Marina, a manmade canal lined with skyscrapers and retail outlets, furniture from nearby restaurants could be seen washed away by strong currents.\nImages published in local media showed traffic gridlocked on Dubai's Sheikh Zayed Road, a 16-lane thoroughfare. Luxury cars were seen almost entirely submerged in the Business Bay district that is home to apartment buildings, offices and retail outlets. A Dubai Metro station was flooded with commuters having to wade through ankle-deep water.\nDelivery services stopped functioning and many Dubai residents were unable to leave their homes due to waterlogged streets, which cars and pedestrians couldn't access. Some residents were seen rowing canoes outside their homes, and one viral video on social media showed residents wake boarding on a flooded street in a residential area.\nOther videos from social media showed water rushing through a major shopping mall and inundating the ground floor of homes.\nAn official at the UAE's National Center of Meteorology was cited by local newspaper The National as saying that the rain was not caused by cloud seeding, putting to rest rumors that the chaos was man-made. The practice is meant to enhance rainfall in arid or semi-arid regions and entails the 'seeding' of existing clouds with substances that eventually help the clouds induce rain. The UAE has been cloud-seeding since the 1990s and has been doing it regularly over the past few years.\nLike the rest of the Persian Gulf region, Dubai has a hot and dry climate. As such, rainfall is infrequent, and the city's infrastructure often fails to handle extreme weather events.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Nadeen Ebrahim,Brandon Miller","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-04-17t090228z-1843395528-rc2887ai0vgm-rtrmadp-3-emirates-weather-2.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnn","_score":5.43875,"_id":"015cb3dc7eafa2cf05aed91e9e2d3eb1"},{"title":"At least 20 environmental protesters arrested at Massachusetts airport, police say","author":"Sarah Dewberry","published_date":"2024-04-20 19:16:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/20/us/massachusetts-hanscom-airport-protest","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"At least 20 people were arrested at a Massachusetts airport Saturday morning after protesters with Extinction Rebellion allegedly breached a security perimeter, according to local police.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 At least 20 people were arrested at a Massachusetts airport Saturday morning after protesters with Extinction Rebellion allegedly breached a security perimeter, according to local police.\nThe protesters were arrested after some allegedly trespassed on the tarmac at Hanscom Field Airport in Bedford, Massachusetts State Police spokesman Dave Procopio said.\nProcopio said those arrested could face charges including trespassing and disorderly conduct.\nAccording to an Extinction Rebellion Boston news release, the group gathered Saturday 'to protest the proposed expansion of 17 new private jet hangars' at the small airport approximately 20 miles northwest of Boston. The climate activism organization said they condemn 'new fossil fuel infrastructure that will be in operation for decades, preventing us from achieving decarbonization and threatening us with runaway global heating and an uninhabitable Earth.'\nThe group added protesters disrupted flights at the airport 'in a peaceful, non-violent, non-destructive act of civil disobedience.'\nCNN has reached out to the Massachusetts Port Authority but has yet to hear back.\nOn its Facebook page, the Bedford Police Department said they were called upon to assist Hanscom personnel and Massachusetts State Police 'in response to reports of numerous disruptive protesters and trespassers.'\nThe police department added the community did not appear to be in any danger in connection with the protest.\nExtinction Rebellion has previously staged protests at the same airport, according to their news release.

New projects are being announced, and perhaps most significantly, states are actually signing up to purchase the clean power generated by future ocean-based wind farms.\n'There's a lot of momentum in the industry right now,' said Sam Huntington, director of S&P Global Commodity Insights' North American power team. 'We're past the nadir of the industry's troubles.'\nOffshore wind is on much more stable footing than it was last year, but some analysts aren't ready to declare it a boom. The industry is still in its infancy in the US and plagued by many of the same problems as last year \u2013 high interest rates and long wait times for components like turbine blades, generators and towers.\nAnd former President Donald Trump \u2013 a man with a long disdain for wind power \u2013 is seeking a return to the White House in 2025. Trump castigated wind as costing 'a fortune' and the 'most expensive energy' at a Wisconsin rally in April and called wind turbines 'a bird cemetery' at a December event.\nBut offshore wind is increasingly Trump-proof, according to a top White House climate official, wind CEOs and an industry analyst. Too much progress has been made to be fully undone by a second Trump administration.\nStill, White House national climate adviser Ali Zaidi warned that for the industry to mature and be successful, it needs a friendly administration willing to push it along.\n'The steel that's in the ground, that's not going to get pulled out, that's irreversible,' Zaidi told CNN. 'But if we want to go from startup to runaway success, we've got more work to do, and that's going to have to happen as a partnership between the federal government, state government and the private sector.'\nThe Biden administration set an ambitious goal for offshore wind energy: to deploy 30 gigawatts by 2030.\nZaidi is 'very confident' they will meet the target. But industry analysts aren't so sure.\n'We're not bullish,' Huntington said. 'Our latest forecast has them getting about half of that \u2013 15 gigawatts. Unless a lot of projects get approved, and Europe gives us a whole bunch of installation vessels, I don't see how we're ramping up to that.'\nThe administration recently has approved enough projects to eventually get 10 gigawatts of power on the grid, enough to power nearly 4 million homes. And the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management plans to hold up to four lease sales this year, including ones in the Gulf of Maine and off the coast of Oregon, which are likely contenders for the massive floating turbines industry experts say the world should be moving toward.\n'This year will be a significant year for offshore wind development,' BOEM director Elizabeth Klein told CNN in a statement. 'This progress is further proof that America's clean energy transition is not a dream for a distant future \u2013 it's happening right here and now.'\nStill, it will take years for those approved projects to come online, a timeline Huntington and offshore wind CEOs say speaks to the continuing challenges US projects face. Permitting a single project can still take years because of the multiple federal, state and local hoops developers must jump through.\nOrdering equipment is another challenge. The US supply chain for offshore wind is still being built; therefore, projects are turning to European manufacturers to get blades, gearboxes, and other components.\n'There's really only three suppliers that are serving the US market' for wind turbines and the high-capacity electric cables that carry electricity back to shore, said Clint Plummer, head of New York-based company Rise Light & Power, who was formerly at Danish wind giant \u00d8rsted. 'And their lead times seem to continue to get longer.'\nCompounding the problem is the fact that the US industry is so underdeveloped compared to Europe and Asia, pushing US projects to the back of the line.\n'Because the US is more nascent in the development of our industry than either of those two mega markets, it simply means that we have less influence than those other regions in being able to get the attention of the manufacturers,' Plummer said.\nDespite persistent headwinds, the biggest change over the past year has been that the Northeast is signing up for the electricity wind farms will generate.\nThere's a simple explanation for that: New England and Northeast states want to make their own energy, according to Pedro Azagra Bl\u00e1zquez, the CEO of offshore wind company Avangrid, which is developing wind farms off the coasts of Massachusetts and New York.\n'For many years, there has been no (power) generation being built,' Bl\u00e1zquez told CNN. Now, he said, Northeast governors 'just want to make sure their states have energy.'\nNew York has been aggressively pursuing offshore wind projects, rebidding previously canceled projects and accepting those projects at higher prices.\n'The fact that that these projects that were in so much trouble were rebid and accepted at higher prices was a really positive sign for the industry,' Huntington said. But it will also mean electricity from wind will initially come at a higher cost, given supply-chain constraints and high interest rates.\nBl\u00e1zquez and Plummer give the Biden administration high marks for setting an ambitious goal for offshore wind and trying to ease federal permitting for the projects. But they're also not overly worried about what a Trump administration could mean for the industry.\n'Our obligation is to work well with any administration, because what is clear is these investments bring economic development, they bring jobs,' Bl\u00e1zquez said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ella Nilsen,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1850000181.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":5.2533836,"_id":"bc5409a5347f63266208d1ae5b283b09"},{"title":"Opinion: Why gardens and poems rhyme","author":"Tess Taylor","published_date":"2024-04-22 08:41:27","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/22/opinions/earth-day-national-poetry-month-taylor","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Against a tide of weariness, I have two pieces of advice on this Earth Day, embedded in National Poetry Month: start a garden, and read or write a poem, writes Tess Taylor.","summary":"Editor's Note: Tess Taylor is the author of five collections of poetry, including 'Work & Days' and 'Rift Zone.' She is the editor of the anthology 'Leaning Toward Light: Poems for Gardens & the Hands That Tend Them.' The views expressed here are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.\nCNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 On a recent morning, unearthing our postage-stamp front yard garden from a second winter of atmospheric rivers, I saw one monarch butterfly amid our plum blossoms \u2014 a rare sight in a year when monarch populations are at an all-time low.\nI'd gone out to rake leaves, lay compost and weed the artichokes we grow on the strip between the sidewalk and the street. I'd been a bit impatient, grumpy even, hacking away. I also discovered that the rhubarb is coming back, that the tree collards are up; that our woody Thai basil wintered over. I discovered that some shiso, which a kind neighbor offered me last spring, and which seemed a failed experiment by fall, had only been fooling me \u2014 it is not only not dead, it now has 10 new sprouts.\nBy the time the butterfly came by, I found that I was quite still, delighting in its presence, imagining those fragile wings on their long, difficult migration. I came inside feeling grateful to have unearthed both the texture of my own heart and of the day. I felt more able to settle into my other work, which is writing, and particularly writing poems.\nIn an often-furious world, I come to gardens and poems because in dense quick space, they reroute me, surprise me and remind me of the joy of savoring life on our fragile, complicated, endangered planet. This year, particularly, I've been meditating on the fact that gardens and poems share critical, linked invitations.\nBoth offer us space to acknowledge the beauty and complex grief, of say, seeing one lone butterfly fly through a rapidly changing climate, to remember our interconnection and hunger for beauty, even as we face down a present that's full of violence, intolerance, war. Each process can be a small but still practical place of re-routing, in the midst of political fury and climate grief. In fact, against a tide of weariness, fear or despair, I have two small pieces of advice on this Earth Day, embedded in National Poetry Month: start a garden, (even one plant!), and read or write a poem.\nRelated article Opinion: What threatens my \u2018city in the forest'\nRelated article Opinion: What threatens my \u2018city in the forest' Why? Because in the face of all that seems intractable, ugly and downright depressing about our struggles to coexist justly with one another, gardens and poems each build ecosystems of nourishment and possibility, what English poet Andrew Marvell called green shade. Gardens and poems remind us how to admire, steward and participate in our own lives and in the life of the planet, even a planet it seems we've irrevocably damaged.\nAndrew Marvell called green shade. Gardens and poems remind us how to admire, steward and participate in our own lives and in the life of the planet, even a planet it seems we've irrevocably damaged. And because even as the planet warms, gardens and poems help cool us off, practically and emotionally. As we undertake the work of bringing the world's temperature to some safer margin, and as we try to imagine how to work toward compassion and repair in our human relationships, the green shade of a garden and the rich words of a poem can offer models of gracefulness, surprise, and imaginative possibility. They are places to practice listening to others in the human and nonhuman world. They remind us of the beings with whom we share oxygen, water, light. These oases help us to root in place and time, to attune to possibility \u2014 one grosbeak, one stanza, one endangered butterfly at a time.\nI don't think I'm overstating the case to say that time spent with poems and gardens build pathways that actually repair us. Gardens are centers for diversity \u2014 they build abundant community from the soil up. Diverse microbes of healthy soil absorb more carbon than depleted soil. From that soil up, gardens invite in other life in diverse webs as well: I'll never forget when a visiting entomologist at the Warren St. Marks Community Garden in Brooklyn said that the garden, on the reclaimed site of two fallen Brooklyn brownstones, supported 42 species of pollinators, while other Brooklyn blocks only had 2 or 3.\nWe are desperately in need of these oases of pollinators. For one thing, this type of outer diversity nourishes our neural pathways. Even five minutes with a tree or flower helps people regulate stress, to emerge rested and curious and compassionate while facing the world around them. This space compounds its benefits: Our community garden in Brooklyn supported a diversity of human gardeners as well, people who would walk home from a day harvesting tomatoes, bestowing a few on their neighbors.\nIn their own small plots, poems build diverse networks as well: Sinking into the rhythms and pleasures of literature stimulates the parts of our brains attuned to empathy, helping us build attention, kindness, compassion, regard. Engaging poems (and taking part in the arts generally) has practical benefit at a wider community level: A critical study by the National Endowment for the Arts found that people with longitudinal engagement with the arts were more likely to vote, more likely to be leaders in their community, more likely to graduate high school, and more likely to have friends across racial or ethnic lines.\nAll of this to say: people reading poems, people practicing and admiring art, people engaging in acts of art, are more likely to be wise and tolerant citizens, fostering diverse community. The arts foster civic health. Artists are pollinators, too.\nThis Earth Month and National Poetry Month, I wonder if there can be a wider way to extend and build our spaces of patience, curiosity, attentiveness and care \u2014 in our own daily practices, our front yards, our morning meditations, our cities. How can we weave just a few more poems, a few more green spaces in?\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook I have often imagined riding through urban spaces, finding huge parking lots and putting up signs that read, 'Why isn't this a garden yet?' What if our cities were full of community gardens with free or low-cost arts programming in them? How might these spaces enrich us all as we face down the climate crisis, the empathy crisis, the hunger crisis, the loneliness crisis?\nIn some ways, such a world seems far off, but in other ways, it's the kind of existence we have to dream aloud, to name, to make way for. We have to believe in these possible ecosystems of repair in order to work to widen them. It's the kind of world I think my fellow gardeners imagine often, one my fellow poets help us dream up too. 'I dwell in possibility' wrote Emily Dickinson. Gardens and poems invite that kind of dwelling. As spaces that embody richness, and point towards what might yet be, poems and gardens help us imagine the possible, a bit more richly, a bit more carefully, and (I imagine) more hopefully, as well.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Opinion Tess Taylor,Tess Taylor","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1324231917.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@CNNOpinions","_score":5.0897665,"_id":"6ccf0d7fdc8503b0404297edd03952da"},{"title":"5 ways to add joy into your meals","author":"Andrea Kane","published_date":"2024-04-19 16:02:57","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/19/health/joy-food-diet-weight-wellness","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Weight and eating habits are deeply intertwined. How do you strike a balance between eating for weight, eating for fuel and eating for pleasure? Here are five tips.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 In this season of the podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent has explored the topic of weight: what it really tells you about your health, why it's so hard to lose, how the new diet drugs work and its links to menopause (you can listen to the episodes here).\nWhether you are happy with your size or not, whether you follow a special diet or eat what you want when you want, the basic fact of life \u2014 unavoidable, inescapable, non-negotiable \u2014 is that we all have to eat. If we are fortunate, it's usually up to five times a day, every day.\nHow you choose to nourish yourself can make a big difference in how you feel, not only in your body, but about yourself and the world around you.\n'I had this babysitter who was a chronic dieter,' Dr. Linda Shiue, an internal medicine physician and trained chef, told Gupta on the podcast recently. 'She would eat this colorless, aroma-less food and she was sad all the time.'\nThat is not Shiue's style. She is the first director of culinary medicine at Kaiser Permanente San Francisco. That's where she founded Thrive Kitchen, a teaching kitchen for patients, so she could do more than just hand out prescriptions for chronic conditions.\nShe wanted to create a place where she could teach her patients to make healthy food taste good. 'They think it's deprivation and, you know, loss of joy and kind of penance even,' said Shiue, who is also the author of 'Spicebox Kitchen: Eat Well and Be Healthy with Globally Inspired, Vegetable-Forward Recipe.' 'It's colorless, it's bland, it has no texture, it has no flavor and \u2014 we're not supposed to enjoy it.'\nSimilar to her cookbook, Shiue's classes show patients how to use spices and herbs to flavor seasonal cuisine while following an eating pattern that supports health.\n'As a food lover since birth, and a physician who has seen the negative effects of chronic dieting, I encourage people to reframe their relationship to food as a source of pleasure, cultural connection and well-being, regardless of weight. This can be a hard task given the pro-diet messaging that surrounds us,' Shiue said in an email.\nWhat can you do to break out of the diet mindset and really enjoy your food? Shiue has five tips.\nFood isn't intrinsically good or evil, so there is no need to feel bad about food choices.\n'Many of us have experienced shame or guilt around food, and a lot of that is a product of our culture and what the food industry has taught us and what the fashion and whole dieting industries have created,' Shiue said.\n'Even though we, as an individual, may not even think that we care that much about that message, it's reached all of us \u2014 it's in all of our subconscious,' she said. 'I think that most people at some point feel like, \u2018Oh, I shouldn't eat that. That's bad for me. It might affect my weight.''\nShiue wants to help people learn how to stop thinking that way. 'There's no room for shame on the plate,' she said, choosing her language around food carefully.\n'In diet culture, people talk about \u2018cheat' days (but) I prefer to celebrate \u2018treat' days. Everything in moderation, and that means there is room for the occasional indulgence,' she said.\nRestrictive diets are counterproductive because most of us won't be able to stick to them perfectly and forever.\n'(S)tudy after study has proven that the best eating plan is the one which any given individual can stick with \u2014 a sustainable lifestyle change,' Shiue said.\n'Rather than restricting, add more of the foods (that) science shows us are better for our health: lots of plants, legumes and whole grains. This will improve your health even if (you) aren't eating \u2018perfectly' all the time, and even if you don't lose weight,' she said.\naren't eating \u2018perfectly' all the time, and even if you don't lose weight,' she said. Shiue admitted to not eating perfectly all the time and having a sweet tooth; she said she allows herself to enjoy her favorite treats \u2014 just not all the time.\nListen to your body Eat intuitively.\n'That means several things,' said Shiue said. 'First, are you actually hungry, or are you feeding an emotional need, such as anxiety, sadness, or fatigue?\n'How does the food make you feel after you eat? Do you feel comfortably full, or are you feeling stuffed? How is your energy level after eating?' she said. 'When you pay attention to these feelings, your body will guide you to making the healthiest food choices for you.'\nAlso, eat mindfully, which Shiue said does not mean meditating over your food.\n'It means when you're eating your food, just focus on the pleasure of that,' she said. 'Eat slowly. Chew your food. \u2026 Also pay attention to when you've had enough.'\nHealthy diets can come from a variety of ethnicities and customs, and they can contain a cornucopia of flavors and ingredients.\n'A lot of people were taught that quote-unquote \u2018cultural food' \u2026 is not healthy,' Shiue said. 'People are told, \u2018Oh no, no: The food that you eat, that's why you have diabetes. You have to eat this kind of standard, healthy American diet.''\nwhy you have diabetes. You have to eat this kind of standard, healthy American diet.'' But she said that many people from different backgrounds either don't want to switch diets, or they don't know how or it just doesn't work out \u2014 and, Shiue said, they really don't have to.\n'The traditional diet of every culture contains healthy foods, and should be celebrated, with pleasure,' she said.\nRemind yourself that food is more than a way to simply stay alive.\n'Nutrition and sustenance \u2014 that's only one small part of food,' Shiue said. 'Food is, for me, mainly pleasure. It's a connection to myself, to my loved ones, to my culture.'\nShe added food is also an expression of love and caring.\n'Enjoy your food,' she said.\nWe hope these five tips help you enjoy your meals and release the guilt.

'So far, this year, we have seen cases peak in the south, and we would now expect an increase in cases in the north.'\nThe rise of dengue can be attributed to several factors, PAHO says, including rising temperatures, extreme weather events, rapid population growth, and inadequate water and sanitation services, which can create mosquito breeding sites.\nSo far in 2024, the Americas have reported 1,858 deaths from the illness, less than last year's total of 2,418.\nA vaccine for dengue is available and can play a role in reducing severe cases and deaths, Barbosa said, but he warned it is not capable of immediately interrupting outbreaks.\nTo try to control the outbreak, PAHO recommends implementing a strategy that focuses on surveillance, control of the mosquito vector that transmits the virus and clinical management, Baldwin said.\n'While there is currently no specific treatment for dengue (at any clinical stage), most cases are mild.

'Virtually every waterway is polluted to an extent where the ecosystem just can't balance back anymore,' he explains. Aquaai is aiming to fill that information gap using fishlike drones that collect data from underwater environments. Powered by batteries, they are designed to look and swim like fish, with a body and tail that swish from side-to-side as they cruise through the water. With their orange, white, and black neoprene skin, they resemble the clownfish star of the 2003 hit movie 'Finding Nemo.'\nThe standard version is about 4 feet long (1.3 meters) and weighs 65 pounds (30 kilograms) and can be equipped with cameras and sensors to measure metrics like oxygen, salinity and pH levels.\nPieterkosky, who has a background in animatronics for horror movies, was motivated to build the robots after his eight-year-old daughter learned about the ocean crisis and asked him to help protect the seas.

The company has put its technology to use in California, where it was founded, and in Norway, where it has a subsidiary. It has operated in both fresh and saltwater, near dams, and in harbors and fish farms, checking things like water quality and fish health. Many fish farms use fixed sensors to monitor water quality, but CEO and co-founder Liane Thompson says this can be inefficient in giant pens, where fish might gather away from the sensors; instead Aquaai's robots swim alongside the fish, collecting data wherever they go.\nThe technology could also find a use in the Middle East, a region that is battling water scarcity. The Middle East and North Africa is home to just 1% of the world's freshwater resources, and many countries are depleting water from underground reservoirs, largely to irrigate farmland.\nThompson and Pieterkosky, who are married, have re-located to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, and last October, Aquaai was accepted into a 'company building' program at Abu Dhabi's tech ecosystem Hub71.\nThompson says its technology could be used in the region for water management, sustainable aquaculture operations, detecting derelict fishing gear and monitoring the health of corals.

It has raised about $1.6 million in funding, but has been mostly relying on a few venture capital firms, an angel investor, family offices, a strategic corporate investor and paid trials.

The redesign is the company's latest effort to reduce the environmental impacts from its cups, which have been criticized for piling up waste.\nThe new cups were developed internally at Starbucks as part of its ongoing sustainability efforts to reduce its waste and carbon output in half by 2030. Similar to other large companies, the chain wants to cut down on its reliance on plastic because the material is mostly made from polymers created from dangerous fossil fuels.\nThe new cups will debut at select US and Canada locations this year, with the full rollout expected to be complete by spring 2025.\nIn addition to using less plastic for the cups themselves \u2014 Starbucks projects the new cups will save more than 13.5 million pounds of plastic going to landfills annually \u2014 it is 'projected to reduce emissions and conserve water in the production process,' the chain said.\nStarbucks said it conducted tests with baristas and customers to ensure the changeover doesn't reduce the cups' sturdiness or ability to keep drinks cold.\nSlight design tweaks includes the addition of new accessibility features, including black and white 'fill lines' that allows for contrast against light and dark-colored drinks.\nAnother change is that tall, grande and venti cups now use the same-sized lid; in the past, the tall cup used its own lid and grande and venti cups shared the same one.\nFor employees, that will cut down on clutter and save time finding the correct lid. Starbucks also said that it added embossed letters on the bottom of the cup, so 'baristas can quickly confirm what size they're grabbing during a busy rush when all the cups are stacked upside down.'\nStarbucks notes its largest trenta size, which holds 31 ounces, will still use a different lid size.\nCups \u2014 and the waste they create \u2014 have long been a major issue for Starbucks.\nIn January, the chain expanded the way customers can have their drinks filled with their own cups by adding option to drive-thru and app orders.\nOther sustainable ideas Starbucks have tried included experimenting with a borrow-a-cup program, in which customers pay a deposit for a durable cup that they take with them and drop back off after use.\nIn a test location in Seattle in 2021, customers paid a $1 deposit and had to return the recyclable cup to a smart bin located in the store to get their dollar back. The company has tested similar pilot programs in Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom.\nStill, these tests and changes aren't enough to solve the 'plastic crisis,' according to Emma Priestland, global corporate campaigns coordinator for Break Free from Plastic.\n'While the world urgently needs to cut plastic production for the sake of the climate, from the perspective of waste management and the amount of plastic pollution entering the environment, simply reducing the amount of plastic but keeping the same number of plastic items is a false solution,' she told CNN.\nPriestland suggests that Starbucks develop reusable and returnable on-the-go cups to help them fully achieve their sustainability goals.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"food","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Jordan Valinsky","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cold-cup-lineup-with-lids.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNbusiness","_score":4.7785416,"_id":"953c06cc5606cf40457b403cb0aa8357"},{"title":"Hyundai is the latest brand to pause advertising on X due to antisemitism","author":"Ramishah Maruf","published_date":"2024-04-19 00:21:39","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/18/business/hyundai-pause-advertising-x-antisemitism","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Automaker Hyundai said it has paused its advertising on X, a day after an ad from the company appeared next to an antisemitic and pro-Hitler post on the social media site.","summary":"Hyundai said on Thursday it paused advertising on X, formerly known as Twitter, a day after an ad from the automaker reportedly appeared adjacent to an antisemitic and pro-Hitler post on the social media site.\nOn Wednesday, user Nancy Levine Stearns posted screenshots of a paid Hyundai ad above an antisemitic post from a verified 'premium' account.

Kate's cancer was found in tests following an abdominal surgery in January.\nThe revelation followed weeks of speculation over her whereabouts and bizarre conspiracy theories circulating online.\nWilliam started his engagements on Thursday by visiting Surplus to Supper, a food redistribution organization where he met with volunteers and helped load vans with food to dispense to local groups.\nHe also chatted with chefs on how they are bridging the gap between food waste and food poverty while donning an apron and pitching in with the preparation of meals.\nWhile in the kitchen, one volunteer gave the prince several get well cards for his wife and father, King Charles III, who also revealed in February that he was getting treatment for an unspecified form of cancer.\nLater, he is due to visit a youth center that benefits from the Surplus to Supper's work.\nKensington Palace said his visits aimed 'to spotlight the community and environmental impact organisations in the area are having through their work.'\nThe palace added: 'Reducing food waste has a considerable number of environmental benefits, including reducing emissions from landfill that contribute to climate change.'\nThe prince's last official engagement was in March 19 when he visited the English city of Sheffield for his Homewards homelessness project.

Himalayas, the people of a remote northern Indian territory fear their way of life is under threat from the changing climate, looming development \u2013 and border tensions with China.\nAt stake, they believe, is the future of Ladakh, one of the world's highest elevation regions, where indigenous tribes maintain nomadic traditions on sprawling plains hemmed in by mountains punctuated by Buddhist monasteries.\nFor years, Lopzang Dadul herded his yaks, sheep and goats across the vast, vertiginous landscape near India's contested border with China, following the seasons to find grazing land.\nBut now, Dadul says, shepherds are being barred by the Indian military from lands that for generations sustained Ladakh's nomadic way of life \u2013 a situation he and others say has worsened following a deadly 2020 border clash between Chinese and Indian soldiers.\n'In India, the army is not letting us go to places which they call no-man's land \u2026 civilians are not allowed to go there anymore,' says Dadul, 33, a father of two from the village of Phobrang.\n'If we do not get enough land we will have to sell our livestock \u2026 and look for another option.'\nLadakh's herders inhabit what is now a highly strategically sensitive area, where India's contested 2,100-mile (3,379-kilometer) boundary with China has for decades been a source of friction between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.\n'A lot of these grazing lands are in contested areas between India and China, and (after the 2020 clash) these grazing lands have now been denied to the locals, because they have been brought as part of buffer zones between India and China,' according to Sushant Singh, a senior fellow at the Indian think tank Centre for Policy Research.\nBoth India and China maintain a significant military presence along their de facto border, known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which has never been clearly defined and has remained a source of friction since a 1962 Sino-Indian border war.\nFour years ago, border tensions broke out into the open when a clash in Ladakh-Aksai Chin brought the first known fatalities in conflict between the two countries in more than four decades \u2013 with at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers killed.\nThe violence was followed by a process of disengagement, the creation of buffer zones and ongoing border talks \u2013 but the situation remains tense and neither India nor China have publicly specified where the zones are, making for a murky reality on the ground.\nFor that reason, the location of some of those zones may 'not be clear to the local people,' said Manoj Joshi, a distinguished fellow at the New Delhi think tank Observer Research Foundation.\nThe movement of herders is seen as sensitive because both countries have in the past used their presence in an area to assert military control over it, said Singh.\n'First graziers go, then you pitch up tents, and then your soldiers reach and then you say \u2018this is our area,'' he said, noting why India is blocking them from entering these zones.\nKonchok Stanzin, 37, a councilor in Ladakh's Chushul constituency, which encompasses four border villages, says such restrictions have impacted herders' access to land.\n'Rezeng La, Mukhpari, Black Top, Helmet Top and Gurung Hill. All these areas are winter grazing areas of Chushul village. Now people find it very difficult to go there. These areas are now no-man's land,' said Stanzin, who has been raising awareness about these issues since 2020.\nBut those interviewed by CNN also point to what they say is the impact of Chinese encroachment and changes to the control of contested lands over time, including from the 2020 clash.\nChinese encroachment and changes to the control of contested lands over time, including from the 2020 clash. 'We know the reality, we know the ground situation. If the (Indian) government says we have not lost an inch of land, then whatever we have lost is already lost,' said Stanzin.\nDadul in Phobrang said the 'Chinese are coming toward us constantly. They have been crossing the line and coming in,' he said. 'China is capturing the land, the Indian government is saying nothing is lost, the (Indian) Army is not letting us go there.'\nCNN was unable to independently confirm the status of the restricted land described in this report, nor claims of Chinese encroachment or loss of Indian territorial control after the 2020 clash.\nIn a statement, India's Ministry of Defense told CNN: 'No Indian territory has been lost during the standoff. Negotiations are currently underway for disengagement at the remaining friction points.'\nOn the buffer zones, the ministry said: 'all disengagements achieved till date have been based on the principle of Mutual and Equal Security. Currently, a mutually agreed moratorium exists on military activities from both sides in areas where disengagement has been affected, to maintain peace and tranquility.'\nThe 'number of Indian graziers and livestock in traditional grazing areas has seen a sharp rise' after the events of 2020, the ministry's statement added. 'There has thus been no adverse impact on the livelihood of locals in the area.'\nChina's Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\nMounting concern over threats to the way of life in Ladakh \u2013 from lost grazing lands to climate change and industrialization \u2013 have driven thousands from across the region to its joint capital city of Leh in recent weeks to demand greater rights ahead of India's general election, which begins Friday.\nThere, some 3,500 meters (11,550 feet) above sea level, residents are calling for Indian statehood for Ladakh to ensure political representation, as well as inclusion in the national constitution's Sixth Schedule, which grants special rights to tribal areas. Organizers say at least 10,000 people turned out during a single day in Leh last month to support the start of an ongoing, weekslong hunger strike.\nLadakh lost special controls over its land in 2019, following a controversial move by the Indian central government that stripped the former state of Jammu and Kashmir of its statehood and broke off Ladakh, which had been a part of it, into a separate territory.\nThe change placed the region under the direct control of India's central government, which critics say has pared back national environmental protections and backed ecologically harmful infrastructure development pushes in other sensitive parts of the country in recent years.\nChina doesn't recognize what its Foreign Ministry has called the 'so-called union territory of Ladakh,' saying the 'western section of the China-India border has always belonged to China.' In addition to China, the territory of Ladakh also shares a disputed border with Pakistan, another neighbor with which Delhi has fraught relations.\nNow many in Ladakh are concerned about the potential damage of future New Delhi-backed industrial projects, or that an influx of people moving in could shift the largely tribal demography.\n'Only local people will think about the next few generations, (others will) \u2026 make mistakes at best and sell off the place at worst,' said Sonam Wangchuk, an activist and educator widely known across India, who is leading the hunger strike to draw attention to environmental threats facing Ladakh.\nSpeaking to CNN during the 19th day of a 21-day fast last month, Wangchuk said in a steady but weakened voice that without protections and representation, 'we will have no control on how to secure these mountains.'\nHe pointed to plans for a solar plant and the potential for more environmentally damaging industry to follow.\nThe activism has faced pressure from local authorities.\nEarlier this month, Wangchuk and other civil society leaders called off a planned peaceful march toward the border they said was meant to reveal grazing lands lost to Chinese encroachment, after local authorities banned unauthorized gatherings and temporarily slowed internet speeds, citing an 'apprehension of breach of peace.'\nCNN has reached out to Leh's district magistrate and local police for comment.\nSome, like the Ladakh president of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), say protections on land, jobs and culture in Ladakh could be granted through other means, which local leaders have rejected. He also suggested the border dispute is a factor in why other demands won't be met.\n'We are with the border with China and Pakistan. How can a sensitive (place) like Ladakh just be turned into a state immediately?' the local party leader, Phunchok Stanzin, told CNN.\nThe nomadic traditions of shepherd communities living off the land and selling goats' wool to be spun into luxurious Pashmina had already been diminishing in Ladakh in recent decades.\nA tourism boom and the impacts of climate change \u2013 as receding glaciers and other impacts drive flash floods, drought and reduced snowfall \u2013 are among factors shifting how some families make their livings.\nNamgail Phonchok, 51, whose village lies south of the piercing blue waters of Pangong Lake that stretches from India into China, fears his children won't be able to continue their way of life \u2013 including due to access restrictions on grazing lands.\n'When they won't let us graze, then we will sell our animals. We do not know what other job to get, and our own work will also go, then what will we do?' he said, adding that 'if big industries come here then the environment will get ruined completely.'\nBetween longer-term changes and new restrictions on grazing lands, 'our nomadic way of life is going away,' Phonchok said.\nDadul, in Phobrang, has seen those changes too.\nHe says 60 of the 113 households in his village used to be nomadic; now only 10 are maintaining the tradition due to those factors and lost grazing lands.\n'Nomadic way of life is a very rare thing in India. In one home you have yaks, sheep, goats, horses and other livestock \u2026 yaks are meant for transportation and milk, cheese and butter, and the goats give Pashmina. This is the actual eco-friendly and sustainable way of life,' he said.\n'When the army steps back from the real border, this effect spills over to the village \u2026 and the movement of the nomadic tribes is restricted,' he added.\nNew Delhi has denied that its border tensions with China are impacting the lives of the shepherds there.\nAnd Prime Minister Narendra Modi \u2013 India's Hindu nationalist leader, who is widely expected to win a rare third term in the upcoming election \u2013 has tread cautiously around the border issue, claiming in the wake of the June 2020 border clash that 'no one has intruded' into Indian territory.\nModi's comments appeared to contradict his own foreign minister, who said the violence began after 'the Chinese side sought to erect a structure in Galwan valley on our side of the LAC.' Beijing at the time said, 'none of the responsibility lies with China,' blaming Indian troops for 'starting provocations' and crossing the de facto border.\nNew Delhi says two sites remain contested along the Ladakh border after disengagement at other contested zones following the 2020 clash. Observers believe Chinese forces are blocking Indian patrols in those contested areas where they previously had access.\nAt the points where there has been disengagement, the establishment of buffer zones means 'both sides have pulled back by mutual agreement and neither side patrols there,' as opposed to earlier, when troops could patrol up to their claim, according to Joshi in New Delhi.\nNew Delhi's official response \u2013 and the lack of transparency over buffer zones \u2013 has fueled domestic debate about India's position on the border.\nA report from a Ladakh police superintendent released in 2023 further stoked concerns \u2013 detailing how Indian forces lost their presence in 26 of 65 patrol points over an unspecified period. Reduced patrolling led to an ultimate loss of control over such areas, where China grabs land 'inch-by-inch,' the report said.\nThe report also accused China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) of having 'taken advantage' of the buffer areas established in the de-escalation talks by objecting to Indian forces' movement in the buffer zone and asking for further pushback.\nIt noted: 'Much restrictions on the movement of civilians and grazers near the forward areas on the Indian side, indicating their \u2018play safe' strategy that they do not want to annoy the PLA by giving them the chance to raise objections on the areas being claimed as disputed.'\nA copy was posted online by Indian magazine The Caravan alongside a report from Singh, from the Centre for Policy Research.\nSingh, who is also a lecturer at Yale University, suggested the lack of clarity on the border situation may stem from Modi's concerns over Chinese military superiority \u2013 and tarnishing his government's image.\nIf Modi's strongly nationalist government were to acknowledge loss of territorial control, 'it would be very difficult for him to then not take some aggressive action to regain that lost territory,' he said.\n'Then the risk of escalation would be very high and, in that escalation, I think Mr. Modi's government fears that they could be humiliated \u2013 that they could lose to China.'\nBut some from Ladakh argue that the sensitivity of the region, both environmentally and strategically, is the very reason to allow the local people more control over the land \u2013 including access around the border.\n'The shepherd is going to the mountain and protecting it every day,' said Dadul, the shepherd from Phobrang.\n'If the real protectors are brought to the borders and allowed to stay there,

the Himalayas, the people of a remote northern Indian territory fear their way of life is under threat from the changing climate, looming development \u2013 and border tensions with China.\nAt stake, they believe, is the future of Ladakh, one of the world's highest elevation regions, where indigenous tribes maintain nomadic traditions on sprawling plains hemmed in by mountains punctuated by Buddhist monasteries.\nFor years, Lopzang Dadul herded his yaks, sheep and goats across the vast, vertiginous landscape near India's contested border with China, following the seasons to find grazing land.\nBut now, Dadul says, shepherds are being barred by the Indian military from lands that for generations sustained Ladakh's nomadic way of life \u2013 a situation he and others say has worsened following a deadly 2020 border clash between Chinese and Indian soldiers.\n'In India, the army is not letting us go to places which they call no-man's land \u2026 civilians are not allowed to go there anymore,' says Dadul, 33, a father of two from the village of Phobrang.\n'If we do not get enough land we will have to sell our livestock \u2026 and look for another option.'\nLadakh's herders inhabit what is now a highly strategically sensitive area, where India's contested 2,100-mile (3,379-kilometer) boundary with China has for decades been a source of friction between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.\n'A lot of these grazing lands are in contested areas between India and China, and (after the 2020 clash) these grazing lands have now been denied to the locals, because they have been brought as part of buffer zones between India and China,' according to Sushant Singh, a senior fellow at the Indian think tank Centre for Policy Research.\nBoth India and China maintain a significant military presence along their de facto border, known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which has never been clearly defined and has remained a source of friction since a 1962 Sino-Indian border war.\nFour years ago, border tensions broke out into the open when a clash in Ladakh-Aksai Chin brought the first known fatalities in conflict between the two countries in more than four decades \u2013 with at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers killed.\nThe violence was followed by a process of disengagement, the creation of buffer zones and ongoing border talks \u2013 but the situation remains tense and neither India nor China have publicly specified where the zones are, making for a murky reality on the ground.\nFor that reason, the location of some of those zones may 'not be clear to the local people,' said Manoj Joshi, a distinguished fellow at the New Delhi think tank Observer Research Foundation.\nThe movement of herders is seen as sensitive because both countries have in the past used their presence in an area to assert military control over it, said Singh.\n'First graziers go, then you pitch up tents, and then your soldiers reach and then you say \u2018this is our area,'' he said, noting why India is blocking them from entering these zones.\nKonchok Stanzin, 37, a councilor in Ladakh's Chushul constituency, which encompasses four border villages, says such restrictions have impacted herders' access to land.\n'Rezeng La, Mukhpari, Black Top, Helmet Top and Gurung Hill. All these areas are winter grazing areas of Chushul village. Now people find it very difficult to go there. These areas are now no-man's land,' said Stanzin, who has been raising awareness about these issues since 2020.\nBut those interviewed by CNN also point to what they say is the impact of Chinese encroachment and changes to the control of contested lands over time, including from the 2020 clash.\nChinese encroachment and changes to the control of contested lands over time, including from the 2020 clash. 'We know the reality, we know the ground situation. If the (Indian) government says we have not lost an inch of land, then whatever we have lost is already lost,' said Stanzin.\nDadul in Phobrang said the 'Chinese are coming toward us constantly. They have been crossing the line and coming in,' he said. 'China is capturing the land, the Indian government is saying nothing is lost, the (Indian) Army is not letting us go there.'\nCNN was unable to independently confirm the status of the restricted land described in this report, nor claims of Chinese encroachment or loss of Indian territorial control after the 2020 clash.\nIn a statement, India's Ministry of Defense told CNN: 'No Indian territory has been lost during the standoff. Negotiations are currently underway for disengagement at the remaining friction points.'\nOn the buffer zones, the ministry said: 'all disengagements achieved till date have been based on the principle of Mutual and Equal Security. Currently, a mutually agreed moratorium exists on military activities from both sides in areas where disengagement has been affected, to maintain peace and tranquility.'\nThe 'number of Indian graziers and livestock in traditional grazing areas has seen a sharp rise' after the events of 2020, the ministry's statement added. 'There has thus been no adverse impact on the livelihood of locals in the area.'\nChina's Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\nExplained: Why do India and China spar at the border? (2022)\n02:40 - Source: CNN\n02:40 - Source: CNN Mounting concern over threats to the way of life in Ladakh \u2013 from lost grazing lands to climate change and industrialization \u2013 have driven thousands from across the region to its joint capital city of Leh in recent weeks to demand greater rights ahead of India's general election, which begins Friday.\nThere, some 3,500 meters (11,550 feet) above sea level, residents are calling for Indian statehood for Ladakh to ensure political representation, as well as inclusion in the national constitution's Sixth Schedule, which grants special rights to tribal areas. Organizers say at least 10,000 people turned out during a single day in Leh last month to support the start of an ongoing, weekslong hunger strike.\nLadakh lost special controls over its land in 2019, following a controversial move by the Indian central government that stripped the former state of Jammu and Kashmir of its statehood and broke off Ladakh, which had been a part of it, into a separate territory.\nThe change placed the region under the direct control of India's central government, which critics say has pared back national environmental protections and backed ecologically harmful infrastructure development pushes in other sensitive parts of the country in recent years.\nChina doesn't recognize what its Foreign Ministry has called the 'so-called union territory of Ladakh,' saying the 'western section of the China-India border has always belonged to China.' In addition to China, the territory of Ladakh also shares a disputed border with Pakistan, another neighbor with which New Delhi has fraught relations.\nNow many in Ladakh are concerned about the potential damage of future New Delhi-backed industrial projects, or that an influx of people moving in could shift the largely tribal demography.\n'Only local people will think about the next few generations, (others will) \u2026 make mistakes at best and sell off the place at worst,' said Sonam Wangchuk, an activist and educator widely known across India, who is leading the hunger strike to draw attention to environmental threats facing Ladakh.\nSpeaking to CNN during the 19th day of a 21-day fast last month, Wangchuk said in a steady but weakened voice that without protections and representation, 'we will have no control on how to secure these mountains.'\nHe pointed to plans for a solar plant and the potential for more environmentally damaging industry to follow.\nThe activism has faced pressure from local authorities.\nEarlier this month, Wangchuk and other civil society leaders called off a planned peaceful march toward the border they said was meant to reveal grazing lands lost to Chinese encroachment, after local authorities banned unauthorized gatherings and temporarily slowed internet speeds, citing an 'apprehension of breach of peace.'\nCNN has reached out to Leh's district magistrate and local police for comment.\nSome, like the Ladakh president of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), say protections on land, jobs and culture in Ladakh could be granted through other means, which local leaders have rejected.

That's 270 million people living on sinking land.\nMeanwhile, 67 million people are living on land that is subsiding faster than 10 millimeters (0.4 inches) each year.\nChina's rampant groundwater extraction is one of the primary factors for subsidence, researchers said. Cities have been pumping water from underground aquifers faster than it can be replenished, a situation exacerbated by climate change-fueled drought. Excessive pumping lowers the water table and causes the overlying land to sink.\nThe land is also sinking due to the growing weight of cities themselves. Soil can compact, naturally from the weight of sediments accumulating over time and from heavy buildings pressing down on the ground, causing the land to steadily sink.\nLand subsidence isn't just a problem in China. In the US, dozens of coastal cities, including New York City, are sinking. In the Netherlands, 25% of its lands have sunk lower than sea levels. And in Mexico City, likely the world's fastest subsiding city, land is sinking at the speed of up to 50 centimeters, or nearly 20 inches, a year.\nThe impact of sinking is typically worse along the coasts, where the sea level is rising at the same time. This combination exposes more land, people and property to destructive flooding.\nThe study suggests roughly a quarter of China's coasts will be lower than sea level because of subsidence and projected sea level rise, priming the area for colossal damage and putting lives at risk. Tianjin, Shanghai and areas around Guangzhou are significantly exposed to both issues, the study found.\nBut some coastal areas in China have already built physical protection from the growing risk of inundation, and the study does not take those protections into account. In Shanghai, for example, Shengli Tao, co-author of the study and professor at Peking University, said the city has built 'impressive' dike systems that are meters tall.\n'Such massive coastal dike systems will largely reduce the risk of being inundated even given both land subsidence and sea level rise,' Tao told CNN. 'I am not aware of other countries that have built such massive dike systems.'\nThursday's study is 'scientifically robust' and did 'a fine job' of highlighting that subsidence is not just a 'coastal problem,' said Leonard Ohenhen, a doctoral researcher at Virginia Tech who recently published a study on land subsidence in the US.\n'Most urban cities experience land subsidence, but we focus our attention on coastal cities because of sea level rise,' Ohenhen, who was not involved with the study, told CNN. 'However most urban cities experience land subsidence at rates comparable or even greater than subsidence in coastal cities.'\nTao said the Chinese government is addressing the sinking in a few ways, including implementing strict laws to control groundwater pumping in the last few years. Shanghai and surrounding areas have been limiting groundwater withdrawals, which has slowed the region's rate of subsidence. Decades ago, Shanghai's subsidence was a significant issue, Tao said.\nChina has also been pumping water from the Yangtze River in southern China to northern China \u2013 including to Beijing \u2013 which has suffered from water shortages. The project prevents the need for over-pumping groundwater and has stopped land subsidence in Beijing, the study found.\n'I believe China's government efforts will address the issue of land subsidence,' Tao said. 'But I would suggest to keep controlling groundwater withdrawals for major cities and constantly maintain dike systems in coastal lands.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Rachel Ramirez,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1546789651.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":4.440994,"_id":"7787cc3337eece9d58662c2ace0988e9"},{"title":"Before and after: See Dubai flooding from space","author":"Mary Gilbert","published_date":"2024-04-22 15:34:37","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/22/weather/dubai-flooding-before-after-satellite-climate","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Unprecedented, torrential rainfall plunged parts of the United Arab Emirates underwater last week, bringing life to a standstill in Dubai and elsewhere.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Unprecedented, torrential rainfall plunged parts of the United Arab Emirates underwater last week, bringing life to a standstill in Dubai and elsewhere.\nThe flooding that resulted from the UAE's largest deluge on record was so intense that satellites were still able to see it from space days after the clouds cleared and the last drops of rain fell.\nA firehose of heavy rain gushed over a large portion of the UAE from late Tuesday, April 16, through Wednesday, April 17. Dubai \u2013 the country's most populous city \u2013 recorded a year's worth of rain in just 12 hours as areas farther east recorded nearly 2 years' worth of rain in under 24 hours.\nThe heaviest rain targeted areas north and east of the country's capital city of Abu Dhabi. Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches (about 100 to 200 mm) were common, but a few locations recorded nearly 10 inches (250 mm).\nFloodwaters rose quickly and were slow to recede as a result of the historic deluge, which was the most extreme event in the country since records began 75 years ago.\nLess than two days after the rain relented, the Landsat 9 satellite passed over the UAE on Friday, April 19, and captured images of large, lingering pools of floodwater. The satellite collects detailed imagery of Earth's surface and is operated by NASA and the United States Geological Survey.\nImages taken over the Jebel Ali area, located on the southern outskirts of Dubai, capture the area before and after historic flooding. NASA\nImages taken over the Jebel Ali area, located on the southern outskirts of Dubai, capture the area before and after historic flooding. NASA Pools of deep blue in the images above highlight floodwaters that stand in stark contrast against the region's typically dry ground, which appears tan or light brown. The flooding shown is in the southernmost portion of Dubai, but the city's highly urbanized central hub isn't captured.\nThese images were taken with Landsat 9's false color products to make the presence of water stand out against the dry ground. The colors shown are not exactly how they would appear to a person peering down from space, but make differences in the land easier to spot.\nThe satellite also captured significant flooding in Abu Dhabi. Small, shallow bodies of water appear light blue. The larger and deeper pools of floodwater are dark blue.\nLarge sections of dry, tan ground also gain a light green tint after the rainfall. This likely shows that the ground in many areas retained a dampness from the rain, even if they did not fully flood.\nWhile these images may have missed out on the absolute worst extent of flooding in the country, they provide an incredible snapshot of just how much the stormy weather left behind.\nThe torrential rain was associated with a larger storm system last week traversing the Arabian Peninsula and moving across the Gulf of Oman. This same system also brought deadly flooding to nearby Oman.\nExtreme rainfall events like this are becoming more common as the atmosphere warms due to human-driven climate change. A warmer atmosphere is able to soak up more moisture like a towel and then ring it out in the form of torrential rainfall.\nDry areas that lack the infrastructure to deal with intense rain are more likely to struggle with bouts of significant flooding as a result.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Mary Gilbert,CNN Meteorologist","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/screenshot-2024-04-22-at-11-20-11-am.png?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnn","_score":4.193781,"_id":"904ca7c63957a43746e363b10a28454b"},{"title":"10 ways you can help the planet on Earth Day \u2014 and every day","author":"Emily Fazio","published_date":"2024-04-16 16:03:57","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/wbd/10-ways-you-can-help-the-planet-on-earth-day-and-every-day","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Love the Earth and make your home and neighborhood a better, healthier place with these landscaping, lawn care and gardening tips.

Let these serve to inspire change to live a 'greener' lifestyle. Share what you learn with others and make a real difference every day.\nThe Garden Is a Great Place to Start\nIf the health of the planet is a concern, one of the best ways you can do your part to help the environment is by using responsible and impactful garden strategies in your home garden. Find out how even small gestures can yield important results, just in time for Earth Day.\nReduce Food Waste by Composting\nCut down on the amount of food waste you dispose of by adopting the at-home practice of composting. It won't take too long to create nutrient-rich soil that can be given back to the earth and supplement your garden.\nInstall a Rain Barrel\nAttach a rain barrel to your home's downspout to collect roof runoff. The 'free' water is perfect to reuse in the garden or around the yard. Rain barrels require only a few parts and can easily be assembled yourself \u2014 some towns even offer rain barrel programs and will supply you with the barrel and all of the components at low- or no cost!\nUse Natural Wood Chips or Needles for Mulch\nAs much as you might fawn over color-rich bagged mulch, there's something to be said for using materials from your own environment to keep weeds at bay. Pine needle mulch, autumn leaves, and natural wood chips are all excellent options to use year-round. You may even be able to obtain wood chips free from your local municipality if they take care of clearing fallen trees throughout the community. Which mulch is best for your garden?\nChoose Natural Fertilizers and Organic Nutrients for Your Garden Soil\nOpt for chemical-free plant food and soil additives for your garden. While many inorganic store-bought products will help produce big, healthy plants that'll surely make you proud, they can also be void of certain nutrients and microorganisms that the soil needs to stay healthy.\nFurthermore, rainwater runoff from some inorganic fertilizers can be dangerous for pets, kids, and it also contributes to polluting larger bodies of water. There is a lot to learn about fertilizer, but when you must incorporate store-bought nutrients, always look carefully at the ingredients and choose a fertilizer that is organic, not synthetic.\nMake Your Own Natural Wood Stain\nWhen you soak steel wool (#000) in apple cider vinegar, it dissolves into a rich, eco-friendly wood stain that's perfect for indoor or outdoor applications.\nIf you're using it indoors, no need to wear a respirator and ventilation isn't necessary, that is unless you despise the smell of salt and vinegar chips.\nOpt for this DIY Earth-friendly alternative that, as it dries, turns wood into a mocha-brown color.\nThe increasing availability of battery-operated lawn tools is a benefit for homeowners who want powerful alternatives to common gas/oil-fueled machines. They're also quiet, lightweight and emission-free to help make your yard (and neighborhood) a healthier, more peaceful place.\nAlmost all yard maintenance tools have a battery-operated version \u2014 lawn mowers, string trimmers, rototillers and chainsaws so powerful that you'll be able to cut logs and branches all afternoon on a single battery charge.\nChoose Native Flowers and Trees\nBefore you get inspired to pick a little-bit-of-this and a-little-bit-of-that for your home's landscape, do your research and learn what native plants thrive in your area. Native plants naturally support wildlife, are able to adapt to climate and seasons, and are more apt to thrive in your specific soil conditions. Plants that are not native may or may not do well \u2014 but when they do very, very well, they can also do harm, such as suffocate native species, damage soil, and become irreversibly invasive. Learn more about native plants for the Northwest, South East, Midwest and South West.\nShare Seeds and Transplants\nSeed sharing with neighbors or through local co-ops is a great way to spread the love of gardening and introduce new plants to others. Always consider harvesting seeds from native plants and flowers, and make it a habit to also save some seeds from fruits and vegetables when your garden is in full production during the summer.\nSome perennials benefit from being divided every 3-5 years to prevent overcrowding, and the individual sections can usually be transplanted and continue to thrive at a new home.\nNaturally Repel Bugs\nThwart infestations around your property by taking preventative action. If your kitchen is prone to attracting ants, or your backyard is a magnet for moles, do research to learn what scents or soil additives may naturally make them change their course.\nPhoto: Emily Fazio\nBy choosing natural ingredients instead of powerful bug and insect repellants, you can keep harsh chemicals away from where you eat, sleep and play.\nOpt for Natural Weed Killers\nKeep weed-killing chemicals out of your garden by diligently managing unwanted weeds as they sprout from the soil.\nPhoto: iStockPhoto/Maxim Kostenko\nBoiling water, Acetic acid, and plain ol' weeding by hand can keep unwanted growth from taking over your landscape.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Emily Fazio","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/shutterstock-137711042-xixinxing-community-gardeners.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnn","_score":4.0664682,"_id":"1ca8ccd202869b56e73256a18c692888"},{"title":"Giving a hoot on Earth Day: How to protect owls in your own backyard","author":"Amy Chillag","published_date":"2024-04-22 01:12:13","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/21/us/how-to-protect-owls-iyw-scn","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The plight of Flaco, the Eurasian Eagle owl who escaped the Central Park Zoo last year, showed just how tough it is to survive in a world altered by humans.","summary":"Atlanta CNN \u2014\nAtlanta CNN \u2014 The plight of Flaco, the Eurasian eagle-owl who escaped New York's Central Park Zoo last year, showed just how tough it is to survive in a world altered by humans.\nThe gorgeous creature with a six-foot wing span, piercing orange eyes and tufted ears captivated the world as he flew freely throughout Manhattan. Flaco fans posted social media updates every time they sighted him soaring, landing and catching prey, sparking an intense love affair.\nBut then it was over. After a year on the lam, Flaco died after flying into a Manhattan high rise. Crying emojis dominated social media. The reactions almost seemed outsized \u2013 but paying attention to nature will do that to a person. We had come to know Flaco, in a way. A necropsy showed he had also ingested a potentially lethal amount of rat poison.\nThe attention to Flaco's life and death isn't an anomaly. During the pandemic, people who had never been interested in the wildlife in their own backyards began to take notice.\nOwls' popularity has soared in the US along with the number of Americans engaged in birdwatching. A survey by the US Fish and Wildlife Service found a whopping 96 million people now take part in observing or photographing birds in parks or their backyards. That's double the birdwatching going on just eight years ago.\nBut there's something particularly special about owls people seem to appreciate.\n'Maybe it's because they look like us,' says, Denver Holt with the Owl Research Institute.\n'They've got a big head; they have the symmetry of the eyes, nose and mouth,' muses Holt. 'We tend to gravitate to animals with big, round eyes.'\nHolt says owls are one of the most widely recognized groups of animals in the world. 'They have been so since prehistoric times. In the caves of France, there are etchings of owls scratched on the cave walls.'\nAnd, he says, they make such cool sounds - hooting, tooting, and trilling. They help humans with pests, he says, eating an average of six mice or rats a night. And they're beautiful.\n'Often with bright yellow eyes, it's fascinating how these birds can hunt in the dark- their vision is amazing at night,' says David Wiedenfeld, Senior Conservation Scientist with the American Bird Conservancy.\n'If you look at their feather patterns, (they're) very intricate,' Wiedenfeld says. 'Owls have special feathers that are softer than a lot of birds. They make almost no sound in flight,' so they can surprise their prey.\nSadly, many species of owls are declining with some highly threatened, says Wiedenfeld.\nOf 19 owl species found in the United States, more than half are losing populations \u2013 a similar trend to all birds. The biggest reasons are habitat loss from climate change and human land use, collisions (especially during migrations) and pesticides that kill insects and rodents that owls rely on, according to the American Bird Conservancy.\n'We have to start making sure we keep the habitat for the owl,' says Wiedenfeld.\nOld-growth forests are dwindling in the US and Canada because of the high value of timber, a major reason for the huge drop in spotted owl populations, according to the American Bird Conservancy.\npopulations, according to the American Bird Conservancy. Open grasslands are shrinking where the tiny burrowing owl makes its home nesting in underground burrows.\nWhere it was once plentiful, the Burrowing Owl's numbers have plummeted in Florida.\n'Florida is largely turning into condominiums,' Wiedenfeld tells CNN.\nThe lack of open grassland has also impacted the short-eared owl, whose population has decreased an estimated 65 percent since 1970, according to the Audubon Society. 'Much of that grassland is being used for agriculture \u2013 corn, soybeans, wheat,' says Wiedenfeld. The American Bird Conservancy is working with farmers to set aside some undisturbed land for nature.\nwhose population has decreased an estimated 65 percent since 1970, according to the Audubon Society. 'Much of that grassland is being used for agriculture \u2013 corn, soybeans, wheat,' says Wiedenfeld. The American Bird Conservancy is working with farmers to set aside some undisturbed land for nature. People who'd never birdwatched before have flocked to snowy owl sightings over the years, says Holt, the owl researcher. But their future also looks dim.\nThe snowy owl has lost half its population in the past 50 years, according to the State of the Birds 2022 report. Holt has been tracking them for more than three decades in Montana and their breeding grounds in Canada.\nLast year, he and his fellow field researchers found zero nests. 'It's disappointing. Each year you go up with hopes the lemming population is high (their food source) and Snowy Owls will make a rebound. You get there, and you just don't find nests.'\nOwl experts say they don't know exactly what's causing the Snowy Owl's decline, but the American Bird Conservancy says climate change is likely affecting their prey, as well as collisions with vehicles, communications towers, wind turbines and airplanes.\n1. Keep large, older trees\n1. Keep large, older trees Leaving trees is the most important thing people can do for most of the owls, says Wiedenfeld.\nMost owls sleep and roost in tree holes which are often found in older trees. Many, like screech owls, will use big woodpecker holes or a hollow where a branch has broken off. Great horned owls, don't use holes, but build their large nests in trees.\n'A lot of people in suburban areas don't like to leave old trees. They worry about them falling,' says Wiedenfeld. 'But if you have a place where you don't have to worry about safety or buildings, leave them so they can have tree cavities.'\n'There are so many reasons people use to take snags down,' says Holt. 'One of the last things they think about is their importance to wildlife.'\n2. Leave some of yard natural or 'messy'\n2. Leave some of yard natural or 'messy' Many homeowners strive to maintain spotless lawns with no weeds, no leaves, no brush, no mess. But if you want owls or any birds in your backyard, that's not what draws them.\n'Allow there to be some disorder. Allow a few tree snags; leave the corner of your field a little bit weedy,' says Wiedenfeld. 'Try not to have everything mowed as a lawn.'\nAnd, he says, keep a small brush pile in a corner away from your house, if you can.\n'It will benefit birds and makes a place for prey that will help the owls.'\n3. Put up a nest box\n3. Put up a nest box If you're looking for a fun project with the kids, 'a nest box can be a really nice thing to do at home,' says Holt. Owls will often use those boxes for shelter and brooding, especially if there is a lack of tree holes on your property. Then you might get to see baby owls \u2013 talk about cute.\nThe Cornell Lab of Ornithology has a great guide for building nest boxes for many types of owls or birds.\n4. Avoid using pesticides and rodenticides\n4. Avoid using pesticides and rodenticides If you're trying to get rid of rats or mice, owls are the perfect pest control. Poisons may be lethal to rodents, but they also kill the owls and hawks that prey on them.\nAll over the country pest companies continue to use 'second generation rodenticides.' They are anticoagulants which cause vermin to bleed to death.\n'The mice or rats will eat the rodenticide, and then they don't die immediately,' says Wiedenfeld.\n'They wander out into the open, sick from having ingested the poison, and they make an easy target for the owl.'\nAn owl can pick up a lot of poison eating at least four rodents a night, and many more during breeding season.\nIf the poison doesn't kill them, eventually an injury will because they'll bleed to death. 'Any slight injury (to the owl) can cause internal bleeding. It's a pretty horrible death,' Wiedenfeld says.\nThe EPA has banned their use in products sold to individual homeowners, but they are still allowed in the commercial market, including restaurants, farms or any business.\n5. Use bird-safe glass or decals\n5. Use bird-safe glass or decals It's extremely common for birds, like Flaco did, to collide with buildings. The windows on our homes and office buildings reflect the sky and clouds, making it look like safe passage. Collision is one of the leading causes of bird mortality. An estimated one billion birds die this way each year.\nOne way to combat this is with decals for home windows.\nMost are transparent and only birds can see the ultraviolet reflection that wards them off. Many birding groups like American Bird Conservancy are working with developers and state governments to build bird-safe buildings from the start. In fact, Flaco's death spurred the New York State Senate to rename its Bird Safe Buildings Act the FLACO (' Feathered Lives Also Count') Act. If passed, it would require new state buildings (and those significantly altered) to adopt bird-friendly designs.\n6. Become a wildlife volunteer or citizen scientist\n6. Become a wildlife volunteer or citizen scientist Wildlife rescue centers are always looking for volunteers to help with the care of tens of thousands of injured and orphaned animals every year. When it comes to owls, many have been poisoned, hit by cars, hurt in a building collision, or caught up in fish netting and barbed wire.\nOnce they've lost the use of a wing, or sight in an eye, it's hard for them to be released back into the wild. Some injured owls become ambassadors to show school children the wonders of nature.\nYou can also report injured owls to wildlife rehabilitators in your area- https://ahnow.org/\nGrab some binoculars and be a citizen scientist. You can participate in counting birds through census-taking. The Great Backyard Bird Count happens every year in February and the Christmas Bird Count You every December.\nScientists rely on these numbers to determine how bird populations are faring year after year.\n7. Donate to Bird Charities\n7.

Last week, former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson treated a Canadian crowd to a helping of his signature bombast.\n'The party of Winston Churchill wants to ban [cigars]?' he moaned. 'Donnez-moi un break, as they say in Quebec. It's just mad.'\nThe source of his ire was the proposed UK smoking ban, which was spearheaded by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at last October's Conservative Party Conference and underwent its second reading in the House of Commons on Tuesday evening.\nIn a free vote, the House leaned in favor of the plan by 383 to 67, meaning the bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle.\nUnder the proposed bill, no one born on or after January 1, 2009, would ever be allowed to buy tobacco, effectively raising the legal smoking age every year. This would mean today's 15-year-olds will never legally be able to buy cigarettes.\nDespite what Johnson may have led his audience to believe, a potential smoking ban enjoys broad popular support in the UK. A February survey by YouGov for the charity Action on Smoking and Health found that 71% of adults backed the goal of making Britain a country where no one smokes (12% are opposed). Like most people, I'm certain this would save many lives and relieve a massive strain on the National Health Service (NHS). Whether that goodwill proves sufficient to overcome the many obstacles still ahead remains to be seen.\n(NHS). Whether that goodwill proves sufficient to overcome the many obstacles still ahead remains to be seen. Johnson may have invoked one of the most tired clich\u00e9s in British politics (his obsession with Churchill's legacy is matched only by his obsession with his own), but in this instance, it's at least adjacent to something relevant. Conservative backbenchers led by former Prime Minister Liz Truss have condemned the proposed bill as 'profoundly unconservative,' adding that it 'only gives succor to those who wish to curtail freedom.'\n'only gives succor to those who wish to curtail freedom.' This, whatever people's politics, is a sticking point. Smoking isn't just the teenage rite of passage glamorized by shows like 'Skins' and 'Euphoria.' For some, it's synonymous with bodily autonomy. The health benefits of quitting \u2014 or better, never taking it up in the first place \u2014 are irrefutable. But for years, people have weighed the risks of cigarettes and decided they're worth it. As adults, we reserve the right to raise a glass in celebration, bake sugar-packed birthday cakes, drive a car, play extreme sports and do all manner of things that might ultimately harm us. It's our time, our money, our health to do with as we wish.\nThe harder line to draw is how severely our own pleasures should be curtailed for the sake of other people. The UK's 2007 ban on smoking indoors in public places was impactful partly because it vastly reduced children's exposure to second-hand smoke, a cause even the most committed smoker could get behind. It's one thing to puff away on the street, another to do so in a crowded restaurant almost directly into growing lungs.\nThen, there's the question of money. New Zealand's conservative National Party introduced a similar phased smoking ban last year, but reversed it before it went into effect to help pay for tax cuts. When Prohibition was introduced by the 18th Amendment in 1920s America imposing a ban on the sale, manufacture and transportation of alcohol, swathes of the population refused to comply. This resulted in a booming bootleg market and spiraling gang violence. It cost the federal government $11 billion in lost tax revenue and over $300 million to enforce, ultimately contributing to the Amendment's repeal in 1933.\nSmoking costs the NHS an estimated \u00a32.5 billion ($3.1 billion) every year, equivalent to 2% of the health service's budget. Cancer Research UK estimates that in 2022, the gross cost of smoking to public finances was \u00a320.6 billion ($25.7 billion), thanks to a combination of reduced tax revenue, increased benefits payments, unemployment, and premature death. The long-term economic benefits of a smoke-free Britain are obvious. But those savings would take time to materialize, and this government isn't known for staying its course.\nestimated \u00a32.5 billion ($3.1 billion) every year, equivalent to 2% of the health service's budget.

The long-term economic benefits of a smoke-free Britain are obvious. But those savings would take time to materialize, and this government isn't known for staying its course. If cigarettes were invented now, they'd probably never reach the stores. Sadly, getting rid of something the population is already acclimatized to is far trickier than never introducing it in the first place. A phased ban might be a gentler approach than forcing the nation to go cold turkey, but how it'll be enforced in practical terms is far from clear. Among other things, it raises the possibility that in 10 years, we could be in a position where a shopkeeper is 'too young' to smoke, but obliged to sell cigarettes to older people.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook The legal smoking age is a devolved issue, meaning the ban would only apply in England. Depending on how Wales and Scotland choose to proceed, someone who's unable to buy cigarettes in England might be able to do so across the border. And anyway, underage kids have never struggled to get hold of cigarettes in the past, so how will this be managed differently?\nThe Tory rebels' abhorrence of the 'nanny state' might be less sympathetic among the general public at a time when 250 people per week are dyingdue to NHS waiting lists and a cost of living crisis is stunting the growth of our children. Some who might once have blanched at the idea of state intervention may feel more amenable in this climate. The question is whether Rishi Sunak can make an enforceable plan and stick with it.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Holly Thomas,Opinion Holly Thomas","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-102165893.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@CNNOpinions","_score":3.7802706,"_id":"bea4de9367db3418cef0a5b9f1eabd29"},{"title":"Fossil found on a beach by tween reveals massive marine reptile","author":"Ashley Strickland","published_date":"2024-04-20 15:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/20/world/ichthyosaur-fossil-science-newsletter-wt-scn","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"This week, encounter the largest marine reptile ever to roam the seas, see a rainbow-like phenomenon on another planet, marvel at underwater bees, and more.","summary":"Editor's Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter.

Encouragement and the pursuit of knowledge help us grow. When Jane Goodall was a little girl, her mother nurtured the celebrated primatologist's love of the living world.\nNow 90, Goodall nurtures that same appreciation through her Roots & Shoots program, which empowers young people to create change within their communities around the globe.\nEven as the world shifts in reaction to the climate crisis, Goodall remains hopeful that humanity can save the planet.\n'Don't forget that you as an individual make an impact on the environment every single day,' Goodall told CNN recently. 'And it's up to you to choose what sort of impact you make.'\nIn May 2020, Ruby Reynolds, then 11, and her father, Justin, were searching for fossils on a Somerset beach along the English coast when she spotted something unusual.\nNow reassembled with the help of experts, the fossils Ruby found have revealed the jawbone of a giant ichthyosaur that roamed the seas 202 million years ago. And when it came to sheer size, the marine reptile likely rivaled the blue whale, currently the largest living animal.\n'It was so cool to discover part of this gigantic ichthyosaur. I am very proud to have played a part in a scientific discovery like this,' she said.\nMeanwhile in India, paleontologists at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee unearthed evidence of a different massive reptile: a prehistoric snake that was longer than a school bus.\nArchaeologists have pieced together the puzzle of a dramatic dynasty collapse after finding burned remains within an ancient Maya pyramid in Guatemala.\nThe research team uncovered the scorched bones of four adults, as well as luxurious adornments and weapons, in a room beneath a temple, leading them to believe the people were of royal lineage.\nIt's likely that a new type of leader arose during a time of political and societal change for the Maya, and the bones were burned as a sign of intentional desecration, the team said.\nSeparately, two 5,500-year-old skeletons recovered at an archaeological site in southwest France belonged to women who were likely buried alive in a sacrificial rite using an Italian Mafia-style form of torture.\nFor the first time, astronomers have detected a rainbow-like effect called a glory on a planet outside our solar system.\nScientists using the Cheops space telescope noticed an unexpected glow within the atmosphere on WASP-76b.

Read more opinion at CNN.\nDean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio's daily program 'The Dean Obeidallah Show.' Follow him on Threads . The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 People at rallies are obviously capable of yelling out whatever they want. It's how leaders of the event and the community involved respond that is defining. That is why the response of local Arab and Muslim leaders who vocally slammed a 'death to America' chant by a few attendees at an April 5 rally in Dearborn, Michigan, was so vitally important.\nThis despicable chant was heard as part of an annual Al Quds Day (Jerusalem Day) event intended to show support for Palestinians. This year, given Hamas' brutal October 7 terrorist attack and the war in Gaza in response that has seen thousands of Palestinian civilians killed including an estimated 13,000 children, the utter devastation of large swaths of Palestinian homes and the onset of famine confirmed by USAID, passions were undoubtedly very high.\nBut still there is absolutely no place for a chant in Arabic of 'death to America' \u2014 nor for 'death to Israel' \u2014 that was started by one person who event organizers said was 'unaffiliated and unknown' to them.\nThe video of this chant was shared by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), whose executive director Steven Stalinsky wrote a February Wall Street Journal op-ed titled 'Welcome to Dearborn, America's Jihad Capital' that sparked a backlash. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said the op-ed was a 'really abhorrent' piece and 'total misrepresentation' of that community's Arab Americans and President Joe Biden declared that 'blaming a group of people based on the words of a small few is wrong' and 'can lead to Islamophobia and anti-Arab hate, and it shouldn't happen to the residents of Dearborn \u2014 or any American town.'\nSo when MEMRI circulated the rally video, it was especially telling that the leaders of Dearborn didn't attack the messenger. Instead, they denounced the horrible message of the chant at the Al Quds event.\nDearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud responded on social media to the video in which 'some attendees were chanting statements that were unacceptable and contrary to the heart of this city.' He added, 'Dearborn is a city of proud Americans; the hateful rhetoric heard on [April 5] does not reflect the opinion of the members of this community.'\nImad Hamad, the executive director of the American Human Rights Council in Dearborn, was at the rally and responded to the chant with a statement released on behalf of a group of Arab American and Muslim leaders. 'We, as a community, unequivocally denounce the inflammatory speeches and chants that emerged from that gathering\u2026 your messages of extremism do not resonate with us,' said the joint statement. 'In condemning these actions, we reaffirm our commitment to Dearborn as a city that embodies diversity and inclusivity.'\nOsama Siblani, a well-known Arab American activist in the area who was also involved with the AHRC statement and is publisher of the Dearborn-based Arab American News, wrote on Facebook, 'To the speakers who incited the despicable chants at the alQuds rally in Dearborn last Friday\u2026 Your pathetic ill speeches and the disgusting chants that you incited and invited are totally and unequivocally rejected by all Arab Americans and Muslims in Dearborn and everywhere.' He added, 'Dearborn is the Arab American capital and has no place for people like you. It is a diverse and a proud city and will continue to be a welcoming city that represents the hope and aspiration of all its residents regardless of their ethnicity, religion or color.'\nAnd the organization that sponsored the event, Al Quds Committee Detroit, responded that the comments were 'wrongful' and 'a mistake.' One of the organizers of the event, Sheikh Usama Abdulghani \u2014 who was born in Washington, DC, and educated in Iran on Islamic law \u2014 said in a video response that 'we were all quite surprised when on the (Al) Quds Day rally, someone who was in the rally started chanting \u2018death to America.'' He added, 'Why would somebody do that on this day?'\nAs someone active in both the Arab and Muslim American communities who has spoken at and attended hundreds of events in recent years, I've never heard anyone say or chant either 'death to America' or 'death to Israel.' And if anyone did, the backlash would be swift.\nCriticism of the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's administration \u2014 especially now given the horrific suffering his military has caused to innocent people in Gaza \u2014 is more than justified, it's demanded of all who value humanity. And the freedom to criticize Biden or any US president's policies with which a person doesn't agree is a cornerstone of our democratic republic.\nBut language that dehumanizes and creates a climate of hate or fear must be denounced as it was in Dearborn by Arab and Muslim American leaders.\nIt's also vital that hate peddled by foreign actors that can impact communities in the United States be loudly condemned, whether it's antisemitic speech from Iran or the demonization of Muslims and Arabs by Israeli extremists. That's why it was important that we saw the Biden administration condemn chants of 'death to Arabs' by thousands of right-wing Israelis in May 2023 as part of that nation's Jerusalem Day celebration. This annual event marks the day the Israeli military captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 war. Last year's Jerusalem Day march featured thousands of Jewish supremacists taunting Palestinian Christians and Muslims with chants like 'may your village burn.'\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook While such vile chants by right-wing Israelis have been heard for years in Israel \u2014 even at sporting events \u2014 last year's Jerusalem Day rally was even more alarming given a member of Netanyahu's cabinet, national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who was convicted in 2007 of inciting racism against Arabs in Israel and supporting a terrorist organization with a sign at a protest, marched along with these hate-filled bigots. And the day after the rally marked by these despicable taunts that grabbed headlines, Netanyahu didn't denounce the hate but instead called the march 'a splendid day on which to celebrate our return to our eternal capital.'\nPassion and the Middle East conflict go hand in hand. But when that passion manifests as hate and dehumanization it must be loudly denounced. That is true regardless of who is the person or group peddling the toxic message. Dearborn leaders showed how to take a stand and not tolerate this kind of message in their own community.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Dean Obeidallah","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1923247729.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@CNNOpinions","_score":3.7562792,"_id":"3fc2a7cd4b226ba3a1709792845969c6"},{"title":"Missed communications and blocked evacuation routes: New report details problems and heroism from Maui's disastrous wildfires","author":"Holly Yan","published_date":"2024-04-17 15:53:03","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/us/hawai-maui-wildfire-report/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"An investigation of the catastrophic Maui wildfires that killed 101 people, destroyed hundreds of homes and left $6 billion in damages reveals a spate of problems with emergency preparation and\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 An investigation of the catastrophic Maui wildfires that killed 101 people, destroyed hundreds of homes and left $6 billion in damages reveals a spate of problems with emergency preparation and coordination before and during the disaster.\nAmong them: Chief officers and some Maui Fire Department staff used 'WhatsApp' for situational awareness updates, but not everyone in the department used the app. And there was 'minimal' pre-positioning of staff and equipment after the National Weather Service issued a red flag warning prior to the four major wildfires breaking out on August 8, 2023.\nBut the new 84-page report produced by the Western Fire Chiefs Association also acknowledges the 'whole island's limited resources, which were extremely challenged by the scope and scale of the collective incidents.'\n'After conducting over 200 interviews and reviewing numerous data sets, it is clear that the four major wildfires pushed the (Maui Fire Department) to an unprecedented level of strain. Despite this, the collective actions by MFD and law enforcement saved many lives and property across the island,' the report says.\n'Nearly every staff member and vehicle resource of MFD on Maui was deployed. The emergency response system did not break but rather it found itself outmatched by the extreme weather and fire conditions. Staff members endured shifts of 36 hours or more and risked their lives in a valiant effort to stop the spread of the fires and save lives.'\nThe report was released one day before Hawaii's Attorney General Anne Lopez is expected to announce the first wave of findings from an investigation by her office and the Fire Safety Research Institute on Wednesday.\nBut already, the fire chief association's report has revealed a host of challenges \u2013 as well as 111 recommendations on how to help prevent or mitigate such disasters in the future.\nWhat the 84-page report found \u2013 'Calls and text messages serve as the primary communication methods to staff up vehicles,' the report says. 'Some staff members were not contacted and remained unaware of ongoing incident activities. Chief Officers and certain MFD staff utilize the \u2018WhatsApp' application for situational awareness updates, but its usage is not universal across the department.'\nThe report suggested creating an automated system to notify all staff of a major deployment and allow battalion chiefs to take command vehicles home 'so off-duty BCs can readily respond from their residence' during urgent events.\n\u2013 'There are no formal County inter-island or State mutual aid agreements among fire departments, resulting in a cumbersome and slow process for relocating equipment,' the report says. 'However, additional staffing during adverse times can really make a difference, especially for supporting firefighting operations.'\nThe report recommends creating a statewide mutual aid agreement as well as an 'inter-island engine fleet program, where the State procures and maintains a specified number of Type 3, Type 4-6 engines for shared use on each island. Standardizing the model/type ensures consistency in training and operations across islands.'\n\u2013 After the National Weather Service issued a red flag warning on August 5 for August 7-9, 'there was minimal upstaffing and pre-positioning of resources,' the report says.\n'Battalion Chiefs initiated upstaffing for some resources on the morning of August 8' \u2013 the day the four major wildfires ignited.\n'Battalion Chiefs initiated upstaffing for some resources on the morning of August 8' \u2013 the day the four major wildfires ignited. The report recommends creating an intelligence center 'to continually monitor current and predicted emergency events and facilitate the sharing of relevant data' and 'Upstaff and preposition appropriate resources based upon intelligence briefings.\n\u2013 The public's awareness and understanding of wildfire risks are also paramount. 'Like on the mainland, staff, policymakers, and the public may not see the escalating wildfire issues until an emergency incident unfolds, as observed in August,' the report says.\n'A myriad of studies since 2010 have delved into topics such as climate change, fuel conditions, and the growing workload demands for firefighters. Policymakers face the challenge of deciding whether public education alone will suffice or if there's a necessity for policy and enforcement changes to better address the wildfire problem.'\n\u2013 The report noted multiple challenges surrounding evacuations \u2013 including communication problems and obstacles that hindered or blocked evacuations.\n'On August 8, evacuation routes across the island were obstructed by downed power poles, trees, and wires, exacerbating pre-existing challenges with accessing and leaving areas,' the report says.\n'MFD requested law enforcement to facilitate evacuations over the radio. Although law enforcement was part of the ICS structure, lack of co-location at Incident Command Posts (ICP) was partly attributed to the dynamic nature of the incidents and available staffing.'\nThe report suggests working with law enforcement and state emergency management officials 'to identify key access routes and develop contingency plans.'\n'Upon identifying key access routes, collaborate with the Hawaiian Electric Company to relocate adjacent infrastructure, potentially underground, to enhance the safety of evacuation routes,' the report says.\nIn addition, the report says trying to communicate evacuations 'to a transient tourist population that speaks multiple languages poses a significant challenge.'\nIt recommends collaborating with state emergency management officials about evacuation notifications in multiple languages\nWhile questions remain, changes are already underway Seven months after the calamitous wildfires, it's still unclear what caused the most devastating inferno \u2013 the Lahaina fire \u2013 that killed 101 people and scorched thousands of acres.\n'That is still under investigation with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives,' Maui Fire Department Chief Brad Ventura said Tuesday.\nThe fire chief lauded his firefighters for saving many lives despite personal tragedy.\n'There were firefighters fighting the fires in Lahaina as they well knew their homes were burning down at that very moment,' Ventura said.\nVentura was the fire official who commissioned the independent, 84-page report focusing on his department's challenges and suggestions for improvement.\nThe after-action report praised the Maui Fire Department's initiative in trying to improve.\n'We commend MFD for their swift actions to address the issues identified in this AAR, rather than waiting for AAR recommendations,' the report says.\nFor example, the Maui Fire Department has already worked with law enforcement to review new evacuation software, made plans for upstaffing during red flag warnings and committed to a fleet replacement program, the report says.\n'We trust that this report will contribute to the recovery process, prompting actions and public policies that enhance preparedness for future major incidents.'\nCNN's Pete Burn contributed to this report.\nCNN's Pete Burn contributed to this report.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Holly Yan","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1623484398.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":3.7562792,"_id":"9ca7a53996faf68203ff841910291cf6"},{"title":"11-year-old's fossil discovery reveals ancient creature larger than a blue whale","author":"Ashley Strickland","published_date":"2024-04-20 15:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/20/world/ichthyosaur-fossil-science-newsletter-wt-scn/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"This week, encounter the largest marine reptile ever to roam the seas, see a rainbow-like phenomenon on another planet, marvel at underwater bees, and more.","summary":"Editor's Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter.

Despite efforts to rein it in, only 9% of it is actually recycled.","summary":"A local fisherman performs maintenance on his boat while surrounded by trash washed up on Loji Beach in West Java, Indonesia.\nThe western coast of Java in Indonesia is popular with surfers for its world-famous breaks. There's a majestic underwater world to explore, too. But it's impossible to surf or snorkel without running into plastic water bottles, single-use cups and food wrappers.\nThe garbage sometimes forms islands in the sea, and much of it washes ashore, accumulating as mountains on the beach.\nThe world produces around 400 million metric tons of plastic waste each year. Every day, 2,000 truckloads of it is dumped into the ocean, rivers and lakes.\nA team of women haul in fishing nets on Java's western coast. Despite global efforts to give plastic products longer lives, only 9% of them are actually recycled. Most plastic waste goes into landfills or is shipped to places like Indonesia and other Southeast Asian nations, many of which are already drowning in their own plastic pollution.\nClearing beaches of litter in Indonesia is no small task. The country is the world's second-biggest producer of plastic waste. As the world's longest archipelago \u2014 stretching over the same distance as London to New York \u2014 Indonesia has a vast coastline and three times the amount of sea surface area than land, making fishing an industry that 12 million people rely on.\nWithout adequate state services to keep the beaches clear of litter, fishing communities are on the front lines of the clean-up.\nLoji Beach, on the Indonesian island of Java, is one of the most contaminated in the country. Marsinah collects plastic on Loji Beach to try and sell it to informal recycling centers. Plastic bottle labels are accumulated in a recycling center in Bangkok, Thailand. Loji Beach, nestled in a bay in West Java, is especially prone to plastic pile-ups. Ocean currents sweep the waste into the bay where it gets trapped in and ends up on the sand.\n'There's no real community living here. There's not a proper road to the beach, so there's no local people cleaning it up properly, like you see in other parts of the country,' said Edu Ponces, a Barcelona-based photographer. 'Loji Beach is telling us something: if we decide not to do more about plastic waste, this is what the sea will give back to us.'\nMarsinah is an Indonesian woman who collects some of the plastic waste on Loji Beach. She then tries to sell it to informal recycling centers \u2014 it's the only way for she's been able to earn an income since her husband died. Sometimes the local government buys the waste she and others collect, even if there's no use for it, just to provide a livelihood.\nFishermen separate fish from plastic waste collected in their nets. The separation of plastic and the sorting of the catch is an increasingly laborious task as the amount of waste increases. Farther down the Java coast at Pangadaran Beach, Rahmat Hidayat has an important job: he goes out on the boat to cast the nets, which will then be collected by his colleagues. He says they are catching fewer fish than they used to, and there's an increase in plastic in their haul.\nHe and his fellow fishermen spend hours separating the plastic and fish after a catch. Increasingly, plastics and small microplastics are making their way into the food chain as fish come into regular contact with ocean plastic waste.\nTo stop this vicious cycle, some traditional fishing villages are turning to other means for their catch.\nA man feeds fish at a floating fish farm in Pangadaran Bay. Some fishing communities are turning to farming, where the fish are isolated from the rest of the sea with nets to limit their contact with plastic pollution. Plastic waste accumulates on the shore at Loji Beach. Fisherman Rahmat Hidayat says there are fewer fish and more plastic in his hauls. Indonesia is one of several Southeast Asia nations that have tightened their rules for plastic waste imports as they try to prevent becoming plastic dumping grounds for countries like China, the US and EU nations. Indonesia will only allow shipments of products that are fully recyclable, but its neighbor to the north, Thailand, has gone further: It is banning all incoming plastic waste shipments starting in 2025.\nAt the same time, the European Union will ban the export of plastic waste to developing countries by 2026. Ironically, that has led to an uptick in plastic waste exports from the EU to Southeast Asia, as European companies rush to offload their waste ahead of the ban's start date.\nPonces, the photographer, says that seeing piles of plastic at Bangkok's recycling centers left a deep impression on him, and reinforced how enormous this global problem is.\nA man works amid a pile of plastic bottles prepared for recycling at one of Bangkok's informal recycling centers.

London CNN \u2014\nLondon CNN \u2014 Last week, former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson treated a Canadian crowd to a helping of his signature bombast.\n'The party of Winston Churchill wants to ban [cigars]?' he moaned. 'Donnez-moi un break, as they say in Quebec. It's just mad.'\nThe source of his ire was the proposed UK smoking ban, which was spearheaded by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at last October's Conservative Party Conference and underwent its second reading in the House of Commons on Tuesday evening.\nIn a free vote, the House leaned in favor of the plan by 383 to 67, meaning the bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle.\nUnder the proposed bill, no one born on or after January 1, 2009, would ever be allowed to buy tobacco, effectively raising the legal smoking age every year. This would mean today's 15-year-olds will never legally be able to buy cigarettes.\nDespite what Johnson may have led his audience to believe, a potential smoking ban enjoys broad popular support in the UK. A February survey by YouGov for the charity Action on Smoking and Health found that 71% of adults backed the goal of making Britain a country where no one smokes (12% are opposed). Like most people, I'm certain this would save many lives and relieve a massive strain on the National Health Service (NHS). Whether that goodwill proves sufficient to overcome the many obstacles still ahead remains to be seen.\n(NHS). Whether that goodwill proves sufficient to overcome the many obstacles still ahead remains to be seen. Johnson may have invoked one of the most tired clich\u00e9s in British politics (his obsession with Churchill's legacy is matched only by his obsession with his own), but in this instance, it's at least adjacent to something relevant. Conservative backbenchers led by former Prime Minister Liz Truss have condemned the proposed bill as 'profoundly unconservative,' adding that it 'only gives succor to those who wish to curtail freedom.'\n'only gives succor to those who wish to curtail freedom.' This, whatever people's politics, is a sticking point. Smoking isn't just the teenage rite of passage glamorized by shows like 'Skins' and 'Euphoria.' For some, it's synonymous with bodily autonomy. The health benefits of quitting \u2014 or better, never taking it up in the first place \u2014 are irrefutable. But for years, people have weighed the risks of cigarettes and decided they're worth it. As adults, we reserve the right to raise a glass in celebration, bake sugar-packed birthday cakes, drive a car, play extreme sports and do all manner of things that might ultimately harm us. It's our time, our money, our health to do with as we wish.\nvideo\nvideo Related video New Zealand scraps world's first youth smoking ban\nRelated video New Zealand scraps world's first youth smoking ban The harder line to draw is how severely our own pleasures should be curtailed for the sake of other people. The UK's 2007 ban on smoking indoors in public places was impactful partly because it vastly reduced children's exposure to second-hand smoke, a cause even the most committed smoker could get behind. It's one thing to puff away on the street, another to do so in a crowded restaurant almost directly into growing lungs.\nThen, there's the question of money. New Zealand's conservative National Party introduced a similar phased smoking ban last year, but reversed it before it went into effect to help pay for tax cuts. When Prohibition was introduced by the 18th Amendment in 1920s America imposing a ban on the sale, manufacture and transportation of alcohol, swathes of the population refused to comply. This resulted in a booming bootleg market and spiraling gang violence. It cost the federal government $11 billion in lost tax revenue and over $300 million to enforce, ultimately contributing to the Amendment's repeal in 1933.\nSmoking costs the NHS an estimated \u00a32.5 billion ($3.1 billion) every year, equivalent to 2% of the health service's budget. Cancer Research UK estimates that in 2022, the gross cost of smoking to public finances was \u00a320.6 billion ($25.7 billion), thanks to a combination of reduced tax revenue, increased benefits payments, unemployment, and premature death. The long-term economic benefits of a smoke-free Britain are obvious. But those savings would take time to materialize, and this government isn't known for staying its course.\nestimated \u00a32.5 billion ($3.1 billion) every year, equivalent to 2% of the health service's budget.

The long-term economic benefits of a smoke-free Britain are obvious. But those savings would take time to materialize, and this government isn't known for staying its course. If cigarettes were invented now, they'd probably never reach the stores. Sadly, getting rid of something the population is already acclimatized to is far trickier than never introducing it in the first place. A phased ban might be a gentler approach than forcing the nation to go cold turkey, but how it'll be enforced in practical terms is far from clear. Among other things, it raises the possibility that in 10 years, we could be in a position where a shopkeeper is 'too young' to smoke, but obliged to sell cigarettes to older people.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook The legal smoking age is a devolved issue, meaning the ban would only apply in England. Depending on how Wales and Scotland choose to proceed, someone who's unable to buy cigarettes in England might be able to do so across the border. And anyway, underage kids have never struggled to get hold of cigarettes in the past, so how will this be managed differently?\nThe Tory rebels' abhorrence of the 'nanny state' might be less sympathetic among the general public at a time when 250 people per week are dyingdue to NHS waiting lists and a cost of living crisis is stunting the growth of our children. Some who might once have blanched at the idea of state intervention may feel more amenable in this climate. The question is whether Rishi Sunak can make an enforceable plan and stick with it.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Opinion Holly Thomas,Holly Thomas","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-102165893.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@CNNOpinions","_score":3.650044,"_id":"7aca261374a47184c7b02e3d641d3dd7"},{"title":"Patagonia Houdini Jacket review: The ultralight travel essential","author":"Emily Pennington","published_date":"2024-04-16 20:26:46","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/patagonia-houdini-jacket","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Light as air and tough as nails. Dive into our review of the Patagonia Houdini Jacket, the ultimate travel companion for adventurers seeking lightweight, packable protection against wind and rain.","summary":"As a professional travel writer who spends nearly half the year on the road, I'm constantly looking for the best travel gear. Bonus points abound if my latest find is also ultralight and easy to shove into a backpack pocket.\nThat's why my current obsession is Patagonia's Houdini Jacket. This packable jacket is water-resistant and perfectly named because at its featherlight weight of 3.4 ounces, you'll hardly feel it in your pack or purse, like magic. Plus, this rain jacket packs down into its own zippered chest pouch, to a size compact enough to place into an ordinary pants pocket.\nI've had the Houdini for a little over a month now, and it's proven to be an excellent travel companion on hikes in the Rocky Mountains and a two-week trip to rainy, springtime Japan to photograph the cherry blossoms. It works well as a thin, insulating layer and easily sheds mellow rainstorms. Here's why it's a standout.\nPatagonia Houdini Jacket\nPatagonia At an impressively light 3.4 ounces, this windbreaker is light enough to take anywhere and can be easily tucked away into a pants pocket or purse. Features include a cinchable hood and a zippered chest pocket. Plus it's coated with a durable water-repellent finish, suitable for light rainstorms when you're on the go.\n$109 at Patagonia\nWhat we liked about it\nEmily Pennington/CNN Underscored\nPatagonia's Houdini Jacket is shockingly full-featured for a thin 3.4-ounce windbreaker. Here are a few things that stood out the most during our testing period.\nFeatherlight and packable\nEmily Pennington/CNN Underscored\nAt a barely-there, featherlight 3.4 ounces, this is the lightest name-brand windbreaker on the market today. It's so tiny that it's hard to justify not bringing it with you, even on the most fast-and-light excursions. The Houdini packs down small, into its zippered chest pocket, which is roughly the size of a fist when closed shut.\nOn my big trip to Japan to witness the annual cherry blossoms, it was easy to toss the Houdini into my purse or day bag for easy and stress-free city strolling. It worked well as a thin layer to warm up when I didn't want to cram a full-sized jacket or sweater in with my things. I could even fit it into my side pants pocket (though it did create a bulge) on a quick sunset photo outing in front of a rural ryokan (traditional inn) when I didn't want to be weighed down by my purse. The jacket proved so functional that I have half a mind to purchase a solid black one for my next trip, so I can match it better to subdued evening outfits.\nSurprisingly water-resistant\nEmily Pennington/CNN Underscored\nBefore I picked up the Houdini, I had been told by my Patagonia-obsessed friends that the jacket was decent at repelling moisture for up to an hour, and after that, it would wet through. 'Fair enough,' I thought to myself, not expecting to take it head-first into a deluge.\nHowever, on my seventh day in Japan, the heavens opened up, and I was faced with a rainy, hours-long stroll from one small village to the next along the fabled Nakasendo Trail. I had a second rain jacket with me, just in case, but I wanted to see how the Houdini would perform in extreme conditions. Amazingly, this little wonder held out against the pouring rain for a full 90 minutes, before soaking through a bit at the elbow creases. Pretty impressive.\nThoughtful details\nEmily Pennington/CNN Underscored\nWhen I'm speedily traveling from place to place, it can be easy for me to sometimes overlook the tiny, thoughtful details in a piece of ultralight apparel like the Patagonia Houdini Jacket. But the more I wore this windbreaker, the more I noticed small things that the brand chose to include, while still maintaining its petite profile.\nThe Houdini boasts several features you'd expect to see in a heavier raincoat, like a cinchable hood, carabiner clip loop, elastic wrist cuffs (to trap heat) and a zippered chest pocket. Unfortunately, there aren't hand pockets in this baby, likely to keep its weight and bulk down, but I found it easy enough to use the various pouches in my travel pants instead to store small items, like my wallet, lip balm and cell phone.\nWhat we didn't like about it\nOf course, at an ultralight 3.4 ounces, there's no way a wind- and rain-resistant jacket will be perfect or as full-featured as its heavier competitors. Here are a few things we'd like Patagonia to improve in the Houdini's next iteration.\nChest pocket is small\nEmily Pennington/CNN Underscored\nWhile I love that the Houdini jacket does provide wearers with a zippered security pocket, I was bummed when I realized that this pocket couldn't fit my regular-sized iPhone in its case. Like many travelers, I'm constantly popping my phone into and out of various bags, taking photos or looking up directions to the subway. On my Japanese walking tour, I tried to stash my phone away safely for quick access throughout our rainiest day and was disappointed when it simply wouldn't stash away into the jacket, no matter how hard I tried.\nThis petite chest pocket would be better served for a slim wallet and a lip balm or snack. The only plus side? Patagonia designed the Houdini to neatly fold away into the aforementioned tiny pouch, meaning that this jacket packs down ultra-small.\nNot fully waterproof\nEmily Pennington/CNN Underscored\nWhen I took the Houdini jacket, I knew it wouldn't stand up to the superior weather protection of a heavier, less-packable Gore-tex shell, like my trusty Arc'teryx Beta LT. Still, it's worth mentioning here that this little marvel is best suited for short, surprise thunderstorms and misty climates (like Seattle or Portland), not all-day downpours when hiking in the mountains. While testing it, I noticed that the jacket would soak through in about 75-90 minutes during heavy rains. Impressive, but not perfect.\nHow it compares\nBottom line\nIf you want a breathable, featherlight windbreaker that can easily be packed into your purse or pants pocket and easily sheds light rain, look no further than Patagonia's best-selling Houdini. At a paltry 3.4 ounces, this jacket is surprisingly feature-rich, boasting elastic cuffs, a zippered pocket and cinchable hood. It's so darn light and functional that it's going to practically live in my bag from now on.\nLooking for a travel credit card?

'Passengers should only come to Terminal 3 if they have received a confirmation from their airline regarding their flight departure.'\nAgency videos showed large crowds of passengers at the airport, which was recently named as the second busiest worldwide.\nStorms swept through the United Arab Emirates and surrounding countries on Tuesday, dumping 250 millimeters (around 10 inches) of precipitation in fewer than 24 hours in some areas \u2013 the heaviest rainfall witnessed in the region for 75 years.\nThe tarmac of Dubai International Airport was left submerged. Videos showed large jets plowing through the rippling water, sending up sprays in their wake. In the airport's terminals, hundreds of passengers were forced to wait as their flights were canceled or delayed.\nMohit Mehta, from Gurgaon in India, said he had spent more than 30 hours at the airport after trying to catch a morning flight out of Dubai on April 16.\n'[The] condition was really bad,' he told CNN. 'No one was there to answer the queries. It was all haywire. There [was] a lot of water logging inside the airport. A lot of leakage happening from the roof.'\nMehta added that a shortage of catering options in the airport's Terminal 1 meant large queues as people sought food and water, which he said was being sold a premium.\n'For eating and drinking there was scarcity at the airport.'\nOn Thursday, some 388 flights in or out of the airport were delayed and 30 canceled, according to airplane tracker site FlightAware. Of those delays, 246 were Emirates flights \u2013 more than 50% of the UAE flag carrier's services \u2013 and 86 were FlyDubai. Hundreds more had been canceled a day earlier.\nEmirates issued an apology to affected passengers. Some have taken to social media complaining they had been unable to contact the airline.\n'Emirates extends our sincerest apologies to impacted customers who have experienced delays and disruption to their travel plans caused by bad weather and road conditions,' the airline posted on X. 'We appreciate how difficult it is for everyone affected.\n'While some customers have been able to return home or reach their destination, we are aware that many are still waiting to get on flights. Our teams are working hard to restore our scheduled operations, as well as secure accommodation and other amenities for affected customers at the airport.\n'Our primary concern will always be the safety of our customers and crew, and this will never be compromised.'\nOne X user with the handle Mister Funk replied that they were struggling to contact the airline after being stranded in Amsterdam when their flight to Dubai was canceled.\n'We are unable to get a response from you from literally any number in the world, livechat is not responding,' they wrote. 'We are stuck in Amsterdam and are in need of help desperately.'\nSome 134 million passengers flew through the UAE's airports last year, including 87 million traveling through Dubai International Airport alone. The UAE is home to approximately 10 million people, and is a hub for five airlines.\nAccess roads to the airport were also hit as traffic ground to a halt. The rain fell so heavily and quickly that some motorists on some roads in Dubai were forced to abandon their vehicles as the floodwater rose and roads turned into rivers.\nThe storms were part of a pattern of extreme rainfall events emerging as the planet's atmosphere warms due to human-driven climate change. A warmer atmosphere is able to soak up more moisture like a towel and then ring it out in the form of flooding rainfall.\nThe weather conditions were associated with a larger storm system traversing the Arabian Peninsula and moving across the Gulf of Oman. This same system has also brought unusually wet weather to nearby Oman and southeastern Iran.\nIn Dubai, the rain meant delivery services were unable to function and many residents were unable to leave their homes due to waterlogged streets, which cars and pedestrians couldn't access. Some residents were seen rowing canoes outside their homes, and one viral video on social media showed residents wake boarding on a flooded street in a residential area.\nOther videos from social media showed water rushing through a major shopping mall and inundating the ground floor of homes.\nMadiha Khawaja, a tourist visiting from London with her husband and two children, aged two and four, said she felt 'helpless' trying to calm her children amid the chaos.\nThe rain had disrupted building lifts, including in some of Dubai's tallest skyscrapers. Khawaja said she spent 45 minutes taking the stairs to her 27th floor apartment in the heart of Dubai to find rest and shelter for her toddlers.\nThe journey was 'grueling,' she said, adding that 'upon reaching our apartment with hungry and tired kids, we were met with dry taps, no drinking water, no telephone service, no Wi-Fi connection.'\n'The kids were hungry, and I as a mother was getting very anxious and upset,' she told CNN.\nOn Thursday, the streets between the soaring skyscrapers of Dubai, were still covered by large pools of water while residents in several neighborhoods remain holed up at home avoiding blocked roads.\nMunicipal authorities were continuing to use trucks to pump water off the roads and clear debris blocking the streets. The Dubai municipality is also asking residents to send Whatsapp's to remove the accumulated rainwater.\nSheikh Zayed Road, a main highway connecting the entirety of Dubai has been difficult to access due to cleanups, leaving traffic congestions across the city as some metro stations remained non-operational.\nIn the nearby emirate of Sharjah, 65 community service patrols were deployed to the areas affected with rain while cleanups continued. Damage from the storm remained visible in different neighborhoods of Abu Dhabi.\nSchools will remain closed and federal workers will be working from home until Friday, the government said.\nUAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan has instructed authorities to 'quickly work' on evaluating the country's infrastructure and direct support to be provided to families impacted. He also ordered the transfer of families affected to safe locations in cooperation with local authorities.\nCNN's Mary Gilbert, Brandon Miller, Abbas Al Lawati, Teele Rebane, Kathleen Magramo, Mostafa Salem, Sophie Tanno and Eleni Giokos contributed reporting.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"travel","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Francesca Street,Mostafa Salem,Barry Neild,Nadeen Ebrahim","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-04-17t122203z-1855736598-rc2a87ard6pg-rtrmadp-3-emirate-weather-airport.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnntravel","_score":3.644454,"_id":"2d86c95cde78a830d3f302bbbd567dbd"},{"title":"What to see at the 2024 Venice Biennale","author":"Nicole Mowbray","published_date":"2024-04-18 09:03:54","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/18/style/venice-biennale-2024-what-to-see","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The 8-month festival of art and culture is this year themed around 'Foreigners Everywhere,' and will spotlight artists from diverse and marginalized backgrounds.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 This week sees the opening of the Venice Biennale, an 8-month-long festival of art and culture staged every other year. For 2024 \u2014 the show's 60th iteration \u2014 Brazilian curator Adriano Pedrosa has chosen the topic of 'Foreigners Everywhere,' and announced an intention to spotlight artists from diverse and historically marginalized backgrounds.\nThe theme, Pedrosa explained in a statement, has a dual meaning: 'First of all, that wherever you go and wherever you are you will always encounter foreigners\u2014they/we are everywhere,' he said. 'Secondly, that no matter where you find yourself, you are always, truly, and deep down inside, a foreigner.'\nSeen by many as an opportunity to see some of the world's best artists all in one place, the art biennale consists of three parts: A central show, housed in a series of sprawling industrial buildings; 88 national pavilions, most of which are located in the Giardini parkland area of the city; and finally, a series of satellite or 'collateral' exhibitions and pop-up events dotted throughout the city.\nWith the main event running from April 20 to November 24 2024, here's our pick of what to see if you're headed to Venice.\nOne of the most revolutionary and influential artists of the 20th century, de Kooning is the subject of a major exhibition exploring his time in Italy in 1959 and 1969 and the impact it had on his work. Spanning the 1950s to the 1980s, the show will bring together around 75 works, making this the largest presentation of the artist ever organized in Italy.\nGallerie dell'Accademia\nGallerie dell'Accademia Taking its title from a Nick Cave song of the same name, 'City of Refuge III' is the third in a series of exhibitions by Berlinde De Bruyckere thematizing art as a place of sanctuary and shelter. The sculptures and installations respond to the venue's spiritual intensity (a 16th century Benedictine church on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore).\nAbbazia di San Giorgio Maggiore\nAbbazia di San Giorgio Maggiore\nJuszkiewicz's renditions of old portraits serve a rebellious purpose. The intentional covering of historical faces confronts the essence of portraiture, transforming the images into potent symbols of women's struggles under patriarchy, unravelling the intricate threads of gender and identity and revealing a defiant spirit.\nPalazzo Cavanis, Fondamenta Zattere Ai Gesuati\nPalazzo Cavanis, Fondamenta Zattere Ai Gesuati One of the most important American photographers of the 20th century, Peter Hujar was a major figure in New York City's avant-garde community during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, when he documented the artistic life of the city. This exhibition assembles all 41 of the photographs that Hujar included in the book 'Portraits in Life and Death,' published in 1976.\nSanta Maria della Piet\u00e0, Palazzo Cavanis Dorsoduro\nSanta Maria della Piet\u00e0, Palazzo Cavanis Dorsoduro\nThis exhibition showcases the works of over 30 emerging and established international artists (including Cindy Sherman, Louise Bourgeois, Sarah Lucas, Irving Penn) spanning the realms of painting, sculpture, photography, and film. Exploring how breasts have been understood and represented in art across cultures and traditions, it reflects on a range of themes from motherhood, empowerment and sexuality to body image and illness.\nPalazzo Franchetti San Marco\nPalazzo Franchetti San Marco Works created with the participation of inmates from Giudecca women's prison will form part of the exhibition presented by the Vatican at this year's biennale which focuses on human rights and the experiences of those living on the margins of society.\nA 12-minute video installation directed by actor Zoe Saldana and her director and producer husband Marco Perego around the concept of freedom features some of the inmates as actors and works by the late Corita Kent, American pop artist, activist and former Catholic nun, will be displayed in the cafeteria.\nMaurizio Cattelan will also create a large outdoor installation for the presentation which Pope Francis is scheduled to visit on April 28.\nGiudecca Women's Prison\nGiudecca Women's Prison\nThis photography exhibition by Greenlandic artist Inuuteq Storch, curated by Louise Wolthers, marks the first time that the Danish Pavilion has showcased both a major exhibition by an artist from Greenland and a presentation dedicated to photography. Comprising of over 200 images, Storch's overarching project aims 'to tell the Greenlanders' visual history, not seen through the visitors' eyes, but through the Greenlanders' own,' and combines historical and family photographs with contemporary images of everyday life in Greenland.\nDanish Pavilion\nDanish Pavilion Known for his art films and multi-screen video installations, John Akmofrah explores major issues including racial injustice, colonial legacies, diasporic identities, migration, memory and climate change with a renewed focus on the act of listening and sound. The exhibition \u2014 commissioned by the British Council \u2014 has been conceived as a single installation with eight interlocking and overlapping multi-screen sound and time-based works and encourages the idea of listening as activism.\nBritish Pavilion\nBritish Pavilion\nThe first exhibition in Europe of one of Korea's most influential artists, including many works never exhibited before outside Korea. Yoo Youngkuk lived through war and occupation, but created vibrant, soaring abstractions inspired by Korea's natural landscape that influenced generations of Korean artists.\nFondazione Querini Stampalia\nFondazione Querini Stampalia This immersive exhibition will examine the life and work of the modernist painter dubbed 'India's Picasso.' Celebrating his versatility as an artist, thinker and writer, the show juxtaposes his wooden toys, paintings, photographs, letters and snippets from his films with collages, letters and poetry that shaped his vision of India as a richly layered 'cultural mosaic.'\nMagazzini del Sale\nMagazzini del Sale Two years into the Russian invasion, the Ukraine Pavilion will present a group show sharing similarities with the Biennale's 'Foreigner's Everyone' theme. Showcasing a diverse range of voices responding to the effects of war, the exhibition title refers to the practice of citizens of all ages and backgrounds meeting to weave camouflage nets \u2014 a symbol of the collective resistance of everyday Ukrainians.\nUkraine Pavilion\nUkraine Pavilion\nThis exhibition traces the creative career of Ai Weiwei, from 2006 to today, featuring a large selection of new works made between 2019 and 2023 using LEGO bricks alongside historical works made from porcelain, wood, marble, bamboo, and assemblages of different materials.\nGalleria Continua, San Gimignano\nGalleria Continua, San Gimignano Presented by the Bangkok Art Biennale Foundation in advance of the city's own biennale in October, 'The Spirits of Maritime Crossing' brings together 15 artists from the Global South from countries such as Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar and Singapore to explore themes of diaspora, displacement, and colonialism through the lens of ocean and sea travel. Spanning performance, painting, film and sculpture, the exhibition also draws parallels Venice and Bangkok, with the latter being known as the 'Venice of the East' due to its network of canals (khlongs) where people live, work and travel on a daily basis.\nPalazzo Smith Mangilli Valmarana\nPalazzo Smith Mangilli Valmarana During the summer of 2023, Koo collected scent memories for 'Odorama Cities' by asking people for their 'scent memory of Korea.' More than 600 written statements were received in response, which were then translated into 17 distinct scents created specifically for the pavilion. Each will be experienced alongside installations including mirroring infinity symbols, two floating wooden mo\u0308bius-shaped sculptures and a levitating, scent-diffusing bronze figure.\nSouth Korean Pavilion\nSouth Korean Pavilion\nThe first solo exhibition in Italy of Houston-based artist Rick Lowe takes place at Palazzo Grimani, home to a large collection of 16th-century Greek and Roman sculpture.

Lots of attention was on the WNBA draft this week, where Caitlin Clark, Kamilla Cardoso and Angel Reese were some of the NCAA stars to take their talents to the next level. It comes at a big moment for women's basketball, with viewership and ticket sales through the roof, and the next generation is paying attention. Their performance on the court is allowing more people to look at them and have like, they have favorite girl basketball players. 18 year old Joyce Edwards is the Gatorade Player of the year and committed to the University of South Carolina. That's the team that won the 2024 women's NCAA championship. I mean I'm just excited and I'm happy for the people who paved the way for me, like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese, you know, you got to give it up for them. High school senior Leah Harmon's committed to the University of Miami. She got to attend this week's draft and said she could feel the excellence, energy and love in the air. I just think that it's really good to see as a player that's going into college and seeing what they did in college and the attention they brought to women's basketball as a whole this year just is really inspiring. 18 year old Jaloni Cambridge is committed to Ohio State, where she'll play alongside her older sister. Jaloni thinks the entire freshman class has a lot to prove. But here's her advice for young women athletes... Don't let the haters, you know, bring you down honestly. You can do anything that a man can do. There are no limits to what you can do based off your gender. It doesn't matter. Cameron Clifford from Oklahoma told me his nine year old son Cal's been asking for a pet octopus since he was three. He is absolutely infatuated with octopuses, and so we knew pretty quickly that it wasn't something that was just going to be a fad. Well, last summer, Cameron told Cal he found out it was possible to actually own one. That's amazing. I never knew I could do that. And Cal's emotional reaction is what inspired the family to go all in. If you think about as a kid, like, what would be, like, the world's greatest thing to happen to me, that was him right then. 'So after months of intense planning and research, the Clifford family welcomed Terrance and started documenting their new pet chronicles on their viral TikTok account @doctoktopus. But things took an unexpected turn when they discovered that Terrance or Teri for short, was actually a female that had laid eggs. It's pretty rare for female octopuses to live after this. But Teri did, and so did dozens of her babies. It was something that not many people get to do or have the experience of seeing firsthand, especially in your kids room in Oklahoma. Now, Cameron says they found homes for all of Teri's offspring at research organizations and universities who can take good care of them. One dorm at Providence College teamed up to surprise their hall's security guard with a trip home to Nigeria for the first time in more than a decade. We just want to do something nice for someone who really deserved it. Daniel Singh, the RA, helped organize a GoFundMe to pay for James Mogaji's flights. James is one of those people that will get to know your name and where you live. Also someone who's willing to be patient and talk us through it and give us advice so we can improve. The dorm spread the word about the fundraiser at school and on social media, and within a week they had $3,000 of donations, and they were able to all surprise James with the money for his tickets home. Our gift to you is a trip to Nigeria. I don't know how much I can thank you guys. James was overwhelmed with emotion and teared up. God guys, how did I deserve this? And Daniel said there were a lot of hugs. It's something that, it's a picture and an image I'll never forget. It was just like, we're going to change this man's life. So not only did James get to book his flights, but Daniel says donations hit over a whopping $30,000 after a video of the surprise went viral, all of which will go to James. I hope you take some time to stop and appreciate the beauty Mother Nature has to offer on Monday for Earth Day. Personally, my favorite trees to hug are cherry blossoms. In Washington, D.C, the National Cherry Blossom Festival just ended, where thousands of people visit from near and far to see the beautiful pink and red flowers bloom. Did you know that Japan gave the U.S. 3000 cherry trees more than 100 years ago, that now line the National Mall and Tidal Basin Reservoir? Well, the country just committed to plant 250 more trees there in 2026 to honor the US's 250th birthday. And the gift comes just in time, because construction crews are going to start removing nearly 160 of these trees soon. Which is sad in the short term, but the National Park Service is doing it to strengthen the city's seawall for the long term against flooding. So even more of these iconic beauties can grow and blossom. Coming up, a new way to hitch a ride to space? Helium balloons. Stay with us to hear how that could work after a quick break.

Hey, Taylor. So how exactly does this work? Yeah. So good question. A few companies are working on these near space adventures. Now one is called Halo Space, where the plan is for a huge helium balloon to carry around a space capsule, and they just revealed their interior design of it. And the capsule can hold eight people and has a toilet and everything. And it plans to go all the way to the stratosphere, meaning you'll actually be in the atmosphere Krista and able to look back at Earth. I mean, wow, I bet the views are crazy, but I'm scared to ask how much it costs. So their goal is to start offering six hour commercial flights in 2026 for... wait for it, $164,000 a person. So granted, it is cheaper than some of the other options out there like SpaceX and Blue Origin, but it's definitely not cheap Krista. Oh my gosh. A six figure ticket for a six hour ride. I'm not going to lie, though, the idea of floating around the stars with just a balloon is a little scary, don't you think? For sure. Halo says it's already completed five successful test flights. But yeah, personally, I don't do very well with heights, so I don't think I'll be saving up for a ticket. Alright, that's all for now. Join us tomorrow for the next edition of One Thing.

A family in Oklahoma granted their son's wish to get a pet octopus, but they had no idea she would end up giving birth! A college dorm surprises their hall's security guard with the gift of a lifetime. Why a recent gift comes just in time for the iconic cherry blossom trees in Washington, DC. Plus, would you ride to the edge of space in a helium balloon?\nFor some more goodness on Saturdays, sign up for CNN's the Good Stuff newsletter.\nHey there! Need a breather from the breaking news? Then you're in the right place. Each Saturday, we focus on stories that remind us of the good stuff happening. You know, the kind of stuff that brings a smile to your face. One college dorm surprised their hall's security guard with a really thoughtful gift. We just wanted to do something nice for someone who really deserved it. Plus, what's the cheapest new way to get to the edge of space? Riding a balloon, apparently. From CNN, I'm Krista Bo and this is 5 Good Things. Lots of attention was on the WNBA draft this week, where Caitlin Clark, Kamilla Cardoso and Angel Reese were some of the NCAA stars to take their talents to the next level. It comes at a big moment for women's basketball, with viewership and ticket sales through the roof, and the next generation is paying attention. Their performance on the court is allowing more people to look at them and have like, they have favorite girl basketball players. 18 year old Joyce Edwards is the Gatorade Player of the year and committed to the University of South Carolina. That's the team that won the 2024 women's NCAA championship. I mean I'm just excited and I'm happy for the people who paved the way for me, like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese, you know, you got to give it up for them. High school senior Leah Harmon's committed to the University of Miami. She got to attend this week's draft and said she could feel the excellence, energy and love in the air. I just think that it's really good to see as a player that's going into college and seeing what they did in college and the attention they brought to women's basketball as a whole this year just is really inspiring. 18 year old Jaloni Cambridge is committed to Ohio State, where she'll play alongside her older sister. Jaloni thinks the entire freshman class has a lot to prove. But here's her advice for young women athletes... Don't let the haters, you know, bring you down honestly. You can do anything that a man can do. There are no limits to what you can do based off your gender. It doesn't matter. Cameron Clifford from Oklahoma told me his nine year old son Cal's been asking for a pet octopus since he was three. He is absolutely infatuated with octopuses, and so we knew pretty quickly that it wasn't something that was just going to be a fad. Well, last summer, Cameron told Cal he found out it was possible to actually own one. That's amazing. I never knew I could do that. And Cal's emotional reaction is what inspired the family to go all in. If you think about as a kid, like, what would be, like, the world's greatest thing to happen to me, that was him right then. 'So after months of intense planning and research, the Clifford family welcomed Terrance and started documenting their new pet chronicles on their viral TikTok account @doctoktopus. But things took an unexpected turn when they discovered that Terrance or Teri for short, was actually a female that had laid eggs. It's pretty rare for female octopuses to live after this. But Teri did, and so did dozens of her babies. It was something that not many people get to do or have the experience of seeing firsthand, especially in your kids room in Oklahoma. Now, Cameron says they found homes for all of Teri's offspring at research organizations and universities who can take good care of them. One dorm at Providence College teamed up to surprise their hall's security guard with a trip home to Nigeria for the first time in more than a decade. We just want to do something nice for someone who really deserved it. Daniel Singh, the RA, helped organize a GoFundMe to pay for James Mogaji's flights. James is one of those people that will get to know your name and where you live. Also someone who's willing to be patient and talk us through it and give us advice so we can improve. The dorm spread the word about the fundraiser at school and on social media, and within a week they had $3,000 of donations, and they were able to all surprise James with the money for his tickets home. Our gift to you is a trip to Nigeria. I don't know how much I can thank you guys. James was overwhelmed with emotion and teared up. God guys, how did I deserve this? And Daniel said there were a lot of hugs. It's something that, it's a picture and an image I'll never forget. It was just like, we're going to change this man's life. So not only did James get to book his flights, but Daniel says donations hit over a whopping $30,000 after a video of the surprise went viral, all of which will go to James.

'Elephant Vs. Man' with CNN Chief International Security Correspondent Nick Paton Walsh premieres Sunday, April 21 at 8pm ET/PT on CNN. In Sri Lanka, it's an all-out war between man and the Asian elephant. As the human population surges and their territories expand, the habitats for elephants are rapidly shrinking, leading to daily confrontations between the people who are trying to protect their homes, and the elephants who are losing theirs. Paton Walsh embeds with locals on overnight patrols who risk their lives to protect their crops from being trampled and villages from being charged by elephants during the night.\n'This is not just a story about us taking away the spaces and greenery elephants have existed upon for centuries: be in no doubt, we are forcing them into tinier spaces so we can have more and more for ourselves, all the time, in the name of growth. It is a story about every fight for space happening on the planet now,' said Paton Walsh. 'Wars, migration, land disputes \u2013 they are all a symptom of our species' ravenous need to expand. In Sri Lanka, it is visually writ large. Elephants and people do not naturally interact, but here they scrap over a pumpkin. This conflict, which kills hundreds on both sides every year, is just a very vivid way of seeing the impact of our greed on the natural world that sustains us.'\nThere are about 6,000 elephants in Sri Lanka and in 2023 humans killed 476 of them; elephants killed 169 people. As both elephants and people continue to die at an alarming rate, this violent struggle may be an ominous sign of what's in store for other wildlife across the globe impacted by climate change and human expansion.\nThe Whole Story with Anderson Cooper is executive produced by Susan Chun .\nThe Whole Story with Anderson Cooper is executive produced by Susan Chun.

They will gather all your wealth and distribute it among those who have more children. They will distribute among infiltrators,' Modi said to thunderous roars from the audience.\n'Do you think your hard-earned money should be given to infiltrators? Would you accept this?' Modi said.\nThose remarks have been seized on by the opposition, who have long accused Modi and the BJP of using divisive rhetoric to turbo-charge their increasingly popular brand of Hindu nationalism.\nOpposition members have called on the Election Commission of India (ECI) to investigate whether Modi's comments break the body's code of conduct.\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking during a rally in Sydney, Australia, on May 23, 2023.\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking during a rally in Sydney, Australia, on May 23, 2023.\nMatthew Abbott/The New York Times/Redux Narendra Modi was born in 1950, three years after India's independence, to mother Hiraben and father Damodardas, a teaseller, in the western state of Gujarat.

Activity which 'may aggravate differences or create mutual hatred or cause tension' between communities and religions, is also not allowed.\nCNN has contacted the ECI for comment.\nModi received widespread backlash from members of the Muslim community for his comments at a time when many fear a third BJP term will deepen the communal fissures already running through the country.\n'This is not a dogwhistle, this is a targeted, direct, brazen hate speech against a community,' prominent Muslim journalist Rana Ayyub wrote on X.\nMuslim lawmaker and president of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen, Asaduddin Owaisi, said: 'Modi today called Muslims infiltrators and people with many children. Since 2002 till this day, the only Modi guarantee has been to abuse Muslims and get votes.'\nCongress chief Mallikarjun Kharge described Modi's comments as 'hate speech' and 'a well thought out ploy to divert attention.'\n'Today the prime minister did what he has learnt from the values of the Sangh,' referring to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) a right-wing Hindu paramilitary organization, which Modi was once a youth member of and to which the BJP is affiliated with. 'In the history of India, no prime minister has lowered the dignity of his post as much as Modi has.'\nModi swept to power in 2014 on a promise of development and anti-corruption, rising in popularity during his term and getting re-elected five years later \u2013 the second time on a more openly Hindu nationalist ticket.\nOver the last decade, Modi and his BJP have been accused of driving religious polarization with their Hindu nationalist policies, giving rise to a wave of Islamophobia and deadly communal clashes in the world's largest secular democracy.\nIndia's minority Muslim population is enormous \u2013 some 230 million people \u2013 and Muslims have lived in what is now modern India for centuries. But a false conspiracy voiced by some Hindu nationalists is to accuse Muslims of being somehow outsiders and spreading a false narrative that they are displacing the country's Hindu population by deliberately having large families.\nThe BJP has repeatedly said it does not discriminate based on religion and treats all citizens equally.\nBut research, reporting and rights groups say divisions have increased in the country of 1.4 billion people.\nAnti-Muslim speech has risen dramatically, a recent report by the Washington-based research group India Hate Lab showed, which documented 668 such cases in 2023. Of these cases, 75% took place in BJP-ruled states, the report said.\nIndia prohibits hate speech under several sections of its penal code, including a section which criminalizes 'deliberate and malicious acts' intended to insult religious beliefs, but rights groups say there is a lack of immediate and adequate action against the alleged perpetrators of such acts, giving right-wing extremists tacit support.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Rhea Mogul","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap24091522580573.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":3.0590172,"_id":"4f8bca292b13b215b37a61a84046a878"},{"title":"To my son, born in the climate crisis: These helpers changed the fate of the titi","author":"Bill Weir","published_date":"2024-04-22 09:00:26","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/22/climate/climate-crisis-earth-day-letter-weir-c2e","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"When disasters strike, I remember the advice of Mister Rogers: 'Look for the helpers.

'I mean, how could you not?' Rosamira Guillen laughed, gesturing up at the family above.\nWhen she learned that the illegal pet trade and slash-and-burn cattle ranching were erasing a species that lived only in her homeland of Colombia, her architect mind suddenly shifted from building zoos to rebuilding forests.\nAnd River, it didn't take long to understand that this job could not be done by dropping seeds from drones. It would take shovels and sweat and an intimate acre-by-acre knowledge of the ecology. It would take community organizing and youth education and economic development so the titi's human neighbors wouldn't need to cut down trees and poach animals to survive.\nBut to connect enough fragmented habitat for the remaining gene pool to thrive, she would need land. And the cooperation of cattle ranchers who do not share her love for toy-sized primates.\n'I would be happy to just hang out with the monkeys and in the forest than to have to interact with people,' she laughed as we bumped over dirt roads in her worn pickup, and described how wanton deforestation can change water cycles and trigger ecosystem crash.\n'In a country like Colombia, where there's so many challenges, people don't realize that if you screw up the forest we're all going to be screwed. The ranchers see us as romantic,' she laughed with grim resignation.\nBut still, Rosamira wanted to be a helper, and in a search for funding met an American super-helper named Charlie Knowles.\nAs the scion of a family that invented the small microphones used in everything from Apollo spacecraft to Richard Nixon's office to the iPhone, Charlie went into software and made enough of a fortune to retire at 34. Inspired by the story of biologist Laurie Marker who sold all her possessions and moved to Namibia to save cheetahs, Charlie told me he felt the same calling but knew that he had none of the skills required.\n'What are my core competencies?' he asked himself. 'I'm really good at throwing parties and raising money.'\nWith a cheetah borrowed from a petting zoo as a conversation starter, his first party raised $5,000, and with kindred souls from Silicon Valley, he set out to disrupt the world of nature philanthropy. 'I became really frustrated by the lack of transparency,' Charlie told me. 'I didn't feel I knew where my money was going or what the impact it was having.'\nSo \u2013 alongside Akiko Yamazaki, John Lukas \u2013 Charlie co-founded the Wildlife Conservation Network and instead of telling donors to simply write a check and trust the process, WCN set out to create venture capital for animals like the titi and helpers like Rosamira.\nThey created expos to connect philanthropists in wealthy American suburbs with data-proven, wilderness-restoring, boots-on-the-ground conservationists. And they helped those folks make their operations more efficient and effective and often expanded their original vision of what was possible.\nMore than 20 years later, Charlie tells me that WCN supports hundreds of projects around the world with raves from the likes of Jane Goodall and a rare perfect score of 100 from the watchdog Charity Navigator.\nOne million-dollar donation funded over 200 scholarships for kids to study conservation. Another donor personally installed over 50 solar power arrays around the world. And at an expo in 2006, the fate of the titis turned for the better when the Vargas family walked in.\n'I told my 12-year-old daughter, Kira, to go interview all the conservationists at the expo,' Chris Vargas told me. As another successful tech entrepreneur with a heart for wildlife and some money to give, he was searching for maximum bang for his buck.\n'And on the drive home. I said, \u2018Who is your favorite?' Mine was Rosamira. She's Steve Jobs and Jane Goodall all wrapped into one. Her energy, her passion, her clarity of purpose and her just sheer ingenuity,' Chris said. 'But I wanted my daughter's vote, without missing a beat she goes, \u2018Daddy, you know that that woman from Colombia? Rosamira? She was my favorite'. So we high fived.'\nFor 18 years, the Vargas family would support Rosamira as she revived her corner of Colombia, one tree at a time. But when she needed $1.2 million to buy nearly 1,000 acres of neighboring ranchland, Chris needed to find more helpers.\n'We thought, \u2018Why don't we just build a website? And build a technology that lets anybody in the world click on a map, pick an acre, pick ten acres, pick 50 acres, and get all that feedback one exactly what happened with your money.''\nCombining the eyes of a satellite and the hearts of nature lovers, Chris began an experiment in crowdsourced conservation he called ReWorld.\nFor a one-time donation of around $1,200, he promised to secure two-and-a-half acres of degraded Colombian forest, bring it back to life and preserve it for the titis forever. Thanks to real-time images from the satellite, the donors would be able to watch their hectare grow from scrub brush and dirt into trees that look like broccoli tops from the sky.\nRiver, after we watched the cotton-topped titis pass by, I followed Rosamira's team to a shady gully where I planted a tree dedicated to you and your sister, Olivia. We flew home, and after my story of the titis aired just once on CNN, enough helpers pitched in to buy the ranch.\nI just got word that Rosamira signed the papers today.\n'It may take a day to cut a hectare of forest,' she told me as we hiked past her plantings and into a meticulous greenhouse. 'But to rebuild it, it takes about 20 years.'\nWhat happens now? Well, Charlie and Chris are hoping the developed world will build trustworthy and verifiable carbon and biodiversity credit markets to help fund operations like Project Titi, though they both admit it will be incredibly complicated.\nStill, River, when days get dark and I feel that need to look for the helpers, I sometimes flash to the series of fortunate events that gave almost 1,000 acres of forest to the titis \u2014 and I imagine all the spots that need similar love.\nWith enough helpers, what else is possible?\nEditor's note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions.

'There is no level playing field in this election.'\nIt echoed a similar rally more than 40 years earlier on the same spot, when opposition leaders fired up huge crowds to help change the course of the 1977 election \u2013 ending the 10-year rule of India's powerful third prime minister and political scion Indira Gandhi.\nGandhi had imposed a state of emergency, jailed key opposition leaders and curtailed civil freedoms. To some, India's future was perched on a needle point between autocracy and democracy.

Such levels of popularity for a two-term incumbent prime minister defy all modern conventions, both in India and throughout much of the democratic world.\nBut India's opposition leaders accuse Modi's right-wing government of becoming an electoral autocracy by attempting to rig the vote, weaponizing state agencies to stifle, attack and arrest opposition politicians, and undermining democratic principles ahead of elections, which began on April 19 and run until June 1, with results counted on June 4.\nThey also warn Modi's brand of Hindu nationalism is uncorking dangerous religious divides in a country with a long and tragic history of sectarian bloodletting.\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking during a rally in Sydney, Australia, on May 23, 2023.\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking during a rally in Sydney, Australia, on May 23, 2023.\nMatthew Abbott/The New York Times/Redux Narendra Modi was born in 1950, three years after India's independence, to mother Hiraben and father Damodardas, a teaseller, in the western state of Gujarat.

It has been beset by ideological differences, has seen a host of defections to the BJP and, even with the election in full swing, has yet to even name a prime ministerial candidate.\n'What kind of a democracy can you have if you don't have a vibrant opposition, a robust opposition that can question the government?' asks Arati Jerath, an independent political commentator and journalist.\n'That's why it's not really a question of whether Modi wins or not, it's a question of keeping the opposition alive to fight another day so that democracy in India survives.'\n\u2018Scorched earth'\nAmong those leading the charge for the opposition alliance is Rahul Gandhi, longtime face of the Congress and the latest member of his family to bid for power.\nHe is the son of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. His grandmother Indira was India's first female leader, and his great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the country's founding prime minister.\n'If the BJP wins these fixed elections and changes the constitution, the country will be on fire. Remember this,' Rahul Gandhi told the crowd in Delhi last month.\nThe BJP and its allies are gunning for a supermajority of more than two-thirds of the seats in India's parliament, the Lok Sabha. A rising fear among critics is that this would give the BJP the power to change India's constitution, which is rooted in the democratic principles of justice, liberty, equality and \u2013 crucially \u2013 secularism.\nThe BJP has repeatedly denied it has plans to change the constitution.\nCongress party leader Rahul Gandhi speaks during a press conference in New Delhi on March 25, 2023.\nCongress party leader Rahul Gandhi speaks during a press conference in New Delhi on March 25, 2023.\nMoney Sharma/AFP/Getty Images\n'When I say that I have big plans, no one should be scared. I don't take decisions to scare or run over anyone, I take decisions for the wholesome development of the nation,' Modi said in an interview with Indian news agency ANI earlier this week.\nBut the party has already begun publicly pulling India's government away from its secular foundation and leading BJP figures have openly advocated for the country to be declared a Hindu nation.\n'There shouldn't be politics on the basis of religion in any country, they should talk about real issues. Until people's financial situation improves, there won't be any social reform,' said voter Mohammad Irfan at the opposition rally in Delhi.\nOpposition parties have found themselves facing a slew of legal and financial challenges in the run-up to this year's election.\nGandhi's Congress \u2013 the largest party in the INDIA alliance \u2014 has accused the BJP of 'tax terrorism' and crippling its ability to campaign after its accounts were frozen by the tax department, leaving it unable to use some $20 million in funds. It has also been landed with a $218 million tax bill.\nThen came the arrest of Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi chief minister and head of the popular Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).\nKejriwal's detention on graft allegations came after the announcement of the general election last month, sparking protests in the capital. Analysts say it's the first time in post-independence history that an Indian chief minister has governed from behind bars.\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal speaks during a protest against alleged attacks on federalism by the federal government, in New Delhi, India, on February 8, 2024.\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal speaks during a protest against alleged attacks on federalism by the federal government, in New Delhi, India, on February 8, 2024.\nAltaf Qadri/AP\nKejriwal has denied the allegations, claiming they are politically motivated. He is just one of several prominent members of the opposition, including three other senior AAP leaders, that have also been arrested or investigated by state agencies in moves decried as political by their parties.\n'I think there are very serious concerns about how free and fair the elections are going to be in India this time around,' said Atishi, Delhi minister of education for the AAP, who goes by one name.\nReports have emerged of opposition party members being coerced into joining the BJP with the threat of arrest, while they were under investigation by state agencies. Other reports suggest politicians have had their probes dropped after switching sides.\nAtishi said she was also approached to switch to the BJP. 'Either you join the ruling party, and then the cases are closed or put into cold storage or if you don't, like the Aam Aadmi Party leaders, then the cases go ahead and you're arrested and put into jail,' she said, without specifically naming who approached her.\nCNN cannot independently confirm the incidents and has reached out to the BJP for comment.\nIn his interview with ANI, Modi denied any sliding of democracy under his rule and emphasized the independence of the Election Commission and state agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate, saying political leaders make up just 3% of cases.\n'Shouldn't we let the ED work independently when it is supposed to do so?' he said. 'I am convinced that corruption has destroyed the country. We should fight against corruption with our full strength.'\nAnalyst Jerath said a BJP-led campaign to weaken the opposition was part of Modi's 'scorched earth policy.'\n'Just wipe out whatever comes in your way so that this juggernaut can move on without any kind of challenge, without any obstruction,' she said.\nGandhi \u2018not a contender'\nModi is enduringly popular, analysts say, appealing to both the poor and the affluent, especially among much of the roughly 80% of India's population who are Hindu.\nDuring his 10 years in power, he has launched a raft of welfare policies including free food handouts, housing, cheap gas cylinders for women and infrastructure projects.\nIndia is also the world's fastest-growing major economy and Modi's presence on the world stage \u2014 including hosting the G20 \u2014 has cemented the country as a modern global power, along with a history-making moon landing.\nAuthor Christophe Jaffrelot told CNN Modi makes people feel 'proud again of being Indian.'\n'There is a sense in India, a constant sense, of vulnerability, a lack of self-esteem. So to be recognized as a great power in spite of everything, (that) is attributed to him,' he said.\nThat does not mean there aren't key issues the opposition could rally around, analysts say, including the BJP's failure to increase education opportunities or improve health infrastructure \u2013 especially following the coronavirus pandemic, which hit India especially hard.\nYouth unemployment also remains a huge problem, close to 50% among 20-to-24-year-olds.\nBut the INDIA alliance has failed to capitalize on these weak spots, Jerath said.\n'They haven't been able to weave together a cohesive kind of campaign, come up with a catchy slogan that will fire the imagination of the voting public,' she said.\nCongress leader Gandhi is one of the few opposition figures considered to have the kind of star power and name recognition to stand against Modi.\nBut though he may have the name, Gandhi lacks leadership skills, some analysts say.\nRasheed Kidwai, journalist and author of '24 Akbar Road,' a history of the Congress party, said it's a winner-takes-all election and there is 'no silver medal in politics.'\n'The problem with INDIA alliance is there is nobody who has that kind of hunger, who has that kind of personal(ity), who has that kind of inner sense of belonging or ownership to go in this election. Rahul is doing it but is not a contender,' he said.\nGandhi recently completed a 6,713-kilometer (4,200-mile) walk across the country, starting in the violence-hit northeastern state of Manipur, to raise issues of poverty, unemployment, diversity and democracy with voters.\nDespite these efforts, the BJP has dominated the campaign narrative.\nA key gauge of opposition strength will be in those parts of India where the BJP has historically failed to make inroads.\nSupporters of the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) participate in an election campaign rally on Hill Cart Road in Siliguri, India, on April 16, 2024.\nSupporters of the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) participate in an election campaign rally on Hill Cart Road in Siliguri, India, on April 16, 2024.\nDiptendu Dutta/NurPhoto/Getty Images\nRegional opposition heavyweights, such as the West Bengal chief minister and All India Trinamool Congress head Mamata Banerjee and the south's Tamil Nadu chief minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin, will be vying to block a BJP takeover in their respective states.\nBut the only other major national party is the Congress, which has been the main opposition since 2014.\nCongress governed the country for much of the 77 years since independence, and while it was once a powerful political force with its legacy rooted in the formation of modern India, it now finds itself in the doldrums, dogged by infighting and accusations of corruption within the party.\n'In the Congress, the best and brightest are not fighting the election,' Kidwai said.\nAnalysts say that during a decade in opposition, Congress has failed to rebuild its organization and political machinery to effectively take on the BJP.\nThe Congress organization has 'decayed and almost died over the years, particularly in north India, and particularly in Uttar Pradesh, which is the largest, most populous state,' Jerath said.\n'There was a time after independence, and for many years after independence, that they used to say that you would find a Congress flag in every single village in India,' she said. 'That's no longer true.'\nStill, there is optimism from some.\nThe AAP's Atishi said that despite repeated attacks against her party, it has been able to defeat the BJP in Delhi again and again.\n'Democracy becoming an autocracy \u2026 That is what we are fighting against,' she said. 'I think that the people of India have always voted very sensibly, and we hope that they do so this time.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Helen Regan,Rhea Mogul","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2147820411.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":2.772315,"_id":"d9d77c90c6fbf24426f2f6910912f042"},{"title":"Rit Dye review: Renew your old, stained clothes with dye","author":"Emma Sarran Webster","published_date":"2024-04-17 15:17:33","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/rit-dye","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Don't throw away your old clothes.

We tried Rit Dye, and we love how it can help extend the lifespan of your closet, all while being a ton of fun.","summary":"This article is a part of CNN Underscored's Earth Week, a weeklong focus on our planet and ways to celebrate and preserve it. We'll be featuring tips on how to live more sustainably, products to help you spend more time in nature and exclusive deals all week, so check in every morning to see what's new and be sure to subscribe to the CNN Underscored newsletter to see it all.\nWe can't expect to love every article of clothing we buy forever \u2014 or for every item to remain free of blemishes and tears \u2014 but that doesn't mean sending them to the landfill should be the default. Considering fashion's role in the climate emergency, it's crucial to extend the lives of pieces we own whenever possible. Mending is one way to do that; dyeing is another. And if you've spent enough time on sustainable living social media, you've probably come across some pretty creative 'thrift flips' and DIY projects involving fabric dye; that's exactly how I learned about Rit, a 100-plus-year-old brand of dyes for clothes and more.\nWhile Rit has been around since long before social media, it's enjoying a resurgence in popularity alongside the rise of visible mending, thrift-flipping and sustainable fashion. Head to the company's website or social media, and you can easily fall down the rabbit hole of creative and inspiring projects that use Rit Dye to revitalize clothes, shoes, holiday decorations and even furniture. After seeing enough such projects pop up on my own feed, I knew I had to try Rit Dye myself.\nRit Back to Black Dye Kit\nRit You don't have to give up on your favorite black jeans or sweats just because they're faded; Rit's Back to Black Dye Kit makes it easy to refresh the jet-black shade with liquid dye, a color-stay solution and rubber gloves.\n$14 $10 at Amazon\n$14 $10 at Amazon\nWhat is Rit Dye?\nRit's two main products are the liquid All-Purpose Dye, a dye primarily for 'natural' fabrics like cotton, linen and silk; and DyeMore for Synthetics, a liquid specially formulated for synthetic fabrics like polyester, acrylic and acetate (a necessary distinction because of how natural versus synthetic materials absorb and hold onto colors). The former also comes in a powder.\nPer the website, the dyes are made with 'a combination of various acid, disperse and direct dyes, along with sodium chloride,' and all have been deemed non-toxic by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (though they're not food-grade \u2014 so you should pass on dyeing any toys your kids or pets might chew on). The dyes are also sewer- and septic-safe, so you can rinse and pour excess down your drain with peace of mind that they won't destroy the plumbing.\nHow does Rit Dye work?\nThough the processes vary slightly depending on which specific product you're using, Rit works by using hot water to loosen the fibers of your fabric, allowing the dye to bond. If you're going for a solid color on a natural fabric, you can achieve it with one of three main methods: sink or bucket, stovetop or washing machine.\nEmma Sarran Webster/CNN Underscored\nAll three methods essentially involve immersing your item in a high-temperature dye bath for anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour, then rinsing in cool water to get rid of excess dye and washing in warm water to set the color. Because synthetic materials are more dependent on high heat to accept the dye, if you're dyeing fabric that contains more than 35% synthetic materials, you'll have to go the stovetop route to maintain the near-boiling water temperature.\nWhat we liked about it\nGiving clothes a second life\nWhile Rit isn't a perfectly eco-friendly product \u2014 the bottles are made from plastic, the dyes are made from (albeit 'non-toxic') chemicals and the website doesn't offer any information on sustainable or ethical manufacturing \u2014 it still offers consumers an opportunity to meaningfully cut back on excess waste and new purchases. According to a Rit Dye blog post citing a Hult International Business School study, revitalizing four shirts with Rit's products instead of buying four new ones can reduce your CO2 emissions by 74%. It goes hand-in-hand with the ethos behind mending \u2014 how can we look at our items through a different lens and give them new life before discarding them without a second thought?\nEmma Sarran Webster/CNN Underscored\nEmma Sarran Webster/CNN Underscored\nWhile I haven't measured the associated emissions, I can definitively say that I've used Rit Dye to bring plenty of garments back from the brink of the donation pile \u2014 or worse, landfill. The first product I tested was a white bathing suit top that I bought back in 2015 but stopped wearing a couple of years back because of accumulated sand and sunscreen discoloration. I was reluctant to get rid of it (most people don't want to buy stained garments, so it probably would've wound up in the trash), so I was thrilled when I realized I could dye it another color and extend its life. Rit's website says its dye won't cover stains, but I tried anyway and found it actually worked \u2014 or at least, masked the blemishes enough to make them unnoticeable.\nAfter my first successful dye project, I went on to revive plenty more pieces. Instead of donating a white blouse that I never wore and then buying a more colorful one in its place, I was able to transform the former into the latter. I also revived faded black secondhand jeans and a button-up shirt, a tank with a bizarre, faint laundry stain, a white linen coverup, a black-and-white striped dress and, in my first non-clothing Rit attempt, a mini wooden chest of drawers.\nEase of use\nRit Dye offers an easy and relatively turnkey method for giving your clothes new color and life. The dye bottles themselves include basic written instructions, with even more detailed guides on the Rit website. There, you can find in-depth tutorials \u2014 with photos and sometimes videos \u2014 of nearly every technique and use of Rit products. It can seem overwhelming at first, but the step-by-step instructions are clear and easy to follow. Depending on your setup and project specifics, you can definitely get some dyeing done in the span of an hour or two (maybe even less, if you're efficient).\nEmma Sarran Webster/CNN Underscored\nI tested both the liquid and powder dyes; both were easy enough to use, though I generally preferred the former over the latter. The liquid is pre-mixed, but the powder has to be dissolved in hot water before going into the main dye bath, adding an extra step. If you're not planning to use your dye right away and are tight on storage space, though, the powder comes in nice, small boxes that take up significantly less space than the bottles.\nWide variety of colors\nRit offers a vast selection of dye colors that take you well beyond the class ROYGBIV rainbow shades, and if you still can't find quite what you're looking for, you can use the incredibly extensive color formula guide and color mixing instructions to create it yourself. So far, I've experimented with hyacinth, fuschia and tangerine all-purpose liquid dye, fuschia, golden yellow, tangerine and teal all-purpose powder dye, peacock green DyeMore for Synthetics liquid dye and the Back to Black Kit and have loved all of the outcomes.\nEmma Sarran Webster/CNN Underscored\nBy and large, the end results reflected the color indicated on the packaging pretty closely, though the depth of color depends on how concentrated your dye bath is, how long you leave the material in it and the material itself \u2014 for example, the peacock green synthetic dye resulted in a very different shade on my white polyester blouse than my white-and-black striped rayon dress \u2014 but that's part of the fun of it, in my opinion, because it expands the possibilities of what you can do with a single product.\nI used the Back to Black kit, which includes jet black All-Purpose Dye, ColorStay Dye Fixative and a pair of rubber gloves, on two faded black secondhand items: jeans and a button-down shirt. The process is the same as with the other colors \u2014 plus the added step of a dye fixative bath before rinsing \u2014 and I'm pleased to say after many wears of each, the deep black color remains. You can buy black dye and the color fixative separately (they're $5 each, while the kit is $11\nEndless creative possibilities\nIn addition to dyeing garments solid colors, you can get creative with techniques like tie-dye, shibori, ombre, marbling and more. When it came to my first project \u2014 the aforementioned white bikini top \u2014 I was too excited and indecisive to choose one technique, so I opted for two. I started with Rit's shaving cream method to marble-dye one half, and it couldn't have been easier (it was also the fastest of all the techniques I tested because you only have to leave your fabric on the dye for a minute or two). For the other side of the bikini, I went with the classic stovetop method; it was a bit tough to keep half of the top in the pot and half out, so the resulting solid color is slightly uneven, but it works.\nEmma Sarran Webster/CNN Underscored\nEmma Sarran Webster/CNN Underscored\nI also tried ice dyeing with Rit's powder dye, attempting both techniques featured on Rit's website. I used the scrunch method on a thrifted white linen cover-up that I was always hesitant to wear because didn't trust myself to keep it clean at the beach, and it worked like a charm. Once I dyed it so that the white portions were minimal, I couldn't wait to wear it \u2014 and, in fact, broke it out on my next beach visit.\nI'll need to give the incline method another go \u2014 it was tougher to keep the colors separated than it looked in the video tutorial, and I didn't love the final result (something I realized only after I set the dye with a rinse and wash). Silver lining: It gave me an opportunity to try Rit's Color Remover, a chlorine-free solution meant to remove dye and other stains from whites, or existing color from natural fabrics before you re-dye them. The instructions recommend using Color Remover in a well-ventilated area, so I opted for the bucket method on my back deck; by the end of the approximately 20-minute bath, most \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the dye was gone from my tank. My best guess as to why the solution didn't remove everything is that, per the instructions, the sink or bucket method is less reliable than the stovetop method; regardless, I'm actually happy with the remaining faint pattern on my shirt, so it was a win for me.\nNot just for clothes\nRit Dye can be used for more than what's in your closet (or fabrics in general); you can also dye countless other materials, including plastic, paper, feathers, cork, clay and (unfinished) wood. That knowledge came in handy when I unexpectedly received a miniature wooden chest of drawers in the mail as part of a gift packaging. I realized I could use the drawers to store craft supplies, but the wood was unfinished and pretty uninteresting. I mixed some orange all-purpose dye with hot water and used the brush method to paint a color-blocked design.\nUnlike other paints, Rit Dye is transparent enough that you can still see the wood grain through the color, resulting in a nice, 'natural' look. The next non-clothing item on my list: shoes. I'm excited to revive some white canvas slip-ons that have seen better days and to dye my ancient gray Ugg boots black.\nWhat we didn't like about it\nLack of sustainability information\nWhile Rit Dye is a fantastic tool for revitalizing old items to keep them out of landfills \u2014 and to keep you from buying more unnecessarily \u2014 the only sustainability and ethics information on its website focuses on that aspect. There's no transparency about the manufacturing process, the packaging (the liquid dye is in plastic bottles) or the company's labor practices. While we know the Consumer Product Safety Commission classifies the dyes as non-toxic and, according to product safety sheets, they're not considered to be hazardous to health 'at their given concentrations,' the ecological information on those safety sheets simply says 'long-term ecological studies have not been conducted for this product.' (It's also worth noting that while the dyes aren't considered health hazards, that may not be the case for all of Rit's dyeing aids and laundry additives. The ColorStay Dye Fixative, for example, can cause 'mild skin irritation' and 'eye irritation,' though I didn't experience either while using it \u2014 so if you're concerned, be sure to check out the info before you use a product.)\nEmma Sarran Webster/CNN Underscored\nThat said, this is one of those things that may be best viewed through an 'imperfect environmentalist' lens. Sure, you can DIY dyes from fruits and veggies, but plant dyes tend not to adhere well to synthetic fabrics, and if you're not up for the task (or are concerned about fading), using something like Rit still seems like a more earth-friendly option than disposing and re-buying \u2014 especially if what you re-buy is dyed with chemicals, anyway.\nWhen I prepared for my first dye project, I quickly realized I would need to gather quite a few supplies before I could do anything. At a minimum, if you're doing the stovetop or bucket method, you'll need a container large enough for the dye bath and whatever you're putting in it, a measuring cup, metal tongs or a large metal spoon and rubber gloves. Rit warns against dyeing in a container that you also use for food (if you can't avoid it, the website suggests cleaning the container with chlorine bleach or a powdered cleanser after dyeing), so I ruled out all of my existing pots and cooking utensils. While you can dye in a stainless steel sink (but not porcelain or fiberglass), I was hesitant to do so, considering my sink also comes into regular contact with my cooking and eating supplies. I was loathe to spend too much money or create more waste on a whole new set of dyeing supplies, especially before even trying this out, but I was able to find a stovetop pot, a large galvanized metal bucket and the additional tools at my local thrift stores (I already had a few pairs of sturdy rubber gloves for cleaning, so I designated one specifically for dyeing).\nEmma Sarran Webster/CNN Underscored\nIf you're keen to try some of the more creative techniques, you might need even more. The ice dyeing, for example, required a flat cooling rack (again, it's best not to use one that's in your actual kitchen rotation), while the marble dyeing required a squeeze bottle or medicine dropper, stir stick, spatula and sheet pan.\nRit also recommends using the ColorStay Dye Fixative to lock in the color on anything containing cotton, linen, silk, wool, ramie or rayon. A single $5 bottle is enough for approximately four adult t-shirts, if you follow Rit's recommended proportions, so it can add up if you plan to do extensive dyeing.\nThe bottom line\nIf you have clothes, shoes or decor that have been gathering dust \u2014 whether because of stains or your evolving personal taste \u2014 but are hesitant to get rid of them, give Rit Dye a go. Even those who don't consider themselves 'crafty' can succeed in this DIY project, particularly with the help of Rit's extensive 'how-to' guides. The myriad, vibrant color options and suggested dyeing techniques make it easy to transform what you already own into something that feels new, customized and exciting, while cutting back on your household waste.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Emma Sarran Webster","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/lead-rit-dye-13-cnnu.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNUnderscored","_score":2.45149,"_id":"cb7b544e7c66616834700100f4d7d422"}],"user_input":{"q":"climate","search_in":["title_summary_en"],"lang":["en"],"not_lang":null,"countries":null,"not_countries":null,"from":"2024-04-15 00:00:00","to":null,"ranked_only":"True","from_rank":null,"to_rank":null,"sort_by":"relevancy","page":1,"size":100,"sources":["cnn.com"],"not_sources":[],"topic":null,"published_date_precision":null}}
