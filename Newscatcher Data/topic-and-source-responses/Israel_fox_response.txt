Rivzi has a troubling background when it comes to his documented support for Iran and anti-Israel views.\nThe Free Press first broke the story about Rizvi's chants that occurred during a breakout session of an event in which 300 activists countrywide gathered to plan protests to disrupt the Democratic National Convention in August. The crowd reportedly burst into applause hours later when another activist shared the news that the Islamic Republic of Iran had attacked Israel, launching more than 300 bomb-bearing Shahed drones and ballistic missiles into its airspace.\nIn the video shown by the Free Press, Rivzi said that \"marg barg\" could either mean \"death to, or down with,\" while previously stating to laughter \"depending on who's asking.\"\nBefore videos of Rizvi's \"Death to America\" chant made their way around the internet, the self-professed anti-war activist was a regular contributor to Iran's Press TV and an outlet called Al Mayadeen. David Daoud, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, spoke to Fox News Digital about these outlets' links to Iran and its proxy, Hezbollah, a designated foreign terrorist organization.\n\"Press TV is a known Iranian mouthpiece,\" Daoud said, noting that its U.S. website was seized in June 2021 alongside 32 other sites by the U.S. Justice Department. He said it \"targeted the United States with disinformation campaigns and malign influence operations.\"\nRizvi propelled this anti-Israel, anti-U.S. ideology while writing for Al Mayadeen on Jan. 19, explaining that Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, Hamas' deadly Oct. 7 incursion into Israel, had \"called the Axis of Resistance into action.\" Rizvi specifically cites Hezbollah and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as groups that \"harmonized in action while maintaining their own sovereignty to assist their Palestinian allies.\" The IRGC is also a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization.\nRizvi's Press TV reports also show an alleged pro-terror bias. In a Dec. 9 Press TV article, Rizvi writes not of terror attacks on innocents on Oct. 7 but of \"the severity of the humiliation the Zionist regime was dealt on October 7 by the Palestinian resistance led by Hamas.\"\nTies between Al Mayadeen and Hezbollah are \"a little bit more complicated,\" Daoud said. While the Lebanon-based outlet calls itself \"an independent Arab satellite news channel,\" Daoud said it is \"at times it's virtually indistinguishable from Al-Manar,\" a Lebanese outlet owned by Hezbollah. \"In both content and in terms of access to Hezbollah officials,\" Daoud said he \"considers Al Mayadeen a Hezbollah-linked media outlet,\" though the site's funding sources \"have always been shrouded in a little bit of mystery.\"\nDaoud said both channels \"take the \u2018Resistance Axis' ideology\" and \"spread it as far and wide in the Arab world as possible.\"\nThough Rizvi may portray these actors as part of a \"resistance,\" Daoud says these groups merely use the term \"to gain legitimacy\" while seeking the annihilation of the state of Israel. \"Their objectives are not defensive,\" Daoud said. \"The elimination and destruction of a country is not a defensive action. The idea of resisting Israel's very right to exist is not resistance. This is propaganda\" designed to \"make the objectives more palatable,\" Daoud said.\nWhen discussing Iran's April 13 strike on Israel for Press TV, Rizvi said the \"Iranian retaliation is within the scope of international law\" and that Iran's response \"is proportional and just and comes after much patience in dealing with the rogue regime [Israel].\" He continued, \"The morale of the Islamic world is being restored as Iran acts as the harbinger of regional stability.\"\nOn the contrary, the United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner notes that both Israel's April 1 attack on the Iranian Embassy in Damascus, Syria, and Iran's April 13 aerial attack on Israel \"may \u2026 constitute the international crime of aggression.\"\nAfter videos of his anti-American chants spread, Rizvi appears to have scrubbed his social media presence on the internet. The Powerless Podcast set an episode with Rizvi to private on April 16. In the episode, discussing so-called Western and Israeli propaganda, Rizvi suggested that \"no politician, no business person, no corporation should be allowed to enjoy any peace until there's justice.\"\nRizvi's \"abolishnato\" handle on X, formerly known as Twitter, no longer exists. The internet and several concerned groups, however, have a long memory of the hate he espoused there.\nOn April 14, the Anti-Defamation League shared a tweet in which Rizvi wrote, \"God bless Iran and the heroes of the IRGC,\" in response to a tweet from Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi.\nCanary Mission, which highlights U.S. entities and individuals spreading anti-Israel or antisemitic hate, shared several of Rizvi's archived tweets and press appearances with Fox News Digital. They demonstrate what they claim is Rizvi's anger toward Israel and its supporters.\nOn Oct. 25, Rizvi said on Press TV that Israel is \"actively flaunting\" plans to create \"a greater Israel\" that \"extends into Egypt, extents into Syria, extends into Saudi Arabia.\" He further said that if Israel were to \"execute these grand plans of maybe even invading Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan \u2026 it would have the full political and military backing of the United States.\" He noted that Israel \"is actively admitting that they have plans to kill\" those they conquer.\nDaoud says the idea that Israel seeks to expand its territory to create a \"greater Israel\" is \"a conspiracy theory usually espoused by the most feverish of antisemitic minds.\" Furthermore, Daoud explained that Rizvi's belief that \"Israel wants to conquer most of the Middle East and slaughter its inhabitants goes a step further, showing that his worldview is based in the demonization and dehumanization of Israelis.\"\nOn Nov. 1, Rizvi addressed Press TV once more, stating that \"the Zionist lobby has a huge influence on the American political system and spends millions and millions of dollars, sometimes per congressional representative, to make sure that everybody follows suit with what the Zionist political line is.\" Rizvi also said in the interview that he did not believe you could \"call [the conflict between Hamas and Israel] a war when one side is annihilating an entire people.\"\nIn a series of archived Tweets that Canary Mission uncovered, Rizvi's fervor against Israel is further revealed. On Nov. 15, 2023, Rizvi decried The Guardian newspaper's decision to remove Usama Bin Laden's \"Letter to America,\" explaining that bin Laden had \"correctly blamed America for its role in ethnic cleansing of Palestine by arming Israel.\"\nOn Jan. 6, 2024, Rizvi wrote, \"Love waking up to news that Hezbollah put these Zionists in a blender.\" A month later, on Feb. 11, he tweeted that the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism's Super Bowl ad, which he wrongly attributes to the state of Israel, was proof that \"from sports to Hollywood, the entire entertainment industry is complicit in genocide.\"\nThough Rizvi and numerous protesters from Saturday's activist gathering allege that Israel is committing genocide, the International Court of Justice ruled on Jan. 26 that there has not been a genocide in Gaza.\nFox News Digital attempted to contact Rizvi for comment about his online statements and writings and for context behind his chanting on Saturday. Rizvi did not respond.\nSaturday's assembly in Chicago was the start of a greater initiative to protest against Israel at the Democratic National Convention in August.\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson rejected protesters' initial request to march in the vicinity of the convention. Fight Back News reported that a coalition of protesters sued the city to march in a location where President Biden \"can hear us and see us.\" Calling the president \"Genocide Joe Biden,\" the spokesperson for the Coalition to March on the DNC told Fight Back News that \"Biden could stop the war with one phone call. He refuses to take action, and so we must protest.\"\nAccording to Axios, the city must respond to protesters' request for a permit to protest closer to the convention by April 21. One protester told Axios that the group will be \"marching with or without a permit\" because of the \"genocide happening in Gaza.\"\nWhile anti-Israel fervor rises in Chicago, where the mayor cast the deciding vote on a controversial cease-fire resolution in January, the Jewish population in Illinois has faced increased hate. On April 16, the ADL released its findings that antisemitic incidents in Illinois rose 74% between 2022 and 2023. Of the 211 recorded incidents of vandalism, harassment and assault, 68% occurred after Oct. 7.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Beth Bailey","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Shabbir-Rizvi-flag.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.308979,"_id":"506fd29d77e57e20577e89ee469626d4"},{"title":"Biden admin notes 'urgent' concern over Israel in Gaza human rights report","author":"Julia Johnson","published_date":"2024-04-22 19:39:14","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-notes-urgent-concern-israel-gaza-human-rights-report","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Israel was prominently featured in the preface of the Biden administration's 2023 Human Rights Report from the Department of State, which highlighted U.S. concerns about the civilian toll in Gaza.","summary":"The State Department's annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices highlighted Israel prominently, featuring concerns over the country's precautions to minimize the civilian toll of Palestinians on the first page, which is normally reserved for the most egregious of human rights abusers.\nIn the report's preface, President Biden's Secretary of State Antony Blinken addressed the human rights concerns with the war between Israel and terrorist group Hamas prior to either Iran or the Taliban in Afghanistan.\n\"The conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza continues to raise deeply troubling concerns for human rights,\" Blinken wrote.\nHe explained that the U.S. has \"made clear\" that Israel needs to follow international law \"and take every feasible precaution to protect civilians.\" Blinken emphasized that the department is still \"urgently\" raising concerns about civilian deaths in Gaza during the war.\nThe U.S. also \"repeatedly\" brought up concerns about humanitarian aid access in Gaza, civilian displacement and \"unprecedented\" journalist deaths, the report noted.\nIsrael was mentioned before the Biden administration's State Department addressed \"ongoing and brutal human rights abuses in Iran\" or \"the Taliban's systemic mistreatment of and discrimination against Afghanistan's women and girls.\"\nThe Jewish state was featured after only Russia's civilian violence in Ukraine and \"mass killings\" and \"rape\" perpetrated by the Sudanese Armed Forces and Rapid Support Forces.\nHamas terrorists are mentioned in the same paragraph, with the U.S. condemning Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which, it noted, \"included appalling abuses, including gender-based violence and sexual violence.\"\nAfter noting the urgent concern over Israel's civilian precautions, Blinken added, \"We have repeatedly condemned Hamas' abhorrent misuse of civilians and civilian infrastructure as human shields.\"\n\"Hamas' horrific attacks on Israel on Oct. 7 last year, and the devastating loss of civilian life in Gaza as Israel exercises a right to ensure that those attacks never happen again, have also raised deeply troubling human rights concerns,\" Blinken reiterated at a press conference following the report's unveiling.\nA State Department official told Fox News Digital that the report's discussion of issues globally is not a ranking of countries that compares them to one another.\nRepresentatives for the Israeli government did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment for purposes of this story.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Julia Johnson","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/Biden_Blinken.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.3073378,"_id":"7dfaca1a5901a867cd90a82f70c93193"},{"title":"Fetterman hammers 'a--hole' anti-Israel protesters, slams own party for response to Iranian attack: 'Crazy'","author":"Julia Johnson","published_date":"2024-04-22 09:30:11","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fetterman-hammers-a-hole-anti-israel-protesters-slams-own-party-response-iranian-attack-crazy","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Sen. Fetterman revived criticism of extreme anti-Israel protests as he reaffirmed his staunch position of support behind U.S. ally Israel.","summary":"Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., reiterated his criticisms of activists calling for cease-fire in Gaza, and slammed fellow Democrats for their \"crazy\" response to the attacks Iran has launched against Israel, in an interview with Fox Digital.\n\"It is not appropriate or legal or helpful to advance your argument if you show up in a Starbucks with a bullhorn and start yelling at people,\" he told Fox News Digital in a Friday interview.\nHe also claimed such protests don't \"make you noble.\"\n\"It just makes you an a--hole,\" Fetterman said.\nSince the onset of the war between Israel and terrorist group Hamas, anti-Israel demonstrations have erupted across the U.S. The protesters have gone to extreme lengths at times to telegraph their displeasure with U.S. policy in regard to Israel. Some have trespassed in government buildings, blocked high-traffic bridges and entered private businesses with bullhorns, chanting at employees.\nFetterman clarified that he is supportive of the right to protest and hold different opinions.\n\"It's very American to protest and to do that in the appropriate way,\" he said. \"I absolutely support that.\"\nWhat he takes issue with, he said, is when those demonstrations \"disrupt lives.\"\nHe noted the serious implications of protesters who block traffic with their bodies on high-volume bridges and roads, explaining, \"There could be people that [are in] an emergency, or they're going to be late for work \u2013 that they could lose their job, or they have to pick up their kids or drop kids off.\"\nWhile he opposes such forms of protest, he didn't signal interest in legislation to address them, telling Fox News Digital, it's \"not really my priority.\"\n\"My priority is to talk about hostages,\" he said, referring to those still in Hamas' custody in Gaza.\nThe Pennsylvania senator has emerged as one of the most vocally supportive Democrats of Israel, which he reiterated in the interview, emphasizing, \"We can't ever forget Hamas started this, and they have chosen to do the most terrible, awful, unspeakable things.\"\nAnd until the hostages, including the Americans still held in Gaza, are released, Fetterman doesn't believe the Palestinian cause for statehood can go anywhere.\n\"They have the power to decide, today \u2013 send everyone home and surrender, and all the trauma, the death, and everything in Gaza can end. And you can get back on the path of peace and a two-state solution,\" he said.\nMany in the Democratic Party were not supportive of Israel's decision to retaliate against Iran, which attacked the country directly last weekend. They feared any counterattacks could stoke a regional war that has the potential to draw in the U.S. But Fetterman said, \"I am not going to be in a position to tell Israel what it should do. That's their choice.\"\n\"I certainly hope none of this escalates and turns into [a] more widespread\" conflict, he added.\nHe was critical of fellow Democrats who did not immediately condemn Iran for directly attacking Israel. \"I was appalled that there were members of our party \u2013 Democrats that can't even condemn Iran,\" Fetterman remarked. \"That's crazy.\"\nPrompted on growing division within the Democratic Party over support for Israel, he said he can't speak for other members. However, he reaffirmed his position as \"a very confirmed and consistent voice in standing with Israel throughout all of this.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Julia Johnson","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/right-two-thirds.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.3033533,"_id":"ddfa5475e3a7219a09feb3e13c6ad46a"},{"title":"Ex-CNN anchor bringing her sons to Israel where she says they will be 'safer' than in New York City","author":"Alexander Hall","published_date":"2024-04-22 23:00:17","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/ex-cnn-anchor-bringing-sons-israel-says-safer-new-york-city","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Former Meta executive and news personality Campbell Brown declared that the embattled state of Israel is safer for her Jewish family to be than a wealthy part of Manhattan.","summary":"Former CNN host Campbell Brown declared Sunday she is heading to Israel with her sons, arguing that the embattled country is currently more welcoming to her Jewish family than New York City, where antisemitic protests have roiled Columbia University.\nJust before Passover began, the former news anchor and ex-Meta executive wrote on social media, \"I'm on my way to Israel where my two sons will be safer and feel more welcomed than they would be today on the Upper West Side. #AmYisraelChai [The people of Israel live].\"\nBrown's husband, former Bush administration foreign policy adviser and author Dan Senor, responded with a series of emojis in support of her statement.\nNew York City has been a hotbed of massive anti-Israel protests since the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks. Columbia University, in particular, one of America's most prestigious universities, has been shaken by such demonstrations in the past several days.\nAnti-Israel activists there have taken over the main lawn of the New York City campus since last week, with authorities arresting more than 100 of the agitators on Thursday, including Rep. Ilhan Omar's, D-Minn., daughter.\nHowever, the chaotic encampment continued over the weekend, riling students and faculty with anti-Jewish slogans and chants, including statements of support for Hamas.

Gen. Aharon Haliva announced his resignation after he failed to prevent Hamas' unprecedented Oct. 7 attack, the deadliest terror attack in Israel's history, the military said.\n\"The intelligence directorate under my command did not live up to the task we were entrusted with. I carry that black day with me ever since, day after day, night after night. I will carry the horrible pain of the war with me forever,\" Haliva wrote in his resignation letter, according to a translation by the Associated Press.\nHaliva is the first senior figure to step down after Hamas terrorists invaded Israel nearly six and a half months ago and rampaged through Israeli communities, killing 1,200 people \u2013 mostly civilians \u2013 and taking roughly 250 hostages back into Gaza.\nThe decision to resign was made with the approval of Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant. The military chief of staff accepted Haliva's request to resign and thanked him for his 38 years of service, the IDF said.\nHaliva's resignation could set the stage for additional fallout from Israel's top security brass over Hamas' attack, which triggered a war in Gaza between the Jewish state and Hamas. The war will cross its 200th day this week.\nShortly after the war was initiated, Haliva said publicly that he shouldered blame as the head of the military department for not preventing the assault.\nOther military and security leaders are also reportedly expected to resign in response to intelligence failures that did not catch the impending Oct. 7 attack.\nThe timing of these resignations, however, has been unclear as Israel remains in a war with Hamas, while battling the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria.\nTensions in the region remain high after Israel traded direct attacks with Iran last week, leading some military experts to say Israeli resignations are irresponsible while the military is fighting on multiple fronts, according to the Associated Press.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not among those expected to resign and has indicated that he will not step down, despite growing protests.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Lawrence Richard","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1761387532.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.2663565,"_id":"1b04c9e299d449c8223ec86e494cb0c1"},{"title":"Democrats join Republicans in condemning antisemitism at Columbia University","author":"Julia Johnson","published_date":"2024-04-22 15:04:21","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-republicans-denounce-antisemitism-columbia-university","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Democrats joined their Republican counterparts in condemning anti-semitic protests at Columbia University as the party grapples with a growing divide over support for Israel.","summary":"A number of Democrats in the Senate have joined their Republican colleagues in denouncing discrimination against Jewish students at the prestigious Ivy League Columbia University, where an anti-Israel solidarity encampment persists on campus, prompting the institution to move classes online on Monday.\n\"Every American has a right to protest,\" Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement. \"But when protests shift to antisemitism, verbal abuse, intimidation, or glorification of Oct. 7 violence against Jewish people, that crosses the line.\"\n\"Campuses must remain safe for all students.\"\nSchumer, who represents New York City, where Columbia is located, is the first Jewish majority leader in the Senate and also the highest ranking Jewish elected official in U.S. history.\nLast week, the anti-Israel demonstration sprang up on Columbia's campus, with students camping out in tents and demanding that the university divest from all companies with ties to Israel. Since then, the protest has grown in size and presented a safety threat to Jewish students. This has mushroomed into such a concern that an Orthodox rabbi at the school advised Jewish students to leave campus because \"Columbia University's Public Safety and the NYPD cannot guarantee Jewish students' safety.\"\nNew York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, another Democrat, also denounced the display of antisemitism at the university, saying she was \"appalled.\"\n\"Threats of violence against Jewish students and the Jewish community are horrible, despicable and wholly unacceptable,\" she said. \"Using the rhetoric of terrorists has no place in New York, where we pride ourselves on tolerance and the right of every group to practice their religion in peace.\"\nOthers who joined their party members in addressing the encampment were Sens. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., and John Fetterman, D-Penn.\n\"I'm outraged by the vile displays of antisemitism at Columbia University, including threats of violence,\" read a post on X, formerly Twitter, from Rosen, who faces a tough re-election battle in November in swing state Nevada.\nFetterman, who has emerged as one of Israel's strongest supporters in his party, compared the demonstration to \"Charlottesville for these Jewish students.\" Fetterman referenced the 2017 \"Unite the Right\" rally in Virginia that drew hundreds of white supremacists and ultimately turned violent, resulting in the death of one woman.\n\"President Minouche Shafik: do your job or resign, so Columbia can find someone who will,\" Fetterman added.\nWhile a number of Democrats have chosen to make public statements on the events unfolding at Columbia, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., blamed the party for allowing it to happen in the first place. \"The radical anti-Israel protestors have always been part of the Democratic Party's base,\" he wrote on X. \"Now Joe Biden is using them as an excuse to undermine Israel and appease Iran.\"\nWhite House spokesperson Andrew Bates said the administration condemns \"echoing the rhetoric of terrorist organizations\" in the \"strongest terms.\"\nRepublicans in the Senate were quick to condemn the encampment at Columbia, and Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., even suggested, \"Any student on a visa that is arrested for supporting Hamas needs to be deported immediately.\"\nMany GOP members in the upper chamber have reinforced their support for Israel and the Jewish people frequently throughout the war between Israel and terrorist group Hamas in Gaza. Democrats have been more measured and careful with their commentary on the war and Israel as the party's divide on the issue expands, making the statements from them regarding Columbia particularly significant.\nPresident Biden and Democrats have faced criticism from their Republican counterparts for pulling back from Israel, a major U.S. ally in the Middle East. Biden recently warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that U.S. policy in support of the country could change depending on the actions it takes to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza.And in the wake of Iran's recent direct attack on Israel, Republicans quickly blamed Biden and other Democrats, accusing them of emboldening Israel's adversary to undertake such an audacious attack.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Julia Johnson","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/schumer-gillibrand-columbia-antisemitism.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.2519207,"_id":"1bac3e92abbed919354ef01e359bd3d3"},{"title":"'Our Revolution': Far-left lawmakers host event taking aim at 'anti-peace' pro-Israel group","author":"Elizabeth Elkind","published_date":"2024-04-22 15:10:05","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/our-revolution-far-left-house-dems-host-event-taking-aim-anti-peace-pro-israel-group","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Leftist lawmakers in the House of Representatives are featured at a Monday evening event aimed at attacking the pro-Israel lobby in the U.S. and \"building progressive power in Congress.\"","summary":"A group that's backing leftist candidates for Congress who want to place conditions on U.S. aid to Israel is hosting a Monday night event aimed at bashing the pro-Israel lobby and \"building progressive power in Congress.\"\nOur Revolution, an organizing group founded by self-described \"democratic socialist\" Sen.

We believe that it is entirely consistent with progressive values to stand with the Jewish state as it confronts aggression from Iran and its terrorist proxies.\"\nA spokesperson for the group also told Fox News Digital that AIPAC is \"the largest PAC contributor\" to Democratic candidates.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Elizabeth Elkind","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/omar-jayapal-bowman.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.1820955,"_id":"b388f41c4ce23f73e486cbd46cde5ef2"},{"title":"Liberal comedian Michael Rapaport tells anti-Israel protesters Trump will win 'because of you'","author":"Kristine Parks","published_date":"2024-04-22 15:20:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/liberal-comedian-michael-rapaport-tells-anti-israel-protesters-trump-will-win-because-you","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Liberal comedian Michael Rapaport predicted that anti-Israel protests erupting at Ivy League schools this past weekend would help Donald Trump win in November.","summary":"Far-left comedian and actor Michael Rapaport delivered a stern message to anti-Israel college protesters in a social media post on Monday, warning they would help deliver former President Trump the November election.\nIn a video posted to X, the staunch Trump critic boldly predicted that Trump would win the election because of the anti-Israel protests that took over Yale and Columbia University campuses over the past week.\n\"You know what's going to be great?\" Rapaport sarcastically remarked. \"When d--- stained Donald Trump gets elected \u2014 and I ain't saying I'm voting for him \u2014 but when he does win, and he's going to win, the screaming and yelling that you f------ p---- a-- blow--- miserable mother f------ on college campuses are doing now, the screaming that you are doing at Jews about, \u2018Free Palestine,' the screaming you are doing at Zionists is nothing compared to the screaming you are going to be doing come November, when d--- stained Donald Trump wins presidency because of you.

Other signs at the NYU demonstration, captured in footage shared by FreedomNews.TV, read \"Honor the Martyrs of Palestine\" and \"We are all SJP,\" a reference to the anti-Israel group known as \"Students for Justice in Palestine.\" Columbia notably suspended its SJP chapter for staging an \"unauthorized\" die-in event on campus back in November.\nEncampment-style demonstrations were also erected at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Emerson College.\nPhotos showed tents near Emerson's Boston campus with signs reading \"from the river to the sea,\" the antisemitic phrase calling for the eradication of the Jewish state, as well as \"No more money for Israel's crimes,\" \"drop all charges on student activists\" and \"neutrality\" is complicity with the Palestinian flag.\nAerial footage captured by CBS Boston over MIT showed anti-Israel agitators setting up an encampment on the campus lawn. Notably, the MIT president was the only one to keep her job when she and the presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania failed to explicitly condemn calls for the genocide while testifying before the House Education and the Workforce Committee hearing in December.\nColumbia's president testified before the same committee on Wednesday, and on Thursday, allowed the NYPD onto campus to arrest more than 100 people for trespassing. They have since been released from custody.\nOn Sunday, Elie Buechler, a rabbi for the Orthodox Union's Jewish Learning Initiative at Columbia, sent a WhatsApp message to nearly 300 Jewish students recommending they go home because campus police and the NYPD \"cannot guarantee Jewish students' safety in the face of extreme antisemitism and anarchy.\"\nA New Haven, Connecticut, police spokesperson said about 45 protesters were arrested at Yale on Monday morning and charged with misdemeanor trespassing.\nAll were being released on promises to appear in court later.\nProtesters set up tents on Beinecke Plaza on Friday and demonstrated over the weekend, calling on Yale to end any investments in defense companies that do business with Israel.\nIn a statement to the campus community on Sunday, Yale President Peter Salovey said university officials had spoken to the student protesters multiple times about the school's policies and guidelines, including those regarding speech and allowing access to campus spaces.\n\"Putting up structures, defying the directives of university officials, staying in campus spaces past allowed times, and other acts that violate university policies and guidelines create safety hazards and impede the work of our university,\" he said. School officials said they spoke with protesters over several hours and gave them until the end of the weekend to leave Beinecke Plaza. They said they again warned protesters Monday morning and told them that they could face arrest and discipline, including suspension, before police moved in.\nA large group of demonstrators regathered after Monday's arrests at Yale and blocked a street near campus, a police spokesperson said.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Fox News Digital.\n\"To appease his base, Joe Biden allowed over $100 billion to flow to Iran. Iran then used that money to make drones and cruise missiles to attack Israel,\" Cruz said. \"In a very real sense, Joe Biden funded Iran's attack on Israel. The Democrat position on Israel and Iran is as illogical as it is indefensible.\"\nIran attacked Israel directly over the weekend, launching hundreds of drone strikes as well as a barrage of ballistic and cruise missiles. With the help of the U.S. military, Israel managed to intercept almost all the incoming drone and missile attacks.\nIran's previous involvement in attacks against Israel has been through proxies in countries such as Syria and Yemen. Launching an assault from within its own country marks a major escalation from a proxy fight to a direct attack.\n\"Since October 7, Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer have tried to undermine Israel at every turn,\" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Whether it's on the battlefield, at the UN, or in Congress, they are more interested in pleasing the pro-Hamas wing of their party than they are in helping our greatest ally in the Middle East.\"\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., pointed to the Democratic Party's shift on Israel, saying in a statement Saturday, \"Tehran and its proxies are emboldened when they see divisions between the US and Israel.\"\nPrior to the attack, Biden hardened his posture toward Israel as it fights Hamas in Gaza. Biden warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a call this month \"that U.S. policy with respect to Gaza will be determined by our assessment of Israel's immediate action on these steps\" to address civilian casualties and ensure safety for humanitarian aid workers, according to the White House. The call followed an Israeli strike that led to the deaths of seven aid workers from World Central Kitchen.\nLast month, Schumer sparked outrage from Republicans after calling on Israel in a floor speech to hold elections to replace Netanyahu, who he said \"has put himself in coalition with far-right extremists\" and \"has been too willing to tolerate the civilian toll in Gaza.\"\n\"If Prime Minister Netanyahu's current coalition remains in power after the war begins to wind down and continues to pursue dangerous and inflammatory policies that test existing U.S. standards for assistance, then the United States will have no choice but to play a more active role in shaping Israeli policy by using our leverage to change the present course,\" Schumer said.\nPrior to his floor speech, Schumer requested a classified intelligence briefing, which he routinely receives, on the status of hostage negotiations between Israel and Hamas. The briefing revealed that there would be no disruptions to ongoing hostage negotiations if Schumer gave his speech, according to a source familiar.\nHowever, the source was unable to say whether any implications regarding Iran were relayed during the briefing.\nSchumer's office also hit back at the claims, with spokesperson Allison Biasotti saying in a statement, \"Leader Schumer has been clear that the United States' commitment to Israel's security is ironclad, and that the best way to deter enemies of Israel, like Iran, is for the House to promptly pass the bipartisan supplemental bill, with over $17 billion urgently needed for Israel's defense and U.S. operations against Iranian-backed aggression in the Red Sea, which Schumer already passed in the Senate.\"\nThe majority leader's office said the attack on Israel was a response to the recent Israeli strike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, Syria, adding that Iran and Israel have been engaged in a lengthy conflict for years.\nBut according to one Democrat aide, there are senators in the party who are concerned about a growing number of Democrats' posture on Israel potentially giving Iran the sense that American support is wavering for its ally.\nSen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., accused Biden of trying to \"walk a tightrope of appeasing an increasingly radical base of his party while upholding the mainstream American position of support for Israel.\"\n\"The problem is the president isn't walking a tightrope. He's trying to straddle the Grand Canyon,\" he said in a statement.\nWhite House spokesperson Andrew Bates pushed back on criticism of Biden's posture toward Israel, and he rejected claims he emboldened Iran to attack, in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\"Former Trump Administration officials and Fox News' own reporting have debunked those lies,\" he said.\n\"President Biden is the only American President to have directly defended Israel, as he ordered the American military to do last weekend,\" Bates said. \"He is also the only American President to have set foot in Israel during wartime, in support of our ironclad commitment to their security. Unlike others, he did not rail against Israel in the days after October 7th, nor has he ever praised Hezbollah.\"\nMeanwhile, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., pointed to a recent effort to force votes on a stand-alone Israel aid bill in the Senate as she criticized her Democrat counterparts.\n\"This week, Senate Democrats again blocked immediate aid to Israel after Senator [Roger] Marshall and I demanded a vote to support our ally. The Left would rather play politics to appease their socialist base,\" she told Fox News Digital in a statement.\n\"It's clear that the Biden administration and Leader Chuck Schumer refuse to back our most important ally in the Middle East,\" Blackburn continued.\nTwo Democrat congressional aides told Fox News Digital that the attack by Iran was expected. They said intelligence suggested it was in response to the consulate strike on April 1 that killed Iranian commanders.\nNevertheless, the scale of the Iranian attack and its direct targeting of Israel shocked many observers.\nDemocrats in the upper chamber objected to two requests for unanimous consent to vote on different versions of stand-alone Israel aid. However, most Democrats maintained support for a foreign aid package that ties Israel aid to Ukraine aid.\nMcConnell said last month that Schumer's call for new Israeli elections was both hypocritical and grotesque as well as \"unprecedented.\"\n\"Make no mistake, the Democratic Party doesn't have an anti-[Netanyahu] problem. It has an anti-Israel problem,\" the Republican leader said in floor remarks at the time.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Julia Johnson","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/schumer-biden-israel-iran.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.005303,"_id":"64e2de4e16feb98f647697b2811c970b"},{"title":"Hezbollah claims to shoot down Israeli drone over Lebanon","author":"Greg Norman","published_date":"2024-04-22 10:57:19","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-claims-shoot-down-israeli-drone-lebanon","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The Israel Defense Forces is investigating after Hezbollah has claimed to shot down one of its drones that was on a mission over southern Lebanon.","summary":"The Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah is claiming to have shot down an Israeli drone that was on a combat mission, a report says.\nHezbollah said in a statement that the drone, which was \"waging its attacks on our steadfast people,\" was brought down in the Al Aishiyeh area of southern Lebanon near the country's border with Israel, according to Reuters.\nIt reportedly described the drone as a Hermes 450 made by Israel-based weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems.\n\"A surface-to-air missile was launched at a remote manned aircraft of the air force that was operating in the skies of Lebanon, as a result the vehicle was hit and fell in Lebanese territory,\" the Israeli Defense Forces later said in a statement. \"The incident is being investigated.\"\nMore than 240 Hezbollah fighters have been killed in cross-border skirmishes with Israel since the Oct. 7 surprise attack by Hamas that launched the ongoing war in Gaza, Reuters reports.\nOn the Israeli side, 18 people, including soldiers and civilians, have died, it added.\nThe reported downing of the drone comes as the head of Israel's military intelligence directorate has resigned for failing to prevent the Oct. 7 massacre.\n\"In coordination with the Chief of the General Staff, the Head of the Intelligence Directorate, MG Aharon Haliva, has requested to end his position, following his leadership responsibility as the Head of the Intelligence Directorate for the events of October 7,\" the IDF wrote on X.\n\"The Chief of the General Staff thanked Major General Aharon Haliva for his 38 years of service in the IDF, during which he made significant contributions to the security of the State of Israel as both a combat soldier and commander,\" it added.\nIn a resignation letter quoted by The Associated Press, Haliva wrote, \"The intelligence directorate under my command did not live up to the task we were entrusted with.

Now, those systems defend Israel and Biden doesn't want our ally to strike back at Iran.","summary":"Iran fired more than 320 warheads at Israel on Saturday. The explosives were carried by about 170 propeller-driven drones of the kind Iran has sold Russia for use against Ukraine, more than 30 cruise missiles, and more than 120 ballistic missiles \u2014 mostly fired from Iranian territory at least 1,100 miles away to the east with a few launched from more distant Houthi-controlled Yemen to the south.\nThe attack failed to deliver any meaningful damage, though a 10-year-old girl was injured, as 99% of the drones and missiles were intercepted by Israel, the U.S., and likely Jordan and Saudi Arabia as well.\nWhat Iran's large-scale attack on Israel \u2014 more than twice as large as any Russian attack on Ukraine \u2014 did was show the value of a layered anti-missile defense championed by former Presidents Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump \u2014 and opposed by President Joe Biden, when he served in the U.S. Senate.\nIran's triple threat attack was defeated by fighter jets, Israel's short-range Iron Dome system, David's Sling, a kinetic hit-to-kill interceptor system with a range out to 186 miles away, and Israel's Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems, developed with the United States beginning in the late 1980s. The U.S. Navy also fired anti-ballistic missile rockets from warships nearby.\nBut, had Biden had his way in 1987, Israel wouldn't have had the sophisticated and highly effective missile defense system.\nAt the time, I was a young special assistant for foreign affairs in the Pentagon. Shortly after the Republicans lost their U.S. Senate majority in the 1986 election, Democrats redoubled their efforts to terminate Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.\nIt was a destabilizing waste of money, they claimed. They argued on one hand that it cost too much, and it wouldn't work anyway, and on the other hand, if it did work, it would increase the likelihood of a life-ending nuclear war.\nBut with Israel's advances in defense technology, combined with its location in a dangerous neighborhood, a bipartisan argument could be made that Israel would benefit from the development of anti-missile technology while America would benefit from Israel's testing data and lessons learned. Thus was born Israel's Arrow anti-ballistic missile system.\nIt's important to note at the time that Arrow had its critics in both America and Israel. Aside from Biden and the largely anti-defense left, the Israeli Air Force was skeptical, fearing a diversion of resources from its ability to deter attacks on Israel through what was euphemistically called \"preemptive diplomacy\" \u2014 the threat of first strikes to destroy emerging dangers.\nBut Israel's Ministry of Defense believed that an effective anti-missile defense would blunt the destruction of an enemy surprise attack, allowing Israel the luxury of not having to conduct diplomatically costly preemptive strikes. That has now been borne out.\nIn the wake Iran's foiled attack on Israel, Biden told Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to \"take the win\" and not strike back. Further driving the point home \u2014 likely to appeal to the Democrats' growing problem with their antisemitic, left-wing base \u2014 Biden said he wouldn't support an Israeli counterattack.\nBut just because a would-be murderer failed doesn't mean that a criminal should escape justice.\nRepublican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio called out Biden, accusing him of leaking his call transcript with Netanyahu to appease the \"pro-terrorist\" mob. Rubio further condemned the Biden administration for playing a \"public game\" that \"encourages Iran and Hezbollah \u2026 and the Houthis\" and other anti-Israel elements that make the Middle East an even more dangerous region.\nIn the meantime, domestic pressure is mounting to force Israel to relent in its efforts to defend itself by eliminating the threat from adjacent terrorist groups. Terrorist sympathizers in Chicago shut down the road to the city's airport and increasing chants of \"Death to America\" and \"Death to Israel,\" aiming to change U.S. policy towards Israel.\nThis brings to mind the Cold War-era revelations from high level Soviet defector Col. Stanislav Lunev, a military intelligence officer, that the Soviet Union's clandestine agencies provided more resources for \"antiwar propaganda in the United States than it did for economic and military support of the Vietnamese.\"\nBut, had Biden had his way in 1987, Israel wouldn't have had the sophisticated and highly effective missile defense system.\nThe People's Republic of China has a simple doctrine with regards American interests: Whatever the U.S. supports, it opposes; whatever the U.S. opposes, it supports. With China openly opposing Israel's efforts to defend itself and in possession of an economy several times larger than the Soviet Union's at its peak, as well as having powerful propaganda tools such as TikTok, one can only guess at the extent to which China is involved in whipping up anti-Israel, pro-terror hysteria in America.\nBiden's policy of appeasing Iran and its terror proxies has failed spectacularly.\nIsrael may soon do what it must, using its strength to make up for Biden's fecklessness.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Chuck Devore,Chuck De Vore","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/2024-04-14T011856Z_2_LYNXNPEK3C0B3_RTROPTP_4_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-IRAN.jpg","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.9566603,"_id":"eec1f669eeae4ce9737f193a7a93e6ef"},{"title":"Gigi Hadid's father apologizes for racist, homophobic messages to Democratic lawmaker","author":"Lindsay Kornick","published_date":"2024-04-22 00:00:56","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/gigi-hadids-father-apologizes-racist-homophobic-messages-democratic-lawmaker","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Model Gigi Hadid's father Mohamed Hadid admitted to sending racist and homophobic messages to New York Rep.

I appreciate that. But I want to be clear: Our decisions we will make ourselves,\" the prime minister added.\nDuring the meeting, Baerbock said escalation \"would serve no one, not Israel's security, not the many dozens of hostages still in the hands of Hamas, not the suffering population of Gaza, not the many people in Iran who are themselves suffering under the regime, and not the third countries in the region who simply want to live in peace,\" Reuters reported.\nNetanyahu's comment also comes just hours after Iran's president has vowed to completely destroy Israel, should it proceed with even the \"tiniest invasion\" of its country.\nPresident Ebrahim Raisi vowed a \"massive and harsh\" response to potential Israeli retaliation, during a speech Wednesday at an annual army parade.\nIran launched hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel on Saturday in response to an apparent strike on Iran's embassy compound in Syria on April 1 that killed 12 people, including two Iranian generals.

He has tried to pretend there is a moral equivalency between Israel and the Palestinians and that only encourages more attacks on our ally.","summary":"President Joe Biden is trying to have it both ways with his post Oct. 7 Israel policy. It won't work, especially after Iran's game-changing attack on the Jewish state over the weekend.\nBiden still claims to \"stand with Israel.\" But he doesn't want to stand with Israel too much because he risks losing the votes of those who support the Palestinians \u2014 including, apparently, his own wife. So now he's encouraging Israel to stand down instead of standing up to the Iranians.\nConsider too what his administration has been doing at the United Nations. Ambassador Lisa Thomas-Greenfield abstained on March 25 from voting on UN Security Council Resolution 2728, which calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza during Ramadan, a release of the hostages Hamas holds, and the facilitation of humanitarian aid into Gaza. In a twist, the administration had recently proposed its own draft resolution regarding a ceasefire.\nBut the resolution that did pass differs in two important respects.\nFirst, gone is the condemnation of Hamas's barbaric actions on Oct. 7 as terrorist outrages against humanity \u2014 a condemnation that apparently prompted Russia and China to veto the Biden version. Second, while 2728 calls for the release of the hostages, it removes the language making any ceasefire contingent on their release.\nIn other words, this UNSCR turns a blind eye to Hamas terrorism and opens the door to the group getting a ceasefire while keeping the hostages \u2014 and the United States let it pass.\nSadly, the Biden administration can point to previous and bipartisan U.S. dalliances with UNSCRs to persuade the Palestinians that the United States has not really taken a side in the conflict and is sincerely committed to their cause, even while paying lip service to America's commitment to Israel. But such twisted logic, along with the canard that an abstention is somehow different than an affirmative vote, is too cute by half.\nThis disgraceful equivocation began in January 2009, when President George W. Bush's then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice considered voting for UNSCR 1860, which the U.S. Mission to the UN had helped draft during that round of violence provoked by Hamas.\nLike 2728, 1860 called for an immediate ceasefire and humanitarian aid to Gaza, while providing no security assurances to Israel. Perhaps in the hopes of completing a peace deal in the final days of the Bush administration, Rice ultimately abstained, and 1860 passed.\nIn December 2016, this pattern repeated with UNSCR 2334 at the end of the Obama administration, which condemned the settlement activities of the \"occupying power\" Israel in the Palestinian territories, thus perpetuating the fantasy that there is an equivalency between the two parties.\nThen-U.S. Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power abstained, allowing the resolution to pass, with the cover that she was only doing what the Bush administration had done.\nNone of the UNSCRs in question have done anything material to either reduce violence or produce peace in the Middle East. But they have all contributed to the counter-productive impression among the Palestinians that violence against Israel is somehow legitimate \u2014 as is their support of the perpetuators of this violence, first and foremost Hamas.\nAnd while that belief remains pervasive, they will not take the concrete steps necessary to end the conflict that they have lost if anyone has the courage to tell them so.\nDespite all these contortions at the United Nations, the United States cannot have it both ways on Israel. In 1923, the pioneering Zionist Ze'ev Jabotinsky wrote in his essay \"The Iron Wall\" that until the Palestinians accept that Israel is not going away, and engage in legitimate negotiations, the only way a Jewish state could survive is through impenetrable defenses that would render the inevitable future attacks futile.\nIf the Iranian attack on Israel and Oct. 7 have taught us anything, it's that Jabotinsky was correct. Given the Biden administration's reluctance to unequivocally support Israel's self-defense, it stands with Congress to do so \u2014 and just as failure on Israel policy has been bi-partisan, success can be so as well.\nIn other words, this UNSCR turns a blind eye to Hamas terrorism and opens the door to the group getting a ceasefire while keeping the hostages \u2014 and the United States let it pass.\nLate last year, a stand-alone, paid-for request for emergency funds for Israel passed the House of Representatives, and similar legislation could be passed again on Monday. Pro-Israel senators on both sides of the aisle should then insist it be taken up and passed immediately to demonstrate that American support for Israel is indeed ironclad.\nWhat is needed in the current crisis is not Biden's default to the uni-party failures of the past, but rather a fresh appreciation for Jabotinsky's clarity. President Donald Trump understood this wisdom, and his administration's unabashed commitment to the U.S.-Israel alliance resulted in the first peace deals with Israel and the Arabs in a quarter-century, not the grinding misery and violence we see today.\nAny future American administration that values the U.S.-Israel alliance should make it clear Israel isn't going away because America won't permit it to be destroyed. Only when the Palestinians \u2014 and the Iranians \u2014 accept that as an incontrovertible fact will there be any hope that they might finally lay down their arms and sue for a just and lasting peace. Until then, only a joint U.S.-Israel Iron Wall will suffice at the U.N. and beyond.\nVictoria Coates is vice president for foreign policy and national defense at The Heritage Foundation.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Chip Roy,Chip Roy Victoria Coates,Victoria Coates","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/2024-04-14T011856Z_2_LYNXNPEK3C0B3_RTROPTP_4_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-IRAN.jpg","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.9271846,"_id":"1d59734e7738548ed5b97b7c0a7f373d"},{"title":"Iran humiliated, Hezbollah and Houthis 'completely stunned' by Israel attack failure, says Gen.

It's part of a wider set of bills, totaling roughly $95 billion in foreign aid, that Johnson put on the House floor Saturday. The slate of bills also included aid for Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific as well as a fourth bill containing various national security priorities.\nThe vote comes as tensions in the Middle East escalate dramatically, particularly between Israel and Iran as Israel fights a war on the Palestinian terror group Hamas.\nIsrael carried out limited strikes against Iran on Friday in retaliation for a barrage of airstrikes Tehran fired on Israel, the first such direct attack from the Islamic fundamentalist government. No large-scale damage or casualties were reported in either incident.\nThe issue of Israel has also been a divisive one for Democrats, as a growing faction of left-wing lawmakers criticize Israel's invasion in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack.\nRepublicans, for the most part, have been united in backing Israel and its conservative government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Johnson has put two previous Israel funding bills on the House floor, one that offset the funding with cuts to the IRS, and one which provided the funding without any strings attached. Neither was taken up by the Senate.\nThis time, however, fiscal conservatives decried the lack of offsets and funding for Gaza.\n\"I will always stand with our greatest ally in the Middle East, Israel. But I rise today to express my serious concerns with a very flawed supplemental. In November, I supported the first security supplemental for Israel, which was financially paid for and would have provided weapons and equipment for Israel's fight against Hamas. The cost was offset by rescinding Democrats unprecedented expansion of the IRS. Today, we are considering a vastly different bill, one that is all borrowing another 26 billion of debt with no rescission,\" House Freedom Caucus member Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., said during debate on the bill.\n\"The legislation also contains 400 million for FEMA, which has nothing to do with supporting Israel, and over $9 billion for humanitarian aid in\u2026Gaza and the West Bank.\"\nClyde cited a Heritage Foundation report that said Hamas and other terror groups controlled the flow of all international humanitarian aid operating in Gaza.\n\"It is therefore highly likely U.S. taxpayer-funded humanitarian aid to Gaza, including some of the aid in this bill, will again be diverted to support further Hamas attacks against Israel,\" he said.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Elizabeth Elkind","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Johnson-Netanyahu-Split-Photo-1.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.921402,"_id":"532a76b80a554ab37df03a866f0e7ef7"},{"title":"Morning Glory: Now or never time for Israel?","author":"Hugh Hewitt","published_date":"2024-04-18 09:00:27","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-now-never-time-israel","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"If Israel allows itself to be cowed now, will it ever regain the optimism and sense of security it enjoyed on 10/6?","summary":"As of this writing Israel has not responded to Iran's massive attack against it Saturday night. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron relayed, after meeting with Israeli officials on Wednesday that it was \"clear the Israelis are making a decision to act.\"\n\"We hope they do so in a way that does as little to escalate this as possible,\" Cameron added in his best impersonation of Lord Halifax in 1938, and that Israel is \"smart as well as tough.\"\nRear Admiral (USN, Ret.) Mark Montgomery reviewed with me on Wednesday morning all the ways the Jewish State could strike directly at Iran They are many and varied. Israel possesses ballistic missiles just as Iran does. It has a fleet of F-35 fighter planes which are not only stealth aircraft but may also be able to reach the known nuclear facilities and which may possibly be fitted to carry payloads robust enough to damage significantly those nuclear facilities. (Admiral Montgomery added that it is widely believed that Israel also possesses submarines with the capability to launch cruise missiles.)\nThe target list is long, from those nuclear sites both known to the public and those only known to intelligence agencies and to every system that could be crippled by Israel's robust cyber warfare capacities. There are the headquarters and barracks of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, and of course oil refineries and power grid facilities. Montgomery's 30 minute Q-and-A explains that what Israel strikes depends entirely on what goal it wants to achieve. There are different sorts of deterrence the long-time grand strategist opined. We don't yet know which if any Prime Minister Netanyahu and his colleagues have settled on, or if they have settled on any at all. The weather and the phase of the moon, Montgomery added, are more variables to figure into this incredibly complex calculation.\nVery few media professionals have any serious idea what even is possible or what Iran might do in response. The leaks and counter-leaks to the media in Israel and the United States have created the proverbial \"wilderness of mirrors.\" For a civilian, much less anyone not in the Israeli War Cabinet meetings, to predict anything is absurd.\nBut long time observers of the undeclared (until Saturday) Israel-Iran War can say with some certainty that it hard to imagine any circumstance in which Israel would strike directly at the nuclear program if not now. Certainly not after Iran achieves nuclear weapon \"break out.\"\nThe mullahs escalated Saturday night to a massive direct attack on Israel. They intended savage harm. Some of the attack was directed at Israel's nuclear site at Dimona. Some asset at the Knesset was targeted too. The comprehensive defense of the Jewish State mounted by it and its allies frustrated every projectile, and prevented terrible destruction and casualties but if Iran had developed a nuke, would they have used it? Can Israel ever tolerate even the near approach to \"break out\" after Iran dashed all the illusions of the \"Iran just wants to be acknowledged as a leader in the region\" crowd?\nIran is a theocracy led by fanatics. That it did not unleash Hezbollah's 150,000 rockets and missiles on Israel could mean that Iran wanted the message to be clear that the state actor with the upper hand when it came to escalation was in fact Iran, and it was confident of its superiority to Israel if escalation occurred. Alternatively Iran could have acted as it did to prevent the ground invasion of Lebanon for which Israel has been preparing for the six months since 10/7. It is hard to \"think like a religious fanatic.\" We don't know. And no American safe within our country can fully judge what Israel's leaders must weigh in their deliberations and do so with their country's long term interests in mind.\nThe \"clarity window\" for the West is, however, wide open right now. Israel has absolute justice on its side \u2014now and for a few more days or perhaps a couple of weeks (at best) because the world moves on quickly and forgets even faster. Once \"stability\" returns the pressure on Israel to de-escalate will grow and grow by actors who just want to get \"back to normal,\" as though that is actually possible.\nIf Israel does not strike back now, it seems very likely it won't strike back until it is either too late to do so or at least do so confident that a large portion of its friends in the West will applaud and, if not applaud, at least grudgingly acknowledge that it was obliged to do so.\nThe other new factor: The faith in the ability of high-tech intelligence capabilities to warn Israel of deadly attacks and thus to allow it to preempt those attacks is gone after the surprise of 10/7. Yes, warning was given this past weekend. Will it be the next time? Could Iran achieve strategic surprise in the way Hamas achieved tactical surprise on 10/7?\nWhat is clear beyond any doubt that an Israel that does not respond soon with a devastating counter-strike is an Israel that will have forfeited deterrence against attacks of at least equal intensity. At a moment when the United States and the United Kingdom are both led by very weak governments beset by electoral considerations, Israel has to decide for itself: Will it be cowed?\nIf so, it is hard to imagine circumstances when the Israel of 10/6 can be regained.\nHugh Hewitt is one of the country's leading journalists of the center-right.

People that are out there cheering military attacks of this scale and scope are not peace activists. These are antisemites, anti-Israel, pro-terrorist elements out there. And we need to stop calling them peace activists.\"\n\"They are not peace activists. You don't \u2014 peace activists do not cheer massive attacks against other countries, which is what they were doing yesterday. So, I guess this is part of the White House's effort to appease them by putting this out proactively,\" he continued.\nRubio also said the call would embolden Israel's enemies in the Middle East.\n\"It is the continuing part of this public game that they are playing, which frankly, encourages Iran and Hezbollah, which we haven't even talked about, and the Houthis and all these other elements that are targeting Israel,\" he added.\nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment.\nSelf-described anti-war activists in Chicago cheered after learning that Iran had launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel on Saturday.\nEarlier in the day at that same event, before the Iran attacks, one agitator led chants in Farsi translating to \"Death to America\" and \"Death to Israel,\" according to a Free Press reporter there.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Kristine Parks","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/rubiobiden.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.9139113,"_id":"f3e573814217cd1dddc5accf7361c3d0"},{"title":"GOP senators plan to force votes on stand alone Israel aid in wake of Iran attack","author":"Julia Johnson","published_date":"2024-04-15 21:50:55","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-senators-force-votes-stand-alone-israel-aid-iran-attack","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Sens. Marshall and Blackburn will each try to force a vote on a version of stand-alone Israel aid on the Senate floor on Monday, which Democrats are opposed to and expected to object to.","summary":"FIRST ON FOX: Republican Sens. Roger Marshall of Kansas and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee will look to force votes on two different versions of a stand-alone Israel aid measure in the Senate on Monday night.\nFollowing Iran's drone attack on Israel over the weekend, the two Republicans are planning to ask for unanimous consent to force votes on both Israel aid bills \u2013 one that is for $14.3 billion and includes cuts to Biden's $80 billion expansion of the Internal Revenue Service under the Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 and another for $17.6 billion that does not include a mechanism to pay for it. The former will be led by Marshall while Blackburn tries to force a vote on the latter.\nIn prepared remarks, Marshall is expected to tell his fellow senators: \"Time and time again, I see members, even the Democrat Majority Leader this weekend, say he stands with Israel.\"\nWith his unanimous consent to vote on the stand-alone Israel bill, Marshall said in a prepared statement: \"My message today to my colleagues is that actions speak louder than words. We are tired of hearing the pro-Israel lip service while you simultaneously block every effort to help Israel in its time of need. History will not forget this; let's do the right thing.\"\n\"Democrats say they support Israel, but their actions since October 7 to repeatedly block urgent standalone aid have told a different story,\" Blackburn told Fox News Digital in a statement.\n\"Senator Marshall and I will once again request the Senate swiftly and unanimously give Israel the resources they need to continue their fight against terrorism. In light of Iran's historic attack this weekend, I hope our Democratic colleagues will put politics aside and join us in support of our Jewish friends.\"\nA Democratic senator is likely to object to the request, as the caucus has maintained its desire to tie Israel aid to Ukraine aid.\nMarshall previously tried to force a vote on the same measure late last year, but his request for unanimous consent was objected to by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who argued on the chamber floor, \"Ukraine can no more afford a delay than our allies in Israel.\"\nThe bill for aid to Israel only, and not Ukraine or Taiwan, passed the House earlier last year, by a largely party-line vote of 226 to 196. Two Republicans defected from their conference, while 12 Democrats voted with Republicans. The measure's IRS funding cut was a particularly controversial point of the bill, as it took funds allocated within Biden's much-touted IRA law. While Republicans claimed the additional money for the IRS would mean auditing more Americans, Democrats claimed it would instead prevent wealthy individuals from getting away with not paying taxes.\nThe White House renewed its threat on Monday to veto aid to Israel that was not tied to other foreign aid. At a White House press briefing, Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre claimed, \"We will not accept a stand alone.\"\n\"Stand-alone would actually not help Israel and Ukraine,\" she said.\nNational security communications spokesperson John Kirby reiterated the White House's opposition at the same briefing, telling reporters, \"We are opposed to a standalone bill that would just work on Israel.\"\nMarshall and Blackburn each voted against the $95.3 billion supplemental foreign aid package that included Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan in February. Arguing against the aid, Marshall told his colleagues that voting against the measure was putting U.S. \"national security first by securing the border first.\"\n\"Up here in DC, my friends across the aisle, the White House, they continue to put Ukraine funding as their priority,\" he said.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Julia Johnson","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Double-Rectangle-Inset-3.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.909107,"_id":"47ece44e2d393d2a0f1b7f7a69d6fbac"},{"title":"Harvard closes Harvard Yard as anti-Israel protesters take over Ivy League campuses across country: report","author":"Stephen Sorace","published_date":"2024-04-22 19:04:02","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/harvard-closes-harvard-yard-as-anti-israel-protesters-take-over-ivy-league-campuses-across-country","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Harvard University is reportedly restricting access to Harvard Yard this week as anti-Israel protesters take over open areas of other Ivy League campuses.","summary":"Harvard University has closed Harvard Yard at the heart of its campus and is restricting access to the outside area until Friday, according to a report, a move that comes as anti-Israel protesters take over open areas of other Ivy League campuses.\nSigns posted on the gates of Harvard Yard on Sunday said that the area was closed to non-Harvard ID holders and that \"structures, including tents and tables\" are not permitted without prior permission, the Harvard Crimson first reported.\nBlocking pedestrian pathways and access to building entrances was also prohibited, according to the Crimson.

Johnson was asked about videos from the streets of Brooklyn, New York where anti-Israel agitators burned an American flag.\n\"What's so shameful about all this, for all the obvious reasons, is that we're turning our back on Israel, our critical ally and important friend,\" Johnson said on Tuesday. \"But the most shameful part about it, I'm afraid, is the silence that you hear from Washington.

I spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu about a week ago, and he expressed the same sentiment. We've got to stand strong. We got to tell the world and show the world that Israel is not alone here.\"\nHundreds of anti-Israel protesters shut down traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco on Monday, holding banners with the messages \"Stop the world for Gaza\" and \"End the siege on Gaza now!\" Aerial images captured by KTVU later showed the Golden Gate Bridge protesters being taken into custody and the banners being put away.\nA similar demonstration has also blocked traffic on Interstate-880 in Oakland.\nMeanwhile, in New York City, nearly 300 protesters gathered outside the New York Stock Exchange on Monday morning. Protesters were heard chanting \"free, free Palestine\" - \"Palestine will never die\" - \"from Wall Street to Palestine\u2026 intifada\" - \"Israel bombs. USA pays. How many kids did you kill today?\"\nJohnson called out Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., directly for not speaking out against the protests.\n\"It's unconscionable that anybody would stand by that,\" Johnson said. \"Chuck Schumer is really responsible for Israel not being funded yet. Remember, we sent over an Israel funding package, back in October.

Why? Because Joe Biden said he would veto it. It's really shameful,\" he continued.\nIn Chicago, protesters blocked traffic to O'Hare Airport, causing delays that lasted for several hours after the protest was broken up by police.

Iran blames Israel for the attack, although Israel has not claimed any involvement.\nRaisi said Saturday's attack was a limited one, and that if Iran was provoked to carry out a bigger attack, \"nothing would remain from the Zionist regime,\" the official IRNA news agency reported.\nRaisi's remarks came during a military parade that was relocated to a barracks north of the capital, Tehran, from its usual venue on a highway in the city's southern outskirts. Iranian authorities gave no explanation for the relocation.\nUniquely, state TV did not broadcast it live, as it had in previous years.\nOn Saturday, Israel, with help from the U.S., the United Kingdom, neighboring Jordan and other nations, successfully intercepted nearly every missile and drone that Iran launched.

But Iran escalated way beyond what it has ever hitherto dared to do. Biden urged Israel to stand down. Astonishing.\nYesterday's column laid out the origins of the Biden appeasement policy. At this writing Israel has not responded. I hope by the time this column posts that Israel will have done so. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Israel is very close to unleashing a response.\nWe have also learned that nine missiles from Iran did manage to evade interception and strike the IAF's Nevatim Air Base in southern Israel along with another nearby IAF base, and that 120 ballistic missiles were launched during the Iran attack, as well as 200 plus cruise missiles and drones. That's not a symbolic attack. It is a \"mostly failed\" massive attack. It wasn't intended to be a show. It was a strategic attack on the Jewish State. Iran wanted to kill and destroy.\nSo Biden's \"Don't!\" didn't work again. One poster on X quipped that every time he says \"Don't,\" they do. Commentary's Seth Mandel pointed out in a memorable Commentary podcast that Biden's has met the \"foreign policy fiasco\" measure of former President Obama's \"red line\" erasure. John Podhoretz noted in same podcast that Biden \"hasn't said anything\" at all after Saturday night's bombardment. \"His policy toward Iran is shredded. There is no policy towards Iran anymore.\"\nBoth are right, as are Abe Greenwald, Christine Rosen and Matthew Continetti who are also on this memorable pod. There is a bet amongst them now on whether Israel both responds to Iran and enters Rafah to finish off Hamas.\nThe United Kingdom's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Foreign Minister David Cameron have joined the Neville Chamberlain club anchored at the White House. If Israel acts it will do so despite their allies in the defense of the Jewish State asking them not to go on offense. But as former Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren bluntly stated on Monday's radio show: \"Defense is not deterrence.\" He's right too. The willingness to take a punch, or many punches, doesn't deter the enemy. It encourages the enemy to try another assault.\nThis isn't the sort of thing one has to learn from the Melian Dialogue in Thucydides (though it is indeed found there.) You get the same lesson from Ralphie in a Christmas Story when he finally snaps: Bullies have to be stopped. They don't evolve into your friends. Not on a playground. Not in the realm of national security.\nWhat does Hamas's Sinwar think at that point? Is he going to continue to reject Israel's cease-fire offers because he's a religious fanatic or because he expects to emerge from the tunnels as the terrorist equivalent of Churchill at the close of the worst part of the Battle of Britain because the United States forces Israel to stay out of Rafah and thus not to destroy those tunnels?\nWhat does Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah see happening here? And how about \"MBS\" and \"MBZ\" \u2014the rulers of our allies, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates?\nAnd what do the triumvirs \"Supreme Leader\" of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei, Russia's dictator Vladimir Putin and the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping conclude if the United States succeeds in obliging Israel to accept this unprecedented attack on the Jewish State? Nothing good. Many things bad. For Israel, for Ukraine, for Taiwan. And for the United States.\nIran has funded and controlled its proxies to the north and south of Israel for decades. Iran never dared such an attack until now. Khamenei has taken the measure of Team Biden. Israel's War Cabinet must persuade him that it is not the measure of the Jewish State.\nWe know Israel killed many Iranians with its strike on the Damascus headquarters of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps. We know that apologists for Tehran's mullahs are suggesting, and sometimes asserting, that Israel's strikes provoked this off-the-charts escalation from Tehran, as if there was some unspoken deal between Iran and Israel that Israel would not tag out Iran's commanders in the field if they could get back to a base.\nIt's up to Israel now to reset the understandings Iran has developed as well as the mullahs' reliance on President Biden to always take and advise the wrong course on national security. Hopefully by the time you read this, Prime Minister Netanyahu and the War Cabinet have done just that.\nHugh Hewitt is one of the country's leading journalists of the center-right.

Hours earlier, she said she had been suspended from Barnard College for \"standing in solidarity with Palestinians facing a genocide.\"\nThe 21-year-old has gone into more detail about the suspension. Along with not being able to go to classes, she said she has been evicted from campus housing and banned from using the dining hall with her meal plan.\n\"I was a little bit frantic, like, where am I going to sleep?

The college did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.\nDozens of anti-Israel activists began protesting at Columbia University on Wednesday morning, creating an encampment on the main lawn in protest of Israel's war against Hamas. Protests continued into the overnight hours with calls for an intifada and the death of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nOmar praised her daughter's participation in the protests.

The likelihood of support for such a measure is especially high if it is determined to be the only way to pass an aid package to Ukraine and Israel.\nIn the wake of an Iranian drone attack on Israel over the weekend, a renewed sense of urgency was placed on lobbying attempts for aid in Congress, which were already underway.\nThe Senate passed a $95.3 billion foreign aid package that included Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan in February. Despite passing the upper chamber, it managed to split the Republican conference, several of whom had been critical of continued aid to Ukraine. A number of Republican senators were also unhappy that the package didn't address the southern border.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has yet to bring the supplemental package to the House floor for a vote, despite many House Republicans having urged him to do so. The package would likely pass, but with significant Republican opposition.\nWith a path forward on foreign aid still unclear, House Republican leaders are set to meet Monday evening to discuss potential ways to address both Israel and Ukraine.\nAccording to several Democratic congressional aides, the attack on Iran isn't likely to make Senate Democrats more amenable to a stand-alone bill for Israel. This is partially because Ukraine aid would have more difficulty passing without being tied to Israel. One Democratic aide even suggested stand-alone Israel aid would face trouble passing without the alottment for Ukraine.\nWhat the attack on Israel at the hands of Iran is more likely to prompt from Democrats is an even harder push for the House to take up the Senate-passed supplemental bill, per one Congressional aide.\nWhile Senate Democrats still prefer the supplemental bill and believe it is the fastest way to get aid to Israel, they aren't completely opposed to other ways of obtaining it.\nTwo aides told Fox News Digital that numerous Senate Democrats are open to advancing a package that combines aid for Ukraine and Israel, with the provision that assistance to Ukraine is extended as a loan, aligning with Trump's proposal.\nThis is especially true if it presents a faster opportunity to get aid to both countries.\nRepublicans are similarly interested in the idea of the aid as a loan, per two GOP aides.\nA Senate Republican aide indicated that the appetite for the supplemental package, which was passed but severely divided Republicans, likely remains the same. Instead, the recent attack on Israel renewed desires to pass Israel aid apart from Ukraine and Taiwan, which Democrats have largely rejected.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/4032d4bb-Rectangle-Inset-right.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.8518605,"_id":"f04718204f2d9db1014125c06bf0c83f"},{"title":"13 Dems vote against resolution condemning Iran after Israel strike","author":"Elizabeth Elkind","published_date":"2024-04-18 16:54:16","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/13-dems-vote-against-resolution-condemning-iran-after-israel-strike","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a measure to condemn Iran's airstrikes on Israel, but 13 Democrats and one Republican voted against it.","summary":"More than a dozen House Democrats voted against a resolution condemning Iran's airstrikes on Israel Thursday.\nThe resolution, which also affirms U.S. support for Israel responding to the attack however it deems necessary, overwhelmingly passed 404 to 14.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.; Cori Bush, D-Mo.; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y.; and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was also among those opposing the bill.\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., the No. 3 House GOP leader, tore into the Democrats who voted against condemning Iran in a statement to Fox News Digital after the vote.\n\"House Democrats' hatred for Israel runs so deep they would rather defend terrorists than support our strongest ally in the Middle East. Vote after vote, the Democrat Party continues to cement their position as the pro-terrorist party,\" Emmer said.\nIran fired a barrage of rockets at Israel over the weekend, 99% of which were intercepted, in retaliation for an Israeli attack on an Iranian diplomatic facility in Syria. It's a marked escalation of tensions in the region as the first attack on Israel directly from Iranian soil.\nThe 13 progressives who voted against the measure are among a growing faction of the Democratic Party who are critical of the U.S.'s strong ties to Israel, particularly in the wake of Israel's invasion of Gaza.\nIsrael's war on Hamas began after militants from the pro-Palestinian terror group invaded southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 and killed more than 1,000 people. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians, has said over 30,000 Palestinians have died in the months since.\nHouse Republicans have seized on the Democratic divides over Israel, distancing themselves from that fight by standing firm with the longstanding relationship. In response to the Iran attack, House GOP leadership lined up 17 bills for a vote this week affirming U.S. support for Israel and against Iran.\nOcasio-Cortez criticized that effort earlier this week in a statement, \"Following last weekend's unprecedented response by Iran to Israel's attack on its consulate, the Republican Majority is explicitly leveraging a series of bills to further escalate tensions in the Middle East.\"\n\"This is a blatant attempt to distract from their own incompetence. The country and the world need real leadership from the House of Representatives in this moment, not resolutions designed purposefully to increase the likelihood of a deadly regional war or worse.

U.S. officials said 99% of those were intercepted.\nThe move, in retaliation for Israel's attack on its consulate in Damascus, signified a major escalation of tensions amid Israel's ongoing war with Hamas. Despite decades of hostilities, Iran has never directly attacked Israel, instead relying on proxy forces in Iraq, Lebanon, and elsewhere.\nThursday's resolution condemning Iran overwhelmingly passed 404 to 14. Thirteen Democrats voted against the resolution including \"Squad\" member Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.; Cori Bush, D-Mo.; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y.; and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.\nJust one House Republican, Rep. Thomas Massive, R-Ky., voted against the bill.\nIsrael's war on Hamas began after militants from the pro-Palestinian terror group invaded southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 and killed more than 1,000 people. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians, has said over 30,000 Palestinians have died in the months since.\nSince Oct. 7, Fetterman has repeatedly irked his Democratic colleagues with his fervent support for Israel.\nEarlier this week, Fetterman said he would never \"capitulate to the fringe\" of his party.

A fourth House GOP aide also confirmed they will discuss Iran's attack.\nHouse lawmakers on both sides of the aisle normally meet with their respective parties the morning after they begin their weekly legislative session, giving them time to arrive back in Washington from around the country.\nBut the tense state of international affairs prompted Johnson to call House Republicans together for 5:30 p.m. on Monday.\nIran launched a barrage of missiles toward Israel over the weekend, the vast majority of which were intercepted.\nLeaders in the White House and Senate used the attack to put renewed pressure on Johnson to pass the Senate's $95 billion supplemental funding bill with aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Johnson has passed two standalone Israel aid bills so far, neither of which was taken up by the Democrat-controlled Senate.\nBut Ukraine is a politically fraught issue for Johnson as he navigates a razor-thin two-seat House majority, and a growing number of Ukraine aid skeptics in his conference.\nOne of those skeptics is Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who has previously suggested ousting Johnson from power if he put that funding package on the House floor.\nOne of the three senior House GOP aides who spoke with Fox News Digital said Johnson received pushback from members over the weekend regarding the idea of combining funding for Ukraine and Israel this week.\nNevertheless, Johnson has been circulating ideas on Ukraine aid that have gotten bipartisan support, including a lend-lease option that former President Trump, the de facto leader of the Republican Party, signaled he could support.\n\"We're looking at it right now, and they're talking about it, and we're thinking about making it in the form of a loan instead of just a gift,\" Trump said of Ukraine aid during a press conference with Johnson at Mar-a-Lago on Friday. His support would be a powerful insulator for Johnson against Ukraine critics, the vast majority of whom support the ex-president.\nThe other proposal is a bipartisan measure that would liquidate seized Russian assets and then use those funds as aid to Ukraine. It's being called the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity (REPO) for Ukrainians Act.\nTiming on a possible vote this week is not immediately clear. Two of the four House GOP aides who spoke with Fox News Digital said they expect at least Israel funding to get a vote this week. One of those two anticipated a vote on some kind of Israel and Ukraine combined package that would be different from the Senate's $95 billion bill.\nThe House Majority Whip's office did not list any Israel or Ukraine funding bills on its expected schedule on Monday morning, but advised lawmakers that \"additional legislative items related to security supplemental appropriations are possible.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to Johnson's office for comment.\nSpeaking on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" this past weekend, Johnson suggested he wants the House to take up Israel aid this week for a third time.\n\"The details of that package are being put together right now,\" he said. \"We're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues.\"\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner, R-Ohio, meanwhile, told NBC's \"Meet The Press\" that Johnson \"made it clear\" that he wants a House vote this week on some kind of aid funding for Israel and Ukraine.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Elizabeth Elkind","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/mike-johnson-funding.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.8059506,"_id":"7ac9d9364fb5900e10820b63deb33b7c"},{"title":"Squad Democrats push Israel aid package amendment in failed cease-fire effort: 'Death warrant on Palestinians'","author":"Louis Casiano","published_date":"2024-04-20 21:08:07","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/squad-democrats-push-israel-aid-package-amendment-failed-cease-fire-effort-death-warrant-on-palestinians","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Two Squad members offered an unsuccessful amendment to deny aid to Israel a day before the House passed a military spending package.","summary":"U.S. Reps.

Critics argue Israel needs to inflict severe damage on Iran's regime.","summary":"JERUSALEM - Just a week ago, some residents of Iran's central province of Isfahan - a nuclear weapon and missile production hub of the Islamic Republic - cheered the Iranian rockets fired into Israel.\nIn the early-morning hours of Friday, the Isfahan authorities were jolted by Israeli strikes that triggered their air defense systems in the cities of Isfahan and Tabriz after three explosions went off near an important military airbase close to Isfahan. It is unclear how much damage Israel's strikes inflicted. Iran's regime reported no casualties.\nPotkin Azarmehr, a British-Iranian expert on Iran, told Fox News Digital, \"What my sources are saying is that there is no damage to the airbase, but Israel proved it can jam Iran's air defense and bypass it to the extent that they didn't even manage to sound the alarm despite Isfahan being in the heart of Iranian territory.\"\nHe continued that \"Isfahan is the epicenter of Iran's air defense. If they couldn't detect the attack, serious questions about the reliability of Iran's air defense must be asked.\"\nAzarmehr noted, \"When the Pakistan Air Force retaliated after Iran missile attack, there was no air defense.\"\nIsfahan is a top-priority strike location for Israeli forces, because the area is one of the central features of the regime's illicit atomic weapons program. It is where the powerful Shahab medium-range missiles are made. Isfahan was the testing ground back in late October for the country's missile system, which proved capable of reaching Israel last week.\nIsraeli strikes against Iran's regime are typically shrouded in ambiguity to avoid any fingerprints on the missions and to leave Tehran's rulers guessing.\nIn January, 2023, Israeli drone strikes allegedly hit a weapons factory inside Isfahan. The drone attack last year was said to be executed by Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.\nThe Jerusalem Post reported that Friday's response was meant to be internalized as \"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Israel retaliated where they were attacked.\"\nIsfahan is also a hotbed of antisemitism and Holocaust denial. At an April Al-Quds day demonstration, the last Friday of Ramadan, Iran promoted the destruction of Israel. The Imam of Isfahan, Ayatollah Yousef Tabatabainejad, declared, \"It is our obligation to support the oppressed Muslims who have been oppressed, and we hope that, with divine providence in this path of resistance, we will be able to wipe the Zionist regime off the face of the earth.\"\nIn 2016, the Islamic Association of the University of Isfahan announced a cartoon contest that aims to mock and deny the Holocaust.\nSheina Vojoudi, an associate fellow at the Gold Institute for International Strategy, told Fox News Digital that \"Isfahan is of great strategic importance in Iran. There are military and nuclear bases in Isfahan, and it shows how the regime is concentrated in this city and the rockets that were fired at Israel were also fired from one of the bases in Isfahan.\"\nVojoudi, an Iranian dissident who opposes the Islamic Republic's government, added that the \"attack on Isfahan means that this city is one of the main points where the regime can pose a threat to Israel and, of course, to the Iranian people because of the intense activities of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The regime's nuclear activities have almost ruined the lives of the people of Isfahan and increased the rate of cancer in Isfahan.\"\nWhile the U.S. and allies seem to be content with Israel's reaction, other experts say an opportunity has been wasted.\n\"This is a missed opportunity. Israel needed to impose a serious cost on Iran to restore deterrence. I worry that this pin-prick reprisal will instead teach Iran that it can get away with large-scale attacks on U.S. partners without serious consequences,\" said Matthew Kroenig, vice president and senior director of the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security and the Council's Director of Studies.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Benjamin Weinthal","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/AP24110352791764-scaled-e1713523503400.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.784302,"_id":"2d0e045e1c326030832a5085f8ef91ba"},{"title":"World leaders push Israel to avoid escalation following Iran attack","author":"Greg Norman","published_date":"2024-04-15 13:38:19","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/world-leaders-push-israel-avoid-escalation-following-iran-attack","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"World leaders are urging Israel to avoid escalating tensions in the Middle East on Monday following Iran's attack on the country over the weekend.","summary":"World leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, are pushing Israel on Monday to \"avoid an escalation\" against Iran in the Middle East following the Islamic Republic's attack on the country over the weekend.\nMacron, speaking to French media BFMTV and RMC, said his country had carried out \"interceptions\" of some of the missiles Iran launched at Israel and that it will try to \"convince Israel that we must not respond by escalating.\"\n\"We have condemned, we have intervened, we will do everything to avoid an escalation, an inferno,\" Macron added, noting that France will work to \"isolate Iran, increase sanctions and find a path to peace in the region.\"\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz also called on Israel on Monday to \"contribute to de-escalation\" in the Middle East and that \"Iran must stop this aggression.\"\nIran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel in response to a deadly strike on the Iranian consulate in Syria earlier this month that left 12 dead, including Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander in Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps.

He is the chair of the association.\nCardinal Dolan started his tour in Jerusalem on Friday and arrived in Bethlehem on Saturday, when Iran unleashed a missile attack on Israel.\n\"This Sunday in Bethlehem, all does seem calm and bright. And it is for us. We feel safe and secure. That wasn't true in the middle of last night when the air raid sirens went off, and we had to go down and seek security at Notre Dame Center.\" Dolan said in a video shared on X. \"But right now things look good, and we're grateful for that.\"\nOn Sunday, Dolan led mass at the Our Lady of Peace chapel in the Notre Dame of Jerusalem Center near Bethlehem.\n\"We can never forget where we came from.

Iran has been attacking other nations since the mullahs came to power in 1979.","summary":"On the evening of April 17, following his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron confirmed in an interview with the BBC that \"It is clear that the Israelis are making a decision to act.\" After four days of tense deliberations within the Israeli cabinet since the April 13 direct attack by the Islamic regime of Iran against Israel, which involved more than 300 objects, containing 30 cruise missiles, 120 ballistic missiles and 170 drones, it is evident that Israel has reached the decision to target the bases of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps inside Iran. The question is no longer whether Israel will launch an attack on Iran, but rather when and to what extent the retaliatory strike by Israel might occur.\nThe United States and Israel, with the support from allies and friendly nations such as Britain, France, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, could successfully intercept IRGC's missiles. Then, immediately Biden asked his \"fellow G7 leaders to coordinate a united diplomatic response.\" The objective was to urge Israel to avoid further escalation of conflict in the Middle East.\nHowever, these efforts were perceived as weak from Israel's standpoint. Israel has valid reasons to be concerned about the next phase of Iran's actions against the Jewish state. The aggressive behavior of the mullahs' regime over the past 45 years, starting from the storming of the American Embassy in Tehran and the hostage crisis in 1979, to the bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Argentina in 1992, the October 7 attack six months ago, the recent massive missile and drone attack, and numerous other assaults against the United States and Israel, all underscore the fact that this regime cannot be trusted to behave rationally and respectfully within the international community.\nDespite all of that, it was revealed days before last weekend's attack that the Islamic regime of Iran has a supply of highly enriched uranium, which, according to current and former officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency, \"could be converted to weapons-grade fuel for at least three bombs within a time frame ranging from a few days to a few weeks.\"\n\"This cannot just pass. It cannot go unanswered,\" Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Herzog said in an interview with Bret Baier on Fox News. \"Because if you don't answer, the Iranians will feel impunity, and they will feel that you can strike anywhere in the Middle East or elsewhere, without any consequences.\" He followed \"We have to respond, and we will respond. How exactly we do it remains to be seen. I don't want to discuss any details.\"\nHerzog clearly stated that, \"In our part of the world, defense is not enough to create deterrence. We need to push back.\" He added \"If we do not push back against Iran, in a matter of few years, you may see nuclear warheads on ballistic missiles.\" Israel has valid concerns and may feel compelled to preemptively disable IRGC's missile and nuclear capabilities permanently, echoing their 1981 intervention at Iraq's Osirak Nuclear reactor.\nWhite House National Security Spokesperson John Kirby addressed questions about Iran and the IRGC's motives regarding the recent missile attack. Kirby informed reporters, \"The aim was to get as many [missiles and drones] through Israel's defenses as possible.\" He refuted theories suggesting that the Iranians intended the operation to fail, labeling such claims as \"categorically false\" and asserting, \"Given the scale of this attack, Iran's intent was clearly to cause significant destruction and casualties.\"\nReflect on the potential threat if Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, known for his enmity with the United States and Israel, had access to nuclear ballistic missiles. He likely would not hesitate to use such weapons, aligning with their longstanding so-called Islamic revolutionary slogan of \"Israel must be wiped off the map.\"\nIn 1989, seven days after Ali Khamenei was appointed as Iran's second supreme leader following Ruhollah Khomeini's death, Smith Hempstone, soon to be appointed by President George H.W. Bush as Ambassador to Kenya, speculated that \"Unfortunately if Khamenei remains in power and seeks an opening to the outside world, he is more likely to look to the Soviet Union than to the U.S. He is a graduate of Moscow's Patrice Lumumba university.\"\nOver the past 35 years, Khamenei's actions have consistently revealed his ties to Russia. Under his command, the IRGC has suppressed numerous uprisings, with the most brutal crackdown occurring in November 2019. This incident saw the IRGC, under General Qassem Soleimani's leadership, kill at least 1,500 peaceful protesters across 200 cities using military-grade weapons.\nFollowing Soleimani's death by a U.S. drone strike ordered by then-President Donald Trump, IRGC General Mohammadreza Zahedi took control as the deputy commander of the Quds Force. Zahedi, known for his long-standing loyalty to Khamenei, was responsible for suppressing protests involving mostly teenagers in 500 cities last year.\nDespite all of that, it was revealed days before last weekend's attack that the Islamic regime of Iran has a supply of highly enriched uranium, which, according to current and former officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency, \"could be converted to weapons-grade fuel for at least three bombs within a time frame ranging from a few days to a few weeks.\"\nZahedi himself was killed on April 1st by an Israeli strike in Syria, which subsequently triggered a missile attack by Iran against Israel. He was killed by Israel because its undoubtedly confirmed \"that he participated in the planning and execution of the October 7 attacks \u2013 and at the time of his assassination, Zahedi was planning other terror plots.\"\nGiven the historical actions attributed to Iran's supreme leader and the IRGC's pervasive influence in Iran, Israel has significant reasons for concern. Over the past two decades, the IRGC has gradually taken control of key aspects of Iranian society, including almost every seat in parliament, the cabinet, national TV, the banking system, and the import and export sectors, as well as the police departments and the supreme leader's headquarters, all under Khamenei's direct command.\nAs a result, IRGC facilities represent a broad array of potential Israeli targets for retaliation following missile attacks. Understandably, many Iranians view potential Israeli strikes on these targets as a beacon of hope for the overthrow of the Mullahs' regime. While Biden expressed concern in his op-ed in The Wall Street Journal about the potential for being dragged into war, he should be even more worried about the prospect that \"Israel's failure to strike back at Iran could lead to NUCLEAR WAR,\" warned the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Amir Fakhravar","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/israel-jet.jpg","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.754872,"_id":"6caa3d4cab19a46807d179075303a168"},{"title":"SOUNDING OFF: Morgan Ortagus and Gen.

The Jewish state responded with far superior military technology in retaliation.","summary":"No matter how you look at it, the first direct attack by Iran against Israel was a victory for the Jewish state.\nAnd the United States. And Britain and France. And an utter humiliation for Tehran.\nYet many are still understandably nervous that it could lead to a wider war.\nIn launching more than 300 drones and missiles over the weekend, the Iranians showed the world that Israel's military technology is far superior to theirs. Iran no longer seems quite so threatening, and Israel seems more than capable of defending itself.\nEven as the media spotlight shifted yesterday to Donald Trump's first criminal trial \u2013 with round-the-clock reports on arguments over admissible evidence and a gag order, and jury selection \u2013 the Middle East loomed large as a potential powder keg.\nFor decades, Iran has fought a shadow war against Israel through its proxies. Without its support of the Hamas terrorists, there would have been no barbaric slaughter of Israelis on Oct. 7, or the unthinkable seizure of civilian hostages. Without its backing of Hezbollah, rockets would not have rained down from southern Lebanon, including during Iran's latest assault. The same goes for Yemen.\nThe reason for the direct attack, as Iran sees it, was retaliation. Israel had killed three top Iranian commanders in a strike against its consulate in Syria. Iran's leaders vowed to strike back.\nNow they had no idea how effective Israel's Iron Dome and Arrow missile defense systems would be at stopping their assault. Many Israelis could have been killed, which would have inflamed the region further.\nMy own view is that Iran's goal was to save face and inflict only limited damage. The minor incursion against an Israeli military base strongly suggests that.\nAnd while there were dozens of injuries, including the hospitalization of a young Bedouin Arab girl, the lack of fatalities also helped things from boiling over.\nAfter all, 99% of Iran's incoming weapons were destroyed outside Israeli airspace, and some failed on their own.\nWhat's more, Iran clearly telegraphed the timing \u2013 so precisely that Biden knew when to return from Rehoboth to the White House \u2013 and declared its response over while some projectiles were still in the air.\nThis was a big win for President Biden, who vowed an \"iron-clad\" defense of Israel, but after a congratulatory call to Bibi Netanyahu, word quickly leaked to the press that the president was urging the prime minister not to retaliate.\n\"Take the win\" was one of the phrases attributed to Biden. Another was \"slow things down.\"\nWhich leaves Netanyahu with a monumental choice.\nHe could blow off Biden's warnings and retaliate against Iran, which, especially if there are casualties, could lead to further rounds of airstrikes that could easily turn into a wider war. (Israel says it will \"exact a price.\")\nOr Netanyahu could do nothing and allow things to settle down \u2013 which would run the risk of allowing the Iranians to pay no price for a sustained attack that had many frightened Israelis spending all night in bomb shelters.\nAnd there is an additional layer of questions involving Bibi's self-interest. The longer the war goes on, the longer it protects him from possible ouster and potential charges. Israeli streets were filled with anti-Bibi protesters angry with his attempt to neuter the Supreme Court. That quieted down during the war, though there have been some demonstrations since, so Netanyahu may just view a gradual escalation as his insurance policy.\nThere is no question that the massive death toll and widespread hunger in Gaza have hurt Israel in the court of world opinion. It has hurt the Biden administration at home as well, particularly as Netanyahu has ignored the president's calls for restraint and more civilian aid, especially regarding the coming invasion of heavily populated Rafah.\nBut the brazen Iranian attack has been a gift to Israel by showing the world that the Mideast's only democracy has come under sustained assault by one of its Arab enemies. And it has brought America and Israel closer together, despite previous tensions, as the administration has delivered on its promise to race to the Jewish state's defense with warplanes and ships.\nOne final consideration is whether the aerial assault has transformed the atmosphere on Capitol Hill. The months-long failure to provide further aid to Israel because of petty partisan politics looks all the more pathetic in light of the Iranian fusillade.\nBoth sides bear some responsibility, but it's the House Republicans who carry the heaviest burden because of Speaker Mike Johnson's refusal to allow a vote on aid to Israel. A compromise effort collapsed when Donald Trump objected to a military aid bill that also would have beefed up border security, though to what extent is debatable.\nDoes anyone really doubt that if Johnson put an Israel bill on the floor today, it would pass overwhelmingly?\nThe speaker, after meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, told Fox News that he wants to bring an Israel measure to the floor this week. He also hinted that he would like to include aid to Ukraine \u2013 a decidedly less popular move within the Republican caucus \u2013 with Trump saying it could take the form of a loan rather than an outright grant.\nIn exchange, Johnson wants to see a relaxation of Biden's energy policy \u2013 which would help a potential project in his Louisiana district \u2013 a pork-barrel trade that seems a small price to pay.\nThere are many cross-pressures, many tensions, many moving parts, but it's time for Congress to get something done after an unconscionable delay.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Howard Kurtz","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/biden-split-iran-strikes.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.7388215,"_id":"a49d4c16fb715a91f4acf3e69f351259"},{"title":"Israel strikes back at Iran: 5 key questions","author":"Timothy Nerozzi","published_date":"2024-04-19 14:24:07","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-strikes-back-iran-5-key-questions","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Israeli carried out a \"limited\" strike against Iran on Friday, targeting the country's Isfahan province, which is where Natanz, one of Iran's nuclear facilities, is located.","summary":"Israel carried out limited strikes in Iran early Friday in retaliation for Tehran firing a barrage of missiles and drones at Israel last Saturday.\nHere are the key facts you need to know about the latest escalation of violence between the two countries.\nFox News confirmed there have been explosions in Iran's Isfahan province, which is where Natanz, one of Iran's nuclear facilities, is located.\nA well-placed military source has told Fox News that the strike was \"limited.\"\nIranian state media stated following the attack that the nation's atomic sites were \"fully safe\" and not struck by the missiles.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency, a United Nations affiliate watchdog organization, later confirmed \"there is no damage to Iran's nuclear sites.\"\nThere have been no reports of large-scale damage or casualties.\nA senior Iranian official reportedly told Reuters on Friday that Tehran has no immediate plans to strike back.\nThat official said \"the foreign source of the incident has not been confirmed\" and \"the discussion leans more towards infiltration than attack.\"\nIranian state media reportedly has been downplaying Friday's strikes.

Today, we condemn the godless mullahs who epitomize the head of the snake of war and terror in the Middle East.\"\nThe resolution accuses Iran of having \"contributed to terrorism and regional instability\" in the Middle East in the wake of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, according to legislative text previewed by Fox News Digital.\nIt also affirms U.S. support for Iranian citizens who have demonstrated against the fundamentalist Islamic government by recognizing \"the rights of the Iranian people and their struggle to establish a democratic, secular, and nonnuclear Republic of Iran.\"\nAt least one member of the House GOP's top leadership ranks, Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., is backing the bill.\nIran launched a barrage of airstrikes against Israel over the weekend \u2013 99% of which were intercepted \u2013 after accusing Israel of attacking its diplomatic facilities in Damascus, killing at least seven officials, including a top commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps.\nNo direct injuries or deaths were reported, but the move marks a significant escalation in the region as the first attack launched at Israel from Iranian soil.\nIran's retaliatory strikes were condemned by leaders in the U.S. and abroad as disproportionate and brazen.\nThe country's regime has been accused of financing Hamas, the Palestinian terror group whose militants invaded Israel on Oct. 7 last year in a surprise attack that killed more than 1,000 people. Iran's government has also backed Houthi rebels in Yemen \u2013 the militant group that has been attacking western ships in the Red Sea.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Elizabeth Elkind","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/leader-iran-airstrikes.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.7143054,"_id":"9e8d71b0b8e8b35a9757706a6b309b6b"},{"title":"Digital sprinkler system helps cut water costs for homeowners","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-22 11:55:14","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6351406373112","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Skip Bedell joins 'Fox & Friends' to demonstrate how IrriGreen can help homeowners with their lawn and water bills.","summary":"All times eastern FOX News Radio Live Channel Coverage WATCH LIVE: Riot police storm Yale University's campus as hundreds of students stage anti-Israel protest\nAll times eastern FOX News Radio Live Channel Coverage WATCH LIVE: Riot police storm Yale University's campus as hundreds of students stage anti-Israel protest","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/964677cf-ffc0-4dc1-9aaf-9964d3a4e3a0/d1bf044f-38b0-4f1d-916b-d3822ea82d2a/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.7053385,"_id":"531cb694b2d5d112a3bce26e7f93e84a"},{"title":"Anti-Israel protesters heard shouting \u2018We are Hamas,' \u2018Long live Hamas' amid Columbia U demonstrations","author":"Brie Stimson","published_date":"2024-04-19 21:17:32","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/anti-israel-protesters-heard-shouting-we-hamas-long-live-hamas-columbia-university-demonstrations","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Some protesters near Columbia University shouted pro-Hamas slogans this week as the anti-Israel protest began at the private university.","summary":"Anti-Israel protesters near Columbia University were heard shouting pro-Hamas slogans this week as demonstrations geared up at the private campus.\n\"We are Hamas!\" one aggressive protester was captured shouting on video.

Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, told Fox News Digital \"the secretary-general does not have the legal authority to label an event as \u2018genocide.' For the United Nations, that determination needs to be made by a competent court.\"\nIn its Jan. 26 preliminary ruling, the International Court of Justice did not rule that Israel had committed genocide but urged Israel to allow Gazans access to humanitarian aid and attempt to assist Palestinian civilians.\nWhen asked whether the secretary-general supports NGO Action News' instructions in an official U.N. publication that protesters engage in civil disobedience, Dujarric stated that NGO Action News \"is compiled in accordance with a mandate conferred by the member states of the U.N. General Assembly\" and \"does not fall under the authority or direction of the Secretary-General.\"\n\"You have all this anarchy on the streets of the U.S.,\" Bayefsky said, which \"ought to be a major wake-up call for American lawmakers and the criminal justice system since we are talking about an operation based in New York City itself.

The ADL noted it \"observed explicitly antisemitic and anti-Zionist rhetoric at 1,352 anti-Israel rallies across the United States\" after Oct. 7.\nWhen asked if he recognized that anti-Israel protests are among the reasons for the rise in antisemitic incidents in the U.S. following Oct. 7, Dujarric said \"the Secretary-General has publicly, and repeatedly, raised his voice against what he believes is the rise of antisemitism in many of our societies, whether that be in Europe, North America and other parts of the world.\n\"In addition, the secretary-general has also stated publicly that those that call for the destruction of the state of Israel is a form of modern antisemitism.\"\nBoth Israel's foreign minister and the United Nations ambassador have called for Guterres to resign over his treatment of Israel.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Beth Bailey","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Chicago_Police_Anti_Israel_protesters.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.694188,"_id":"e102a8ae818a9673e607876aba9dc3f4"},{"title":"Israel's advanced military technology on full display during Iran's attack","author":"Ruth Marks Eglash","published_date":"2024-04-18 08:00:10","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/israels-advanced-military-technology-full-display-during-iran-attack","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Iran's first-ever missile attack on Israel from its own soil brought together all different tiers of Israel's aerial defense system and showed its technological superiority.","summary":"JERUSALEM \u2014 Some of Israel's most advanced military technology was on display over the weekend when its multi-level aerial defense array led the way in striking down an estimated 99% of the more than 350 drones, rockets and missiles that were fired by Iran in an unprecedented attack on the Jewish state.\nFrom the Iron Dome, which in its latest format uses artificial intelligence (AI) to improve accuracy when shooting short-range surface-to-surface rockets, to David's Sling, which intercepts short- to medium-range and medium- to long-range surface-to-surface missiles, to the Arrow 2 and 3 systems, which is used for longer-range ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as AI-driven aircraft and other technology, Israel's defensive operation proved it was far superior to the offensive capabilities of the Islamic Republic.\nIn a press briefing following the attack, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari hailed Israel's defensive operation, which was carried out together with partners from U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), as a \"very significant strategic achievement.\" He said it demonstrated the \"exceptional professionalism\" of Israel's Aerial Defense Array and the \"defensive abilities of the air force as well as the army's military and technological superiority.\"\nTal Mimran, of the Cyber Security Research Center in the Faculty of Law at Hebrew University, told Fox News Digital that broader cyber methods and even AI technology were also likely used in the successful defense operation.\n\"AI-powered algorithms analyze radar and other sensor data to track incoming missiles and calculate the best time to intercept these more effectively and prioritize targets,\" he said. \"AI makes the system more effective against a wider range of threats, like drones and other small, low-flying objects.\"\nMimran said the Iron Dome, which Israel has been using for more than a decade to thwart rocket attacks from Gaza and Lebanon, now uses a \"significant application of AI to improve system accuracy.\"\n\"Using AI increases the Iron Dome's success rate to over 90% and reduces operating costs,\" he said. \"This is important because these threats are becoming increasingly common and pose a challenge to traditional air defense systems, as is evident in the Russia-Ukraine war.\"\nMimran also noted that over the past few months \"IDF officials have acknowledged using AI-based tools for several purposes, including targeting support, intelligence analysis, proactive forecasting and streamlined command and control.\"\nAccording to Mimran, Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza has spotlighted the IDF's Habsora, or \"the Gospel,\" an AI-based system that is used to generate possible military targets for attack. However, he said, accusations that the IDF has been using AI systems to commit mass assassinations give too much credit to the AI-powered tools currently in use.\nJonathan Conricus, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, played down the role of AI in the weekend operation, telling Fox News Digital that while the technology is incorporated in some air force systems, \"a live event with 300 incoming projectiles cannot be left to AI; there needs to be responsible human in the loop making real-time decisions.\"\n\"I know that senior air force personnel were involved in controlling every aspect of this,\" said Conricus, a former IDF spokesperson for the international media. \"I find it hard to believe that any significant part of the targeting done [over the weekend] was done with AI.\"\nHe said that over the past six months \u2013 since Oct. 7 when the Palestinian terror group Hamas carried out a brutal attack in southern Israel, sparking a full-blown war in Gaza and daily rocket fire by the militant Shiite terror group Hezbollah across Israel's northern border, too \u2013 Israel has been forced to utilize its innovative missile defense technology.\n\"All of the systems have been fully operational since Oct. 7 and all have confirmed real-world hits,\" Conricus said, adding that Israel's newest layer of aerial defense, the Arrow 3 system, debuted just a few months ago by intercepting ballistic missiles fired by the Yemen-based Houthis, an extremist Islamist group that is supported and funded by the fundamentalist Islamist regime in Tehran. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are also Iranian proxies.\n\"I think that today what we have is a pretty solid and well-rounded air defense that deals with a very wide array and broad spectrum of incoming threats, from very small and fast projectiles like UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) to extremely large and lethal ballistic missiles, which are also very fast, tremendously big and carry a ton of explosives,\" he said.\nIran's attack on Sunday \u2013 the first ever directly from its soil \u2013 brought together all the different tiers of Israel's defensive system, Conricus said.\n\"They are all interlinked and communicate with each other,\" he said, describing how a central command office provided an overall picture of the attack as it unfolded, giving a threat assessment in real time and coordinating the entire operation with the U.S. and other CENTCOM partners.\nConricus said that while many of the innovative defense systems were created by Israel, \"a large part of the development was also carried out with the Americans,\" allowing \"the radar systems and the digital intercepting systems\" to communicate with U.S. defense systems.\"\n\"They were developed together with congressional funding and support,\" he said, explaining that there were \"a lot of plug-and-play capabilities\" and, if needed, the U.S. systems can easily connect with the Israeli system.\nAccording to Israeli army estimates, Iran fired some 30 cruise missiles, 120 ballistic missiles and 170 suicide drones that carried about 60 tons of warheads and explosives combined. While most of the projectiles were shot down before reaching Israel's borders, two air force bases were lightly hit and a 7-year-old Israeli girl was seriously injured. Forces from the U.S., British and French militaries, as well as from several countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia and Jordan, participated in the operation.\n\"To coordinate such an attack is not an easy task because all three weapon systems have [different] velocities and performances,\" said Tal Inbar, a senior research fellow at Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance.\nHe said that the UAVs, mostly Iranian-produced Shahed 136s, would have been fired first because they move at the slowest pace; followed by the cruise missiles and finally the ballistic missiles, which have a relatively short flight time from Iran to Israel, depending on the launch site.\nInbar noted that Iran's decision to use drones gave Israel several hours to \"prepare itself to the maximum.\"\nIn addition to deploying advanced missile defense systems and scrambling fighter planes, he said Israel also put in place some levels of cyberprotection, including disrupting satellite navigation, which is effective in stopping some of the projectiles from reaching their targets.\n\"Ballistic missiles cannot be jammed because they use an internal navigation system, but this is not the case with drones,\" Inbar said, noting that Israelis have become used to GPS disturbances over the past six months.\nRecent media reports also suggest that Israel deployed its new $1 billion spy plane, the Oron, which provided vital information that was used to track and destroy the drones and missiles in flight. The high-tech jet, which Israel unveiled at last year's Paris Air Show, is equipped with thousands of advanced sensors. The Oron has the ability to scan vast terrain and gather an unprecedented amount of information at a considerable distance from the targets being tracked. When asked about the Oron spy plane, the IDF did not comment.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ruth Marks Eglash","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1713588868.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.692305,"_id":"2e5ee82a948248332e74de08e3141296"},{"title":"Senator Joni Ernst On Democrats Providing Iran With Billions Funding Drones And Ballistic Missiles Used To Attack Israel & American Troops In The Middle East","author":"Peter Caterina","published_date":"2024-04-15 17:20:11","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://radio.foxnews.com/2024/04/15/senator-joni-ernst-on-democrats-providing-iran-with-billions-funding-drones-and-ballistic-missiles-used-to-attack-israel-american-troops-in-the-middle-east","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) spoke to Brian Kilmeade about the Iranian attack on Israel.

The spending package also includes billions for Ukraine and Taiwan.\nJohnson, R-La., is facing immense political pressure to clear through his chamber a $95 billion supplemental package that would send support to the U.S. allies, as well as provide humanitarian aid for civilians in Ukraine and Gaza and funding to replenish U.S. weapons provided to Taiwan. However, the GOP maintains only a slim majority in the chamber and Republicans are divided on whether to continue supporting Kyiv, who is defending itself from Russia's invasion.\nIran's attack on Israel late Saturday further increased the pressure on Johnson, but it could have given him an outlet to underline the urgency in approving the aid. Johnson told Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures\" that Republicans \"understand the necessity of standing with Israel.\"\n\"The details of that package are being put together right now,\" Johnson said Sunday, adding that he would try to advance the aid bill this week. \"We're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues.\"\nThe White House and Senate members are urging Johnson to put a bill already approved by the Senate onto the House floor. The Republican leader could also start fresh with a new bill that has spending levels more favorable to certain members, in an effort to win over their support.\nThe speaker has expressed support for legislation that would structure some of the funding for Kyiv as loans, pave the way for the U.S. to tap frozen Russian central bank assets and include other policy changes. Johnson has pushed for the Biden administration to lift a pause on approvals for Liquefied Natural Gas exports and has demanded policy changes to secure the U.S.-Mexico border.\nIt is not immediately clear how Johnson would proceed.\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise said in a statement Saturday that the House would change its legislative schedule this week to \"consider legislation that supports our ally Israel and holds Iran and its terrorist proxies accountable,\" but did not provide additional details on which path Johnson may take.\nJohnson's legislative push this week comes after he traveled to Florida on Friday for an event with former President Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\nFollowing the meeting, Trump expressed support for Johnson and said he has a \"very good relationship\" with him.\n\"He and I are 100% united on these big agenda items,\" Johnson added. \"When you talk about aid to Ukraine, he's introduced the loan-lease concept, which is a really important one, and I think has a lot of consensus.\"\nJohnson's push for aid comes amid pressure from Biden's White House and the Democrat-controlled Senate.\nOn Sunday, Biden called congressional leaders and urged them to act quickly to send aid to both Israel and Ukraine.\nFollowing the call, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said there was \"consensus\" among the participants.\n\"The best way to help Israel rebuild its anti-missile and anti-drone capacity is by passing that supplemental immediately. As I said, Israel expended about over a billion dollars in defending itself and the security supplemental would replenish the kind of anti-missile and anti-drone defenses that are in the Arrow, in the David's Sling, and in the Iron Dome,\" Schumer said at a news conference in New York, ABC News reported.\nHe added: \"It's vital for the future of Ukraine, for Israel and the West.\"\nThe Senate previously passed a bill that includes roughly $60 billion for Ukraine and $14 billion for Israel.\nThe White House said on Sunday's call, Biden \"discussed the urgent need for the House of Representatives to pass the national security supplemental as soon as possible.\"\n\"We didn't need any reminders in terms of what's going on in Ukraine,\" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on NBC. \"But last night certainly underscores significantly the threat that Israel faces in a very, very tough neighborhood.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Lawrence Richard","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/AP24103768011281.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.6730604,"_id":"58a8418df6bb0ff10dcfa324b62da4c5"},{"title":"Rep.

But [Iran] did anyway. John Kirby is with us now,\" Hemmer, co-anchor of Fox News Channel's \"America's Newsroom,\" said while introducing the White House national security communications advisor onto the show.\n\"You got your hands full,\" Hemmer said.\n\"I was looking back at the track record for President Biden. Here's what sticks out: The Afghanistan withdrawal was a mess. We failed to stop Putin from going into Ukraine. The war with Israel and Hamas has been absolutely dreadful and destructive. Again, it's the first time Iran has aimed at Israel. China's military buildup is substantial. And that was just this morning what I came up with. Can you argue that American strength and persuasion is better today than it was four years ago globally?\" he continued.\nKirby responded, \"Oh yeah. Yeah, 100% I can do that very comfortably.\"\n\"Where?\" Hemmer followed-up.\n\"This is a president who understands American leadership on the world stage. He has devoted additional resources, not just militarily, but diplomatically, economically, around the world to advance our national security interests\u2026 I mean, American leadership was absolutely vital to helping Israel defend itself,\" Kirby responded.\nHemmer also asked Kirby about whether the administration plans to reconsider allowing Iran to access billions amid the sanctions waiver on the country.\n\"Iran has been a pain to your administration. It has been a pain to Israel when you consider its support for Hamas in light of Saturday's events where Iran hit Israel for the first time\u2026 Is it time to rethink allowing Iran access to billions of dollars in electricity sales between Iraq and Iran? Will that policy be stopped, sir?\" Hemmer asked.\nKirby responded by pointing to the Trump administration.\n\"That's an item that comes up for extension every few months, Bill, and the previous administration also extended it as have we because the Iraqi people are just so reliant right now on energy, resources from Iran,\" he said.\nThe interview followed Kirby pointing the finger at former President Trump for supposedly emboldening Iran on Fox News Channel Sunday.\n\"It's hard to take a look at what President Biden has done and say that we have somehow gone soft on Iran,\" Kirby said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"It was the previous administration that decided to get us out of the Iran deal. And now Iran is so much dramatically closer to a potential nuclear weapon capability than they were before Mr. Trump was elected.\"\nGOP senators have criticized what they see as Biden's continued weakness on deterrence after the Iranian regime ignored his request.\n\"So much for President Biden telling bad guys \u2018Don't' actually being an effective deterrent. Every time he says 'Don't,' they do,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., wrote in an X post on Saturday.\n\"Under President Trump, Iran was broke. President Biden gifted them billions of dollars and then naively said 'don't,'\" said Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. \"'Don't' is not a foreign policy.

The member countries are expected to call for sanctions on Iran and restraint from Israel.","summary":"Group of Seven foreign ministers are meeting on the Italian resort island of Capri, with calls for new sanctions against Iran over its attack against Israel and more aid to Ukraine to fight Russia's war topping the agenda.\nUnder Italy's rotating stewardship, the G7 leaders are expected to issue a united call for Israel to exercise restraint after Iran's unprecedented weekend attack involving hundreds of drones, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles fired toward the Jewish state.\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said he had spoken to his Israeli counterpart, Israel Katz, on Tuesday and urged Israel to not only de-escalate any reaction to Iran's attack but to stave off a planned offensive into the southern Gaza city of Rafah.\n\"I reiterated this message and I believe that on the occasion of the G7 foreign ministers in Capri, tomorrow and Friday morning, a similar message will be sent,\" Tajani told state-run RAI.\nWith Israel's war in Gaza in its sixth month, Tehran's attack added a new element of urgency to the three-day meeting of foreign ministers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called for new sanctions against Tehran and was making a last-minute visit to Israel before arriving on Capri later Wednesday.\n\"We will discuss how a further escalation with more and more violence can be prevented,\" she said. \"Because what matters now is to put a stop to Iran without encouraging further escalation.\"\nGermany, a staunch ally of Israel, has been among the chorus of European and U.S. leaders urging Israel to de-escalate tensions and not retaliate for Tehran's attack, which was largely repelled thanks to U.S. and allied help.\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Cameron said he would push for \"coordinated sanctions against Iran\" at the meeting. He argued that Tehran was orchestrating \"so much of the malign activity in this region\" from Hamas in Gaza, to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon to the Houthi rebels in Yemen who are behind attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.\n\"They need to be given a clear and unequivocal message by the G-7 and I hope that will happen,\" Cameron told broadcasters during a visit to Israel.\nRussia's two-year war in Ukraine is also high on the agenda, with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg invited to the Capri meeting on Thursday as guests. Kuleba is expected to repeat his country's need for essential military support, including artillery, ammunition, and air defense systems to bolster its capacity as Russia pushes along the front line.\nThe United States and several European countries are discussing proposals to use the profits generated from billions of euros of frozen Russian assets to help provide weapons and other funds for Ukraine, proposals that have gathered steam as U.S. efforts to get new funds for weapons have stalled in Congress.\nAt the European Union level, EU leaders are to discuss the proposal at a summit Wednesday in Brussels. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, meanwhile, is expected in Capri.\nThe 27-nation EU is holding around $217 billion in Russian central bank assets, most of it frozen in Belgium, in retaliation for Moscow's war against Ukraine. The bloc estimates that the interest on that money could provide around $3.3 billion each year.\nThe Biden administration is also looking into the possibility of tapping into Russian assets. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday she will meet separately with G7 finance ministers to discuss, among other things, Russian sovereign assets.\n\"We're looking at a series of possibilities ranging from actually seizing the assets to using them as collateral,\" she told reporters in Washington.\nShe said Ukraine needs more help and she fears that Russia is beginning to see signs that the U.S. and its allies are \"\"tiring and finding it more difficult to find ways to support Ukraine.\"\n\"That makes us focused on finding a way to unlock economic value and a stream of resources from the Russian sovereign assets\" that have been immobilized, she said.\nThe European Central Bank has warned in the past against seizing Russian assets themselves as this could undermine confidence in the euro currency and EU markets. But Borrell has said that under the EU plan, no assets would be taken, only the windfall profits they make.\nOn the Mideast front, tensions have ramped up since the start of the latest Israel-Hamas war on Oct. 7, when Hamas and Islamic Jihad, two militant groups backed by Iran, carried out a devastating cross-border attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 250 others. Israel responded with an offensive in Gaza that has caused widespread devastation and killed over 33,800 people, according to local health officials.\nWorld leaders have urged Israel not to retaliate after Iran launched a revenge mission that pushed the Middle East closer to a regionwide war. The attack happened less than two weeks after a suspected Israeli strike in Syria killed two Iranian generals in an Iranian consular building.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/EU-Italy-G7.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.65901,"_id":"924eb1f4c2710b2ee330c84b08b013c0"},{"title":"Putin shared surprising advice with Iranian counterpart following unprecedented attack on Israel","author":"Peter Aitken","published_date":"2024-04-16 16:50:41","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/putin-shared-surprising-advice-iranian-counterpart-following-unprecedented-attack-israel","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"President Biden reportedly warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that America will not support further, direct action taken against Iran, suggesting his counterpart \"take the win.\"","summary":"Russian President Vladimir Putin joined international calls for cool heads in the Middle East as tensions remain high following Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel over the weekend.\n\"Vladimir Putin expressed hope that all sides would show reasonable restraint and prevent a new round of confrontation fraught with catastrophic consequences for the entire region,\" the Kremlin said in a readout of a call with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, according to a translation by The Moscow Times.\n\"Ebrahim Raisi noted that Iran's actions were forced and limited in nature: At the same time, he stressed Tehran's disinterest in further escalation of tensions,\" the Kremlin added. \"Both sides stated that the root cause of the current events in the Middle East is the unresolved Palestinian-Israeli conflict.\"\n\"In this regard, the principled approaches of Russia and Iran in favor of an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, easing the difficult humanitarian situation, and creating conditions for a political and diplomatic settlement of the crisis were confirmed,\" the Kremlin concluded, adding that the call discussed \"in detail\" the airstrike on Iran's consulate in Damascus.\nOn Saturday night, Iran launched hundreds of drones and a mixture of cruise and ballistic missiles in retaliation for strikes against its diplomatic mission, or, as other reports claim, an adjoining Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) compound in Damascus.\nThe strike killed seven IRGC members, including Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, the senior commander of the forces since the assassination of Gen. Qasem Soleimani in 2020.\nIsrael never took credit for the strike, but other countries, including the United States, attributed the attack to the Jewish state.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly wanted to retaliate directly, but he changed his plans after President Biden told him to \"take the win\" and stressed the U.S. would not support any direct response to Iran's strike.

They cite possible 'threats' but the decision rings hollow.","summary":"Reasonable people can disagree about whether Asna Tabassum, who has expressed the view that the state of Israel should be destroyed, ought to be the University of Southern California's duly appointed commencement speaker.\nThere are prominent conservative voices such as Mary Katherine Ham, David Harsanyi, and Guy Benson, firm supporters of the Jewish state of Israel all, who say let her speak, in part because sunlight is the best disinfectant for ignorance or hate.\nI agree with them.\nBut there are others who say calling for Israel's demise is just as disqualifying as the unrepentant use of a racial slur, and I can certainly understand that perspective as well.\nBut what we should all agree on, what is utterly obvious and staring us in the face, is that USC's explanation as to why they canceled the valedictorian's speech is a sack of disingenuous dunnage. And worse, it all but scapegoats Jews.\nHere was the school's pathetic explanation, \"The intensity of feelings, fueled by both social media and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, has grown to include many voices outside of USC and has escalated to the point of creating substantial risks relating to security and disruption at commencement.\"\nIt is absolutely true that leftists have a long track record of causing mayhem when speakers on campus say things they don't like, it is also true that more recently anti Israel protesters have done the same.\nBut what we do not have is any record of pro-Israel entities or individuals acting in such violent or destructive manners. Put simply, the threat USC is describing does not exist.\nNo Muslim students have had to hide in a library as protestors accost them as happened to Jewish students at Cooper Union, no roving bands of pro Israel activists are shutting down bridges, burning flags or chanting \"death to America,\" or death to anything.\nIf the speaker were pro-Israel there might be a legitimate threat, but there is no threat here, which is exactly why USC won't specifically define it.\nSo what is the real reason for the cancellation? There are several plausible possibilities.\nMaybe the president of USC didn't want to be dragged before Congress for promoting antisemitism, maybe there were concerns that the speech could offend attendees, or even worse, large donors to the institution.\nBut If USC believes that Tabassum's statements and ideology are not disqualifying then they have a responsibility to protect her free speech, on the other hand, if they do, or if they fear harm to the reputation or bottom line of the school then they have a responsibility to say that too.\nIn other words, if you're canceling the speech because of hateful statements then say so, don't blame imaginary violent Jews.\nThis cop out from USC is especially cowardly and damning because Tabassum's virulent anti-Israel rhetoric, far from being rare or obscure, is mirrored by members of Congress.\nJust this week, 43 Democrats and Republican Thomas Masssie voted against condemning the phrase \"From the River to the Sea,\" which can only mean the destruction of Israel and its total replacement by a Muslim Palestinian State.\nSome of these members, such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Katie Porter were directly asked by Fox News if they condemned the chant \"Death to America,\" or the burning of American flags and they declined to answer.\nObviously, the left wishes to excuse and even normalize this kind of dangerous, anti-American rhetoric, and that is exactly what USC is doing with its lies about why Tasabbum won't be taking to a lectern.\nJust like AOC and Porter the university is refusing to comment when presented with the question of whether calling for the destruction of Israel is a disqualifying statement for a commencement speaker.\nThere is a long history of antisemitism being swept under the rug across the globe, it is an uncomfortable issue that people and institutions find ways to ignore.\nThat approach doesn't generally end well.\nWhether calling for the destruction of Israel is an antisemitic statement that should bar a person from an honor such as valedictorian is a reasonable argument, in fact, just the kind of debate that colleges and universities are meant to foster.\nInstead, USC has simply decided to punt on the question, leaving the completely false impression that Tabassum has been canceled by threats from conservatives or Zionists.\nFor my part, I say, let her give the speech, but what is more important is for the University of Southern California to explain exactly why that isn't happening.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David Marcus","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/USC-valedictorian.png","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.645274,"_id":"5ec87ac5d9e440ab88243748db148d89"},{"title":"Biden admin sanctions Israel national security minister ally, reportedly weighs expanding to IDF unit","author":"Greg Wehner","published_date":"2024-04-20 21:35:06","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/biden-admin-sanctions-israel-national-security-minister-ally-reportedly-weighs-expanding-to-idf-unit","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The Biden administration is likely to impose sanctions against an Israeli military battalion accused of violating human rights before Hamas invaded Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.","summary":"The Biden administration could announce sanctions against an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) battalion for alleged human rights violations in the West Bank before the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas-led terrorists, according to reports.\nAxios reported that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken could announce the sanctions against IDF battalion \"Netzah Yehuda\" within days, marking the first time the U.S. will have placed sanctions on military units operated by Israel.\nIf sanctions are imposed, the battalion and its members would no longer receive any type of training or assistance from the U.S. military, sources reportedly told the publication.\nThe U.S. is prohibited under the Leahy Law, from providing any sort of foreign aid or defense department training to countries responsible for alleged human rights violations based on credible information.\nFox News Digital reached out to the U.S. State Department and White House but did not immediately hear back.\nWhile speaking to reporters on Friday, Blinken was asked about Israel's violations of human rights in the West Bank and recommendations made by his department to cut military aid to certain Israeli units.\nBlinken started by saying the Leahy Law was important and applied across the board.\n\"When we're doing these investigations, these inquiries, it's something that takes time, that has to be done very carefully both in collecting the facts and analyzing them \u2013 and that's exactly what we've done,\" he said. \"And I think it's fair to say that you'll see results very soon. I've made determinations; you can expect to see them in the days ahead.\"\nOn Friday, the U.S. imposed sanctions on an ally of Israel's national security minister and two entities that raised money for Israeli men who allegedly committed settler violence. The new sanctions came in addition to others placed on five settlers and two unauthorized outposts earlier this year. The increased sanctions also show growing frustration of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by the U.S.\nFriday's sanctions will reportedly freeze U.S. assets held by those targeted while also barring Americans from dealing with them.\nRight-wing members of Netanyahu's governing coalition that is pushing to expand Jewish settlements along with the annexation of the West Bank are reportedly upset with the Biden administration for making moves against the Israeli settlers.\nAlso adding fuel to the fire is the tension between Israel and Washington caused by the latter urging Israel to restrain themselves from attacking Iran.\nOne of the individuals sanctioned by the U.S. was Ben-Zion Gopstein, the founder and leader of the right-wing group Lehava. The group does not support Jewish assimilation with non-Jews and has about 5,000 members.\n\"Under Gopstein's leadership, Lehava and its members have been involved in acts or threats of violence against Palestinians, often targeting sensitive or volatile areas,\" State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement obtained by Reuters.\nMiller warned that additional steps would be taken if Israel does not act to prevent extremist attacks as violence continues to escalate in the West Bank.\nThe European Union also agreed to impose sanctions against Lehava and other groups.\nBut the U.S. is not just targeting Israel. In fact, last week, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan announced sanctions would be placed against Iran after its regime attacked Israel last Saturday.\nThe sanctions were announced as Republicans criticized the Biden administration for not being tough enough on Iran, pointing to a waiver extended by the White House in November 2023 that released $10 billion of previously escrowed funds to Iran.\nSullivan said that the actions the U.S. is taking will \"continue a steady drumbeat of pressure to contain and degrade Iran's military capacity and effectiveness and confront the full range of its problematic behaviors.\"\n\"Over the last three years, in addition to missile and drone-related sanctions, the United States has sanctioned over 600 individuals and entities connected to terrorism, terrorist financing and other forms of illicit trade, horrific human rights abuses, and support for proxy terrorist groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Kataib Hezbollah,\" the statement added.\n\"The pressure will continue. We will not hesitate to continue to take action, in coordination with allies and partners around the world, and with Congress, to hold the Iranian government accountable for its malicious and destabilizing actions.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Greg Wehner","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/03/AP24078580386310.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.645274,"_id":"7c8c2d5fa7388c29a3036c4184bed2c8"},{"title":"Katie Pavlich on Disruptive Anti-Israel Protestors: 'Not Only Does It Make You a Bleep-Hole, But It Also\u2026 Makes You a Criminal'","author":"Dylan Rolfsen","published_date":"2024-04-17 22:00:10","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://radio.foxnews.com/2024/04/17/katie-pavlich-protestors","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Katie Pavlich, Editor for Townhall.com & Fox News Contributor, joined the Guy Benson Show today to discuss the latest on anti-Israel protests around the country.

So they are engaging in criminality, and they're using this cause as a way to, you know, forcefully push forward what they believe in in terms of not just being anti-Israel, but being pro terrorism, anti-American, the same cast of dark money characters who are constantly trying to tear down the fundamentals of law enforcement and what you can and cannot do in the system that we have.'","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Dylan Rolfsen","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/radio.foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/Katie-Pavlich-2.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":6.635448,"_id":"f9c5fb7da089b8c59d75bea8b209b030"},{"title":"Israeli artist, curators refuse to open exhibit until cease-fire, hostage deal is reached","author":"Bradford Betz","published_date":"2024-04-17 02:15:45","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/israeli-artist-curators-refuse-open-exhibit-until-cease-fire-hostage-deal-reached","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The artist and curators representing Israel at an international art show say they will not open the Israeli pavilion until a cease-fire and hostage deal are reached.","summary":"The artist representing Israel at this year's Venice Biennale in Italy, along with its curators, said Tuesday they will not open the Israeli pavilion until a cease-fire and hostage deal are reached in Israel's months-long war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\nA sign on the window of the Israeli pavilion posted Tuesday and written in English reads: \"The artist and curators of the Israeli pavilion will open the exhibition when a cease-fire and hostage release agreement is reached.\"\nIn a statement, artist Ruth Patir, said she and the curators wanted to show solidarity with the families of the hostages \"and the large community in Israel who is calling for change.\"\n\"As an artist and educator, I firmly object to cultural boycott, but I have a significant difficulty in presenting a project that speaks about the vulnerability of life in a time of unfathomed disregard for it,\" Patir said in the statement.\nIsrael is among 88 national participants in the 60th Venice Biennale, which runs from April 20-Nov. 24. The Israeli pavilion was built in 1952 as a permanent representation of Israel inside the Giardini, the original venue of the world's oldest contemporary art show and the site of 29 national pavilions. Other nations show in the nearby Arsenale or at venues throughout the city.\nBut even before the statement, curators and critics had signed an open letter calling on the Biennale to exclude the Israeli national pavilion from this year's show to protest Israel's war in Gaza. Those opposed to Israel's presence had also vowed to protest on-site.\nItaly's culture minister had firmly backed Israel's participation, and the fair was opening amid unusually heightened security.\nThe national pavilions at Venice are independent of the main show, and each nation decides its own show, which may or may not play into the curator's vision. Patir's Israeli exhibit was titled \"(M)otherland.\"\nThe curators of the Israeli pavilion, Mira Lapidot and Tamar Margalit, said they were delaying the opening of the exhibit because of the \"horrific war that is raging in Gaza,\" but that they hoped the conditions would change, so the exhibit could open for public view.\n\"There is no end in sight, only the promise of more pain, loss, and devastation. The exhibition is up and the pavilion is waiting to be opened,\" they said. For now, a video work made by Patir can be seen through the pavilion window.\nThe (M)otherland exhibit was set to run from Saturday, April 20, through Sunday, November 24.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Bradford Betz","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Israel-1.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.632625,"_id":"b0072ec5c679dc3aca45affb30986acd"},{"title":"Fox News \u2018Antisemitism Exposed' Newsletter: Chaos at Columbia and Ivy Leagues' moral corruption","author":"Fox News Staff","published_date":"2024-04-19 12:02:45","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/fox-news-antisemitism-exposed-newsletter-chaos-columbia-ivy-leagues-moral-corruption","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Fox News' \"Antisemitism Exposed\" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.","summary":"Fox News' \"Antisemitism Exposed\" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.\nIN TODAY'S NEWSLETTER:\n- NYPD arrests 108 people at Columbia University after anti-Israel protesters set up encampment on campus- Antisemitism watchdog hits Washington Post for defending Hamas supporters- Highway Patrol sends stark warning to anti-Israel agitators who shut down traffic for hours\nTOP STORY: Police removed anti-Israel protesters from Columbia University's campus after the demonstrating students had set up an encampment on a campus lawn, and announced the suspension of those students involved.

Gen. Pat Ryder said Monday that Iran's failed attack on Israel over the weekend was \"pretty telling\" about Tehran's weapons capabilities.\nA reporter had asked Ryder what lessons the U.S. learned from the attack and what they said about the capabilities of Iran and those of the U.S.\nRyder said the U.S. had \"learned a lot from this,\" but declined to go into specifics.\n\"I'm sure you can appreciate I'm not going to be in a position to do an after-action report from the podium today, other than to say it's pretty telling that Iran launched over 300 air threats, and, as I highlighted, 99% of those were knocked down,\" he said. \"So, it is demonstrative of that close coordination and synchronization between the United States and coalition partners when it comes to addressing air defense threats in the region.\"\nIran's attack on Israel late Saturday involved hundreds of drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles launched from Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. It included 110 medium range ballistic missiles, over 30 land attack cruise missiles, and more than 150 drones, per the Pentagon. Ryder said both land and sea aircraft were involved in the attack.\nOnly seven ballistic missiles reached Israeli territory, causing minor damage to an air base. Israeli and U.S. forces shot down the rest with help from the British and the French.\nThe attack was widely expected as Iran had been warning for days of retaliation after an airstrike on its Syrian consulate earlier this month killed a dozen people, including a top commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\nThe attack marked the first time Iran had launched a direct military assault on Israel, despite decades of hostilities, going back to the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution. Tensions between the two countries have been at all-time highs in recent months, following the Oct. 7 attack in which Hamas militants stormed into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking hundreds of hostages.\nRyder would not say whether Israel had informed Washington about potential plans for retaliation, though Israel's War Cabinet met Monday to discuss the situation.\nRyder said Iran had not given a heads-up about the attack, though Turkish, Jordanian, and Iraqi officials have disputed this.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Bradford Betz","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Iran.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.626431,"_id":"0c45beb6a5b86fa40f4ed3aed3d317cd"},{"title":"Iranian president makes no mention of Israeli strike despite threatening complete destruction","author":"Timothy Nerozzi","published_date":"2024-04-19 18:01:56","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/iranian-president-makes-no-mention-israeli-strike-despite-threatening-complete-destruction","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi ignored the Israeli missile strikes that hit his country during a speech on Friday, apparently walking back his previous threats of total war.","summary":"Iranian leadership is downplaying Israeli strikes against their country, despite previously vowing total war in the event of the \"tiniest invasion.\"\nDuring a Friday speech, President Ebrahim Raisi did not mention the Israeli missile strike launched against the Isfahan region of Iran earlier the same day.\nInstead, Raisi focused on justifying Iran's own offensive attacks.\n\"Operation True Promise led to authority, unity and cohesion in the country,\" Raisi said in his speech, according to translations from Iran International English. \"Today, all political groups and factions believe that this response was necessary and a big honor for the country.\"\nOperation True Promise is the codename for the Iranian drone missile and drone launch against Israel that took place on Saturday last week.\nIran launched hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel on Saturday in response to an apparent strike on Iran's embassy compound in Syria on April 1 that killed 12 people, including two Iranian generals.

John Fetterman, D-Penn., was \"not wrong\" to compare anti-Israel protests at Columbia to the White nationalists in Charlottesville.\nFetterman said in a post on social media that he fully agreed with a statement the White House released on the Columbia University demonstrations. During an appearance on \"CNN This Morning,\" Bash said Fetterman was not far off in his statement.\n\"Add some tiki torches and it's Charlottesville for these Jewish students,\" Fetterman wrote. He also called on Columbia's president to resign.\n\"I mean it's not that far off. He's not wrong. He's not wrong. Again, this has gone way beyond being pro- or anti-Israeli government, pro or anti the way that they're prosecuting the war,\" Bash said on CNN in response. \"History shows us that when there is a motivating issue that can allow antisemitism to snowball. It will happen, and it is happening. We\u2018re watching it real-time.\"\nAnti-Israel protesters occupied Columbia's south lawn on Wednesday when university President Minouche Shafik testified before Congress on antisemitism on college campuses, but they continued through the weekend.\nShafik said all classes would be virtual on Monday in an overnight statement. She also condemned \"antisemitic language\" protesters used and the \"intimidating and harassing behavior on our campus.\"\nBash condemned the \"raw hatred towards Jews\" earlier in the segment.\n\"Everybody has a right to disagree with the policies of a democratic government. And that is what is happening in Israel. People in Israel disagree with the policies of their elected government. That does not give people the right to be full-on vile and full of hate,\" Bash said. \"The sort of anti-Zionism, anti-Netanyahu government, that has left the building a long time ago when it comes to what you're actually seeing. And not all of the cases, but many of these cases, it is raw hatred towards Jews.\"\n\"CNN This Morning\" host Kasie Hunt said much of what people have seen at Columbia has crossed the line. She asked former White House communications director Kate Bedingfield about the White House's response.\nBedingfield encouraged President Biden and the White House to keep using the word \"antisemitism,\" but also said they needed to leave room for protest against the Israeli government. She also turned to Charlottesville and said it was a big reason why Biden wanted to run for president.\n\"He was incredibly horrified by what he saw,\" Bedingfield said. \"He really put it in a historical context that this is an incredibly frightening and dangerous thing that snowballs, and what we saw on display in Charlottesville in 2017 was a really pernicious and horrible thing, that can very quickly spiral out of control in society.\"\n\"So this issue of rising antisemitism and hate across the board as has been, I would argue, fanned by Donald Trump, is personally important to Joe Biden,\" she continued. \"And so I would expect to continue to see really direct language come out of the White House on this.\"\nProtests also broke out at Yale University last week. Police began removing anti-Israel protesters from an encampment on campus after a week of calling for the university to divest from military weapons manufacturers.\nAt least 16 protesters were arrested as police looked through tents set up in Beinecke Plaza, where more than 250 agitators gathered Sunday night, the Yale Daily News reported.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Hanna Panreck","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/FETTERMAN-BASH-SPLIT.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.5903225,"_id":"9164be3028049ce093141027a67b8c84"},{"title":"Trump's legal team offers peek at strategy as opening statements set to begin and more top headlines","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-22 10:44:30","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/trumps-legal-team-strategy-opening-statements-begin-top-headlines","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Opening statements in Trump's historic criminal trial are set to begin today.","summary":"COURT KICKOFF \u2013 Opening statements in Trump's historic criminal trial set to begin today.

Guzman announced on the provost's website that the biomedical engineering major would not be delivering her speech following threats to the school made after her speech was originally announced.\nThe university told The Los Angeles Times that threats had been made through letters, phone calls, and emails to USC because of its decision to have someone critical of Israel give the address.\nTabassum was accused of promoting \"antisemitic writings\" with her posts by the activist group We Are Tov, which also noted the valedictorian linked out to a page calling Zionism a \"racist settler-colonial ideology.\"\nThe Daily Mail also reported she allegedly liked Instagram posts from \"Trojans for Palestine\" and called for the \"complete abolition\" of Israel.\nHost Abby Phillip pressed her guest, noting that one of the links she posted \"called for the complete abolishment of Israel. Abolishment of Israel was in the actual language.\"\n\"Is that something that you endorse?\" Phillip asked.\nTabassum responded, \"The abolishment of the state of Israel, I\u2018d like to clarify, is the abolishment of an apartheid system. It inherently is a system that subjugates Palestinians as dehumanized.

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., attempted to argue that there have been no \"anti-Jewish protests\" on campus, only those that are either \"pro-war\" or \"anti-war.\" However, House GOP Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., challenged Shafik's earlier testimony, getting the university president to concede that, indeed, the campus demonstrations where protesters shouted chants including \"F the Jews,\" \"Death to Jews,\" \"F Israel,\" \"No place,\" \"Death to the Zionist state,\" and \"Jews out\" were indeed \"anti-Jewish.\"\nHouse Republicans also grilled Columbia leadership over tenured professor, Joseph Massad, who celebrated the Oct. 7 attacks and Hamas' slaughter of nearly 1,200 Jews as \"awesome,\" \"astonishing,\" \"astounding\" and \"incredible.\" Shafik later confirmed Massad is under investigation for the antisemitic remarks, though he maintains his employment at the school.\nHundreds of protesters swarmed Columbia University's South Lawn while Shafik testified Wednesday, demanding \"divestment\" from Israel, according to the student newspaper, the Columbia Spectator.\n\"The presence of tents on South Lawn is a safety concern and a violation of university policies,\" a university spokesperson wrote in a statement to the Spectator. \"We are informing the students they are in violation of university policies and for their own safety and for the operation of the university they need to leave.\"\nThe student paper reported that the anti-Israel protesters were given paper notices from the university informing them around 7 p.m. that they should \"immediately cease your participation in this encampment and leave the campus.\"\nThe university notice told protesters to \"disperse by 11:00 a.m.\" or \"they would face sanctions.\"\nThe congressional hearing also featured discussion over consequences for students carrying out antisemitic demonstrations. The school suspended several students over an unsanctioned event that featured a speaker with known ties to a terrorist group, but lawmakers noted at Wednesday's hearing that those same students came back to campus and protested again anyway.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Danielle

protests against the Israel-Hamas war could escalate as the election nears to put pressure on President Biden, a new report warns.","summary":"Anti-Israel protests could ramp up as activists adopt more \"extreme tactics\" to put increased pressure on President Biden as the election nears, a new report warns.\nOn Monday, anti-Israel agitators blocked traffic in San Francisco, Oakland, New York City, Philadelphia and several other locations as part of a campaign against the United States' continued support for Israel in its war with Hamas terrorists.\nThese disruptions could \"foreshadow a potentially volatile summer of protests, creating a challenge for President Biden and sparking debate over whether some activists' tactics threaten to undermine public support for their movement,\" The Washington Post reported Wednesday.\n\"If this continues for another six months, I would expect that the types of tactics deployed do escalate and we do see more extreme protests,\" Omar Wasow, an assistant professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley, told the Post. \"There will become a more militant faction that advocates for more extreme tactics.\"\nOne organizer who helped shut down a freeway in Oakland during Monday's protest said the coordinated disruptions were evidence that the movement was picking up steam.\n\"Today is proof that people are going to fight and keep escalating until there is a permanent cease-fire,\" Sha Wiya Falcon told The Post.\nWasow, who has studied protest movements for decades, argued that these disruptive methods could change policy even if they backfire with the public.\n\"When protesters use extreme tactics, they might lose the public, but nevertheless they get to signal to leaders who then want to manage the issue,\" Wasow said. \"So, in that way, more extreme tactics might hurt you at the ballot box \u2026 but they also could help you get policy responses from leaders.\"\nVincent Pons, another expert on protest movements and an associate professor at Harvard Business School, believes the anti-Israel protests will likely gain Biden's attention.\n\"Whether or not the protests continue will depend on whether they feel heard by the administration,\" Pons said in the report. \"The fact the protests will take place so close to a presidential election could imply that the administration will be more likely to pay attention.\"\nSince the Oct. 7 terror attacks in Israel, Biden has faced increased demands from younger progressive voters to withdraw support from Israel in its war with Hamas.\nThe president has met with Muslim American leaders over the past several months in attempts to relieve these tensions.\nWhite House officials previously traveled to Detroit earlier this year and faced an icy reception from Muslim American community leaders in the swing state, where more than 100,000 Democratic primary voters cast protest votes for \"uncommitted\" as part of an organized showing of disapproval for Biden's posture toward the conflict.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Kristine

White House was silent on Monday when asked for comment on calls for President Biden to send the National Guard to break up anti-Israel protests at Columbia University.","summary":"Despite multiple efforts on Monday to get an answer from the White House, officials remained silent on the issue of whether President Biden intends to deploy the U.S. National Guard to break up anti-Israel protests at Columbia University.\nFox News Digital asked the White House whether it would comment on the situation at Columbia University and if it required federal intervention, but didn't receive any response. The silence comes as hundreds of anti-Israel agitators have mounted disruptive protests at the university's campus in New York City, with some calling for violence against Jews and Jewish students.\n\"Eisenhower sent the 101st to Little Rock,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said in a social media post Monday. \"It's time for Biden to call out the National Guard at our universities to protect Jewish Americans.\"\n\"The nascent pogroms at Columbia have to stop TODAY, before our Jewish brethren sit for Passover Seder tonight,\" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., added. \"If Eric Adams won't send the NYPD and Kathy Hochul won't send the National Guard, Joe Biden has a duty to take charge and break up these mobs.\"\nLast week, anti-Israel agitators initiated protests, staging what they labeled a \"Gaza solidarity encampment\" on the Columbia University campus and shutting down a central lawn at the university. The protesters, who erected tents as part of the action, called for hostilities in the Middle East to end and for the university to divest of companies that have ties to Israel.\nOn Friday, police broke up the demonstration and arrested more than 100 students, charging them with trespassing.\nHowever, more protesters have arrived on the scene since those arrests and have clashed repeatedly with police officers. Some protesters have loudly chanted antisemitic slogans, pledged allegiance to Hamas and even endorsed violence against Jewish people.\nIn response to the conflict, Columbia University Rabbi Elie Buechler recommended Jewish students leave campus because of safety concerns, and Columbia University President Dr. Nemat Shafik said Monday that classes would be virtual to avoid further violence.\n\"I am deeply saddened by what is happening on our campus,\" Shafik wrote on Monday. \"Our bonds as a community have been severely tested in ways that will take a great deal of time and effort to reaffirm. Students across an array of communities have conveyed fears for their safety and we have announced additional actions we are taking to address security concerns.\"\n\"The decibel of our disagreements has only increased in recent days,\" she continued. \"These tensions have been exploited and amplified by individuals who are not affiliated with Columbia who have come to campus to pursue their own agendas.\"\nMeanwhile, President Biden issued a statement Sunday ahead of Passover, commemorating the Jewish holiday while also condemning rising antisemitic attitudes across the country.\nProtests, such as those staged at Columbia University, have raged in the U.S. in the aftermath of Hamas' attacks on innocent Israeli citizens on Oct. 7, which sparked Israel to bombard Palestinian territories in Gaza.\n\"The ancient story of persecution against Jews in the Haggadah also reminds us that we must speak out against the alarming surge of antisemitism \u2013 in our schools, communities, and online,\" Biden said.\n\"Silence is complicity. Even in recent days, we've seen harassment and calls for violence against Jews.

Anthony D'Esposito, R-N.Y., to formally criticize the use of the phrase \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\" passed in a 377 to 44 vote.\nAs has been the case with most issues surrounding Israel, the measure split the Democratic Party, with progressives bucking their more traditional colleagues in their criticism of the longstanding U.S. ally.\nProgressive \"Squad\" Democrats were among those to vote against it, including Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y.; Cori Bush, D-Mo., as well as House Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash.\nOne Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., voted against the measure as well. Fox News Digital reached out to his office for comment.\nThe bill is part of a list of 17 measures House Republican leaders are putting up for a vote this week aimed at affirming support for Israel and condemning Iran after the latter launched a barrage of airstrikes over the weekend.\nIt marked a dramatic escalation in Middle East tensions as the first time Tehran launched an attack on Israel from its own soil, though Israel said 99% of the rockets were intercepted.\nThe phrase \"From the river to the sea\" is a pro-Palestinian liberation phrase that has been used by Hamas and other anti-Israel actors as a call to arms against the Jewish nation.\nTlaib, the only Palestinian-American in Congress, was censured last November for her harsh rhetoric toward Israel, including her use of the phrase.\nShe got bipartisan blowback over invoking it in a social media video posted to X, but the progressive lawmaker was unrepentant.\n\"From the river to the sea is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate.

Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy warned on \"The Brian Kilmeade Show,\" Wednesday, that the Biden administration's \"weakness\" is creating a precarious world mirroring the run-up to World War II.\nKEVIN MCCARTHY: If you look at history, and remember, history only repeats itself if you ignore it. If we were sitting in the 30s, that would be the exact same thing you'd be reading about Germany, Italy and Japan as they started entering other countries. Think for one moment, when Iran made the decision to send missiles for the first time in history from Iran directly into Israel, the world has now changed. They believed they could. But would they have done it if they hadn't created a relationship with Russia and China? And what did China say? China didn't criticize. China is now getting an advantage of all this, because they are able to buy Russian and Iranian oil at a discount. And it all stems back to the leadership of Biden. Iran was only producing 4,000 barrels a day when he entered. They're now producing 300,000. That's billions of dollars a day. And China's comments coming out\u2026they didn't criticize October 7th. China's comments coming out too, after the missiles coming in, is Israel shouldn't fire back. And now the technology that they have been sharing, with the drones and others \u2026 they're being able to grow and get synergy between the two.WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL CONFRONTED ON INTERNATIONAL BLUNDERS UNDER BIDEN: \u2018GOT YOUR HANDS FULL'\nIf we think being isolationist keeps us safe. We have forgotten what happened on 9/11. If we think we take ourselves off the playing field, the world becomes safer, we have forgotten what happened when Neville Chamberlain went in for appeasement with Hitler. What we are doing right now, supplying weapons to Ukraine, not one American is dying. What's happening is Ukraine is defending their own nation from an attack. And if Putin falls, you know what happens? More freedom and safety. That means Taiwan is safer, longer. That means Iran thinks second thoughts. Go back to when President Trump took out the Iranian general [Soleimani]... I was with him that night at Mar-A-Lago having dinner.\nI was with him when we went up to the SCIF and identified what transpired and came back down. I know what world leaders called. Everybody else was scared. The world became safer. And you know what? Iran didn't send missiles into Israel that day or anything else because they knew the strength of America and the world was safer. When they see weakness after Afghanistan, we have pushed our allies closer to China, and we've watched the atrocities of October 7th. But those new axis of evils don't say anything negative to it, because any of them could do anything they want now.\nThe Biden administration has a long list of foreign policy blunders since the president came into office. However, the most recent incident was not only historic but also unnerving as the Middle East nears a wider conflict.\nIran launched hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel on Saturday in response to an apparent strike on Iran's embassy compound in Syria on April 1 that killed 12 people, including two Iranian generals. Iran blames Israel for the attack, although Israel has not claimed any involvement.\nIsrael, with help from the U.S., the United Kingdom, neighboring Jordan and other nations, successfully intercepted nearly every missile and drone that Iran launched. Israel boasted of a 99% success rate, through the use of its Iron Dome and David's Sling systems.\nIsrael and Iran have waged a shadow war for decades, with the war coming to a head over the past few months as Iran has supported Hamas, which carried out the deadliest terror attack in Israel's history on Oct. 7.\nSaturday's attack was the first direct Iranian military attack on Israel.\nFollowing the attack, President Ebrahim Raisi spoke Wednesday at an annual army parade warning Israel of a \"massive and harsh\" response, as the country braces for potential Israeli retaliation after Iran's missile and drone attack over the weekend.\nRaisi said Saturday's attack was a limited one, and that if Iran was provoked to carry out a bigger attack, \"nothing would remain from the Zionist regime,\" the official IRNA news agency reported.\nConflict in the Middle East is only one arena seeing heightened tensions. Since Biden took office, Russia has attacked Ukraine and started an ongoing war. The multi-faceted China has also evolved since 2020 with increased aggression and blooming relations with Russia and Iran.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Fox News Staff","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/McCarthyBidenSplit-1.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.549291,"_id":"92b41a98746643f8415de7cd4213c357"},{"title":"SEAN HANNITY: Biden is the 'biggest loser' amid Israeli strikes on Iran","author":"Fox News Staff","published_date":"2024-04-20 02:05:08","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/sean-hannity-biden-biggest-loser-amid-israeli-strikes-iran","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"\"Hannity\" host Sean Hannity argues the world \"simply has no respect for Joe Biden\" following Israel's strikes on Iran.","summary":"Fox News host Sean Hannity decries President Biden's \"don't\" policy regarding Israel and Iran on \"Hannity.\"\nSEAN HANNITY: Without a doubt, the biggest loser from last night to today was Joe Biden. Now, late last week, you might recall when the Islamic Republic of Iran was about to strike Israel, Biden politely told the mullahs in Iran: \"Don't.\" And then he shuffled off to the beach.\nThe very next day, Iran \u2014 they attacked Israel; 170 drone strikes, more than 30 cruise missiles, 120 ballistic missiles. Ninety-nine percent of them were stopped. They never landed at their target. Now, a few days later, when Israel was planning their response, Biden once again uttered his favorite phrase: \"Don't.\"\nThis time, he was telling Prime Minister Netanyahu, don't respond, give Iran a pass. Now Israel then disregarded Biden, thankfully, and they went ahead with last night's targeted attack and reportedly keeping Joe out of the loop \u2014 wisely so \u2014 until the last minute. Now the world simply has no respect for Joe Biden. That's why he is the biggest loser. Nobody listens to him, nobody cares what he has to say, nobody thinks he even knows what day of the week it is. And just to keep track, Biden's one-word foreign policy. I guess we can call it the Biden doctrine, the \"don't\" doctrine, is disregarded by our enemies, it is disregarded by our allies, and a few weeks ago, well the Houthi rebels, you might recall, they ignored Biden's \"don't\" and continued to attack cargo ships.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Fox News Staff","media":"https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/0fd45149-d357-4848-9ec2-e51bc1a47627/de20b14b-3142-4d10-97f7-cbc88f493c4e/1280x720/match/image.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.5483136,"_id":"732b5506627ce7e69bf07b56bdd84825"},{"title":"Israeli leaders condemn expected US sanctions, Netanyahu vows to fight it with all his might","author":"Greg Wehner","published_date":"2024-04-21 21:14:05","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/israeli-leaders-condemn-expected-us-sanctions-netanyahu-vows-fight-might","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other leaders criticized the U.S. for expected sanctions against an IDF battalion accused of human rights violations in 2022.","summary":"Leaders in Israel criticized potential sanctions that are expected to be imposed by the U.S. as early as this week against an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) military battalion accused of violating human rights back in 2022.\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken could announce sanctions against IDF battalion \"Netzah Yehuda\" within days, marking the first time the U.S. will have placed sanctions on military units operated by Israel. If Blinken follows through with the sanctions, it could further strain relationships between the allies, which have already become tense as Israel continues its war in Gaza.\nU.S. officials have not identified the sanctioned unit, though Israeli leaders and local media identified it as Netzah Yehuda, a battalion established nearly 25 years ago.\nIsraeli officials have condemned the expected sanctions, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said he would oppose them.\n\"If anyone thinks they can impose sanctions on a unit in the IDF, I will fight it with all my might,\" Netanyahu said.\nSome of the battalion's members have been linked to abuse of Palestinians. The group faced harsh criticism from the U.S. in 2022 after a 78-year-old Palestinian-American man, Omar Assad, was found dead after being detained at a West Bank checkpoint.\nAn autopsy conducted by Palestinian officials found Assad suffered a heart attack caused by \"external violence,\" adding he had underlying health conditions.\nThe autopsy also noted that Assad had bruises on his head, redness on his wrists caused by being bound, and bleeding in his eyelids after being tightly blindfolded.\nThe country's military also investigated and found Israeli soldiers assumed Assad was sleeping when they cut off the cables binding his hands. When the soldiers saw Assad was unresponsive, they failed to offer medical help and left the scene.\nThe Israeli military said at the time that one officer was reprimanded, and two others were reassigned to non-commanding roles because of the incident.\nThe uproar from the U.S. resulted in Israel relocating Netzah Yehuda to northern Israel in 2022, after it had been stationed in the West Bank. After the attack on Israel on Oct. 7 by Hamas-led terrorists, the battalion was relocated again to the southern border near Gaza. The battalion is now reportedly helping with the war effort in the Gaza Strip, according to the Israeli military.\n\"The battalion is professionally and bravely conducting operations in accordance to the IDF Code of Ethics and with full commitment to international law,\" it said. It said that if the unit is sanctioned, \"its consequences will be reviewed.\"\nAxios reported that if sanctions were imposed, the battalion and its members would no longer receive any type of training or assistance from the U.S. military, according to sources.\nThe U.S. is prohibited under the Leahy Law, from providing any sort of foreign aid or defense department training to countries responsible for alleged human rights violations based on credible information.\nWhile speaking to reporters on Friday, Blinken was asked about Israel's violations of human rights in the West Bank and recommendations made by his department to cut military aid to certain Israeli units.\nBlinken started by saying the Leahy Law was important and applied across the board.\n\"When we're doing these investigations, these inquiries, it's something that takes time, that has to be done very carefully both in collecting the facts and analyzing them \u2013 and that's exactly what we've done,\" he said. \"And I think it's fair to say that you'll see results very soon. I've made determinations; you can expect to see them in the days ahead.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to the State Department for comment.\nThe Associated Press reported that Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's War Cabinet, issued a statement saying he spoke with Blinken on Sunday and told him the decision is a \"mistake.\" Gantz added that sanctions would hurt the country's legitimacy during a time of war.\nThe wire service also learned from two U.S. officials familiar with the sanctions that the announcement could come as early as Monday.\nThe officials reportedly said five units were investigated, and of the five, four acted to remedy violations they were accused of committing.\nOn Friday, the U.S. imposed sanctions on an ally of Israel's national security minister and two entities that raised money for Israeli men who allegedly committed settler violence. The new sanctions came in addition to others placed on five settlers and two unauthorized outposts earlier this year.\nFriday's sanctions will reportedly freeze U.S. assets held by those targeted, while also barring American forces from dealing with them.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Greg Wehner","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/benjamin-netanyahu.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.545499,"_id":"f6a5e43c1eb5a79dbde11f15ecea8fe3"},{"title":"Multiple Yale anti-Israel protesters arrested as police close in on occupation: report","author":"Stephen Sorace","published_date":"2024-04-22 11:56:27","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/yale-anti-israel-protesters-arrested-police-close-in-occupation","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Police began removing anti-Israel protesters who set up tents on Yale University's campus as part of a weeklong demonstration, according to reports.","summary":"Police began removing anti-Israel protesters from an encampment on Yale's campus early Monday after a week of protests calling for the university to divest from military weapon manufacturers.\nAt least 16 protesters were arrested as police looked through tents set up in the encampment at Beinecke Plaza, where more than 250 agitators gathered Sunday night, the Yale Daily News reported.\nProtest organizers told the paper that at least some of those arrested are students.\nA member of the Yale Police Department told the Yale Daily News that the arrested protesters would be written up and released.\nThis is a breaking news story; check back for updates.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Stephen Sorace","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Yale-Anti-Israel-Protests-Photo-1.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.535313,"_id":"2a7bf1527c37664c669cf27af386086f"}],"user_input":{"q":"Israel","search_in":["title_summary_en"],"lang":["en"],"not_lang":null,"countries":null,"not_countries":null,"from":"2024-04-15 00:00:00","to":null,"ranked_only":"True","from_rank":null,"to_rank":null,"sort_by":"relevancy","page":1,"size":100,"sources":["foxnews.com"],"not_sources":[],"topic":null,"published_date_precision":null}}
